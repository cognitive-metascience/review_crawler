This is particularly important for digenetic trematodes because obligatory hosts must overlap in space and time and in sufficient numbers for transmission to be successful (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dobson, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Begon, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">LoGiudice et al., 2008</xref>). In addition, the environment may harbor a diversity of host species, some of which might serve as alternative competent hosts thus potentially favoring parasite persistence, or conversely, such species may act as non-productive sinks for the parasite thereby diminishing its transmission. As shown by an increasing number of studies, the net effect of biotically complex environments on transmission success for a particular parasite may be hard to predict, particularly for parasites that use multiple hosts to complete their life cycles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lafferty et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Suzán et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lafferty, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Johnson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Salkeld et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rohr et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Frainer et al., 2018</xref>). Furthermore, the impact may be highly contextual, depending on the density of host species, leading to dilution or amplification of transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Luis et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Another factor influencing the success of a particular parasite is the diversity of other infectious agents present that colonize the same host species, thereby setting up the potential for within-host interactions. Such interactions can range from mutual dependence or facilitation to overt competition and even predation of one parasite by another (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lim and Heyneman, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Combes, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lafferty et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hechinger et al., 2011</xref>). The purpose of this study is to combine field observations, experimental infections and use of a mathematical model parameterized by our empirical data to understand how transmission of the widespread human-infecting trematode <italic>Schistosoma mansoni</italic> is influenced by other trematode species present in the aquatic habitats in and around Lake Victoria. We are particularly interested in those trematode species that share with <italic>S. mansoni</italic> a dependence on <italic>Biomphalaria</italic> snails for their larval development. These additional <italic>Biomphalaria</italic>-dependent trematodes also infect a variety of wild or domestic host species to complete their respective life cycles. Therefore, strong interactions occurring among trematode species in the snail host could have cascading effects on the level of parasitism occurring in many host species, including humans and domestic animals.</p><p><italic>S. mansoni</italic> is the most geographically widespread causative agent of intestinal schistosomiasis, and the Lake Victoria Basin is one of the largest hyperendemic areas of schistosomiasis in the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gouvras et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wiegand et al., 2017</xref>). Despite repeated treatments with the anthelmintic praziquantel, children living in villages near the lakeshore often exhibit prevalence of <italic>S. mansoni</italic> infection of &gt;50%, and up to 90% in some areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Woodhall et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>A textbook-like portrayal of the <italic>S. mansoni</italic> life cycle highlighting the role of humans and a generic ‘<italic>Biomphalaria</italic>’ in transmission belies a more complex reality in the Lake Victoria Basin in that multiple options exist for transmission. With respect to mammalian definitive hosts, humans are certainly the most important in maintaining transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Colley et al., 2014</xref>), but baboons and common rodents like <italic>Mastomys natalensis</italic> can also play a role and may assume greater significance in ongoing chemotherapy-based control programs targeting human transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hanelt et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Catalano et al., 2018</xref>). Likewise, <italic>S. mansoni</italic> in and around the lake also infects three <italic>Biomphalaria</italic> taxa that exist in different habitats. <italic>Schistosoma mansoni</italic> eggs are passed into aquatic habitats in human feces. A miracidium hatches from an egg and if successful in finding and penetrating a <italic>Biomphalaria</italic> snail, then initiates a long-term, proliferative period of asexual development. This development culminates in the production of human-infective cercariae which are released or ‘shed’ into the surrounding water. These obligatory vector hosts include <italic>B. pfeifferi</italic> in streams and small impoundments, <italic>B. sudanica</italic> along the lakeshore, and <italic>B. choanomphala</italic>, now generally considered to be a distinct ecophenotype of <italic>B. sudanica</italic>, found especially but not exclusively in deeper water (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Magendantz, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Standley et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>). All three species have been found naturally infected with <italic>S. mansoni</italic>, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Magendantz, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Standley et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mutuku et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mutuku et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>In addition to exploiting multiple definitive and intermediate host species, <italic>S. mansoni</italic> is, like many infectious agents, influenced in a myriad of ways by the diverse species with which it co-occurs. For instance, several other non-host species of freshwater snails co-occur with <italic>Biomphalaria</italic> and may act as sinks for <italic>S. mansoni</italic> as its miracidia will not develop in these snail species. Likewise, there are other species of digenetic trematode species in Kenya with an obligatory dependence on <italic>Biomphalaria</italic> snails for their larval development and their larval stages may strongly interact with <italic>S. mansoni</italic> larvae for access to the resources offered by these snail hosts. It is well-known from other studies that complex interactions usually dominated by antagonism via predation (and by indirect antagonism) can occur amongst the larvae of trematode species sharing a particular individual snail, and these interactions often have predictable outcomes that can influence patterns of abundance among trematode species in particular communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fernandez and Esch, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lafferty et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Soldánová et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mordecai et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Relevant to considerations of intra-snail interactions is that not all larval trematodes have the same pattern of development within their host snail. Some like <italic>S. mansoni</italic> develop sac-like sporocysts, whereas others produce rediae possessing a mouth surrounded by a powerful sucker, and a gut (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Schell, 1985</xref>). Rediae can move within the snail and may ingest host tissue, including gonadal tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lim and Lie, 1969</xref>). For example, the rediae of echinostomes (Echinostomatoidea) in particular tend to be dominant in intramolluscan interactions, with some echinostome species able to produce small, motile rediae specialized for attacking and killing larvae of other trematodes species, including <italic>S. mansoni</italic> sporocysts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lim and Heyneman, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Moravec et al., 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hechinger et al., 2011</xref>). Amphistome trematodes (Paramphistomoidea) also produce rediae, and these tend to have more complex antagonistic or facilitation interactions with other trematodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Southgate et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Spatz et al., 2012</xref>). Sporocyst-producing species including strigeids and schistosomes have also been shown to have more subtle indirect antagonistic effects on larvae of other trematodes mediated by as yet uncharacterized soluble factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Basch et al., 1969</xref>). Given the complex nature of the guilds of trematodes, we found to be associated with <italic>Biomphalaria</italic> snails in Kenya, we hypothesized that some of these non-schistosome trematode species could negatively impact the development and transmission of <italic>S. mansoni</italic> in <italic>Biomphalaria</italic>.</p><p>To better understand these interactions, we initiated a survey at two stream sites and one lake site in western Kenya to define the trematode diversity from <italic>Biomphalaria</italic>. Morphological features and molecular markers were used to aid explicit definition of trematode species diversity. We also used sequential observations and experimental infections to reveal the dominance hierarchy among the trematodes that use <italic>B. pfeifferi,</italic> the most widely distributed <italic>S. mansoni</italic> vector in Africa. The same approaches also enabled us to observe striking antagonistic interactions perpetrated on <italic>S. mansoni</italic> by the most common trematode recovered from our habitats, the cattle-transmitted amphistome <italic>Calicophoron sukari.</italic> We then integrated our field survey results and experimental studies into a mathematical model to quantify the influence of <italic>C. sukari</italic> on <italic>S. mansoni</italic> transmission. These studies collectively highlight the importance of animal husbandry practices and of a diverse community of wild animals and the trematodes they support, particularly those dependent on <italic>Biomphalaria</italic>, on downstream transmission of <italic>S. mansoni</italic> infection to people in west Kenya.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Field surveys</title><p>Upon screening <italic>Biomphalaria</italic> from both stream and lake habitats, several trematode species were found, verified as distinct taxa using morphological features and molecular markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). A total of 19 species were found among 19,914 <italic>B. pfeifferi</italic> (overall prevalence 12.3%) from the perennial Asao Stream, 7 species from 1,136 <italic>B. pfeifferi</italic> (15.5%) from the highly seasonal Kasabong stream, and from Lake Victoria, 21 species of cercariae from 3,369 <italic>B. sudanica</italic> (10.3%), (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). Some species, like <italic>S. mansoni</italic>, were recovered from all habitats, but many were habitat specific, such that in aggregate, 29 taxa were recovered. The life cycles of most of these trematodes have yet to be clarified, but by inferring probable life cycles from relatives with known life cycles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yamaguti, 1958</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Schell, 1985</xref>), a broad variety of invertebrate and wild and domestic vertebrate species are involved as hosts in supporting these life cycles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). A portion of the field-collected <italic>Biomphalaria</italic> were also exposed to <italic>S. mansoni</italic> to assess compatibility and we found that all three taxa of <italic>Biomphalaria</italic> were susceptible to <italic>S. mansoni,</italic> but found that <italic>B. pfeifferi</italic> was the most compatible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). At Asao and Kasabong, the most common trematode recovered from <italic>B. pfeifferi</italic> was the cattle-transmitted amphistome <italic>Calicophoron sukari</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Laidemitt et al., 2017</xref>) (1,035/2439 total infections, or 42.4% of all infections at Asao, and at Kasabong 97/176, or 55.1% of all infections) followed closely by <italic>S. mansoni</italic> (1014 of 2439 total infections at Asao or 41.6% of all infections and at Kasabong, 68/176 or 38.6% of all infections) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>). Both species were also commonly recovered from <italic>B. pfeifferi</italic>, but <italic>C. sukari</italic> was not recovered from <italic>B. sudanica</italic> or <italic>B. choanomphala</italic>. Also noteworthy is the overall prevalence of <italic>S. mansoni</italic> infections at stream sites (5.09% and 5.89%) was much higher than from the lakeshore (0.22%).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Trematode biodiversity in the <italic>S. mansoni</italic> hyperendemic area of western Kenya.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The different types of trematode cercariae recovered either uniquely from <italic>B. pfeifferi</italic> from streams or from <italic>B. sudanica</italic> from the lakeshore, or that were recovered from both snail species (in red), confirmed with mitochondrial barcodes.

Some field snails found to be naturally shedding <italic>S. mansoni</italic> cercariae would, upon further observation in the lab, permanently switch over to producing <italic>C. sukari</italic> cercariae instead. Similarly, exposure of field-collected snails shedding <italic>C. sukari</italic> cercariae to <italic>S. mansoni</italic> miracidia rarely resulted in conversion of the infections to production of <italic>S. mansoni</italic> cercariae.

In particular, our modeling framework tracks the outcomes for each parasite in the case of both simultaneous and sequential infections of <italic>B. pfeifferi</italic> with <italic>C. sukari</italic> and <italic>S. mansoni</italic>, based on survival rates from our empirical data. Furthermore, the model includes two snail size classes to account for size-dependent variation in snail survival and fecundity and cercariae output, which we have previously shown is important for accurately assessing the risk of infection to humans (Anderson et al., submitted). By varying the input of either <italic>S. mansoni</italic> or <italic>C. sukari</italic> miracidia to the model, we can examine how the relative abundance of <italic>S. mansoni</italic> to <italic>C. sukari</italic> larvae in the environment impacts the production of new parasites within the snail portion of the transmission cycle.

Surprisingly, even though much of the previous work focusing on interspecific trematode antagonism has been undertaken in the context of exploiting it as a potential control strategy for schistosomiasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Combes, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Moravec et al., 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pointier and Jourdane, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Toledo and Fried, 2011</xref>) ours is the first study undertaken in which all the species involved are extant in sub-Saharan Africa, where schistosomiasis assumes its greatest public health significance.</p><p>With respect to this hierarchy, the dominant trematodes are not the species we most commonly recovered from snails, for at least two reasons. One is that co-infections by no means inevitably occur within snails so that a species with a subordinate position is not always required to compete. This is of relevance for a species like <italic>S. mansoni</italic> occupying an intermediate hierarchical position in that it is not inevitably confronted in snails by predatory or inhibitory rediae of other species. Secondly, input of eggs from competitively dominant species like echinostomes often originates from birds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Laidemitt et al., 2019</xref>) and is likely dwarfed by the input of eggs from large definitive hosts like people, goats or cattle. This helps explain how the prevalence achieved by <italic>S. mansoni</italic> or by <italic>C. sukari</italic> is much higher than achieved by echinostomes despite the latter’s competitive dominance in snails.</p><p>From the point of view of <italic>S. mansoni</italic>, colonizing a snail harboring a preexisting trematode infection, including even those snails infected with subordinate trematodes, is bound to interfere with its transmission to some extent. Successful infection will either be preempted by presence of a dominant species, or if take-over of a subordinate species occurs, the process likely takes weeks. In the interim, production of <italic>S. mansoni</italic> cercariae will be delayed or reduced, and the infected snail could well expire before the take-over is complete.</p><p>Of the many trematodes coexisting with <italic>S. mansoni</italic>, <italic>C. sukari</italic> is most noteworthy for it is both abundant and dominant. Furthermore, the unusual facilitating effect provided to <italic>C. sukari</italic> by <italic>S. mansoni</italic> that we observed carries some provocative consequences. For example, from our experimental exposures of field-derived snails we found that <italic>B. pfeifferi</italic> were already colonized by <italic>C. sukari</italic> larvae, but the larvae were unable to complete development without a follow-up exposure to <italic>S. mansoni</italic>. This implies that most of the <italic>C. sukari</italic> infections we observed in streams represent snails that had been penetrated by <italic>S. mansoni</italic> miracidia and in which some degree of schistosome sporocyst development took place: the sporocysts were either stymied early in their development by the pre-existing presence of <italic>C. sukari</italic> larvae, or were able to develop to the point of cercariae production only to be taken over by a subsequent <italic>C. sukari</italic> infection. It is possible that other trematode species like strigeids or xiphidiocercariae may also facilitate <italic>C. sukari</italic> infections though they are much less abundant in our stream habitats than <italic>S. mansoni.</italic></p><p>By using our empirical work to parameterize a novel mathematical model that explicitly accounts for interaction between parasites within snail hosts, we were able to quantify the role of antagonistic trematodes in field snails on the force of schistosomiasis transmission in an endemic setting. Specifically, our mathematical model predicted that <italic>C. sukari</italic> could dampen the force of transmission of <italic>S. mansoni</italic> by as much as 65 percent. The presence of <italic>C. sukari</italic>-infected cattle thereby provides a significant protective effect for humans. Furthermore, the amphistome would not persist or would persist at much lower levels without the facilitation provided by <italic>S. mansoni</italic>. Consequently, in current mass drug administration (MDA) campaigns in Kenya, treating humans with praziquantel (with presumed downstream effects on limiting <italic>S. mansoni</italic> infections in snails) would then also decrease the number of successful <italic>C. sukari</italic> infections in snails and in turn the number of cattle infected with <italic>C. sukari</italic>. Conversely, if cattle were targeted in MDA campaigns to control <italic>Fasciola gigantica</italic> and other flukes like <italic>C. sukari,</italic> we would expect assuming no concomitant <italic>S. mansoni</italic> control, to observe an increase in the number of <italic>S. mansoni</italic> infections in snails. In particular, our model predicts at least a 40% increase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>). The peculiar dependencies between <italic>C. sukari</italic> and <italic>S. mansoni</italic> provide an important example of how intramolluscan encounters could have significant downstream effects on the prevalence of infection of either parasite in their respective definitive hosts.</p><p>The interactions we have noted between <italic>S. mansoni</italic> and <italic>C. sukari</italic> favor the latter species, but in other contexts, including in Kenya, the presence of another amphistome species <italic>Calicophoron microbothrium</italic> in the snail <italic>Bulinus tropicus</italic> facilitates infections with the cattle schistosome <italic>Schistosoma bovis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Southgate et al., 1989</xref>). Schistosomes and amphistomes, possibly because their respective positions in the dominance hierarchy lie close together (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), clearly engage in distinctive interactions that seem to favor the colonization of a snail species that might otherwise not easily be infected.</p><p>Recent transcriptional studies have indicated that <italic>S. mansoni</italic> sporocysts promote down-regulation of many <italic>B. pfeifferi</italic> immune factors, and that <italic>C. sukari</italic> transcriptomic activity may be limited without <italic>S. mansoni</italic> present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Buddenborg et al., 2017</xref>). This is suggestive that immune interference provided by <italic>S. mansoni</italic> enables larval development of <italic>C. sukari</italic> to proceed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lim and Heyneman, 1972</xref>). This idea is supported by finding, following experimental infections of <italic>B. pfeifferi</italic> by <italic>C. sukari</italic>, intact but undeveloped mother sporocysts of <italic>C. sukari</italic> loosely surrounded by snail hemocytes, as if parasite and host were at an impasse. Furthermore, several studies in the related snail, <italic>Biomphalaria glabrata</italic> indicate <italic>S. mansoni</italic> and <italic>Echinostoma paraensei</italic> can interfere with snail defenses, thereby allowing development of particular trematode strains and species that would otherwise be doomed to fail in <italic>B. glabrata</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lie, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lie et al., 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hanington et al., 2012</xref>). We also note that immune-suppression mediated by one trematode species may be a means whereby another trematode species is able to invade and colonize an otherwise incompatible snail host, thereby helping to account for high rates of snail host-switching that are a prominent feature of trematode-snail interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brant and Loker, 2013</xref>) and <italic>C. sukari</italic> may exemplify this process.</p><p>Also, of interest is the mechanism whereby subsequent development of <italic>S. mansoni</italic> sporocysts is suppressed in the presence of <italic>C. sukari</italic> larvae. Is it mediated directly by predatory or secretory activities of <italic>C. sukari</italic> larvae, or indirectly via snail host responses? Our histological and in vitro encounter studies do not reveal direct evidence of predatory activity by <italic>C. sukari</italic> rediae. It also seems unlikely that if <italic>S. mansoni</italic> initially provided immune-mediated protection for <italic>C. sukari</italic> that later in the co-infection the tables would be turned such that <italic>S. mansoni</italic> rather than <italic>C. sukari</italic> would be selectively attacked by host immune responses. One possibility to pursue is that secretory/excretory products produced by <italic>C. sukari</italic> larvae interfere with development of <italic>S. mansoni</italic> sporocysts, possibly including damaging them such that they are prone to attack by hemocytes of <italic>B. pfeifferi</italic>. Identification of factors inimical to <italic>S. mansoni</italic> larval development would be of potential interest as a novel means of schistosomiasis control. We further note that in an area of hyperendemic transmission of <italic>S. mansoni</italic> in and around Lake Victoria, this predominantly human parasite is nonetheless favored by its ability to infect diverse definitive hosts and at least three taxa of ecologically distinct <italic>Biomphalaria</italic> intermediate hosts. However, <italic>S. mansoni</italic> transmission is modulated by a number of biological realities that relate both to historical patterns in animal husbandry favoring transmission of trematodes of domestic ruminants and to the presence of several wild vertebrate species that support a remarkably diverse trematode fauna. Many of these trematodes, at least 29 species in addition to <italic>S. mansoni</italic>, also depend on <italic>Biomphalaria</italic> snails for their larval development. Our results indicate that <italic>S. mansoni</italic> is in no way favored by their presence but must interact with them if found in the same snail host and can even be directly exploited by them by providing a needed facilitation effect, one that favors the continued presence and abundance of a potent competitor, the most common trematode in the system, the cattle-transmitted <italic>C. sukari</italic>.</p><p>In conclusion, the peculiar interactions we found between <italic>S. mansoni</italic> and <italic>C. sukari</italic> highlight the important role of human-modified history in dictating patterns of infectious disease. The long-term use of the same snail-containing aquatic habitats by human pastoralists and their livestock has led to a situation where the parasites of cattle have seemingly been selected to exploit the predictable and widespread presence of the human parasite <italic>S. mansoni</italic> in snails. Here we show another example of how pastoralism has shaped the nature of the parasites and diseases experienced by both humans and ruminants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Greter et al., 2017</xref>). In addition, the interspecific interactions occurring between trematodes within their vector snails can in turn have cascading effects in influencing prevalence of parasites in their definitive hosts, including humans.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Field surveys and parasite assessment</title><p>To measure transmission patterns of trematode parasites in their snail hosts, we sampled six sites along a 300 m stretch of Asao Stream (−0.31810, 35.00690) in western Kenya every other month from January 2014-January 2018. We also sampled six sites along a 300 m stretch at Kasabong Stream (−0.15190, 34.33550) and two sites along the shoreline at Lake Victoria (−0.09410, 34.70760) from Jan 2015-Jan 2018. At the stream and shoreline sites, two people sampled for 15 min using a long-handled triangular mesh scoop, scooping the sides of rocks, plants, and the bottom of the substrate to collect snails. Water velocity and pH (Hanna Instruments pH/Conductivity/TDS High-Range Tester) measurements were also recorded. Air temperature and rainfall data were collected from the Kisumu, Kenya airport weather station. Snails were then transported back to the lab and following cleaning and sorting were individually placed into 12-well tissue culture plates with 3 ml of aged tap water. The plates were then placed in natural light for 2 hr to induce the release of cercariae (‘shedding’).

Eggs from both sources were concentrated using nested sieves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mutuku et al., 2014</xref>). After the cattle dung was sieved, half of the retained egg-rich material was placed into the refrigerator as a source of <italic>C. sukari</italic> eggs for later parts of the same experiment, and the other half was placed in plastic containers and aerated in the dark for 14–16 days to allow the eggs to fully embryonate. Eggs were considered fully embryonated when moving miracidia were observed within the eggs.</p><p>To establish F1 <italic>B. pfeifferi</italic> for the experiment, at least 200 uninfected (screened by shedding) parental snails were collected from Asao stream or Kasabong stream and divided among five 180 L tanks for breeding. Snails were fed red leaf lettuce and shrimp pellets three times per week until eggs were laid.</p><p>Fifty (2014 experimental exposures) or sixty (2017 experimental exposures) 2–4 mm laboratory-reared F1 <italic>B. pfeifferi</italic> (parents from Kasabong stream in 2014 and parents from Asao stream in 2017) were assigned to each of the following six treatment groups: 1) sham controls (no parasite exposure, but individually placed into 12 well plates); 2) snails individually exposed to 5 <italic>S. mansoni</italic> miracidia; 3) snails individually exposed to 5 <italic>C. sukari</italic> miracidia; 4) snails individually exposed to 5 <italic>S. mansoni</italic> miracidia and two weeks later to 5 <italic>C. sukari</italic> miracidia; 5) snails individually exposed to 5 miracida of <italic>C. sukari</italic> then two weeks later to five miracidia each of <italic>S. mansoni</italic>; and 6) snails simultaneously exposed to 5 <italic>C. sukari</italic> and 5 <italic>S. mansoni</italic> miracidia. F1 snails were randomly chosen from the five 180 L tanks and placed individually into 12-well cell culture plates with 3 ml of aged tap water for the exposures. Miracidia were hatched by placing a flask or plastic container with <italic>S. mansoni</italic> or <italic>C. sukari</italic> eggs in water in ambient light. Miracidia were transferred using a glass pipette into a petri dish to facilitate enumeration and were then pipetted into the 12-well cell culture plates (five miracidia per species per well). All snails were exposed to miracidia obtained within 2 hr of hatching and were exposed for 6 hr in the 12 well plates. Snails were then placed into 20 L tanks in a screened, covered snail rearing facility subject to the diurnal light and temperature at Kisian, Kenya. The snails were kept in 20 L tanks and were fed red leaf lettuce and shrimp pellets three times a week. Water was changed once a week.</p><p>Starting at three weeks post-exposure and at weekly intervals thereafter, snails were individually placed into wells in 12-well cell culture plates with 3 ml of aged tap water for two hours between 10:00-12:00 under ambient light to determine if they would shed cercariae. Cercariae were identified according to cercariae keys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Schell, 1985</xref>) and for verification and further delineation, some cercariae were sequenced (GenBank accession numbers MN603500-MN603506). Snails were shed once a week until 10 weeks post second parasite exposure (12 weeks from initial exposure). The number of shedders and snail mortality were recorded and prevalence of infection determined as described above. This basic experimental protocol was repeated three times, in Jan 2014, Jan 2017 and Jun 2017.</p><p>An appropriate sample size was computed when the study was being designed. We used G*Power to calculate sample size with an alpha error probability of 0.05 and found our sample size was appropriate (250 to 300 for each experiment or 50 to 60 per each treatment). Differences among treatment groups with respect to infection success of experimental exposures were analyzed GraphPad Prism 7 for both <italic>S. mansoni</italic> and <italic>C. sukari</italic> using a non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis analysis of variance (ANOVA) with an alpha of 0.05, by exposure type (single parasite, and mixed species co-exposure), followed by pair-wise comparisons. In the co-exposure experiments we used shedding rates at 8 weeks post second parasite exposure (10 weeks post exposure for controls). Non-parametric tests were used because the data were not normally distributed because survivorship and infection prevalence varied among the infection groups. Prevalence of infection of each parasite per group was determined as the proportion of surviving exposed <italic>B. pfeifferi</italic> shedding cercariae.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Assessing relative dominance ranking among trematodes</title><p>Two different methods were used to reveal the trematode dominance hierarchy. The first used field-derived <italic>B. pfeifferi</italic> found to be shedding one species of cercaria. These were kept in aquaria and were shed twice a week until the snail died. A ‘natural takeover’ was recorded if the snail ceased shedding one species of cercaria and switched over to shedding a different species of cercaria (for example, <italic>B. pfeifferi</italic> was first shedding <italic>S. mansoni</italic> and later began shedding <italic>C. sukari</italic> cercariae). The second method was to obtain either field-derived <italic>B. pfeifferi</italic> shedding one type of cercaria, or to experimentally expose lab-reared <italic>B. pfeifferi</italic> to a particular species of trematode. Then, once the snails were shedding cercariae of that species, they were re-exposed to miracidia of a different species of trematode. These snails were isolated and shed twice a week starting three weeks post second exposure to learn if cercariae of the second species were produced.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Histology</title><p>Snails were placed in Railliet-Henry’s fluid for at least 48 hr. The shell of each snail was removed, and the body of the snail was placed into 10% neutral buffered formalin. The snails were sent to TriCore Reference Laboratories in Albuquerque, New Mexico, sectioned, and sections stained with hematoxylin and eosin.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Mathematical modeling methods</title><p>We developed a deterministic model framework, described by a system of ordinary differential equations, to evaluate the impact of <italic>C. sukari</italic> presence and transmission intensity on <italic>S. mansoni</italic> prevalence in <italic>B. pfeifferi a</italic>nd total <italic>S. mansoni</italic> cercarial production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). The model divides the <italic>B. pfeifferi</italic> snail population into two size classes (juvenile and adults) and multiple infection stages (susceptible, exposed, infected, infected and castrated) to account for the reduction in growth rates and fecundity and an increase in mortality associated with <italic>S. mansoni</italic> and <italic>C. sukari</italic> infections. It also incorporates the timing of each trematode infection (both simultaneous and sequential) on consequent <italic>S. mansoni</italic> or <italic>C. sukari</italic> cercarial output as determined by our laboratory experiments. In addition, the model includes a ‘sink’ snail population to account for the loss of miracidia (of both trematode species) when the larvae infect incompetent snail species that do not result in new cercariae. Moreover, the model explicitly tracks the loss of miracidia due to the successful infection of any snail host.</p><p>The equilibrium levels of <italic>S. mansoni</italic> and <italic>C. sukari</italic> infection were calibrated to field survey data by fixing the rate of snail exposure per miracidial density and the <italic>S. mansoni</italic> and <italic>C. sukari</italic> miracidia input into the system. Field survey data, obtained from January 2014-January 2018 at Asao stream in western Kenya, identify the proportion of <italic>B. pfeifferi</italic> shedding each trematode. These data indicate that the proportion of <italic>B. pfeifferi</italic> shedding <italic>S. mansoni</italic> was equivalent to the proportion shedding <italic>C. sukari.</italic> We set miracidial inputs and exposure rates to yield three different <italic>S. mansoni</italic> and <italic>C. sukari</italic> snail shedding regimes, at 2.5, 5 and 10 percent. The relative size of the exposure rates reflects miracidial preference for <italic>B. pfeifferi</italic> over potential sink snails from our choice chamber experiments, and the unlikely possibility of simultaneous exposure. The volume of water in the system and the overall snail density and relative abundance of <italic>B.pfeifferi</italic> and potential sink snails were obtained from snail density surveys conducted from June 2016 to January 2018 on a 380 meter section of Asao stream. The impact of varying levels of <italic>C. sukari</italic> miracidial input into the <italic>S. mansoni</italic> transmission system at equilibrium was then evaluated with respect to the prevalence of <italic>S. mansoni</italic> infection in <italic>B. pfeifferi</italic> and the overall <italic>S. mansoni</italic> cercarial output of the snail population. The sensitivity of <italic>B. pfeifferi</italic> infection with <italic>S. mansoni</italic> and <italic>C. sukari</italic> and resulting cercarial output to miracidial input and exposure rate of <italic>B. pfeifferi</italic> per miracidial density was explored and is represented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplements 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">3</xref>. At the snail density we found at Asao stream the miracidial input values that resulted in equal shedding of <italic>S. mansoni</italic> and <italic>C. sukari</italic> at reasonable inputs, of between 50–5,000,000 miracidia per week, were only possible in certain exposure ranges. These <italic>B. pfeifferi</italic> exposure rates per miracidial density per week were primarily between 0.025 and 0.75 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>).

offer new insights into how parasite interactions can enhance or decrease transmission depending on the context. They studied human and cattle flatworms, which compete for the resources in a shared snail intermediate host when humans and their domestic animals use the same aquatic habitats. The human flatworm cause the debilitating neglected tropical diseases schistosomiasis. The authors discovered that efforts aimed at reducing the transmission of human schistosomes would help to also control the cattle parasite, whereas efforts targeted at the cattle parasite would be detrimental to schistosomiasis control, thus having important implications for the management of this widespread human disease.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Antagonism between parasites within snail hosts impacts the transmission of human schistosomiasis&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Neil Ferguson as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Bonnie Webster (Reviewer #1); Giulio De Leo (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The reviewers and I found this to be an interesting and well-designed study. I particularly found the question important and understudied, and the findings potentially significant to schistosomiasis control. However, there are some issues that should be addressed that I do think will improve this manuscript. Please see below.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>I received two reviews from reviewers with considerable experience in mathematical modeling of schistosomaisis. One suggested that some sensitivity and uncertainty analyses would improve the paper, and I agree. The second noticed a potential error in the model and both reviewers had concerns about model complexity. These should be addressed. Reviewer #1 raised concerns about clarity of the methods and the results. These concerns should also be addressed.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This is a very interesting, important and well-executed project. It is also scientifically novel and presents some important results.</p><p>My major concern is some of the clarity of the methods and also the results read more like a discussion.</p><p>For the results, I suggest adding actually numbers rather than just an overview of the findings.</p><p>There are several important details missing from the results which are needed for clarity of the data and to see how the experiments were performed.</p><p>I have detailed these areas that need changing or adding too below:</p><p>Subsection “Field surveys and parasite assessment”: Also, how were the cercariae preserved i.e. individually, pooled and in how much ethanol. Also, relate this to the extraction. Individual or pooled cercariae extracted.</p><p>Subsection “<italic>C. sukari</italic> and <italic>S. mansoni</italic> Experimental Exposures”, paragraph two: to help the readers it would be good to have the primer and PCR details in the Materials and methods even though they are published.</p><p>Results section: generally, it would be good to have more numbers and actual amounts stated. I take the example of paragraph two in subsection “<italic>C. sukari</italic> and <italic>S. mansoni</italic> Experimental Exposures”: &quot;Some field snails…&quot;, &quot;rarely resulted…&quot; it would be better to have an actual number of snails. At the moment the results read more like a discussion.</p><p>Subsection “Field surveys and parasite assessment” paragraph two: add how the sequences were edited before analysis.</p><p>The final two sentences of the same paragraph: this is confusing. Can you clarify? Did you use the pairwise comparisons to determine your species or sub-species clusters or determine the actual species? Did you have reference sequences in the analysis?</p><p>Subsection “Compatibility of <italic>Biomphalaria</italic> to <italic>S. mansoni</italic>”: in the results you do not refer to F1 snails in the experiments.</p><p>In the same section explain what you did at each exposure time. Did you record the numbers and then take those infected snails out of the experiment to get a final figure? How many weeks did you continue? Did you record deaths and how did you take these into account in your percentage infection calculations? 50 or 60 is too vague, how many were used? What is peak shedding prevalence? Also the final sentence of this subsection is actually results not methods so the structure needs changing. Also, here how were the different snails identified and how robust is that identification?</p><p>In subsection “Experimental exposures to examine interactions between <italic>S. mansoni</italic> and the amphistome <italic>Calicophoron sukari</italic>”: here you describe the rearing of the snails. But these lab. reared snails are used in the section above. Some restructuring is needed to allow the Materials and methods to be followed better.</p><p>Final sentence of the first paragraph in subsection “Experimental exposures to examine interactions between <italic>S. mansoni</italic> and the amphistome <italic>Calicophoron sukari</italic>”: is there a reference for this method?</p><p>Paragraph two: again 50-60 is too vague, add the actual number?</p><p>In the same paragraph is “in Jan2014” correct? that is a long time before the 2017 studies?</p><p>How many weeks after did you stop and were deaths recorded?</p><p>How were the cercariae identified?</p><p>There are no details on how the snails were individually exposed, in what kind of vessel, the general amount of water, for how long, how were the miracidia captured?</p><p>In the first paragraph of the same section: how do you know they are embryonated and ready for collection for the exposure experiment.</p><p>Subsection “Assessing relative dominance ranking among trematodes”: can you add some numbers of snails that were involved. Again for subsection “Histology” and which exposed combinations.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This is a very interesting study, combining field observations, laboratory experiments, and mathematical models, to explore mechanisms of antagonism between different species of trematodes within snail hosts and the likely impacts on the transmission of human schistosomiasis. Overall, the study was well-designed and implemented, and novel, generating new insights into complexity of <italic>S. mansoni</italic> transmission and having implications on schistosomiasis control programs.</p><p>The only major comment relates to the mathematical modeling on which an important result (removal of <italic>C. sukari</italic> would increase <italic>S. manosoni</italic>-infected snail by three-fold) was based. The mathematical model has too many parameters, given the scale (e.g. limited numbers) of both field observations and lab experiments and the degree to which the majority of parameters relied on parameter estimations, it worried me a bit about the &quot;uncertainty&quot; of the result. It might be helpful to perform sensitivity and uncertainty analyses on the model. Other than that, this is a well-done study.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.50095.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>[…]</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>[…]</p><p>Subsection “Field surveys and parasite assessment”: Also, how were the cercariae preserved i.e. individually, pooled and in how much ethanol.

Figure 5—figure supplement 3 demonstrates how the major parameters that we estimated to calibrate the model against field survey data, the miracidial input of <italic>C. sukari</italic> and the exposure rate of <italic>Biomphalaria</italic> snails to <italic>S. mansoni,</italic> impact cercarial output and infection prevalence for both parasites. Observed prevalence levels (&lt;10%) constrain the possible parameter combinations: if exposure rates are too low or too high, miracidial input has to be set to unrealistic levels. Figure 4 illustrates that the <italic>Biomphalaria</italic> exposure rate to <italic>S. mansoni</italic> and <italic>S. mansoni</italic> miracidial input have larger impacts on <italic>S. mansoni</italic> and <italic>C. sukari</italic> prevalence and shedding than <italic>C. sukari</italic> miracidial input.</p></body></sub-article></article>
