nucleosomes. Here we mapped the H4-tail binding pocket of ISWI. Surprisingly the binding site was adjacent to but not overlapping with the docking site of an auto-regulatory motif, AutoN, in the N-terminal region (NTR) of ISWI, indicating that AutoN does not act as a simple pseudosubstrate as suggested previously. Rather, AutoN cooperated with a hitherto uncharacterized motif, termed AcidicN, to confer H4-tail sensitivity and discriminate between DNA and nucleosomes. A third motif in the NTR, ppHSA, was functionally required in vivo and provided structural stability by clamping the NTR to Lobe 2 of the ATPase domain. This configuration is reminiscent of Chd1 even though Chd1 contains an unrelated NTR. Our results shed light on the intricate structural and functional regulation of ISWI by the NTR and uncover surprising parallels with Chd1.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.21477.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.21477.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21477.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>In the cells of animals, plants and other eukaryotes, DNA wraps tightly around proteins called histones to form structures known as nucleosomes that resemble beads on a string. When nucleosomes are sufficiently close to each other they interact and clump together, which compacts the DNA and prevents the genes in that stretch of DNA being activated.</p><p>But how do cells mobilize their nucleosomes? A nucleosome remodeling enzyme called ISWI can slide nucleosomes along DNA. ISWI becomes active when it interacts with a ‘tail’ region of a histone protein called H4. However, the H4 tail prefers to interact with neighboring nucleosomes instead of with ISWI. Therefore when ISWI slides a nucleosome close to another one, the H4 tail of the nucleosome binds instead to its new neighbor so that ISWI cannot continue to slide. By this mechanism, ISWI is proposed to pile up nucleosomes, which subsequently compact, leading to the inactivation of this part of the genome.</p><p>To investigate how ISWI recognizes the H4 tail, Ludwigsen et al. mapped where the H4 tail binds to ISWI by combining the biochemical methods of cross-linking and mass spectrometry. In addition, mutagenesis experiments identified a new motif in the enzyme that is essential for recognizing the H4 tail. In the absence of the nucleosome, this motif – called AcidicN – works with a neighboring motif called AutoN to keep ISWI in an inactive state. The two motifs also work together to enable ISWI to distinguish between nucleosomes and DNA. Further evidence suggests that other remodeling enzymes have similar regulation mechanisms; therefore this method of controlling nucleosome remodeling may have been conserved throughout evolution.</p><p>Further studies are now needed to detect the shape changes that occur in ISWI as it recognizes the histone tail and work out how this leads to nucleosome remodeling. Inside cells, ISWI is usually found within large complexes that consist of many proteins. It therefore also remains to be discovered whether the proteins in these complexes impose additional layers of regulation and complexity on the activity of ISWI.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.21477.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.21477.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>chromatin remodeling</kwd><kwd>nucleosome</kwd><kwd>ATPase</kwd><kwd>Snf2</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001660</institution-id><institution>Ernst Schering Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ludwigsen</surname><given-names>Johanna</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001655</institution-id><institution>Deutscher Akademischer Austauschdienst</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Singh</surname><given-names>Ashish K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CIPSM</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zacharias</surname><given-names>Martin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MU 3613/1-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mueller-Planitz</surname><given-names>Felix</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MU 3613/3-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mueller-Planitz</surname><given-names>Felix</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFB 1064/1TP-A07</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mueller-Planitz</surname><given-names>Felix</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The N-terminal domain of the chromatin remodeler ISWI contains previously uncharacterized conserved motifs that maintain structure, prevent ATP hydrolysis unless nucleosomes are bound, and confer H4-tail sensitivity without directly competing with the H4 tail.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Eukaryotic cells package their DNA into chromatin. Chromatin organization allows cells to compact, protect and regulate their genomes. Nucleosomes are the primary building blocks of chromatin. These particles consist of ~150 bp of DNA that wrap almost twice around an octamer of histones. Nucleosomal DNA, however, is not accessible to most nuclear factors. Nature therefore evolved ATP-dependent nucleosome remodeling complexes that can alter the position or the structure of nucleosomes as necessary.</p><p>Numerous remodeling complexes with distinct activities are active in any cell. Some move nucleosomes along DNA, eject histones or exchange them for histone variants, and some can even perform several of these activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zhou et al., 2016</xref>). How the various remodelers are regulated in response to cellular needs is not well understood. Several remodelers, for instance, respond to post-translational modifications present on histones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Swygert and Peterson, 2014</xref>). Others are directly regulated by post-translational modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kim et al., 2010</xref>) or react to small signaling molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zhao et al., 1998</xref>). Cells also adjust the subunit composition of remodeling complexes during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lessard et al., 2007</xref>). All these examples indicate exquisite levels of controls exerted over remodeling complexes. The fact that mutations in subunits of human remodeling factors strongly associate with and in some cases drive cancers underscores the necessity to regulate remodeler activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kadoch and Crabtree, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Garraway and Lander, 2013</xref>).</p><p>Remodelers of the ISWI family – like most other remodelers – can reposition nucleosomes along DNA in a process termed nucleosome sliding. ISWI’s activity is directly regulated by the histone H4 N-terminal tail and by DNA that flanks the nucleosome, so called linker DNA. The regulation imposed by these epitopes has direct consequences for the biological output of ISWI remodelers. By measuring the length of linker DNA, ISWI can generate arrays of evenly spaced nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lieleg et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Yamada et al., 2011</xref>), a characteristic feature of chromatin. Arrays of nucleosomes can further compact. In the compacted state, the histone H4 N-terminal tail of one nucleosome contacts the acidic patch formed by H2A and H2B of a neighboring nucleosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Luger et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dorigo et al., 2004</xref>). This interaction sequesters the H4 tail, which now is no longer available for binding to and stimulating the activity of ISWI. Thus, ISWI’s activity on the compacted chromatin would decrease, ensuring the unidirectionality of the reaction. This process is in line with the importance of some ISWI complexes in heterochromatin biology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bozhenok et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>How ISWI senses the H4 tail is largely unknown. Evidence points to the ATPase domain of ISWI directly binding the H4 tail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Racki et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mueller-Planitz et al., 2013</xref>), consistent with the tail directly influencing catalytic reaction steps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Clapier et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dang et al., 2006</xref>). However, a domain at the C-terminal side of ISWI, the HAND-SANT-SLIDE (HSS) domain, has been implicated in binding the H4 tail as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boyer et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Grüne et al., 2003</xref>). Another layer of regulation is imposed by the non-catalytic subunit termed ACF1, which associates with ISWI and sequesters the H4 tail under certain conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hwang et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>ISWI recognizes amino acids R<sub>17</sub>H<sub>18</sub>R<sub>19</sub> within the H4 tail, which are part of a stretch of amino acids called basic patch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fazzio et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hamiche et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Clapier et al., 2002</xref>). Notably, ISWI contains an identical motif, here called AutoN. Mutation of AutoN’s two arginines to alanines (referred to as 2RA) increased the DNA-stimulated ATPase activity and nucleosome sliding, and suppressed the dependence of ISWI’s ATPase and sliding activities on the H4 tail. According to the current model, AutoN directly binds to and blocks the H4-tail binding site, acting as a gatekeeper for the H4 tail. This model necessitates a conformational change of the NTR to allow binding of H4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hwang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Clapier and Cairns, 2012</xref>). Indeed, a conformational change could be traced to AutoN upon nucleic acid binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mueller-Planitz et al., 2013</xref>). Of note, the 2RA mutation diminished but did not abolish the H4-tail dependency, implicating also other regions in the H4 recognition process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Clapier and Cairns, 2012</xref>).</p><p>The AutoN motif is embedded in a structurally and functionally poorly characterized domain referred to as the N-terminal region (NTR). Besides AutoN, the NTR contains additional motifs: an acidic region that we termed AcidicN, the ‘<underline>p</underline>ost-<underline>p</underline>ost-<underline>h</underline>elicase-<underline>S</underline>ANT-<underline>a</underline>ssociated' (ppHSA) motif, so named because it follows the post-HSA motif in remodelers of the Snf2 family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mueller-Planitz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Szerlong et al., 2008</xref>), and a weakly conserved AT-hook (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mueller-Planitz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aravind and Landsman, 1998</xref>). Their functions remain unknown.</p><p>Here, we systematically interrogated the functions of all conserved motifs within the NTR by mutagenesis and a series of quantitative biochemical assays in vitro and in vivo. We paid particular attention to probe for possible crosstalk between these motifs and the H4 tail to understand its recognition process. Using protein crosslinking followed by mass spectrometry and protein structural modeling we obtained information about the general structural architecture of the NTR-ATPase module. With similar approaches, we mapped the H4-tail binding site. We interpret our results within a unified structural and functional framework for the combined inhibition of ISWI by the NTR and recognition of the histone H4 tail. Contrary to current models, we propose that AutoN does not occlude the binding pocket of the H4 tail and that inhibition by AutoN involves a more elaborate mechanism than simple mimicry of the H4 basic patch.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The NTR contains conserved motifs</title><p>Multiple sequence alignment of ISWI homologs revealed several sequence motifs in the NTR of ISWI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mueller-Planitz et al., 2013</xref>).

We reconstituted entire nucleosomes bearing a photo-reactive benzophenone on the N-terminal tail of H4. Benzophenone labeling was achieved by chemical modification of single cysteine mutants of H4 (T1C and L10C). These nucleosomes bound to full-length ISWI and stimulated its ATPase activity like wild-type nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2B,C</xref>) suggesting that they were properly recognized by the remodeler. UV-irradiation of full-length ISWI bound to benzophenone-labeled T1C nucleosomes retarded the mobility of the remodeler during SDS-PAGE, indicative of successful crosslinking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). MS analysis mapped a crosslink to Lobe 2 of ISWI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B–D</xref>). We repeated these crosslinking experiments with the human ISWI homolog SNF2H. Both T1C- and L10C-labeled nucleosomes crosslinked to Lobe 2 of SNF2H (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1G–J</xref>). In summary, two very different crosslinking approaches, one employing Bpa-containing peptides and one using benzophenone-derivatized nucleosomes, consistently yielded crosslinks between the H4 tail and Lobe 2 of the ATPase domain. <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref> lists all crosslink candidates, classified in terms of their reliability (see Materials and methods). Notably, methionine residues were overrepresented as targets of the photo-crosslinking approach, consistent with the known preference of benzophenones for methionine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wittelsberger et al., 2006</xref>). In summary, our data strongly indicated the H4-tail binding site to reside on or close to Lobe 2.<fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21477.017</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>The binding sites of the NTR and the H4-tail on Lobe 2 are proximal.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>–<bold>D</bold>) Crosslinking of nucleosomes containing benzophenone-labeled H4 to ISWI.

In fact, DNA-stimulated ATPase rates of ISWI<sub>+6</sub> reached values of nucleosome-stimulated ISWI<sub>WT</sub> rates. Also its basal ATPase activity was strongly (20-fold) upregulated compared to ISWI<sub>WT</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3A,B</xref>). To rule out that co-purifying contaminating ATPases overwhelm the ATPase signal, we combined the +6 mutation with a point mutation in the ATPase that abrogates ATPase activity (E257Q). ATP hydrolysis and remodeling were negligible for ISWI<sub>+6; E257Q</sub>, providing strong evidence against this possibility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2B,C</xref>).</p><p>In contrast to the DNA-stimulated reaction, nucleosome-stimulated ATPase and remodeling activities were comparable between the AcidicN mutants and ISWI<sub>WT</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B,C</xref>). Taken together, these results indicated that the AcidicN mutants were not simply hyperactive, but misregulated instead. More specifically, mutation of AcidicN prevented ISWI from properly recognizing whether chromatin was bound and led to futile ATP hydrolysis in the absence of chromatin.</p><p>To independently test this conclusion and to further validate the usefulness of the H483B mutant used further above, we combined the H483B and AcidicN mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4</xref>). DNA-stimulated ATP hydrolysis was strongly upregulated in the ISWI<sub>+3; H483B</sub> and ISWI<sub>+6; H483B</sub> double mutants relative to the ISWI<sub>H483B</sub> single mutant and reached levels of the chromatin-stimulated reaction. These data closely paralleled and therefore independently validated our results obtained with ISWI<sub>+3</sub> and ISWI<sub>+6</sub>. We conclude that AcidicN regulates ISWI<sub>WT</sub> and ISWI<sub>H483B</sub> in a very similar fashion, further justifying the use of ISWI<sub>H483B</sub> for crosslinking experiments above.</p><p>To validate the predicted binding interface of AcidicN on Lobe 2 and to further probe the functionality of this interaction, we introduced mutations in Lobe 2. We selected three positively charged residues for mutagenesis, K403, R458 and R508, which are predicted to participate in docking to the negatively charged AcidicN motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). Charge-reversal of these residues would be expected to weaken docking of AcidicN to Lobe2 and – in the simplest case – phenocopy the effects of the mutation of AcidicN. Indeed, the interface mutants had a strongly upregulated DNA-stimulated ATPase activity whereas chromatin-stimulated ATP turnover and nucleosome remodeling were largely unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B,C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>). The interface mutants therefore behaved just like the AcidicN mutants discussed above. A control mutant (ISWI<sub>R486; 488D</sub>), carrying amino acid substitutions just outside of the predicted AcidicN binding interface, however, retained its ability to discriminate chromatin over DNA in the ATP hydrolysis assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). These data support the notion that AcidicN interacts with Lobe 2 at the predicted interface and that this interaction is functionally important to discriminate whether chromatin is bound to the enzyme.<fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21477.026</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Validation of the predicted binding interface of AcidicN on Lobe 2.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Homology model of the ISWI ATPase domain.

The molecular mechanism of H4-tail recognition and regulation has remained elusive, not least because the tail’s binding site had not been mapped. Using crosslinking-MS, we found the H4 tail to bind to the conserved Lobe 2 of the ATPase module. Direct binding to the ATPase domain explains regulation of otherwise divergent remodeler families and explains the influence of the H4 tail on catalytic, as opposed to purely binding steps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Clapier et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dang et al., 2006</xref>).

In fact, AutoN (amino acids ‘RHRK’, which are present in many but not all ISWI proteins; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) was initially discovered by way of its resemblance to the amino acids ‘R<sub>17</sub>H<sub>18</sub>R<sub>19</sub>K<sub>20</sub>’ on histone H4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Clapier and Cairns, 2012</xref>). In this model, the basic patch of the H4 tail must compete with AutoN for the same binding site on the ATPase domain, such that AutoN and possibly the entire NTR is displaced upon tail binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Clapier and Cairns, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hauk et al., 2010</xref>). This model is supported by the observations that the NTR can in principle undergo conformational changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mueller-Planitz et al., 2013</xref>) and that the chromo domains of Chd1 must rearrange before the ATPase domain assumes a catalytically active conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hauk et al., 2010</xref>). Direct experimental support for a shared binding site of AutoN and H4 basic patch has been lacking, however, and the resemblance of the two motifs may be purely coincidental in principle. Of the four amino acids that resemble the H4 tail, only three (R<sub>17</sub>H<sub>18</sub>R<sub>19</sub>) were found to be functionally important for ISWI enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fazzio et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Clapier et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Clapier and Cairns, 2012</xref>). Recent crystallographic evidence also did not support the molecular mimicry hypothesis (see below) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yan et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>We favor a second, simpler model, which does not invoke molecular mimicry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). In this model, the AutoN and the H4-tail binding sites are not identical, possibly allowing simultaneous binding of both to Lobe 2 at least temporarily. This scenario is fully compatible with our suggestion that the docking sites for the H4 tail and AutoN-AcidicN are adjacent to each other but not overlapping (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Conceivably, the negatively charged AcidicN motif may even promote binding of the basic H4 tail to a neighboring site. A structural rearrangement of the NTR upon H4 tail binding is compatible with but not required in this model. Similarly, conformational changes of the NTR upon DNA binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mueller-Planitz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hauk et al., 2010</xref>) or during other steps of the reaction cycle are also fully consistent with it.</p><p>Intriguing parallels between ISWI’s NTR and Chd1’s chromo domains become apparent. Our crosslinking results indicate that the NTR of ISWI docks against Lobe 2 of the ATPase domain in a very similar fashion as the chromo domains of Chd1, and docking appears to involve an acidic motif in both cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hauk et al., 2010</xref>). Thus, the overall conformational architecture of ISWI’s ATPase module may be shared with Chd1. Moreover, both domains are known to inhibit the ATPase, both are predicted to undergo conformational changes upon substrate binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mueller-Planitz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Clapier and Cairns, 2012</xref>) and both confer sensitivity towards the histone H4 tail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Clapier and Cairns, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hauk et al., 2010</xref>). Thus, despite complete lack of sequence conservation between both domains, they appear to have evolved very similar functionalities.</p><p>The NTR of ISWI contains several conserved motifs whose functions have mostly remained unexplored so far. Because the ppHSA motif and adjacent regions crosslinked to the ATPase lobe 2, we suggest that it is important for docking the NTR against the ATPase domain. Consistent with such a structural role of this motif, we found that ISWI<sub>ΔppHSA</sub> is destabilized in vitro and in vivo. Of note, the ppHSA motif is present in a wide variety of unrelated remodelers, including Ino80, Lsh, and Snf2, suggesting that their ATPases, too, might bind the ppHSA motif and assemble into a structurally analogous architecture.</p><p>In this study, we functionally characterized AcidicN, a novel motif in the NTR. ISWI with a mutated AcidicN had a deregulated, hyperactive ATPase activity. Notably, this mutant hydrolyzed ATP with comparable velocities when bound to either DNA or nucleosomes, indicating that it lost its ability to discriminate between them. In particular, it lost its H4-tail dependence. This phenotype is reminiscent of mutations in the acidic helix in Chd1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hauk et al., 2010</xref>), underscoring the functional parallels between the NTR and chromo domains discussed above. The effects of AcidicN mutations were also remarkably similar to AutoN mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Clapier and Cairns, 2012</xref>), which suggested that they work together. The mechanism of autoinhibition by the NTR therefore may involve more than simple mimicry of H4’s basic patch by AutoN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Clapier and Cairns, 2012</xref>). Supporting its functional importance, AcidicN is at least as conserved as AutoN in our alignments.</p><p>During the revision of this manuscript, a crystal structure of the ATPase module of ISWI from a thermophilic fungus became available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yan et al., 2016</xref>). Even though both studies relied on different approaches, they arrived at very similar conclusions. As suggested by our crosslinking and modeling data, the NTR packed against the ATPase domain in the structure of the thermostable ISWI. We correctly predicted the AcidicN binding pocket on Lobe 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3A</xref>), and our crosslinks between Lobe 2 and the NTR were fully supported by the structure as well. Finally, the authors succeeded in co-crystallizing a histone H4-tail peptide with Lobe 2 of the ATPase. Even though only the basic patch of the tail peptide was visible in the structure, its location overlapped well with the position of the modeled H4 basic patch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3C</xref>). AutoN crystallized in closer proximity to the interaction site of the basic patch than suggested by modeling, but molecular mimicry of AutoN with the basic patch was not supported by the structure.</p><p>Sensitive biophysical assays will be instrumental in the future for resolving conformational changes that may occur during H4-tail recognition and for understanding their functional importance in ISWI complexes. Moreover, ascertaining the predicted role of H4-tail recognition for the formation or maintenance of compact heterochromatic regions remains an important goal.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Amino acid sequence alignments and sequence logos</title><p>Search for homologous proteins of full-length <italic>Drosophila</italic> ISWI and alignment of sequences were done using HHblits with standard settings.

All three reviews are included below. We hope that you will find the comments in these reviews helpful in the continuation of this study.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>This is a nice biochemical study examining the auto regulation domains of the ISWI ATPase chromatin remodeling complex. The manuscript provides novel data that &quot;correct&quot; aspects of previous models of ISWI regulation while confirming other aspects. The most important finding in the manuscript is that the ppHSA domain of the N terminal region binds to lobe 2 of the ATPase domain to suppress the ATPase activity in the absence of the H4 tail similar to chromodomains of CHD1 binding the ATPase domain.</p><p>1) While high profile papers have been published on examining auto regulation of ISWI including some which this study corrects, the impact of this work would be greatly enhanced if it were demonstrated that the ppHSA domain in other chromatin remodelers (Ino80, Lsh, Snf2) were also found to bind and regulate their ATPases. Even one more example of this regulation would turn this detailed study of ISWI regulation into revealing novel mechanisms for a whole group of remodelers. I strongly recommend the authors try the cross linking experiment with another remodeler.</p><p>2) ISWI is complexed with other proteins. The manuscript should discuss this in the Introduction and any implications other subunits might have for the activities shown here in the Discussion.</p><p>3) The raw data for the restriction enzyme site accessibility assays should be shown somewhere in the manuscript.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>The ISWI chromatin remodeling enzymes are activated by interaction with the histone H4 N-terminal tail domain. In the current model for ISWI activation, the H4-tail binding site is blocked by the AutoN-motif in the N-terminal region (NTR) of ISWI, which contains a sequence very similar to the basic patch in the H4 tail. Consequently, it was proposed that H4 and AutoN compete for the same site on the ISWI ATPase domain. Using a combination of site-specific cross-linking, mass spectroscopy and structural modeling, the authors have mapped the approximate binding sites of the NTR and the H4 tail within purified ISWI enzymes in vitro. They deduce that the NTR and the H4 tail both bind to lobe 2 of the ATPase domain, but not at the same site. Their data are therefore inconsistent with the current model. They propose an allosteric model instead. This study also identifies two other important regions in the NTR: the ppHSA motif, which is shown to contribute to the structural stability of the NTR domain, and the AcidicN motif which, together with AutoN, is important for H4-dependent enzyme activation. Mutations in AcidicN or AutoN activate the ISWI ATPase in the absence of chromatin and allow remodeling of nucleosomal arrays even if the H4 tail is absent. These two motifs together confer H4-tail dependence on the enzyme. The authors also point out that ISWI is more similar to Chd1 than expected, given the lack of sequence homology between the NTRs of the two enzymes.</p><p>Overall, this is a thorough and careful study with interesting and important conclusions concerning the mechanism of chromatin remodeling by ISWI enzymes. The authors used both UV and chemical cross-linking to map binding sites on two different ISWI enzymes (<italic>Drosophila</italic> ISWI and human hSNF5) in the presence and absence of nucleosomes or H4 peptide, with consistent results. They also assessed the effects of NTR mutations in vivo, although this had to be done in yeast, with the ISW1 enzyme, which is unlike ISWI because it is inactive without Ioc subunits.</p><p>I have only one important concern. The weak point of the study is that the authors have to use structural modeling to interpret the cross-linking pattern. There is no good way around this problem in the absence of a crystal structure for a complete ISWI enzyme. The structural model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref> indicates clearly that there is no overlap between the likely binding sites on the ATPase domain for the H4 tail and the NTR domain. However, the H4 tail is apparently modeled as an α-helix, which makes it much shorter than the extended random coil structure usually proposed for the histone tails. Given that the mapped site-specific contacts involve cross-links from the first or tenth residues of the H4 tail (T1C or L10C), whereas the basic patch includes residues 16 to 20, is it possible to dock a random coil model for the H4 tail such that the mapped contacts involving T1C and L10C are maintained and the basic patch residues are located at the same site on the ATPase as AutoN, as predicted by the competition model?</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>The authors analyze the functional role of three conserved motifs in the N-terminus of ISWI, an ATP-dependent chromatin remodeler that spaces nucleosomes. Previous studies had focused on what is called the AutoN domain and its sequence similarity with the histone H4 tail. Earlier data had suggested the AutoN negatively regulates the ATPase and remodeling activities of ISWI which can be competed away and relieved by the H4 tail. They present a different explanation in which the AutoN and a flanking region called AcidicN bind to a region of the ATPase domain different than the H4 tail. Instead of competing the H4 tail, AutoN and AcidicN cooperate together to regulate ISWI in an H4 tail dependent manner. A third motif called ppHSA is also presented to bind to lobe 2 of the ATPase domain and stabilizes the interactions of AutoN and AcidicN with lobe 2.</p><p>They map the interactions of the AutoN, AcidicN, ppHSA and H4 tail with the ATPase domain of ISWI using a combination of photoaffinity labeling and chemical crosslinking. They incorporate photoreactive amino acid analogs either into a site of the ATPase domain they propose to be the binding site of the NTR region or into the H4 tail. Photoaffinity labeling is a powerful technique, but there are certain concerns associated with this approach which need to be considered. Whenever a modification is made, especially one as bulky as benzophenone (essentially 2 benzene rings), it is critical to determine if the modification interferes with the normal function of the protein. The authors have not shown if the modifications in ISWI or the H4 tail peptide interfered with their binding or the associated enzymatic activity. Since their results and conclusions are heavily dependent on these crosslinking data, it is imperative for them to do the necessary controls. They need to determine if the modifications interfered with the ATPase and nucleosome remodeling activity of ISWI and if modifications in the H4 tail interfere with it stimulating the ATPase activity of ISWI with DNA. The other approach uses chemical crosslinking of proximal lysines with a reagent called BS3 and identification of crosslinked pairs by mass spectrometry. The authors failed to present the full spectral dataset of these crosslinking experiments and how they were validated or confirmed. Instead they indicate only one of the potentially many crosslinks they obtained and in this case have picked the one that is consistent with the model. The data needs to be fully presented and properly vetted before it can be accepted.</p><p>There are additional concerns about the photocrosslinking and the use of Bpa because of the type of photochemistry it entails. It is reasonably probable that the photocrosslinking captures a minor population of the protein and may not be a good representation of the bulk protein and the true state of the protein. Possibly only an inactive fraction of the protein is what is being productively crosslinked and thus additional tests need to be in place to confirm the protein interactions. The site-directed mutagenesis unfortunately do not accomplish this purpose, but only demonstrate that particular residues are important for the enzyme's activity. This is further compounded because unlike aryl azides, benzophenone has the ability to cycle between its excited state and ground state until it reaches the appropriate substrate and it has a high preference for Met. Therefore these reagents can search for quite a while until the right substrate presents itself and for these reason make it even more probable of trapping an inactive or inappropriate conformation that may occur infrequently.</p><p>A major concern of this paper is that there is a lot of in silico work done that is more speculative in terms of determining the binding surface of NTR in the ATPase domain rather than direct experimental data. Based on only one crosslinked site and additional assumptions does not provide a high confidence in the sites proposed by the authors. This non-objective way of showing the data appears multiple times in this manuscript. And yet this is a major point of the manuscript. Also when they dock the H4 tail on the surface of the ATPase domain based on crosslinking at two sites on H4, they only show one model instead of the family of possible interactions obtained by their modeling method. The choice of only one site on the surface of the ATPase domain seems to be inadequate for probing the interactions of the NTR with the ATPase domain. The rationale for choosing the site based on the premise that it should be the same or similar to that of the chromodomains of Chd1 when there is no sequence homology between these two region doesn't have much supporting evidence and is very tenuous. There should at least by other sites within lobe 1 that are examined as controls in order to confirm the specificity of the observed contacts.</p><p>The choice of protein constructs was somewhat curious and varied. The authors start with ISWI from <italic>Drosophila</italic> that contains most of the full length ISWI including the HSS tail, but then revert to one missing the HSS region. And then a third variation is using the human SNF2H when doing the chemical crosslinking with BS3. All of these variations are most likely going to matter. I think it is important for the authors to do all the experiments with the ISWI construct containing the HSS region, because the HSS region is very likely to matter in this regard.</p><p>The other point of the paper is the ppHSA motif stabilizes the interactions of the NTR, however this does not seem to be well supported. The authors examine recombinant constructs of ISWI with serial truncations from the N-terminus. They examined the stabilities of these proteins using differential scanning fluorimetry and concluded the deletion of the extreme N-terminus containing the ppHSA motif is less stable than the full length ISWI. The data however shows that the truncated proteins are more complex that full length ISWI and did not give a simple one curve. Indeed there seems to be components within the sample that may actually be more stable than full length. The purity of these proteins as visualized by SDS-PAGE analysis are not very high and could lead to the complicated scan of these truncated proteins. The author average all this together to give them a lower thermal stability for the truncated constructs and is misleading. The also conclude that the ppHSA motif dies not contribute to the regulation of the activity of ISWI; however they see a 3.6 fold reduction when this motif is removed. I would have thought that was a substantial effect and should not be discounted.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21477.036</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p><italic>This is a nice biochemical study examining the auto regulation domains of the ISWI ATPase chromatin remodeling complex. The manuscript provides novel data that &quot;correct&quot; aspects of previous models of ISWI regulation while confirming other aspects. The most important finding in the manuscript is that the ppHSA domain of the N terminal region binds to lobe 2 of the ATPase domain to suppress the ATPase activity in the absence of the H4 tail similar to chromodomains of CHD1 binding the ATPase domain.</italic></p><p><italic>1) While high profile papers have been published on examining auto regulation of ISWI including some which this study corrects, the impact of this work would be greatly enhanced if it were demonstrated that the ppHSA domain in other chromatin remodelers (Ino80, Lsh, Snf2) were also found to bind and regulate their ATPases. Even one more example of this regulation would turn this detailed study of ISWI regulation into revealing novel mechanisms for a whole group of remodelers. I strongly recommend the authors try the cross linking experiment with another remodeler.</italic></p><p>We agree that additional crosslinking experiments with other remodeler families containing a ppHSA domain would be very interesting. We feel however that this is experimentally out of reach and may be beyond the scope of our study. Purifying megadalton complexes such as Ino80 and Snf2 is technically demanding, and incorporation of the photo-crosslinkable amino acids is not trivial either. A comparative analysis of the role of the ppHSA motif across multiple remodeler families -while certainly worthwhile in its own right- would possibly require a year or more for completion. In addition, it would not substantiate major conclusions of our study, which relate to the mechanism of H4 tail recognition by ISWI and the structure and function of its N-terminal region (NTR). For these reasons, we opted not to pursue crosslinking experiments with other remodelers.</p><p><italic>2) ISWI is complexed with other proteins. The manuscript should discuss this in the Introduction and any implications other subunits might have for the activities shown here in the Discussion.</italic></p><p>As suggested, we now include more references in the text to the presence of additional subunits in ISWI complexes. Their function is not well understood but they potentially provide a whole new layer of regulation:</p><p>Introduction section: “Cells also adjust the subunit composition of remodeling complexes during development (Lessard et al.,2007).”</p><p>Introduction section, paragraph 4: “Another layer of regulation is imposed by the non-catalytic subunit termed ACF1, which associates with ISWI and sequesters the H4 tail under certain conditions (Hwang et al.,2014).”</p><p>Discussion section: “Our data do not rule out additional binding sites on other domains and on ISWI’s partner subunit ACF1 as proposed earlier (Boyer, Latek and Peterson, 2004, Grune et al., 2003 and Hwang et al,. 2014).”</p><p>Discussion section, last paragraph: “Sensitive biophysical assays will be instrumental in the future for resolving conformational changes that may occur during H4 tail recognition and for understanding their functional importance in ISWI complexes.”</p><p><italic>3) The raw data for the restriction enzyme site accessibility assays should be shown somewhere in the manuscript.</italic></p><p>As requested, we incorporated the raw data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p><italic>The ISWI chromatin remodeling enzymes are activated by interaction with the histone H4 N-terminal tail domain. In the current model for ISWI activation, the H4-tail binding site is blocked by the AutoN-motif in the N-terminal region (NTR) of ISWI, which contains a sequence very similar to the basic patch in the H4 tail. Consequently, it was proposed that H4 and AutoN compete for the same site on the ISWI ATPase domain. Using a combination of site-specific cross-linking, mass spectroscopy and structural modeling, the authors have mapped the approximate binding sites of the NTR and the H4 tail within purified ISWI enzymes</italic> in vitro. They deduce that the NTR and the H4 tail both bind to lobe 2 of the ATPase domain, but not at the same site. Their data are therefore inconsistent with the current model. They propose an allosteric model instead. This study also identifies two other important regions in the NTR: the ppHSA motif, which is shown to contribute to the structural stability of the NTR domain, and the AcidicN motif which, together with AutoN, is important for H4-dependent enzyme activation. Mutations in AcidicN or AutoN activate the ISWI ATPase in the absence of chromatin and allow remodeling of nucleosomal arrays even if the H4 tail is absent. These two motifs together confer H4-tail dependence on the enzyme. The authors also point out that ISWI is more similar to Chd1 than expected, given the lack of sequence homology between the NTRs of the two enzymes.</p><p><italic>Overall, this is a thorough and careful study with interesting and important conclusions concerning the mechanism of chromatin remodeling by ISWI enzymes. The authors used both UV and chemical cross-linking to map binding sites on two different ISWI enzymes (Drosophila ISWI and human hSNF5) in the presence and absence of nucleosomes or H4 peptide, with consistent results. They also assessed the effects of NTR mutations in vivo, although this had to be done in yeast, with the ISW1 enzyme, which is unlike ISWI because it is inactive without Ioc subunits.</italic></p><p>We thank the reviewer for appreciating our efforts as “a thorough and careful study with interesting and important conclusions concerning the mechanism of chromatin remodeling by ISWI enzymes”.</p><p><italic>I have only one important concern. The weak point of the study is that the authors have to use structural modeling to interpret the cross-linking pattern. There is no good way around this problem in the absence of a crystal structure for a complete ISWI enzyme. The structural model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref> indicates clearly that there is no overlap between the likely binding sites on the ATPase domain for the H4 tail and the NTR domain. However, the H4 tail is apparently modeled as an α-helix, which makes it much shorter than the extended random coil structure usually proposed for the histone tails. Given that the mapped site-specific contacts involve cross-links from the first or tenth residues of the H4 tail (T1C or L10C), whereas the basic patch includes residues 16 to 20, is it possible to dock a random coil model for the H4 tail such that the mapped contacts involving T1C and L10C are maintained and the basic patch residues are located at the same site on the ATPase as AutoN, as predicted by the competition model?</italic></p><p>We realize that we did not sufficiently explain the modeling procedure and we would like to clarify this point. Contrary to the reviewer’s concern, the H4 tail was not modeled as an α-helix. Indeed, the modeling algorithm was not fed with any information on the tail structure. Accordingly, the family of 383 models that fit the distance restraints provided by the crosslinks, contained both helical und ‘unstructured’ H4 tails (see also Materials and methods for details). The modeled interaction surface (red and yellow in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>) depicts the contact frequency between ISWI and the H4 tail across the entire family of 383 models.</p><p>Nevertheless, the H4-tail assumed a helical organization in the top three best fitting models, one of which was depicted in former <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>. Such a helical configuration would indeed be in good agreement with previously published results [1-3]. We therefore showed one helical model for illustration purposes only in our previously submitted manuscript.</p><p>By doing so, we may have created the wrong impression that we assumed the tail to be α helical during modeling, or that the H4 tail must form a helix once bound to ISWI. We therefore took out the modeled H4 tail from the revised figure. Importantly, all information about the family of models (helical and extended) was and still is contained in the colored interaction surface. See also our response to reviewer #3.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p><italic>The authors analyze the functional role of three conserved motifs in the N-terminus of ISWI, an ATP-dependent chromatin remodeler that spaces nucleosomes. Previous studies had focused on what is called the AutoN domain and its sequence similarity with the histone H4 tail. Earlier data had suggested the AutoN negatively regulates the ATPase and remodeling activities of ISWI which can be competed away and relieved by the H4 tail. They present a different explanation in which the AutoN and a flanking region called AcidicN bind to a region of the ATPase domain different than the H4 tail. Instead of competing the H4 tail, AutoN and AcidicN cooperate together to regulate ISWI in an H4 tail dependent manner. A third motif called ppHSA is also presented to bind to lobe 2 of the ATPase domain and stabilizes the interactions of AutoN and AcidicN with lobe 2.</italic></p><p><italic>They map the interactions of the AutoN, AcidicN, ppHSA and H4 tail with the ATPase domain of ISWI using a combination of photoaffinity labeling and chemical crosslinking. They incorporate photoreactive amino acid analogs either into a site of the ATPase domain they propose to be the binding site of the NTR region or into the H4 tail. Photoaffinity labeling is a powerful technique, but there are certain concerns associated with this approach which need to be considered. Whenever a modification is made, especially one as bulky as benzophenone (essentially 2 benzene rings), it is critical to determine if the modification interferes with the normal function of the protein. The authors have not shown if the modifications in ISWI or the H4 tail peptide interfered with their binding or the associated enzymatic activity. Since their results and conclusions are heavily dependent on these crosslinking data, it is imperative for them to do the necessary controls. They need to determine if the modifications interfered with the ATPase and nucleosome remodeling activity of ISWI and if modifications in the H4 tail interfere with it stimulating the ATPase activity of ISWI with DNA.</italic></p><p>We agree that photo-crosslinking is a powerful technique but that the functional consequences of incorporation of the benzophenone moiety into proteins need to be assessed. In the revised manuscript, we now show the requested quality controls that probe whether benzophenone incorporation affects function.</p><p>We include now a figure that shows that benzophenone-containing H4 tail peptides retain their ability to stimulate ATP hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A</xref>), that benzophenone-labeled nucleosomes stimulate ATP hydrolysis like wild-type nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2B</xref>) and that these nucleosomes can associate with ISWI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2C</xref>).</p><p>We also assessed the effect of Bpa substitution of histidine 483. ISWI<sub>H483B</sub> hydrolyzed ATP and remodeled nucleosomes 3- to 4-fold more slowly than ISWI<sub>WT</sub> (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4</xref>), a result that may not be surprising given that the mutation is located in the conserved ‘block D’ of Snf2 ATPases. Importantly, coupling of ATP hydrolysis to remodeling of nucleosomes was unaffected suggesting that the mutant remained structurally largely intact. We also probed whether auto-regulation of ISWI<sub>H483B</sub> by its NTR was affected by the H483B mutation. Mutagenesis of the NTR (+3 and +6 mutation) had analogous effects on ISWI<sub>WT</sub> and ISWI<sub>H483B</sub> (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6 —figure supplement 4</xref>), demonstrating that the function of the NTR was largely unperturbed. In conclusion, we think that our new data sufficiently justify the use of ISWI<sub>H483B</sub>. These new results are discussed in subsection “The NTR contacts Lobe 2 of the ATPase domain”.</p><p><italic>The other approach uses chemical crosslinking of proximal lysines with a reagent called BS3 and identification of crosslinked pairs by mass spectrometry. The authors failed to present the full spectral dataset of these crosslinking experiments and how they were validated or confirmed. Instead they indicate only one of the potentially many crosslinks they obtained and in this case have picked the one that is consistent with the model. The data needs to be fully presented and properly vetted before it can be accepted.</italic></p><p>We realize that the inclusion of the chemical crosslink obtained with BS3 was confusing. The reviewer correctly predicts that the chemical crosslinking dataset contained many crosslinks. Because we are currently preparing a separate manuscript about these crosslinks, we could not include the entire dataset here. Importantly, none of the additional chemical crosslinks questioned any of our conclusions, nor did they substantiate any of the claims, so we didn’t think it necessary to report them. We would be happy to share the entire dataset with the reviewer as necessary.</p><p>Actually, none of our conclusions in the manuscript relied on this chemical crosslink. Being a low confidence crosslink, we did not even use it for structural docking purposes. Because inclusion of the chemical crosslink evidently led to more question than answers, we simply removed it from the manuscript during the revision.</p><p><italic>There are additional concerns about the photocrosslinking and the use of Bpa because of the type of photochemistry it entails. It is reasonably probable that the photocrosslinking captures a minor population of the protein and may not be a good representation of the bulk protein and the true state of the protein. Possibly only an inactive fraction of the protein is what is being productively crosslinked and thus additional tests need to be in place to confirm the protein interactions. The site-directed mutagenesis unfortunately do not accomplish this purpose, but only demonstrate that particular residues are important for the enzyme's activity. This is further compounded because unlike aryl azides, benzophenone haas the ability to cycle between its excited state and ground state until it reaches the appropriate substrate and it has a high preference for Met. Therefore these reagents can search for quite a while until the right substrate presents itself and for these reason make it even more probable of trapping an inactive or inappropriate conformation that may occur infrequently.</italic></p><p>We thank the reviewer for this detailed comment and agree that -like any other method- also photo- crosslinking has its disadvantages. The disadvantage that the reviewer pointed out is that a very flexible structure may assume multiple conformations and crosslink only out of some of them. We better discussed this caveat in the revised manuscript:</p><p>Subsection “The H4 tail binds Lobe 2 adjacent to AutoN-AcidicN”: “Note that not all lower quality crosslinks were compatible with this binding mode, possibly because the H4-tail peptide bound flexibly or in multiple binding modes (Racki et al., 2014). Some of these modes may not be strongly populated or functionally active as crosslinking can in principle trap fleeting intermediates.”</p><p>We would like to point out that all our crosslinks, including the crosslinks formed by ISWI<sub>H483B</sub>, are fully supported by a crystal structure that was published during the revision of this manuscript (Yan et al., 2016). This structure therefore provided strong orthogonal validation of our crosslinking data, and we discuss our results in the light of the new structure briefly in the Discussion section now.</p><p><italic>A major concern of this paper is that there is a lot of in silico work done that is more speculative in terms of determining the binding surface of NTR in the ATPase domain rather than direct experimental data. Based on only one crosslinked site and additional assumptions does not provide a high confidence in the sites proposed by the authors. This non-objective way of showing the data appears multiple times in this manuscript. And yet this is a major point of the manuscript.</italic></p><p>To clarify, we performed in silico docking only twice. We docked the H4 tail, and we docked AutoN- AcidicN. Docking of the H4 tail was well constrained by the experimentally observed crosslinks between H4 and the enzyme, for which we comprehensively disclosed all supporting spectra (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>). Crosslink-guided structural modeling is the current state of the art, and many laboratories use it when higher resolution techniques cannot readily be employed. The position of the modeled H4 tail was indeed fully consistent with a crystal structure that came out during the revision of this manuscript (Yan et al., 2016)). Only the basic patch of H4 is visible in the structure, however, whereas our crosslinking data restrained amino acids 1 and 10, so that our work predicts the location of the entire binding pocket.</p><p>The reviewer is right, however, that we did not have distance restraints for the second docking that we performed, docking of AutoN-AcidicN. We therefore validated the proposed interface on Lobe 2 by mutagenesis during the revision (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>). Remarkably, interface mutants practically phenocopied AcidicN mutants, providing strong evidence for correct identification of the AcidicN binding pocket. The crystal structure (Yan et al., 2016) that became available after we had designed the mutagenesis experiment, fully supported the predicted AcidicN interface (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p> <italic>Also when they dock the H4 tail on the surface of the ATPase domain based on crosslinking at two sites on H4, they only show one model instead of the family of possible interactions obtained by their modeling method.</italic></p><p>We apologize for being unclear about how the modeling results were being displayed. We do, actually, show the results of the whole family of models in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>. This information is contained in the yellow to red color scale, which denotes low to high contact probabilities between the H4 tail and Lobe 2. These contact probabilities were calculated from the top ranking 383 models that we obtained from docking (see also Materials and methods section). In addition, we previously displayed the H4 tail of the top ranking model.</p><p>To avoid giving the impression that we only show results of one model, we simply deleted the top ranking H4 tail model from the figure during the revision. Importantly, all information about the family of docked structures was and still is represented in the yellow to red interaction surface. See also our response to a comment from reviewer #2.</p><p><italic>The choice of only one site on the surface of the ATPase domain seems to be inadequate for probing the interactions of the NTR with the ATPase domain. The rationale for choosing the site based on the premise that it should be the same or similar to that of the chromodomains of Chd1 when there is no sequence homology between these two region doesn't have much supporting evidence and is very tenuous. There should at least by other sites within lobe 1 that are examined as controls in order to confirm the specificity of the observed contacts.</italic></p><p>This is a good point. We have done the requested specificity control already in a previous study where we inserted Bpa residues at different sites into the ISWI ATPase domain, including into Lobe 1. None of the positions formed crosslinks to the ISWI NTR. The NTR-Lobe2 interaction therefore appears to be specific to the region in the vicinity of H483. We have made the following changes to the text:</p><p>Subsection “The NTR contacts Lobe 2 of the ATPase domain”: “In our previous work, we incorporated Bpa in a variety of places on Lobes 1 and 2 of the ATPase domain but never observed crosslinks to the NTR (Forne et al., 2012 and Mueller-Planitz, 2015). We therefore suggest that the ppHSA motif specifically docked to a location in proximity of amino acid 483 in Lobe 2.”</p><p>Of note, all our crosslinks between Lobe 2 and the NTR are fully consistent with a recent structure that came out during the revision of this manuscript (Yan et al., 2016). Thus, our crosslinking data and the crystal structure mutually validate each other.</p><p><italic>The choice of protein constructs was somewhat curious and varied. The authors start with ISWI from Drosophila that contains most of the full length ISWI including the HSS tail, but then revert to one missing the HSS region. And then a third variation is using the human SNF2H when doing the chemical crosslinking with BS3. All of these variations are most likely going to matter. I think it is important for the authors to do all the experiments with the ISWI construct containing the HSS region, because the HSS region is very likely to matter in this regard.</italic></p><p>The reviewer makes the point that we should use ISWI that includes the HSS domain for all experimental approaches. Maybe we were a bit unclear about this, but we did. The yeast Isw1 experiments included the HSS domain, as did the NTR mutants that we created in <italic>Drosophila</italic> ISWI. Also the crosslinking experiments using benzophenone-labeled nucleosomes and ISWI<sub>H483B</sub>included the HSS domain.</p><p>In addition, we chose to support selected conclusions with independent data that were obtained with HSS-deleted ISWI (crosslinking of ISWI<sub>△HSS</sub> to a BPA-containing H4 tail peptide and crosslinking of a ISWI<sub>H483B, △HSS</sub> double mutant). Importantly, results from these experiments merely supported the evidence collected already with full-length ISWI so that none of our conclusions rest on results obtained with ISWI<sub>△HSS</sub>.</p><p>The reviewer seems to also suggest that we should focus on <italic>Drosophila</italic> ISWI and not include the human homolog SNF2H. Again, we included SNF2H only to support data that we obtained already for ISWI. None of the conclusions rest on the use of SNF2H. The one place where we used both ISWI and SNF2H was crosslinking to benzophenone-labeled nucleosomes. Importantly, we could map crosslinks to Lobe 2 for both enzymes. We do feel that inclusion of the SNF2H results strengthens the conclusion that the H4 tail binds Lobe 2 and therefore would like to include them in the manuscript.</p><p><italic>The other point of the paper is the ppHSA motif stabilizes the interactions of the NTR, however this does not seem to be well supported. The authors examine recombinant constructs of ISWI with serial truncations from the N-terminus. They examined the stabilities of these proteins using differential scanning fluorimetry and concluded the deletion of the extreme N-terminus containing the ppHSA motif is less stable than the full length ISWI. The data however shows that the truncated proteins are more complex that full length ISWI and did not give a simple one curve. Indeed there seems to be components within the sample that may actually be more stable than full length. The purity of these proteins as visualized by SDS-PAGE analysis are not very high and could lead to the complicated scan of these truncated proteins. The author average all this together to give them a lower thermal stability for the truncated constructs and is misleading.</italic></p><p>We agree and took out the supplemental figure altogether because we think that we can support structural destabilization of NTR mutants better otherwise: all NTR mutants proved exceedingly difficult to purify and we had to screen through a variety of different purification strategies for each of them, suggesting that they are misfolded and easily aggregate. The following changes to the text were made:</p><p>Subsection “The ppHSA motif does not substantially contribute to catalysis”: “Although ISWI variants carrying mutations or deletions in the NTR generally expressed well, we failed to purify them using standard protocols. For each ISWI variant, we screened through a variety of expression and purification strategies to improve the yield of soluble protein. The strategies that we employed included fusion to solubility tags (Z2, GB1, NusA, TrxA), fusion to or co-expression of chaperones (trigger factor, GroES/GroEL, DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE) and inclusion of protease sites (3C) at three locations in the NTR to cleave off parts of the N-terminus after purification. The strategies that proved successful are summarized schematically in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>.”</p><p><italic>The also conclude that the ppHSA motif dies not contribute to the regulation of the activity of ISWI; however they see a 3.6 fold reduction when this motif is removed.

Please note, however, the ppHSA motif relative to AcidicN seems to play at most a modest role for catalysis.</p><p>Subsection “The ppHSA motif does not substantially contribute to catalysis”: “In conclusion, ATPase and remodeling data suggested that both ppHSA and AT-hook are not absolutely required for catalysis in vitro.
