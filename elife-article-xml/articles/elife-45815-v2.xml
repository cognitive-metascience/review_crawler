Initially, the Par proteins aPKC and Bazooka form discrete foci at the apical cortex. Foci grow into patches that together comprise a discontinuous, unorganized structure. Coordinated cortical flows that begin near metaphase and are dependent on the actin cytoskeleton rapidly transform the patches into a highly organized apical cap. At anaphase onset, the cap disassembles as the cortical flow reverses direction toward the emerging cleavage furrow.

Cortical polarization during mitosis allows fate determinant containing cortical domains to be separated by the cleavage furrow during cytokinesis. Following division, fate determinant segregation causes one daughter cell to retain the neuroblast fate and to undergo further asymmetric divisions, while the other takes on a differentiated fate to populate the central nervous system. The catalytic activity of atypical Protein Kinase C (aPKC), a component of the animal cell polarity Par complex, is central to this process, and must be localized to the neuroblast’s apical cortex during mitosis. Phosphorylation of neuronal fate determinants displaces them from the membrane, ensuring that they are restricted to the basal cortex to be segregated into the differentiating daughter cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Atwood and Prehoda, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bailey and Prehoda, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Betschinger et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Lang and Munro, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Rolls et al., 2003</xref>). During each asymmetric neuroblast division, aPKC cycles between polarized and unpolarized states. Here we examine the dynamic processes that underlie aPKC polarization and depolarization during neuroblast asymmetric division cycles.</p><p>Neuroblasts begin asymmetric division with aPKC in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Hannaford et al., 2018</xref>). By metaphase, aPKC accumulates at a cortical domain around the apical pole where it directs the polarization of differentiation factors such as Miranda and Numb to the basal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Homem and Knoblich, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Knoblich, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Prehoda, 2009</xref>). Preferential targeting of aPKC to the apical cortex could explain neuroblast polarization, although little is known about how this process might occur. Furthermore, asymmetric targeting as a polarization mechanism contrasts with the dynamics of aPKC polarization in the early worm embryo in which aPKC is localized to both the anterior and posterior domains of the worm cortex before sperm entry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Lang and Munro, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Tabuse et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Wang et al., 2017</xref>). Directional transport from the posterior to anterior cortical domain (i.e. cortical flow), potentially through the activity of actomyosin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Munro et al., 2004</xref>), is thought to play a key role in the worm embryo. It has been unknown whether cortical flows play any role in aPKC polarization in neuroblasts. Furthermore, the nature of the aPKC cortical recruitment process has not been described.</p><p>Because neuroblasts repeatedly cycle between polarized (apical aPKC at metaphase) and unpolarized (interphase cytoplasmic aPKC) states, depolarization is a necessary step in the neuroblast polarity cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). However, little is known about the events that follow metaphase that regenerate the unpolarized state. These events may be especially important for asymmetric division because the localization of aPKC at metaphase is distant from the site of cleavage furrow formation in anaphase, the exclusion point for basal fate determinants. Understanding how metaphase polarity is disassembled may provide insight into the mechanism by which determinants are prevented from occupying the apical cortex that becomes the self-renewed neuroblast following division.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.45815.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The neuroblast polarity cycle is a dynamic, multistep process.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of the neuroblast polarity cycle.

Furthermore, we have examined the role of the actin cytoskeleton in neuroblast polarization and depolarization.

We simultaneously imaged an RFP fusion of Histone H2A (RFP-H2A) to assess the cell cycle stage. To identify as much of the dynamics of the neuroblast polarization process as possible, we imaged the process every 20 s or faster, the maximum acquisition frequency that yielded sufficient signal and little photobleaching. Furthermore, we collected optical sections throughout the full volume of the cell to visualize sections in the center along with those at the cortical edge and to allow for full three-dimensional projections at each time point. These data reveal a highly dynamic process that begins with aPKC in the cytoplasm as cells entered mitosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video1">Figure 1—video 1</xref>). Near the time when chromosome condensation became apparent, discrete aPKC foci appeared on the cortex, preferentially in apical hemisphere. We also observed aPKC foci in three dimensional projections of fixed, wild type prophase neuroblasts using an anti-aPKC antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Near metaphase, the aPKC cortical foci, which by then had grown into larger patches, moved toward the apical pole in a concerted fashion, coalescing into an ‘apical cap’, the metaphase neuroblast polarity state. The aPKC apical cap remained until shortly after anaphase onset at which point the cap disassembled by rapid spreading of cortical patches toward the contracting cleavage furrow. No aPKC signal was detected on the cortex of the basal ganglion mother cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video1">Figure 1—video 1</xref>). In addition, the cortical aPKC in the newborn neuroblast daughter rapidly dissipated into the cytoplasm at the end of mitosis. The overall polarity cycle, from the initial appearance of cortical foci to dissipation occurred in 28.8 ± 8.2 min (n = 20 neuroblasts from four larvae).</p><p>These data reveal previously unrecognized complexity in neuroblast polarization and depolarization processes. We speculate that previous studies failed to observe these dynamics because of their transient nature, and furthermore, the discontinuous nature of the cortical aPKC signal is less visible in central optical sections compared to those along the cortical edge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video1">Figure 1—video 1</xref>).

We observed the first small cortical foci in early prophase when chromosome condensation became apparent. Focus formation was heavily biased toward the apical cortical hemisphere (defined by the hemisphere opposite where the smaller ganglion mother cell eventually formed; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Over time the foci grew into patches, both by fusing with other foci and by the recruitment of additional aPKC from the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Patches generally remained near the location where they initially appeared, undergoing unbiased diffusive movements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,C,D</xref>). Although cortical targeting by focus formation occurred predominantly in the apical hemisphere, occasionally we observed foci in the basal hemisphere.

Approximately 90 s before NEB, the aPKC patches on the apical cortex, which had been undergoing uncoordinated, seemingly random movements along the cortex, began to move in a highly coordinated fashion toward the apical pole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2A,C</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video1">Figure 1—video 1</xref>). The coordinated movements transformed the broad, discontinuous network of patches into a continuous cap tightly focused around the apical pole. The cap formation process lasted approximately four minutes (3.9 ± 1.1 min; n = 20), measured from the point at which coordinated movement begins to when the continuous apical cap is formed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2C,D</xref>) with patches traveling a mean distance of 4.1 ± 1.8 µm at a mean velocity of 0.02 ± 0.01 µm/s (n = 12). We term the patch movements ‘cortical flow’ because they are coordinated, directional, and they occur at the cell periphery, which are characteristics of the motions that take place in the early worm embryo following fertilization when symmetrically cortical aPKC moves toward the anterior cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Munro et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Wang et al., 2017</xref>). Moreover, as described below, these movements require the actin cytoskeleton. Once the cap is formed it is very stable; we observed little change in aPKC localization over an approximately four-minute period that extended from shortly after nuclear envelope breakdown through metaphase (3.9 ± 0.9 min; n = 20).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Apical cap disassembly during anaphase causes aPKC spreading to the cleavage furrow</title><p>Shortly after the onset of anaphase, the apical cap underwent a dramatic disassembly event that coincided with the changes in cellular morphology that occur at the end of mitosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video1">Figure 1—video 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Connell et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Hickson et al., 2006</xref>).

Once treated with LatA, apical patches failed to undergo further growth and prophase treated neuroblasts nearly always failed to undergo coalescence into an apical cap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig4video2">Figure 4—video 2</xref>). Similar to interphase treated neuroblasts, aPKC polarity was lost by cortical spreading into the basal domain before metaphase. Interestingly, cortical patches present at the apical cortex before treatment ceased movement following LatA addition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B,C</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig4video1">Figure 4—videos 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig4video2">2</xref>) and did not spread into the basal domain, indicating that aPKC depolarization results from spreading of non-patch associated protein.</p><p>Neuroblasts treated with LatA near the time at which aPKC patches coalesce into an apical cap exhibited limited cap dissociation unlike in untreated neuroblasts where the aPKC cap dissociated into patches that rapidly spread to the cleavage furrow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig4video3">Figure 4—video 3</xref>). In metaphase treated neuroblasts, we observed some breakup of the cap, but most patches remained near the apical pole before dissipating. LatA treated cells also failed to undergo the morphological changes that normally occur during anaphase in which the apical membrane rapidly extends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Connell et al., 2011</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig4video3">Figure 4—video 3</xref>).</p><p>Together, these data indicate that the actin cytoskeleton participates in multiple phases of the neuroblast polarity cycle. First, while the actin cytoskeleton is not required for asymmetric recruitment to the apical cortex, it does play a key role in the discontinuous structure of foci and apical patches that normally form in prophase. Furthermore, the actin cytoskeleton is also required to retain aPKC at the apical cortex as LatA treatment causes aPKC to rapidly spread onto the basal cortex before metaphase, although aPKC that had been incorporated into patches did not appear to migrate into the basal domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig4video2">Figure 4—video 2</xref>). Finally, the rapid dynamics of the apical cap – both its formation via coalescence and its disassembly during anaphase – depend nearly completely on the presence of the actin cytoskeleton.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Actin-dependent cortical dynamics of the Par complex regulator Bazooka</title><p>The polarization of aPKC requires the activity of Bazooka (Baz; aka Par-3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Joberty et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Rolls et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Tabuse et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Wodarz et al., 2000</xref>).

At mitotic entry aPKC’s localization is exclusively cytoplasmic, and while Baz is also found in the cytoplasm during this phase of the cell cycle, we also observed a significant number of cortical puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig5video1">Figure 5—video 1</xref>).

In cells treated before metaphase, the appearance of Baz apical patches was reduced following treatment and those that did appear failed to coalesce in most cases, similar to LatA’s effect on aPKC dynamics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig6video1">Figure 6—videos 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig6video2">2</xref>). However, while LatA treatment induced spreading of apically enriched aPKC onto the basal cortex, apically recruited Baz remained predominantly in the apical hemisphere following treatment.

These data reveal that canonical neuroblast polarity, with the Par complex’s catalytic component aPKC tightly localized around the apical pole at metaphase, results from a multistep process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Initially, asymmetric recruitment to the apical cortex leads to a discontinuous structure composed of apical cortical patches. Coordinated cortical flows that begin late in prophase lead to coalescence of the patches into an apical cap. We also discovered a remarkably dynamic depolarization step following metaphase polarity in which the apical cap is broken up into cortical patches that spread to the cleavage furrow and ultimately dissipate back into the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). We examined the role of the actin cytoskeleton in the steps that make up the neuroblast polarity cycle and found that it is critical for several different aspects of polarization and depolarization.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.45815.021</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>The neuroblast polarity cycle.</title><p>The cycle begins with discontinuous patches of aPKC forming in the apical hemisphere via recruitment to the cortex from the cytoplasm. The aPKC cap observed in metaphase neuroblasts is formed from coordinated cortical flows that lead to coalescence of the discontinuous patches into a uniform structure tightly localized around the apical pole. During anaphase, the cap is disassembled leading to discontinuous spreading that extends to the cleavage furrow, followed by cortical dissipation back into the cytoplasm.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-45815-fig7-v2.tif"/></fig><p>In principle, cortical polarity could result from directional cortical flow of initially symmetric cortical molecules, or from asymmetric cortical targeting directly from the cytoplasm. In the early worm embryo, aPKC is initially symmetrically localized to evenly distributed cortical foci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Munro et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Wang et al., 2017</xref>). The cortical cue provided by sperm entry induces anterior directed flows that deplete aPKC foci from the posterior cortex and concentrate it in the anterior hemisphere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Rose and Gonczy, 2014</xref>). In contrast to the early worm embryo, neuroblasts begin their polarization cycle with cytoplasmic aPKC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) such that asymmetry in the cortical recruitment process could be sufficient for polarization. We observed that neuroblast polarity begins with asymmetric recruitment but that this process alone leads to a discontinuous polarized structure in the apical hemisphere. Coordinated cortical flows toward the apical pole that begin near metaphase and resemble the polarization of the early worm embryo, transform this unorganized structure into the tightly focused metaphase polarity state. Thus, neuroblast polarity results not from a single process, but from the stepwise activity of two very different cellular processes: asymmetric targeting and actin- dependent cortical flow.</p><p>Given that neuroblasts undergo repeated asymmetric divisions, the neuroblast polarity cycle also includes a depolarization step to regenerate cytoplasmic aPKC, the initial state in the cycle. Rather than directly returning to the cytoplasm from the apical cap, we observed a dramatic cap disassembly step that appears similar to the assembly step but in reverse: the cap breaks up into aPKC patches that move toward the basal rather than apical pole. We speculate that cap disassembly may play an especially important role in segregating fate determinants by extending aPKC fully along the cortex to the cleavage furrow, but not beyond. Cortical spreading of aPKC could provide a mechanism for ensuring basal fate determinants such as Miranda and Numb are completely excluded from the cortex that becomes part of the self-renewed neuroblast following cytokinesis. Is cap disassembly an active process? As it is initiated precisely when the dramatic morphologic changes in anaphase occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Connell et al., 2011</xref>), it may be that this step utilizes a passive mechanism, in which disassembly is driven by the mechanical stresses that the cortex undergoes during this step of the cell cycle.</p><p>The cycle we have identified here represents a new framework for understanding the mechanisms that regulate neuroblast polarity. We have begun to utilize this framework to examine the role the actin cytoskeleton plays in the polarity cycle. While the actin cytoskeleton has been known to be required for metaphase polarity for some time with normally apical proteins such as Inscuteable becoming fully cortical at metaphase when actin filaments are depolymerized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Broadus and Doe, 1997</xref>), its precise role has been unclear. Here we find that the fully cortical depolarized state can result from a polarized intermediate: in interphase treated neuroblasts aPKC is asymmetrically recruited during prophase but rapidly spreads onto the basal cortex. Thus, at least for aPKC, the actin cytoskeleton is not required for polarized cortical recruitment, but is instead necessary for retention at the apical cortex. Treatment of neuroblasts with LatA at various stages of the cell cycle also revealed that the coalescence of aPKC and Baz patches into a metaphase apical cap and cap disassembly both require an intact actin cytoskeleton. We suspect that the analysis of other perturbations in terms of the neuroblast polarity cycle, such as mutants of previously described polarity genes, will lead to new insight into the mechanisms by which animal cells become polarized.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type<break/> (species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Genetic reagent (<italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>)</td><td>aPKC-GFP</td><td>François Schweisguth Lab; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Besson et al., 2015</xref></td><td/><td>BAC encoded aPKC-GFP</td></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td>Baz-GFP</td><td>Carnegie Protein <break/>Trap Library; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Buszczak et al., 2007</xref></td><td/><td>protein trap line</td></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent <break/>(<italic>D. melanogaster)</italic></td><td>H2A-RFP</td><td>Bloomington Drosophila Stock Center</td><td>BDSC:23650; FLYB:FBst0023650; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/BDSC_23650">BDSC_23650</ext-link></td><td>FlyBase symbol: w[*]; P{w[+mC]=His2A-mRFP1}III.1</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>anti-aPKC (rabbit polyclonal)</td><td>Santa Cruz Biotechnology</td><td>Santa Cruz: C-20 (SC-216); <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2300359">AB_2300359</ext-link></td><td>(1:1000)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>anti-Baz (guinea pig polyclonal)</td><td>Chris Doe lab; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Siller et al., 2006</xref></td><td/><td>(1:1000)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>anti-phospho Histone H3 (rabbit polyclonal)</td><td>Millipore</td><td>Millipore:06–570; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_310177">AB_310177</ext-link></td><td>(1:2000)</td></tr><tr><td>antibody</td><td>Alexa 405- or 647- secondaries</td><td>Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories</td><td/><td>(1:500)</td></tr><tr><td>antibody</td><td>Alexa 488- secondary</td><td>Invitrogen, ThermoFisher Scientific</td><td/><td>(1:500)</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Fly strains and genetics</title><p><italic>Oregon R</italic> flies were used for examining the localization of fixed endogenous proteins.

Cortical patches were tracked through cap formation and cap dissociation using the Imaris Spots module. Tracking was restricted by an intensity threshold set by the average intensity of the apical cap in metaphase to help increase accuracy of the tracking algorithm. Smaller, lower intensity foci that grew into patches were tracked manually and their tracks were linked to that of the corresponding patches to construct a fully assembled, continuous track. Statistical data such as total patch displacement, mean square patch displacement, and relative speed between time points were collected from the final tracking result. Mean patch speed for cap assembly were calculated using a 160 s time window starting at the onset of cortical flow. Mean patch speed for cap disassembly was calculated using a 160 s time window starting at the onset of disassembly.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s5"

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Asymmetric recruitment and cortical flow drive the neuroblast polarity cycle&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Yukiko M Yamashita as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Utpal Banerjee as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has also agreed to reveal their identity: Hongyan Wang (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>In this manuscript, the authors present research that advances our understanding of how <italic>Drosophila</italic> neuroblasts divide asymmetrically by polarizing the Par proteins- aPKC and its upstream regulator Bazooka to the apical cortex during mitosis. Although these proteins have long been known to regulate cell polarization, the mechanisms by which this dynamic process takes place is not well understood. Using live imaging of endogenously expressed and GFP-tagged aPKC during its polarization in dividing <italic>Drosophila</italic> neuroblasts, it is shown to be recruited the apical cortex as clusters that individually accumulate aPKC and also coalesce into larger clusters. For formation of the metaphase apical crescent of aPKC, the clusters move apically in a concerted flow. After metaphase, the condensed apical crescent fragments into clusters that then move basally to the cytokinetic furrow that separates the neuroblast from the ganglion mother cell, and subsequently the clusters dissociate. By applying an inhibitor at distinct cell cycle stages, actin is shown to support aPKC cluster numbers but especially their apical flows and basal dispersions, but actin has a relatively minimal effect on apical cortical recruitment of non-clustered aPKC.

One reason we are excited about our findings is that they raise many questions about neuroblast polarity while at the same time providing a new framework for answering them. Along these lines, the reviewers suggested many worthwhile experiments and, as suggested by the editor, we have selected from among them those that would allow us to more fully support the overall conclusions. Our results and the concomitant additions to the manuscript are described in more detail below but the most significant additions are the use of a gene trap line for monitoring Baz localization when expressed from its endogenous promoter (replacing the UAS driven expression data from the original manuscript), and an analysis of LatA treatment on Baz localization. Furthermore, we have extensively edited the text and figures according to the reviewers’ comments and hope that the revised manuscript is more clear and accessible.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) The authors used BAC-encoded aPKC-GFP from the Schweisguth lab, but in the same paper that reported this stock the Schweisguth lab also reported BAC-encoded Baz-GFP.

We replaced the UAS-eYFP-Baz data with the data from this line. We noticed no differences in the localization dynamics of Baz between the two lines. We are not aware of a GFP-Par-6 line expressed from its endogenous promoter.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Although dual color live imaging for Baz and aPKC may be difficult, it would be important to confirm their relative localization patterns with fixed samples.

These data, included in the revised Figure 5, reveal many Baz and aPKC cortical patches that colocalize, but also some Baz patches that do not have a corresponding aPKC patch.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) F-actin depolymerization via LatA treatment at various stages caused aPKC foci to appear less frequently and prevented the retention of aPKC at the apical membrane.

Our analysis of LatA treated neuroblasts reveals that aPKC is initially recruited to the apical cortex but subsequently spreads into the basal domain to become uniformly cortical at metaphase. Broadus and Doe found that in central sections through latrunculin treated metaphase neuroblasts, the apical protein Inscuteable was uniformly cortical 82% of the time (see their Figure 4). Their analysis of fixed cells is consistent with ours from live imaging (assuming Inscuteable and aPKC behave similarly). For example, in our Figure 4A, the 5m20s column shows nearly completely uniformly cortical aPKC (this can be seen even better in Figure 4—video 1 as the cell cycle stage can also be assessed via the H2A signal). We believe the comparison of our results emphasizes the importance of analyzing neuroblast phenotypes by live imaging as it shows that the metaphase phenotype (uniformly cortical) results from depolarization of an earlier polarized state rather than direct recruitment to the entire cortex.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The localization dynamics of Baz resembled those of aPKC. Does F-actin depolymerization influence Baz dynamics similar to aPKC? Furthermore, the authors visualize a different pool of Baz puncta during interphase which do not participate in cap formation. It would be interesting to know what the function of this discrete pool is, possibly by a FRAP experiment.</p></disp-quote><p>We analyzed the effect of LatA treatment on Baz dynamics and report these results in the revised manuscript (new Figure 6, Figure 6—figure supplement 1, and associated videos). These results are very similar to the effect on aPKC’s dynamics, except that disruption of the actin cytoskeleton had less effect on the maintenance of Baz polarity as it did on aPKC (i.e. LatA caused aPKC to spread into the basal hemisphere whereas Baz didn’t spread following treatment). We agree with the reviewer that it would be useful to know if the interphase cortical puncta that Baz forms are important functionally, but until we know more about their physical nature we will not be able to selectively disrupt them.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Would be helpful to have a control panel with no LatA treatment in Figure 4.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an excellent suggestion. We have added comparison panels from untreated neuroblasts to both Figure 4 (LatA effect on aPKC dynamics) and the new Figure 6 (LatA effect on Baz dynamics). We believe this addition significantly improves the figure by making it much easier to see the effect of LatA addition.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Revisions to be addressed by textual modifications:</p><p>1) The writing needs to be improved.

We hope that the reviewers find the revision to be clear and accessible.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) I am somewhat puzzled by aPKC localization on the cortical side and center (Figure 1B) – hard to imagine how they can be continuous.

Not that I think the authors are wrong, but it would help readers in the field if the authors can explain why this was missed before. 3D cartoon representation might help.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a short explanation to the first Results section to address this important issue. We believe the discontinuous nature of the early cortical aPKC signal was not discovered until now for two reasons. First, the discontinuous phase of localization is short (approximately five minutes) so can only be seen when collecting data at high temporal resolution. Second, it is difficult to see discontinuous patches in optical sections through the center of the cell compared to those through the edge of the cell. This is most clearly seen by stepping through Figure 1—video 1 where the two views are side-by-side. For example, at the -300s time point, patches are clearly seen in the cortical projection, but are more difficult to see in the central projection.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The persistent interphase Baz puncta might be the result of the over-expression of the Baz-eYFP. A comment about this and other possible caveats of the over-expression should be added to the text.</p></disp-quote><p>As noted above, we have replaced the data from flies overexpressing Baz with that from a gene trap line.</p></body></sub-article></article>
