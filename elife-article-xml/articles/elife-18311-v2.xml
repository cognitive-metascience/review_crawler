and concomitantly allow the efficient translation of viral mRNAs. Here we use RNA-sequencing and ribosome profiling to explore the mechanisms that are being utilized by the Influenza A virus (IAV) to induce host shutoff. We show that viral transcripts are not preferentially translated and instead the decline in cellular protein synthesis is mediated by viral takeover on the mRNA pool. Our measurements also uncover strong variability in the levels of cellular transcripts reduction, revealing that short transcripts are less affected by IAV. Interestingly, these mRNAs that are refractory to IAV infection are enriched in cell maintenance processes such as oxidative phosphorylation. Furthermore, we show that the continuous oxidative phosphorylation activity is important for viral propagation. Our results advance our understanding of IAV-induced shutoff, and suggest a mechanism that facilitates the translation of genes with important housekeeping functions.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.18311.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.18311.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18311.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Proteins carry out diverse activities in our cells. These proteins are constantly being built according to accurate instructions, which are encoded on molecules named messenger RNAs (mRNAs for short). The process of converting the instructions into proteins is called translation.</p><p>Viruses infect host cells and take over the cellular machinery that is responsible for translation. This causes the cell to produce viral proteins at the expense of host proteins – a process called host shutoff. As a result, viral proteins take over the cell and the infection accelerates. There are two main strategies used by viruses to co-opt the cell’s translation machinery: either host mRNAs are destroyed, or the machines that read mRNA molecules are manipulated to read only the viral instructions. Most viruses appear to dedicate themselves to using just one of these strategies. However, evidence suggests that the Influenza A virus uses both strategies to induce host shutoff.</p><p>To investigate the extent to which each of the shutoff strategies is used by the Influenza A virus, Bercovich-Kinori, Tai et al. have studied infected human lung cells. This revealed that the virus primarily reduces the amount of host mRNA in the cells to take over the mRNA pool. The host mRNAs were affected by the infection to different extents. For example, the mRNAs that coded for proteins that perform important roles for the virus, such as produce energy, were not affected by the virus.</p><p>A future challenge is to find out exactly how the Influenza A virus distinguishes between different cellular mRNAs. This knowledge may help to develop new treatments for flu.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.18311.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.18311.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>virus infection</kwd><kwd>host shutoff</kwd><kwd>translation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004412</institution-id><institution>Human Frontier Science Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Career Development Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stern-Ginossar</surname><given-names>Noam</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003977</institution-id><institution>Israel Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1073/14</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stern-Ginossar</surname><given-names>Noam</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005386</institution-id><institution>Israeli Centers for Research Excellence</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1796/12</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stern-Ginossar</surname><given-names>Noam</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Starting grant, StG-2014-638142</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stern-Ginossar</surname><given-names>Noam</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000780</institution-id><institution>European Commission</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EU-FP7-PEOPLE</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stern-Ginossar</surname><given-names>Noam</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Mr. Ilan Gluzman</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stern-Ginossar</surname><given-names>Noam</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>During host shut-off caused by the Influenza A virus, cellular genes that play important housekeeping roles for the virus are still efficiently translated.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Influenza A viruses (IAV) are included among the Orthomyxoviridae family of negative single-stranded, segmented RNA viruses. These viruses cause an infectious disease that constitutes an important public health problem and remains today an important cause of morbidity and mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fields , 2007</xref>). Like all viruses, IAV is absolutely dependent on the host-cell protein synthesis machinery to produce its proteins. To ensure priority access to host translation machinery, many viruses utilize host shutoff mechanisms that eliminate competition from cellular transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Walsh et al., 2012</xref>). Host shutoff could be achieved by two complementary mechanisms: 1. Direct co-opting of the translation machinery by mechanisms that force better translation of viral mRNAs compared to their host counterparts. A classic example for this strategy is employed by poliovirus. It cleaves an essential host cap- binding protein, eIF4G, therefore preventing cap-dependent translation of host mRNAs while viral RNA translation stays unperturbed through the use of an internal ribosome entry site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ventoso et al., 1998</xref>). 2. Viral-induced degradation of host mRNAs. This strategy is employed by several herpesviruses that express endonucleases which cleave host mRNAs, thereby eliminating the competition with host mRNA for the translation apparatus and ensuring efficient cap-dependent translation of viral mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Glaunsinger and Ganem, 2006</xref>).</p><p>IAV has long been known to significantly shutoff host gene expression. Interestingly, it is one of the few viruses for which both direct translation co-opting and host mRNA degradation were suggested to play a prominent role in host shutoff (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yanguez and Nieto, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jagger et al., 2012</xref>). Although IAV mRNAs share the basic features with host mRNAs like a 5’ 7-methyl guanosine (m7G) cap and a 3’ poly-adenylate (poly(A)) tail, previous research suggested that influenza mRNAs are preferably translated due to features found in the 5’UTR of viral mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Garfinkel and Katze, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Katze et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Park and Katze, 1995</xref>). In addition host mRNA degradation has long been acknowledged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Beloso et al., 1992</xref>). The 5’ m7G caps on viral transcripts are acquired by “cap-snatching” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Plotch et al., 1981</xref>), this snatching allows the priming of viral mRNA synthesis but also leads to nascent host transcripts degradation. In addition, inhibition of polyadenylation of host pre-mRNA by IAV Nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nemeroff et al., 1998</xref>), and degradation of the host RNA polymerase II complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rodriguez and Pérez-González, 2007</xref>) could contribute to the reduction in host transcripts in infected cells. Recently, a highly conserved IAV protein PA-X, possessing the PA endonuclease domain, was shown to selectively degrade host mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jagger et al., 2012</xref>), strongly suggesting that PA-X is a general influenza host shutoff endonuclease.</p><p>Although the discovery of PA-X has prompted new examination of the mechanisms that drive host shutoff during IAV infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Khaperskyy and McCormick, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Khaperskyy et al., 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bavagnoli et al., 2015</xref>), several fundamental questions remain unanswered: (a) To what extent does IAV change host mRNAs expression and translation?, (b) what is the relative contribution of host mRNA degradation versus direct manipulation of translation to host shutoff? (c) to what extent does the virus possess mechanisms to ensure more effective translation of its own mRNAs?</p><p>Here, we took a systemic approach to explore the relative contribution of direct co-opting of the translation machinery, and reduction of host RNA levels to the reduction in host protein synthesis. To this end, we have used RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and ribosome profiling (deep sequencing of ribosomes-protected fragments) to globally map the changes in host genes RNA and translation levels during IAV infection. These comprehensive and simultaneous measurements complemented with Single molecule Fluorescence in-situ Hybridization (smFISH) revealed that host shutoff is mainly achieved by reduction in cellular mRNAs levels, and that IAV transcripts are not preferably translated. Our systematic analysis also reveals that host transcripts are affected differently by IAV infection and that the extent of mRNAs reduction is related to their length and GC content. Interestingly, we noticed that transcripts encoding oxidative phosphorylation related proteins are less affected by IAV infection, their protein levels remain stable throughout infection and their continuous expression supports the energetic demands that are essential for virus replication.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Simultaneous monitoring of RNA levels and translation during IAV infection</title><p>To gain a detailed view of the changes that occur in viral and host transcripts abundance and translation over the course of IAV infection, we infected A549 cells with the A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 H1N1 (PR8) strain at MOI = 5 and harvested cells at 2, 4, and 8 hr post infection (hpi). We designed our experiment to simultaneously monitor both RNA levels and translation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Deep sequencing of mRNA (RNA-seq) allows a detailed mapping of transcript levels during infection and these were paired with ribosome footprints, which allow accurate measurement of protein synthesis by capturing the overall in vivo distribution of ribosomes on a given message (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ingolia et al., 2011</xref>). In order to assess the reproducibility of our experiments we prepared two independent biological replicates for each of these time points. Both the mRNA and footprints read density measurements were reproducible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). We quantitatively assessed the expression pattern of 7211 human transcripts and the 8 viral transcripts that are expressed from the 8 genomic segments of influenza. Metagene analysis, in which gene profiles are aligned and then averaged, revealed the expected profiles of footprints along mRNAs; ribosome density accumulates along the gene body ending at the first in-frame stop codon with pronounced accumulation of ribosomes at the initiation and termination sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Unexpectedly, examination of the ribosome profiling data obtained from influenza transcripts revealed reads that align to the IAV minus strand (vRNA) that is non-coding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). These reads were not correlated with any sequence feature related to translation and were specific for the virus as individual human transcripts presented the expected profiles precluding any general problem in the sample preparation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). To test if the footprints we obtained from viral mRNAs indeed originate from the ribosome protected fragments we generated an additional set of ribosome profiling libraries in which cells were pre-treated with harringtonine, a drug which leads to a strong accumulation of ribosomes precisely at translation initiation sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ingolia et al., 2011</xref>). As expected harringtonine treatment led to strong accumulation of ribosome protected fragments at the first AUG and to the depletion of ribosome density from the body of the viral and host mRNAs. Thus, this indicates that the protected fragments we captured from both cellular and viral mRNAs originate from ribosome protected fragments of transcripts that were engaged in active translation elongation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B and D</xref>). In contrast, the protected fragments that mapped to the IAV minus strand were not affected by harringtonine treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>) indicating that the protection of these fragments is probably not mediated by translating ribosomes.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18311.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Ribosome profiling was performed along IAV infection.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Experiment set up of Ribosome profiling and RNA-seq along IAV infection.

In ribosome-profiling data, the overall size distribution of fragments derived from protein-coding sequences, differs from the lengths of contaminating fragments found in profiling samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ingolia et al., 2014</xref>). We used a fragment length organization similarity score (FLOSS) that measures the magnitude of disagreement between the footprints distribution on a given transcript and the footprints distribution on canonical CDS. As expected thousands of well-expressed protein-coding transcripts scored well, and the similarity improved with increasing read counts ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ingolia et al., 2014</xref>] and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). IAV mRNAs scored well in these matrixes and they did not differ from well-expressed human transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, blue). However, reads from IAV minus strand could be clearly distinguished from annotated coding sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, red). We conclude that the protected fragments originating from minus strand viral RNA are not generated by ribosome protection. These fragments could originate from protection by the viral nucleoprotein (NP) that associates with viral genomes and was shown to sediment with viral RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Duesberg, 1969</xref>). This possibility is supported by the observation that the numbers of protected reads originating from the IAV genome increases as the infection progresses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>IAV host shutoff is driven by reduced levels of host RNA but not reduced translation</title><p>In order to quantitatively evaluate if IAV evolved mechanisms to co-opt the cells' ribosomes we calculated the translation efficiency (TE) across our time course. TE is defined as the ratio of footprints to total mRNAs for a given gene and reflects how well a gene is being translated. We then compared the TE of human genes to that of viral genes at each of the time points along infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). The analysis shows that the viral genes translation efficiencies fall within the general range of host gene translation indicating that viral transcripts are not preferentially translated during IAV infection and that direct co-opting of the translation machinery does not play a dominant role in cellular gene shutoff. Instead, our systematic analysis demonstrates that host shutoff stems from the viral dominance over the mRNA pool. At 8 hpi viral mRNAs take over 53.8% of the translation activity in the cells as 57.3% of the mRNAs in the cells are viral (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).

We compared the expression of the infected samples to mock sample and clustered the mRNA and footprint ratios using partitioning clustering. This approach allowed clustering of the cellular transcripts into 4 distinct classes based on similarities in temporal expression profiles in the RNA-seq and ribosome profiling data. Overall, we found that changes in ribosome footprints tracked the changes in transcripts abundance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), which is in line with host protein synthesis shutoff being driven by the in reduction cellular RNA levels and not by direct interference with the translation machinery. Interestingly, although the majority of host transcripts were significantly reduced during influenza infection, (cluster 1 and cluster 4, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>) we identified numerous genes that were significantly elevated (cluster 2, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>) and genes that were not significantly changed during influenza infection (cluster 3, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>).</p><p>We next carried out GO term enrichment analysis for each of these four clusters.

Interestingly, cluster 1 which is composed of mRNAs that are most drastically downregulated is enriched with genes related to DNA repair and cell cycle (Pval = 1.7E-17 and Pval = 4.3E-18 respectively) whereas cellular mRNAs that are barely affected by IAV infection (cluster 3) are enriched with genes related to oxidative phosphorylation and for transcripts encoding ribosomal proteins (Pval = 3.4E-10 and Pval = 3.9E-8, respectively). These measurements and analysis reveal that the shutoff in host protein synthesis is mainly driven by reduction in cellular mRNA levels, and that host mRNAs sensitivity to influenza is not uniform and certain mRNAs are more resistant to viral interference.</p><p>One limitation of global deep-sequencing measurements is that these measurements provide relative but not absolute quantification of RNA and translation levels.

This analysis quantifies levels of ribosome occupancy higher or lower than those predicted from transcript abundance. In total, this approach allowed us to identify 210 cellular mRNAs that are differentially translated following IAV infection (Pval&lt;0.01, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Supplementary file 3</xref>). Among these, 125 genes were translationally upregulated whereas 85 genes were translationally down regulated. While Go enrichment analysis did not reveal any significant functional category, we noticed that within the group of translationally upregulated genes at 4 hpi, there was an enrichment for genes that were previously shown as translationally induced in conditions in which eukaryotic initiation factor 2α (eIF2α) is phosphorylated (pval&lt;0.002, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andreev et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sidrauski et al., 2015</xref>]). eIF2α phosphorylation is a stress response that reduces overall protein synthesis while enhancing the translation of specific transcripts whose products support adaptive stress responses. By performing western blot analysis, we show that at 4 hpi eIF2α phosphorylation is apparent and only at 8 hpi it is drastically reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). By analyzing polysome profiles prepared from uninfected and IAV infected cells at 4 hpi, we confirmed that IAV infection indeed induce the translation of UCP2 and RALGDS (two genes that are also translationally induced following stress induced eIF2α phosphorylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andreev et al., 2015</xref>]), but not that of control genes SOX4 and SF3B5 for which no change in translation was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Supplementary file 3</xref>). These results demonstrate that although IAV blocks eIF2α phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Goodman et al., 2007</xref>), at 4 hpi eIF2α phosphorylation affects the cellular translation.

To this end, we used the smFISH technique that enables visualization of single mRNA molecules in fixed cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Raj et al., 2008</xref>). This technique relies on the specific hybridization of short DNA libraries that are coupled to a fluorophore and are complementary to a specific target mRNA sequence. Binding of multiple probes to the same transcript yields a bright dot, indicative of a single mRNA molecule. This method has been used in various systems allowing accurate quantification of mRNA molecules per cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Itzkovitz, 2011</xref>).</p><p>We quantified the expression of four human mRNAs, two mRNAs that are significantly reduced during influenza infection (<italic>CHML</italic> and <italic>KIF18A</italic>, cluster 1) and two mRNAs that were less affected by infection (<italic>MYC</italic> and <italic>CDKN1B</italic>, cluster 3). We also tested the expression of one viral transcript, Hemagglutinin (<italic>HA</italic>). We designed a panel of fluorescently labeled probes, each composed of 48 20-base oligos complementary to the coding sequences of each of these genes. We used A549 cells that were left uninfected or IAV infected and then fixed at 2, 4, and 8 hpi. Hybridization of these cells with the fluorescently labeled probes libraries yielded bright diffraction-limited dots, representing single transcripts. These were automatically counted using a custom image-processing software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bahar Halpern, 2016</xref>). Importantly, when we examined <italic>HA</italic> expression in uninfected cells we did not detect any diffraction-limited dots demonstrating the specificity of this approach (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>).

The discovery of the highly conserved RNA endonuclease, PA-X, implied for the existence of cytoplasmic degradation machinery, since viral RNAses from other viruses were proposed to act in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abernathy, 2015</xref>). However, recent work presented evidence that PA-X activity might be restricted to the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Khaperskyy et al., 2016</xref>).

Hence, we were interested in the features differentiating between these cellular mRNA groups. If IAV interference with cellular transcript expression occurs mainly in the nucleus and there is no selectivity in this process then the decline in mRNA levels should be correlated with the cytoplasmic half-lives of mRNAs. Using recent measurements of mRNA half-lives in A549 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Maekawa et al., 2015</xref>) we identified a significant enrichment in mRNAs with long half-lives in cluster 3, which includes genes that were only mildly affected by IAV infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, Pval = 0.005), but this cluster contained also many genes with short half-life. These results suggest that there are additional features that govern the differences between these clusters, and that the differences in the levels of reduction might stem from differences in IAV-interference with host genes expression.</p><p>Since our measurements suggested that most of the IAV-mediated reduction occurs in the nucleus and a recent study connected PA-X activity to the 3’ end processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Khaperskyy et al., 2016</xref>), we tested whether the length of the poly-A tail affects the extent to which mRNAs are reduced after IAV infection. Using genome wide measurements of poly-A tail length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chang et al., 2014</xref>) we did not observe any significant differences between the different clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). We next examined specific characteristics of the corresponding transcripts, including their length and GC content. Interestingly, both mRNA length and GC content showed a significant difference between the clusters, and the transcripts that were less affected by IAV were significantly shorter and had higher GC content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E and 5F</xref>, Pval≤1.49e-63 and Pval≤3.636e-06, respectively). Since cluster 3 (composed of genes that were less affected by IAV) is also significantly enriched in transcripts related to oxidative phosphorylation and ribosomal proteins, and these functional categories are composed of genes that tend to be short (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>), we wanted to exclude the possibility that the reduced length we observed is indirectly driven by the enrichment in these functional categories. Indeed, also after omitting transcripts related to these functional categories cluster 3 transcripts were significantly shorter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). Taken together, these results strongly suggest that shorter and more structured transcripts (transcripts with higher GC content) tend to be less affected by IAV infection and therefore it is likely that the extent to which cellular mRNAs are degraded is at least partially governed by the quantity of exposed single stranded RNA in the nucleus.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>The oxidative phosphorylation capacity is maintained late in IAV infection</title><p>Host shutoff mechanisms clearly provide advantages for viruses as they hamper the cellular response to infection and limit competition for cellular ribosomes. However, dampening cellular gene expression also poses a big challenge, as viruses are fully dependent on cellular resources such as macromolecules’ building blocks, energy production and the host translational machinery. Therefore, the observation that transcripts coding for ribosomal and oxidative phosphorylation proteins, are less reduced following IAV infection, implies that the translation maintenance of these cellular pathways might be important for IAV infection. To validate this notion we conducted western blot analysis on cell extracts along IAV infection and could confirm the stable expression of components of the respiratory complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, upper panel), whereas other proteins were reduced following IAV infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, lower panel). In accordance with these results, by staining infected cells with the potential sensitive mitochondrial stain Tetramethylrhodamine (TMRM), we show that the mitochondria membrane potential is not affected by IAV infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Next we tested if continuous oxidative phosphorylation is important for IAV propagation by employing drugs that interfere with the function of the respiratory chain. We used either the ionophore Carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone (CCCP) or Valinomycin that chelates potassium ions, both causing a collapses of the mitochondria membrane potential. When cells were infected for 2 hr and then treated with CCCP or Valinomycin in concentrations that did not affect cell viability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>), IAV titers were significantly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C and D</xref>).

These results are consistent with the notion that NS1 is not required for the shutoff of host cell protein production(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Salvatore et al., 2002</xref>) and that PA-X endonuclease activity is a dominant factor in mediating host shutoff activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jagger et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Khaperskyy and McCormick , 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Khaperskyy et al., 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bavagnoli et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>It should be noted that at 8 hpi there is already extensive viral replication (evident from the strong increase in reads originating from the viral minus strand). Therefore, at this time point a portion of the viral RNA plus strand we measured are used as a template for replication (cRNA) and not as mRNAs. Since our calculation of viral transcripts TE is based on dividing the number of footprints by the number of corresponding RNA reads it is possible that we underestimate the TE of viral genes at this time point. However, using our smFISH measurements for viral transcript we could show that &gt;90% of the plus strand viral RNA is located in the cytoplasm. Therefore, this potential bias could result in a maximum of 10% effect that does not hamper our conclusions.</p><p>Previous studies demonstrated inhibition of eIF2a phosphorylation during influenza infection and it was proposed that this inhibition is mediated by the activation of the cellular inhibitor of PKR, P58-IPK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Goodman et al., 2007</xref>). Our analysis supports the observation that IAV infection inhibit eIF2a phosphorylation but we show that this inhibition is not immediate. In our experimental system eIF2a was phosphorylated at 4 hpi and this stress response affects the expression of cellular genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Since our measurements suggest the P58-IPK (DNAJC3) expression is reduced during IAV infection (by three-fold) it is possible that other mechanisms also contribute to the inhibition of eIF2a phosphorylation.</p><p>Due to library normalization, it is challenging to assess from the ribosome profiling and RNA-Seq measurements on overall virus-induced host shutoff. To address this inherent limitation, we used smFISH, which allows absolute quantification of transcript levels in single cells. Our smFISH measurements correlated well with our global RNA quantification confirming our data and findings. In addition, our smFISH measurements show that after IAV infection RNA levels of endogenous cellular transcripts are reduced to a similar extent in the nucleus and the cytoplasm. This observation suggests that cellular mRNAs degradation occurs in the nucleus but it could also be explained by blockage of transcription in conjunction to cytoplasmic degradation that reduces cytoplasmic mRNA levels. The recent observation that PA-X activity is mostly nuclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Khaperskyy et al., 2016</xref>) together with limited correlation with a cytoplasmic half-life strongly points to the former possibility.</p><p>Our analysis also allowed us to quantify the reduction in cellular mRNAs along IAV infection, revealing that the extent of reduction varies between different transcripts. The magnitude of reduction could only be partially explained by cytoplasmic half-life and interestingly the extent of reduction was significantly correlated with transcript’s length and GC content. Since cap-snatching activity was shown to target mostly small nuclear RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Koppstein et al., 2015</xref>), it is likely that the majority of the observed differential reduction in cellular mRNAs is driven by PA-X degradation activity. Therefore, the relation to the length and GC content strongly points to a non-selective process of degradation, where the chances of a transcript to be degraded are influenced by the quantity of exposed ssRNA. This notion is consistent with existing in-vitro data showing PA-X preference to ssRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bavagnoli et al., 2015</xref>) and with the findings that PA-X lacks obvious sequence or location specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Khaperskyy et al., 2016</xref>). However, the notion that IAV induced degradation significantly depends on the length of the transcript does not easily reconcile with the evidence that PA-X specifically targets Pol II transcripts and that this specificity is connected to 3’ end processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Khaperskyy et al., 2016</xref>). One way these results could be rationalized is if Pol II transcription and processing is physically limited to specific sub-nuclear compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mitchell, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ghamari et al., 2013</xref>). In this case, the specificity of PA-X to Pol II transcripts could originate from physical proximity, while the recognition itself could be random and depends on the length and GC content, which will govern the amount of exposed ssRNA. Another possibility is that degradation activity is coupled to mRNA splicing. This can explain the specificity to Pol II transcripts and the relative resistance of short transcripts which intrinsically also tend to have less exons. However, this possibility seems less favorable as at least by over expression PA-X did not affect the expression of cellular nascent transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Khaperskyy et al., 2016</xref>). Future work focused on PA-X activity can help shed light on the exact mechanism.</p><p>Host shutoff is a common phenomenon, employed by diverse viruses and it is thought to contribute to the viral progression in two main ways: by redirecting the translation machinery towards viral gene expression and by inhibiting cellular anti-viral responses. However, shutting off cellular protein production could also have adverse effects. Viruses are completely dependent on cellular resources and inhibiting cellular protein production can dampen processes that are indispensable for the virus. Interestingly, we noticed that transcripts that are less affected by IAV infection are enriched for genes involved in pathways that the virus potentially depends on, such as oxidative phosphorylation components and ribosomal proteins. In contrast, genes that were most significantly reduced are related to cell cycle, a cellular activity that is often blocked by viruses. Indeed, we were able to show that the levels of mitochondrial proteins are not affected by IAV even at 16 hpi, a time point in which other proteins were reduced. Further experiments demonstrated that inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation to levels that do not affect cell’s viability severely impairs viral replication. These results suggest that continuous expression of proteins involved in oxidative phosphorylation is important for viral propagation. Since viruses mostly interfere with protein synthesis, the level of protein reduction during infection is also tightly connected to the half-life of these proteins. In this regard, the observation that many of the proteins that perform basic cellular functions like translation and cellular respiration have long half-lives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Schwanhausser et al., 2011</xref>) could also assist viruses to avoid detrimental damage from shutting-off cellular protein synthesis. The inherent difficulties in blocking host protein production should be common to other viruses inducing host shutoff, particularly viruses with long infection cycle. It will therefore be interesting to see whether other viruses that interfere with cellular protein synthesis will also do this in a differential manner, facilitating the maintenance of cellular functions that are important for viral propagation.</p><p>It is well acknowledged that ribosome profiling is an emerging technique that allows probing of translation systematically and with increased sensitivity. This method in conjunction with RNA-seq was previously used to map the changes that occur in host gene expression during herpes simplex virus and cytomegalovirus infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rutkowski et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tirosh et al., 2015</xref>) and to probe the complexity of several viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Stern-Ginossar et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arias et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Irigoyen et al., 2016</xref>). Here we show how these methods in conjunction with smFISH could be used to accurately quantify host shutoff along viral infection. These unbiased and systematic quantification methods can advance our understanding of viral interference with host protein production and are applicable to infection with any virus.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cells and viruses</title><p>The cells used in this study were the human lung adenocarcinoma epithelial cell line A549.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen Wenhui Li as the Senior Editor.

Significantly, they elegantly show that the potent suppression of host protein synthesis observed in IAV-infected cells does not result from preferentially IAV mRNA translation. Instead, declining host protein synthesis reflects virus-induced alterations to the composition of the underlying infected cell mRNA pool where viral mRNAs become the predominate species. For the first time, the variable impact of IAV infection on the host mRNA population is revealed and host transcripts able to sustain translation in IAV-infected cells are identified. Host transcripts that were less affected by IAV infection were significantly shorter in length and had higher GC content. Furthermore, IAV infection stimulated translation of host mRNAs responsive to eIF2α phosphorylation, which reduces overall protein synthesis while enhancing translation of specific transcripts whose products support adaptive stress responses. In particular, host mRNAs refractory to IAV-induced host shut off are involved in cell maintenance processes such as oxidative phosphorylation, which the authors show is continuously required throughout the viral replication program for optimal viral genome replication. This work is important to our understanding of virus-host interactions in IAV-infected cells not only because it addresses a fundamental biological problem, but also as it conclusively overturns incorrect ideas in the older literature that proclaimed preferential translation of IAV mRNAs (often without the rigorous evidence to warrant such a conclusion). The experiments are superbly and expertly executed, the data are clearly presented and the manuscript is well written.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) It is desirable to illustrate the occurrence of &quot;host shut off&quot; in their particular system by pulse-labeling of proteins with [<sup>35</sup>]-Met at different times after infection followed by SDS-PAGE.</p><p>2) Detection of reads that align to the IAV minus strand RNA is puzzling. The authors speculate that these RNA fragments are not generated by translating ribosomes but are due to the formation of viral nucleoprotein particles. Could they prove this using puromycin (which dissociates polysomes but not RNP)?</p><p>3) Goodman et al., 2007 as referenced used mouse cells in their study of eIF2α phosphorylation in IAV-infected cells. This work by Kino et al. utilizes human A549 lung carcinoma cells. Isn't it possible that the capacity of these different cells (human transformed, tumorigenic vs mouse non-transformed, non-tumorigenic MEFs) might vary in their capacity to buffer against accumulation of phospho-eIF2α? The authors should consider blotting for total and phosphor eIF2α in IAV infected A549 cells under the experimental conditions utilized herein to verify that they can or cannot detect changes in phospho-eIF2α abundance.</p><p>4) Were any signatures of the integrated stress response or unfolded protein response (UPR) noted among eIF2α phosphorylation-responsive genes? Also --activation of host p58 IPK has been proposed to prevent accumulation of phospho-eIF2α in IAV infected cells. Were any changes in the abundance of the cellular p58-IPK noted in the overall infected cell mRNA population and/or in ribosome-protected fragments? The authors might consider mentioning these examples specifically at some point in the text or discussion regardless of the findings given the attention they have received in the earlier literature</p><p>5) In the Results, subsection “Cellular transcripts reduction along IAV injectionis correlated with transcripts’ length and GC content”, the authors conclude that the shorter, more GC rich host mRNAs, are less effected by IAV infection. The authors might wish to include one or two sentences in the Discussion section addressing why this is the case. For example, could this reflect the substrate specificity of endo PA-X or cap-stealing enzymes or some other mechanism?</p><p>6) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>. The authors refer to a significant reduction in IAV &quot;titers.&quot; The term &quot;titer&quot; usually refers to infectious virus units – here genome copy number is being measured. Granted that while genome copy number most certainly has some relationship to infectious virus production and pfu, it is not clear how a 5-fold reduction in genome copy number impacts titer. Probably the simplest solution is to just change the wording here to better reflect what is actually being measured experimentally.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18311.021</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p> <italic>1) It is desirable to illustrate the occurrence of &quot;host shut off&quot; in their particular system by pulse-labeling of proteins with [<sup>35</sup>S]-Met at different times after infection followed by SDS-PAGE.</italic> </p><p>As was suggested by the reviewers, we now performed metabolic labeling along IAV infection and we establish that our system recapitulates previous observations about host-induced shutoff during IAV infection. These experiments demonstrate that similar to previous reports, IAV infection results in massive production of virus polypeptides from 4 hpi and this is accompanied by reduced background in cellular protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>)</p><p> <italic>2) Detection of reads that align to the IAV minus strand RNA is puzzling. The authors speculate that these RNA fragments are not generated by translating ribosomes but are due to the formation of viral nucleoprotein particles. Could they prove this using puromycin (which dissociates polysomes but not RNP)?</italic> </p><p>The translation inhibitor, harringtonine, immobilizes ribosomes immediately after translation initiation but does not affect elongating ribosomes (Fresno, M., Jimenez, A. &amp; Vazquez, D. Eur J Biochem 72, 1977). Therefore, a 5-minute pre-treatment with harringtonine leads to strong accumulation of ribosomes at translation initiation sites but also generate the depletion of ribosomes over the body of the message (Ingolia, N. T., Lareau, L. F. &amp; Weissman, J. S. Cell, 2011). This property of polysome run off, which is similar in concept to using puromycin, makes it possible to use the harringtonine pre-treated samples to assess if the reads we mapped from the IAV minus strand originate from translating ribosomes.</p><p>As expected 5 min pre-treatment with harringtonine led to a strong accumulation of ribosome protected fragments at the first AUG and to depletion of ribosome density from the body of viral mRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). In contrast, the protected fragments that mapped to the IAV minus strand were not affected by harringtonine pre-treatment. This point is now illustrated for individual gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, light blue) and in a new metagene analysis that demonstrates no difference in the protected fragments distribution on the viral minus strand following pre-treatment with harringtonine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). This data together with the analysis of the size distribution of the protected fragments (FLOSS analysis/ <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>) strongly suggests that the protected fragments originating from minus strand viral RNA are not generated by ribosome protection.</p><p> <italic>3) Goodman et al., 2007 as referenced used mouse cells in their study of eIF2α phosphorylation in IAV-infected cells.

The authors should consider blotting for total and phosphor eIF2α in IAV infected A549 cells under the experimental conditions utilized herein to verify that they can or cannot detect changes in phospho-eIF2α abundance.</italic> </p><p>As was requested by the reviewers we now added western blot analysis demonstrating that eIF2α is phosphorylated at 4hpi but that this phosphorylation is transient and at 8hpi it is drastically reduced. These measurements align well with our translation efficiency measurements and supports the notion that IAV blocks eIF2α phosphorylation.</p><p> <italic>4) Were any signatures of the integrated stress response or unfolded protein response (UPR) noted among eIF2α phosphorylation-responsive genes? Also --activation of host p58 IPK has been proposed to prevent accumulation of phospho-eIF2α in IAV infected cells.

The authors might consider mentioning these examples specifically at some point in the text or discussion regardless of the findings given the attention they have received in the earlier literature</italic> </p><p>P58-IPK is a cellular inhibitor of PKR and previous studies argued that it is activated at the post-translational level in response to influenza virus infection (Lee, T. G., Tomita, J., Hovanessian, A. G. &amp; Katze, M. G., J. Biol. Chem. 1992) and that its activation is responsible for the inhibition in eIF2α phosphorylation during influenza infection (Goodman, A. G. et al., J. Virol. 2007). Our new western blot analysis supports the observation that influenza virus blocks eIF2α phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). In our ribosome profiling measurements P58-IPK (DNAJC3) expression levels are reduced by 3-fold, but since our measurements are reporting on the level of translation (and not the levels of the protein) and previous reports suggested that P58-IPK activity is increased but not its expression, these results by themselves do not contradict or support the proposed model. We now discuss these points in our revised manuscript (third paragraph of Discussion).</p><p>With regards to general UPR induction, although there is significant overlap between genes that were upregulated at 4hpi and two recent publications that mapped genes that are up regulated following induction of eIF2α phosphorylation (Andreev, D. E. et al., elife 2015 and Sidrauski, C., McGeachy, A. M., Ingolia, N. T. &amp; Walter, P. elife 4 2015), we do not see specific enrichment in UPR genes in the genes that were translationally induced after infection.</p><p><italic>5) In the Results, subsection “Cellular transcripts reduction along IAV injectionis correlated with transcripts’ length and GC content”, the authors conclude that the shorter, more GC rich host mRNAs, are less effected by IAV infection. The authors might wish to include one or two sentences in the Discussion section addressing why this is the case. For example, could this reflect the substrate specificity of endo PA-X or cap-stealing enzymes or some other mechanism?</italic></p><p>We now discuss these points in the Discussion:</p><p>“The magnitude of reduction could only be partially explained by cytoplasmic half-life and interestingly the extent of reduction was significantly correlated with transcript’s length and GC content. […] This notion is consistent with existing In-vitro data showing PA-X preference to ssRNA (Bavagnoli et al., 2015) and with the findings that PA-X lacks obvious sequence or location specificity (Khaperskyy et al., 2016).”</p><p><italic>6) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>. The authors refer to a significant reduction in IAV &quot;titers.&quot; The term &quot;titer&quot; usually refers to infectious virus units – here genome copy number is being measured. Granted that while genome copy number most certainly has some relationship to infectious virus production and pfu, it is not clear how a 5-fold reduction in genome copy number impacts titer. Probably the simplest solution is to just change the wording here to better reflect what is actually being measured experimentally.</italic></p><p>We thank the reviewer for noticing this error. We revised the text and for completeness we added new data from plaque assay that shows we also obtained reduction in viral titers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>).</p></body></sub-article></article>
