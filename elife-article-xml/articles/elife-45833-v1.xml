multi-host systems is difficult, as exemplified in bovine tuberculosis (bTB) systems, but is crucial for control. The agent of bTB, <italic>Mycobacterium bovis</italic>, persists in cattle populations worldwide, often where potential wildlife reservoirs exist. However, the relative contribution of different host species to bTB persistence is generally unknown. In Britain, the role of badgers in infection persistence in cattle is highly contentious, despite decades of research and control efforts. We applied Bayesian phylogenetic and machine-learning approaches to bacterial genome data to quantify the roles of badgers and cattle in <italic>M. bovis</italic> infection dynamics in the presence of data biases. Our results suggest that transmission occurs more frequently from badgers to cattle than <italic>vice versa</italic> (10.4x in the most likely model) and that within-species transmission occurs at higher rates than between-species transmission for both. If representative, our results suggest that control operations should target both cattle and badgers.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Disease-causing microbes that infect more than one type of animal can be difficult to control. This is especially true when they infect wildlife. For example, <italic>Mycobacterium bovis</italic> is a bacterium that causes tuberculosis in tens of thousands of cattle in Britain every year and also infects badgers and other wildlife. Controlling the infections in cattle is essential, as it helps prevent the bacteria from infecting humans, improves cattle welfare and reduces the substantial costs to the livestock industry.</p><p>Analysing the relatedness of <italic>M. bovis</italic> genomes from infected cattle and badgers may help scientists work out how often badgers infect cattle and vice versa. Scientists have collected data and <italic>M. bovis</italic> samples from infected badgers in Woodchester Park, in England, for over three decades. Using these data and additional information about <italic>M. bovis</italic> infecting nearby cattle may help scientists learn how the bacteria spreads and how to stop it.</p><p>Now, Crispell et al. show that complex patterns of contact between cattle and badgers likely drive the persistence of tuberculosis in cattle, also known as bovine tuberculosis. In three separate analyses, Crispell et al. compared the genomes of <italic>M. bovis</italic> found in cattle and badgers, the animals' locations, when they were infected, and whether they could have been in contact. The analyses found that <italic>M. bovis</italic> was likely to have been transmitted more frequently from badgers to cattle rather than from cattle to badgers. They also showed that transmission within each species happened more often than transmission between species.</p><p>If these results are confirmed by other studies, they may help scientists develop better strategies for controlling tuberculosis in British cattle. In particular, controversial control strategies – such as badger culls – could be more targeted to better combat tuberculosis in cattle but have less of an impact on badgers. These insights might also aid control efforts in other countries where bovine tuberculosis is a problem and an important source of human tuberculosis.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>Mycobacterium bovis</italic></kwd><kwd>whole genome sequencing</kwd><kwd>bovine tuberculosis</kwd><kwd>cattle</kwd><kwd>badger</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001602</institution-id><institution>Science Foundation Ireland</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>16/BBSRC/3390</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Crispell</surname><given-names>Joseph</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>714 101237/Z/13/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wilson</surname><given-names>Daniel J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BBS/E/D/20002173</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lycett</surname><given-names>Samantha J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/L010569/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Crispell</surname><given-names>Joseph</given-names></name><name><surname>Balaz</surname><given-names>Daniel</given-names></name><name><surname>Kao</surname><given-names>Rowland Raymond</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/L010569/2</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Balaz</surname><given-names>Daniel</given-names></name><name><surname>Kao</surname><given-names>Rowland Raymond</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>081696/Z/06/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kao</surname><given-names>Rowland Raymond</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund9"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/P010598/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lycett</surname><given-names>Samantha J</given-names></name><name><surname>Kao</surname><given-names>Rowland Raymond</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Analyses combining genomic and epidemiological data of <italic>Mycobacterium bovis</italic>, which causes bovine tuberculosis, revealed evidence of transmission within and between cattle and badger populations.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Control of a pathogen in a system where it can infect multiple species requires an understanding of the role of each host species in the infection dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Haydon et al., 2002</xref>).

On the islands of Britain and Ireland, the current evidence suggests that effective control of infection in cattle is hindered by transmission from an infected wildlife population – the European badger (<italic>Meles meles</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Godfray et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Although a considerable amount of research demonstrates an association between <italic>M. bovis</italic> found in sympatric cattle and badger populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Balseiro et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Goodchild et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Olea-Popelka et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Vial et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Woodroffe et al., 2005</xref>), quantification of the direction and extent of transmission remains elusive. Recent studies using whole genome sequences (WGS) have demonstrated a close genetic relationship among <italic>M. bovis</italic> isolates taken from sympatric cattle and wildlife populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Biek et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Glaser et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Patané et al., 2017</xref>). However, the low genomic variability of <italic>M. bovis</italic> and imbalanced sampling across host species has limited the ability to identify the direction of transmission. Evidence to date suggests that, even with access to pathogen sequence data, obtaining directional estimates of transmission might only be possible at the population level and will require dense targeted sampling and fine-grained epidemiological metadata (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kao et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kao et al., 2014</xref>), as has previously been demonstrated in investigations of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> outbreaks in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bryant et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gardy et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Guthrie et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Walker et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Walker et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Yang et al., 2017</xref>) and in tracing between cattle herds for outbreaks of <italic>M. bovis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Biek et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Salvador et al., 2019</xref>). However, these approaches have yet to be applied to situations where dense multi-host pathogen data are available.</p><p>Since the 1970s, a high-density naturally infected badger population at Woodchester Park in southwest England has been the subject of detailed study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Delahay et al., 2013</xref>). Both the resident badgers and sympatric cattle herds are frequently infected with <italic>M. bovis,</italic> providing the potential for inter-species transmission of infection to occur in either direction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">DEFRA, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Delahay et al., 2013</xref>). The data and samples associated with bTB occurrence in and around Woodchester Park are uniquely detailed, with individual-level host life history data and archived <italic>M. bovis</italic> isolates available for both the cattle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Orton et al., 2018</xref>) and badger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Delahay et al., 2013</xref>) populations. By combining WGS of selected cattle and badger isolates, with detailed local population data from this exceptionally in-depth study system, our work aimed to quantify the relative roles of the local badger and cattle populations in the spread and persistence of <italic>M. bovis</italic> in an endemic area.</p><p>Based on previous evidence of transmission between cattle and badgers, and the success of combining detailed tracing methods with WGS for <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>, our hypothesis is that <italic>M. bovis</italic> circulation in our endemic setting is not limited to a single maintenance host and that it involves bi-directional transmission between the two host populations. Our research aimed to test this hypothesis and to quantify transmission patterns by analysing the Woodchester Park data using a series of statistical and observational analyses linking pathogen genome data with diagnostic testing and population movement and demographic data for both cattle and badgers.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Selecting the isolates, generating and processing the sequencing data</title><p>Archived <italic>M. bovis</italic> isolates were available from 116 badgers and 189 cattle living in and around Woodchester Park.

For each of these models, metrics based on spatial and temporal distances were the most informative in explaining the variation in the genetic distances. Generally, as the temporal and spatial distances associated with the sampled animals decreased, the number of differences between the <italic>M. bovis</italic> genomes decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig5">Appendix 1—figures 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig6">6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig7">7</xref>).

For the within-species comparisons metrics, the network data were also highly informative. Generally, the number of differences between the genomes associated with a pair of animals of the same species decreased as the connectedness of their social groups (badgers) or herds (cattle) increased. The variation explained by the Random Forest models and the high ranking of spatial-, temporal-, and network-based metrics was robust to the presence of highly correlated or non-informative metrics and those with missing data (data not shown).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Inter-species clades identified in the phylogeny</title><p>The relatedness of <italic>M. bovis</italic> genomes sampled from the cattle and badgers was evaluated by constructing a phylogenetic tree (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) using RAxML (v8.2.11; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Stamatakis, 2014</xref>).

In addition, the presence of 16 cattle-derived sequences in clade 4, 15 of which were distant (up to 12 SNVs) from the clade root is consistent with multiple badger-to-cattle transmission events. In contrast, the presence of cattle-derived sequences close to the roots of clades 1–5 suggests that these lineages might have originated in cattle, although these patterns could also be explained by the cattle population being sampled up to 12 years prior to the badger population (cattle were sampled from 1988 to 2013 and badgers from 2000 to 2011). Although clades 1 and 5 contained highly similar sequences originating from cattle and badgers, each clade was associated with only eight animals, making meaningful inference of inter-species transmission patterns difficult.

In this manuscript, a badger or cow is considered ‘sampled’, if one of the <italic>M. bovis</italic> genomes analysed here was sourced from it. In-contact animals were defined as those that lived in the same herd (for cattle) or social group (for badgers) at the same time as one or more of the sampled animals, according to the available data. From the interrogations of the life history data, further evidence indicative of inter-species transmission and disease maintenance in the Woodchester Park badger population was identified for the animals associated with clade 4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>; equivalent figures for the remaining clades can be found in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplements 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">3,</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">4</xref>). Infection was detected in the majority of the sampled badgers before it was detected in the majority of the sampled cattle. Sampled badgers were present in Woodchester Park at least from 1993 until 2011, based on the available capture and sampling data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>). The sampled badgers were in contact with 575 captured badgers, 291 (51%) of which had tested positive for <italic>M. bovis</italic> infection at some point in their lives (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). In contrast, the sampled cattle were in contact with 1760 cattle, of which only 312 (18%) tested positive for <italic>M. bovis</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). In the animals associated with clade 4, infection was detected earlier in badgers, except in the case of one cow, despite the cattle population being sampled over a broader temporal and spatial window (see Materials and methods section: ‘Selecting the isolates’ for more details). In addition, the badgers were the most represented species in clade 4. These two observations suggest that the clade 4 lineage was being maintained in the badger population.

These further analyses should account for the temporal and spatial sampling biases resulting from the broader sampling window applied to the cattle population in time (1988 to 2013 versus 2000 to 2011) and space (cattle were sampled from up to 100 km away from the Woodchester Park area, whereas the badgers were only sampled from within Woodchester Park).</p><p>A series of analyses were conducted using the Bayesian Structured coalescent Approximation, or BASTA, package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">De Maio et al., 2018</xref>) available as part of Bayesian evolutionary analyses platform BEAST2 (Bayesian Evolutionary Analysis by Sampling Trees; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bouckaert et al., 2014</xref>). These analyses aimed to estimate the <italic>M. bovis</italic> inter-species transmission rates between the sampled badger and cattle populations. BASTA is capable of estimating evolutionary dynamics in a structured population and accounting for sampling biases. Here the sampled <italic>M. bovis</italic> population was structured as it was circulating largely separately in the sampled cattle and badger populations, as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and the strong population-specific epidemiological signatures found by the Random Forest and Boosted Regression analyses. In addition, further structure exists within the cattle and badger populations as these were subdivided into herds and social groups, respectively. A series of increasingly spatially structured population models were defined to determine whether the inter-species transmission rates estimated using BASTA were affected by the spatial patterns evident from the Random Forest and Boosted Regression analyses. Structured population models were also chosen to address the spatial sampling biases, by introducing an increasingly structured unsampled badger population. Previous analyses have used BASTA in a similar fashion to estimate evolutionary dynamics in the presence of unsampled populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">De Maio et al., 2015</xref>). To further reduce the influence of the spatial and temporal biases and the computational load, the BASTA analyses used a subset of the cattle- (n = 83) and badger-derived (n = 97) <italic>M. bovis</italic> sequences obtained between 1999 and 2014 within 10 km of Woodchester Park.</p><p>The AICM (Akaike’s Information Criterion Markov Chain Monte Carlo) score (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baele et al., 2013</xref>) was used to compare the BASTA analyses based on different structured populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). The structured population with two demes (<italic>M. bovis</italic> populations in badgers and cattle) had the best (lowest) AICM score, although there was considerable overlap with the bootstrapped AICM score interval for one of the four deme models (splitting the <italic>M. bovis</italic> populations in badgers and cattle into inner and outer populations based on being within or beyond 3.5 km from Woodchester Park [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>]). The estimated inter-species transition rates provided from each BASTA analysis demonstrated considerable variation, with some estimated cattle-to-badger transition rates bounding zero (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). The estimated transition rates can be considered equivalent to the transmission rates, because the states (between which the transition rates were estimated) considered here represented different species. The estimates of the inter-species transition rates from the two-deme model with the best AICM score support the existence of both badger-to-cattle transmission (0.045 times per lineage per year, lower 2.5%: 0.028, upper 97.5%: 0.069) and cattle-to-badger transmission (0.0044 times per lineage per year, lower 2.5%: 0.00021, upper 97.5%: 0.017). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref> shows the order of magnitude differences between the estimated inter-species transmission rates, with the highest supported two-deme model estimating that badger-to-cattle transmission events occurred on average 10.4 times more frequently than cattle-to-badger transmission events in the sample population. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref> represents the lower bound on the number of times (according to the analyses based on the favoured two-deme model) that the sampled <italic>M. bovis</italic> population was transmitted from one animal to another (regardless of sub-population and, where possible, assuming the ancestral node and one of its daughter nodes represent infection in the same animal [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>]). The estimated counts of these transmission events are consistent with the estimated inter-species transition rates and demonstrate that within-species transmission occurs at a higher rate. Specifically, badger-to-badger transmission was estimated to occur at least 2.7 times more frequently than badger-to-cattle transmission (lower 2.5%: 2.2, upper 97.5%: 3.8). In cattle, analyses estimated that at least 46 cattle-to-cattle transmission events occurred (lower 2.5%: 40, upper 97.5%: 56), whereas the estimated number of cattle-to-badger events bounded zero (lower 2.5%: 0, upper 97.5%: 4, with a median value of zero). The counts of events between individual animals outputted by BASTA represent the lower bound of the number of transmission events that occurred over the evolutionary history of the sampled <italic>M. bovis</italic> population because they are estimated on the transmission chains between the sampled and ancestral host animals and do not account for missing individuals in these chains.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Comparison of likelihood scores and inter-species transition rate estimates from the BASTA analyses.</title><p>Model structure is described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, and for each model the sizes of defined demes were held equal or allowed to vary.

Testing our hypothesis across multiple analyses, we found that, while none of these analyses are definitive in their own right, our results are consistent with our hypothesis and suggest that there has been a long history of within- and between-species transmission in the Woodchester Park area, and an important role for badgers in disease persistence.</p><p>Our choice of analytical methods was based in part on our awareness of underlying data biases. Ideally, sampling should be proportionate to prevalence in the host populations and matched over the same spatial and temporal ranges. Here, the combination of poor sensitivities of the standard tests for cattle (~50–80%; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">de la Rua-Domenech et al., 2006</xref>) and badgers (~50–70%; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chambers et al., 2009</xref>) and a reliance on historical archived isolates, meant data biases were unavoidable. Counterbalancing this weakness are the dense sampling of both host populations and the exceptionally detailed metadata.</p><p>Random Forest and Boosted Regression models identified strong epidemiological signatures of <italic>M. bovis</italic> transmission within and between host populations. Within species, metrics capturing the spatial, temporal, and network dynamics were all highly informative, indicative of <italic>M. bovis</italic> circulation being dependent on these factors. Between species, the variation observed between <italic>M. bovis</italic> sourced from cattle and badgers was found to be well explained by where the animals resided and when they were infected. Changes in these relationships could be exploited to rapidly identify changes in the epidemiology, as might be caused by badger social perturbation under culling operations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Tuyttens et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Woodroffe et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>The present study identified further evidence of within- and between-species transmission in the phylogenetic relationships between the <italic>M. bovis</italic> genomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Five clades containing highly similar <italic>M. bovis</italic> genomes derived from infected cattle and badgers were identified, suggesting that substantial inter-species transmission had occurred. The presence of clades dominated by a single host species was also consistent with sustained within-species transmission. However, these phylogenetic relationships are particularly sensitive to sampling biases and should be interpreted with caution. For example, one interpretation of the basal location of the cattle-derived <italic>M. bovis</italic> genomes in the clades shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> is that they originated in cattle. Alternatively, this pattern could be the result of sampling the cattle population over a broader temporal range (from 1988 to 2013) than the badgers (2000 to 2011).</p><p>Further interrogation of the cattle and badger life histories associated with clade 4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) revealed evidence of prolonged persistence of this lineage in the badger population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Despite the cattle population being sampled over a longer time period, the badgers associated with clade 4 were predominantly infected earlier than the cattle and that strain persisted in the badgers for over 10 years. The remaining clades examined suggested that cattle could have been infected before badgers; however, it was not possible to determine whether badgers outside of Woodchester Park could be driving these interactions. Our results do suggest that inter-badger transmission is likely to be dominated by short-range interactions, given that short spatial distances (all less than 3.7 km) were highly informative in describing the genetic relationships examined in the machine learning analyses. Therefore, badgers further away from Woodchester Park are unlikely to be directly driving the patterns observed in our sampled badger population, and the ‘invading’ clades observed here are more parsimoniously explained by introductions of <italic>M. bovis</italic> from cattle. An additional limitation of these analyses is that no other wildlife species were sampled. Previous research by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Delahay et al. (2007)</xref> found other mammal species infected with <italic>M. bovis</italic> in the area, albeit at lower prevalence (7.2% in Fallow deer and 6.8% in Muntjac deer) than the sampled badger population (~30%; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Delahay et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Given considerable evidence in the present study for inter-species transmission of <italic>M. bovis</italic>, we next used BASTA, an analysis platform that can account for sampling biases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">De Maio et al., 2018</xref>), to quantify these processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). The BASTA analyses estimated transition rates between demes within a structured population. As the demes within the structured model were species-specific, the estimated between-species transition rates can be considered equivalent to transmission rates between populations of badgers and cattle. The most favoured two-deme model estimated badgers-to-cattle transmission rates were, on average, 10.4 times higher than cattle-to-badgers transmission rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a and b</xref>). However, the second most favoured four-deme model (which included a more complex population structure) estimated that inter-species transmission rates were close to equal. Although even structured coalescent models do not accurately reflect spatial contact patterns, that the simplest ‘two-deme’ model is favoured is encouraging (i.e. more spatially structured models do not perform better). However, the two-deme model may also have been favoured because of the limited genetic diversity available to estimate the evolutionary parameters and therefore further exploration with explicitly spatial approaches is an important next step.</p><p>In the process of quantifying inter-species transmission rates, the BASTA analyses also provide counts of the number of transmission events within and between the sampled badgers and cattle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>). These counts provide a conservative estimate of the minimum number of transitions between the sampled animals and their ancestors. Although it is not appropriate to directly compare the counts within- and between-species, they do demonstrate that, at a minimum, within-species transmission occurs at least twice as frequently as between-species transmission. The high degree of within-species transmission estimated here is consistent both with the results of other studies that highlight the importance of cattle-to-cattle transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Costello et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gilbert et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Goodchild and Clifton-Hadley, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Green et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Menzies and Neill, 2000</xref>), and the persistent long-term infection observed in the Woodchester Park badger population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Delahay et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>The high-density badger population in Woodchester Park is likely to be similar to populations found in other parts of southwest England (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Judge et al., 2017</xref>). However, broader representativeness should be confirmed by comparison to sympatric cattle and badger populations elsewhere in Britain and Ireland, particularly in areas with high bTB incidence. In addition, we selected only isolates of spoligotype SB0263, as this was the dominant type in the badger population. The selection of SB0263 could artificially inflate the badgers-to-cattle transition rates estimated here, as the high prevalence of this spoligotype in the badgers could be a reflection of host preference. However, though there are known phenotypic differences between spoligotypes, there is no evidence that these fundamentally change the epidemiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Garbaccio et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Wright et al., 2013</xref>). In addition, many different <italic>M. bovis</italic> spoligotypes have been observed in sympatric badger and cattle populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Smith et al., 2003</xref>) and SB0263 is not only one of the most common spoligotypes in the UK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Smith et al., 2003</xref>), it is also highly prevalent in the cattle around Woodchester Park.</p><p>If the transmission interactions estimated in our research are replicated elsewhere, this could help to explain the failure of efforts to address recurrent and persistent infection in cattle herds that co-exist with badger populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gallagher et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Karolemeas et al., 2011</xref>). In addition, the bi-directional transmission of <italic>M. bovis</italic> between species has the potential to combine local persistence in badgers with the long-distance mobility of the cattle. In line with a recent evidence review (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Godfray et al., 2018</xref>), our research also suggests that coordinated bTB control in both cattle and badgers may be necessary to control infection in cattle. More generally, our analyses illustrate the complex interplay that underpins multi-host pathogen problems and demonstrate that, despite this complexity, appropriately defined suites of methods can be used to overcome issues of data biases and identify important epidemiological properties of these systems.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Analyses layout</title><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> describes the complete set of analyses conducted on the <italic>M. bovis</italic> whole genome sequences sourced from infected cattle and badgers living in and around Woodchester Park.

Social group territories are delineated annually using bait-marking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Delahay et al., 2000</xref>).

Cattle isolates were selected if they were of the same spoligotype as the badger isolates and were from herds within 10 km of Woodchester Park. More than 90% of the badger-derived isolates were spoligotype SB0263. More than 75% (1096/1442) of the isolates available from cattle within 10 km of Woodchester Park shared the same spoligotype and it is the second most common type found across England (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Smith et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Smith et al., 2006</xref>). To increase the chances of sequencing strains that were shared with the badgers in Woodchester Park, rather than circulating in the cattle population independently, only cattle-derived isolates of spoligotype SB0263 were selected. Additional spoligotype SB0263 isolates from cattle that lived in herds within 100 km of Woodchester Park (n = 65) were included to provide a broader spatio-temporal context, resulting in a total of 189 isolates.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Generating and processing the sequencing data</title><p>Badger-derived <italic>M. bovis</italic> isolates were prepared for sequencing by the Agri-Food and Biosciences Institute in Northern Ireland (AFBI-NI) and for the cattle-derived isolates by APHA. <italic>M. bovis</italic> isolates were selected from the frozen archives and re-cultured on Löwenstein-Jensen medium.

A heterozygous site was defined as one where the allele frequencies were &gt;0.05 and &lt;0.95. Four cattle-derived sequences that had more than 150 heterozygous sites, and allele frequencies that were clustered and non-random (data not shown), were removed.

For any site that failed these criteria, if the allele called had been observed in a different isolate that had passed, a second round of filtering was conducted using a high-quality base depth of 5 (total across forward and reverse reads) and the same allele support. As recombination is thought to be extremely rare for mycobacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Namouchi et al., 2012</xref>), variants in close proximity could indicate a region that is difficult to sequence or under high selection. To avoid calling variants in these regions, variant positions within 10 bp of one another were removed.

Inter-sequence genetic distances were calculated, for every pair of sequences, by dividing the number of differences present between the pair of sequences by the total number of sites considered (n = 14,987). In addition, epidemiological metrics were calculated to identify any similarities among animals associated with a particular pair of isolates. Epidemiological metrics were calculated using the data, where available, on each animal obtained from its capture or movement and testing history (further details in Appendix 1: Defining the epidemiological metrics). Two additional dummy metrics, samples from a uniform distribution and a Boolean distribution, were included to determine a threshold of importance that distinguishes noise from signal. Inter-isolate genetic distances and associated epidemiological metrics were compared using Random Forest (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_015718">SCR_015718</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Liaw and Wiener, 2002</xref>) regression and Boosted Regression (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_017301">SCR_017301</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Elith et al., 2008</xref>) models in R (v3.4.3; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">R Development Core Team, 2016</xref>). These machine learning approaches were used to separately analyse badger–badger, badger–cattle, and cattle–cattle comparisons. For each set of comparisons, a training dataset was constructed using 50% of the data available and, following training using these data, the model was tested on the remaining 50% of the data. Genetic distances ≤ 15 SNVs were used for these analyses to avoid larger inter-sequence distances that were not likely to relate to the fine resolution epidemiological relationships of interest.</p><p>Random Forest and Boosted Regression approaches were selected as these methods can deal with large datasets with many highly correlated variables whose relationship to the response variable (genetic distances) cannot readily be defined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Auret and Aldrich, 2012</xref>). A broad range of epidemiological metrics were defined as the Random Forest and Boosted Regression models are robust to non-informative and/or highly correlated variables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Auret and Aldrich, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Elith et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Liaw and Wiener, 2002</xref>).

For highly correlated variables, clusters of correlated variables were defined and the least informative variable from each cluster was incrementally removed and the impact on the fitted Random Forest regression models was examined. A similar approach was used twice more to evaluate the influence of retaining non-informative predictor variables and of including predictor variables with large amounts of missing data in the models.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Building phylogeny and interrogating clusters</title><p>Following investigation of population level epidemiological signatures in the sequence data, a phylogenetic tree was constructed to describe the evolutionary relationships among our set of <italic>M. bovis</italic> genome sequences.

For example, if <italic>M. bovis</italic> sequences sourced from cattle and badgers have a very close phylogenetic relationship, this suggests that inter-species transmission has occurred. The phylogeny was constructed with the maximum likelihood algorithm in RAxML (v8.2.11; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Stamatakis, 2014</xref>; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_006086">SCR_006086</ext-link>) using a GTR (generalized time reversible) substitution model with 100 bootstraps.

There were two biases associated with the set of sequences available. First, the prevalence of <italic>M. bovis</italic> in the sampled cattle and badger populations was likely to be different as a result of the on-going control operations in the cattle, therefore the sampling proportions of these different populations relative to the prevalence of <italic>M. bovis</italic> were likely to be unequal.

and epidemiological distances</title><sec id="s8-1"><title>Defining the epidemiological metrics</title><p>A series of epidemiological metrics (<xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table1">Appendix 1—table 1</xref>) were designed to capture how epidemiologically related a pair of sampled animals were. These metrics were compared to the inter-sequence genetic distances using Random Forest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Liaw and Wiener, 2002</xref>) and Boosted Regression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Elith et al., 2008</xref>) models. Three different analyses were conducted based on badger–badger, cattle–cattle, and badger–cattle comparisons. The metrics were defined based on the sampling times and locations, and the life histories of the sampled animals. Life history data for the sampled badgers included all capture event data; specifically, the capture date, the social group the badger was captured in, and the bTB status were used. The bTB status of badgers at a capture event was determined using bacteriological culture (from 1982), Brock Test ELISA (from 1982), gamma-IFN test (from 2006), and Stat-Pak test (from 2006) (tests are described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chambers et al., 2009</xref>). For the sampled cattle, the life histories were made up of the cattle movement data (stored in the Cattle Tracing System) and testing (stored in APHA’s cattle testing SAM database) histories. As part of the national TB surveillance program, cattle are tested using the Single Intradermal Comparative Cervical Tuberculin (SICCT) test and results are stored in the SAM database. For each sampled badger, its main social group was defined as the group in which it spent the majority of its recorded life, its sampled group was that in which it was captured when it was sampled, and its infected group was that in which it was captured when infection was first detected. For each sampled cow, the main and sampled herds were identified in a similar way. Weighted adjacency matrices were constructed counting the number of cattle/badgers that moved/dispersed between each herd/social group. Using these matrices, the shortest path lengths between herds or social groups were calculated using Dijkstra’s algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Dijkstra, 1959</xref>). The epidemiological metrics for comparing each pair of sampled animals were calculated using custom Java code (available <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/JosephCrispell/Java/blob/master/MyWork/src/woodchesterGeneticVsEpi/CompareIsolates.java">here</ext-link>). Random Forest and Boosted Regression models, within R, do not handle missing data explicitly, and so where it was not possible to calculate a metric because of insufficient data a ‘−1’ was inserted. The influence of missing data was investigated by sequentially removing metrics with the highest amounts of missing data. These analyses demonstrated little effect on the variation explained by the Random Forest models or the importance rankings of the metrics (data not shown). The nature of the epidemiological metrics meant that many were highly correlated. The influence of highly correlated metrics on the Random Forest regression models was investigated by sequentially removing metrics from highly correlated clusters. These analyses demonstrated minimal effects on the importance rankings of the epidemiological metrics (data not shown).</p><table-wrap id="app1table1" position="float"><label>Appendix 1—table

between preliminary phylogenetic data and the spoligotype (spacer-oligo type) data for the cattle- and badger-derived <italic>M. bovis</italic> sequences was manually examined. Spoligotyping reports the presence and absence of 43 known spacer sequences within a single direct repeat region of the <italic>M. bovis</italic> genome. The phylogenetic relationships of 26 badger- and 16 cattle-derived sequences were inconsistent with their spoligotype data, as they were phylogenetically dissimilar to sequences sharing their nominal spoligotype. These inconsistencies were indicative of mislabelling and therefore all the cattle- and badger-derived sequences were investigated to determine the extent and effect of any mislabelling present. As cattle- and badger-derived sequences were sourced from different archives of <italic>M. bovis</italic> (isolates held by APHA or the Animal and Plant Health Agency in Weybridge for cattle, and York for badgers), it was assumed that species identification was correct.</p><sec id="s9-1"><title>Badger isolates</title><p>Detailed epidemiological data describing the badger population in Woodchester Park were available. Each isolate was linked to a sampled badger via a unique identifier. Epidemiological metrics were created to summarise the spatial-, temporal-, and network-based relationships between the sampled badgers. Any mislabelled sequence would be associated with the incorrect badger. Potentially mislabelled isolates were identified as those where the variation in their genetic distances to all others was poorly explained by the available epidemiological data. The inter-sequence genetic distances were compared to the epidemiological metrics using a Random Forest regression model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Liaw and Wiener, 2002</xref>) and a Boosted Regression model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Elith et al., 2008</xref>), separately in R (v3.4.3; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">R Development Core Team, 2016</xref>).

As the proportion of the isolates shuffled increased the accuracy of the Random Forest model declined rapidly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1</xref>).

The spacer sequences present in each cattle-derived Whole Genome Sequence (WGS) were extracted and compared to a reference library of the 43 spacer sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Xia et al., 2016</xref>). The spoligotype information extracted from each <italic>M. bovis</italic> isolate’s WGS data was compared to the spoligotype originally assigned to the isolate from conventional typing. The spoligotype information did not match that assigned from the conventional typing for 16 cattle-derived sequences. In addition, these isolates were found to be genetically more similar to sequences sharing the spoligotype derived from the WGS data than to sequences sharing the recorded spoligotype. Therefore, the spoligotype information originally available for these 16 sequences was considered incorrect – either as a result of a typing mistake or through mislabelling. These cattle-derived <italic>M. bovis</italic> sequences were removed. As no other spoligotype-WGS data mismatches were observed, the extent of the mislabelling in the cattle-derived sequences was considered to be minimal. In addition, as the cattle archive included isolates across a broad range of spoligotypes, there was a high chance that mislabelling would result in a different spoligotype being assigned, and the low number of wrongly assigned spoligotypes therefore indicative of a limited mislabelling.</p></sec><sec id="s9-3"><title>Metric importance in Random Forest and Boosted Regression analyses</title><p>Comparisons between the genetic distances and associated epidemiological metrics were completed using Random Forest and Boosted Regression models in R. Two different machine learning approaches were used to ensure that measures of variable importance were robust to the analyses chosen. Genetic distances ≤ 15 SNVs were selected to avoid between-clade comparisons and their associated large genetic distances that are unlikely to relate to fine scale epidemiological relationships. The Random Forest (and Boosted Regression) models were able to explain approximately 67% (62%), 60% (54%) and 75% (70%) of the variation in the genetic distances associated with the badger–badger (n = 12,483), cattle–cattle (n = 1927), and badger–cattle (n = 4838) comparisons, respectively.

If the estimate for a particular parameter in a BASTA analysis is similar with and without the sequence alignment, there is insufficient information in the genetic data to estimate it. For each BASTA analysis, the posterior distributions for each parameter were considerably different in the presence and absence of the sequence alignment, suggesting that there were sufficient data available to estimate them.</p></sec></sec></boxed-text></app></app-group></back><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.45833.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Lipsitch</surname><given-names>Marc</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution>Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health</institution><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Gortazar</surname><given-names>Christian</given-names> </name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution>Instituto de Investigación en Recursos Cinegéticos IREC</institution><country>Spain</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text><p>In the interests of transparency, eLife publishes the most substantive revision requests and the accompanying author responses.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Combining genomics and epidemiology to analyse bi-directional transmission of <italic>Mycobacterium bovis</italic> in a multi-host system&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Neil Ferguson as the Senior Editor.

As currently written, like many pathogen genomics papers, this paper presents analyses and results, but leaves the rationale for the analyses and the interpretation of the results in terms of scientific hypotheses unclear. While this is not atypical for papers in the field, it makes it very hard for an interested non-specialist in the subject matter (ecology of <italic>M. bovis</italic>) to appreciate the paper. For a general interest journal like <italic>eLife</italic>, it is problematic because the reader is left with an unclear sense of what has and has not been shown.</p><p>It seems that the major hypotheses being tested revolve around the extent to which badgers are a reservoir for cattle <italic>M. bovis</italic> infection. Put somewhat more precisely, finding that they are a reservoir would mean that badger-badger transmission sustains the infection, that badger-to-cattle transmission is frequent and is the source (immediate or ultimate) of most cattle infections.</p><p>There are four main types of analysis in this paper. In a revised version we would expect each of these to be motivated explicitly by &quot;we hypothesized x and tested it using this method and found that results were/were not consistent with x”. This is the main missing item in the paper.</p><p>1) Random forest and boosted regressions. The reason for doing both is unclear, and the boosted regressions are not described much at all. The RF method seems perhaps to be testing the plausibility of the idea that genetic distance indicates likely transmission. This seems more or less borne out by the main results where spatial and social proximity have strong explanatory roles (the sign is not stated but I assume that epi distance and genetic distance are positively related). I'm not sure that I'd expect such a relationship to hold over the full scale of distances (beyond some distance I would think there would be no relationship anymore) but this is a detail. The finding that &quot;same host&quot; has no role in the RF is quite weird – usually isolates from the same host would be nearly identical. No explanation is given for why the many different network and spatial measures are used, or which one expects to be positive in such a complex model, especially assuming that this is multivariable, so they are all conditional on the others. Overall, the RF seems maybe to be consistent with the data being of high quality and with transmission being related to short genetic distance, but not to clearly refute or confirm any hypothesis. Please clarify why these analyses were done and what the results mean.</p><p>2) Phylogenetic reconstruction. Here most of the clades have high probability of ancestral nodes being in cattle, seemingly inconsistent with the badger-reservoir hypothesis. Please comment on how these results should be interpreted.</p><p>3) The epidemiological descriptive data, where badgers seemed to have it long before cattle. Seems consistent with the reservoir hypothesis, though badgers are also much more widely sampled. Please make this explicit (modified if it has been misunderstood).</p><p>4) The structured coalescent analyses, in which badger-to-cattle transmissions seem to be much more common than the reverse under nearly all models, including the best-supported ones. One aspect that confuses me is that presumably the different lifespans of the hosts lead to different durations of the infection, so I am not sure if number of transmissions per unit time is the best measure of transmission. But taken at face value this seems consistent with the reservoir hypothesis. Please clarify what you think the interpretation is, and in particular (two reviewers wondered) whether these can be interpreted as the ratio of rates (transmissions per unit time), of basic or effective reproductive numbers (transmissions per infection), or something else that has physical interpretation.</p><p>Assuming that the Reviewing Editor, a nonexpert in the substantive field, has understood the above correctly, please modify the discussion to give careful consideration of the contrasting observations (3 and 4 support the hypothesis, 2 argues against it) and how they can be reconciled. If the authors can convincingly do that and answer (even with uncertainty) a clear scientific question, this could become publishable.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Combining genomics and epidemiology to analyse bi-directional transmission of <italic>Mycobacterium bovis</italic> in a multi-host system&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Neil Ferguson (Senior Editor), a Reviewing Editor, and one reviewer.</p><p>This paper has been extensively revised, and the scientific logic is now far clearer. There are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>1) The sampling selected for genetically similar isolates in the two host species, which will (I believe in all cases) increase the estimated transition rates above that which is typical for all strains. For example, any spoligotypes that are not transmitted between the species will not be counted. This is an important caveat to the conclusions about the frequency of interspecies transfer and needs to be explicit in the Discussion.</p><p>2) The phylogeny and BASTA analyses document interspecies transfer in both directions. The regression trees seemingly show the relevance of within-species transmission. Neither alone nor together do they answer the question of reservoir – is transmission in either species sufficient on its own for maintenance of the infection and continuing spillover into the other? The Discussion recommends integrated control, and intuitively this seems sensible, but on their own evidence of transmission within each species and between the two does not prove that essentially R_0{ii} &gt;1 for either species, where ii represents transmission from species i to species i, and this is a condition for i to be a reservoir. I believe that the data are formally consistent with the possibility that eradication in either species would eradicate in the other (seems unlikely, as it requires a big role for interspecies transmission) or, more plausibly, that eradication in one species would eliminate it in the other because R0 within that species &lt;1. If this reasoning is wrong, please refute. If it is right, please note this in the discussion and soften the call for integrated control.</p><p>3) Is there any way to quantify the ratio of within to between-species transmissions? This is hinted at frequently, but the numbers are never given.</p><p>4) The inclusion of a factor in the RF and BRT analyses does not guarantee that it is included in the expected direction. Can the authors report the direction of the effect for each included factor and explain any discrepancies from expectation, e.g. that overlapping lifespan = lower distance?</p><p>5) Can the authors explain, in Figure 3 a)what &quot;mean posterior probability of each rate&quot; means (I think it means posterior probability that it is positive) and b) why the ratio of transition counts and ratio of transition rates is so different?</p><p>6) No clear answer was given to essential revision 4, which asked in what if any sense these transition rate ratios can be interpreted as reproductive number ratios or something else epidemiological. Please comment on this in the Discussion. Also please edit carefully to use &quot;transition&quot; rather than &quot;transmission&quot; or explain why both these terms appear (as far as I can tell interchangeably) in the text.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.45833.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The major required revision is to place the work in the context of clear hypotheses, predictions of these hypotheses for the results of analyses, and interpretation of the analyses as they inform our judgment on those hypotheses.

We have made the following changes:</p><p>– Additional analyses using Boosted Regression models were completed to allow the two methods to be more directly compared (Appendix 1—figures 2, 3 and 4 were updated and changes were made in the Results section of the main manuscript and to Appendix 1: Metric importance in Random Forest and Boosted Regression Analysis).</p><p>– Additional text was included to provide clarity regarding the use of these analyses in the Results section.</p><p>– The reference to the “same host” epidemiological metric has been removed.

Please comment on how these results should be interpreted.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that these results were inconsistent with our hypothesis. Re-examining our analyses, it was clear that the ancestral character estimation method used was highly sensitive to sampling biases and therefore these analyses were removed. The BASTA analyses we describe conducted similar analyses but BASTA is considered more robust because these analyses can account for the known sampling biases in our dataset. The following changes were made:</p><p>– Removed text referring to ancestral character estimation throughout manuscript.</p><p>– Figure 1 and its legend were updated to remove reference to the ancestral character estimation.</p><p>– Provided additional text in the Discussion noting that clades 1,2, 3, and 5, which appear to have a cattle origin, are likely to originate from outside of Woodchester Park where we have no badger isolates and therefore sampling biases may influence any observations of a cattle origin.</p><p>– Added additional explanatory text in the Results section to highlight the influence of sampling biases.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The epidemiological descriptive data, where badgers seemed to have it long before cattle. Seems consistent with the reservoir hypothesis, though badgers are also much more widely sampled. Please make this explicit (modified if it has been misunderstood).</p></disp-quote><p>The epidemiological description (Figure 2) is restricted to the animals associated with clade 4 in Figure 1. The observation that the badgers in this figure were sampled over a broader temporal window is a reflection of the clade 4 strain rather than our sampling. In fact, in our research the cattle population was sampled over a broader temporal window (1988-2013) as compared to the badger population (2000-2011). To clarify this the following changes were made:</p><p>– Additional text added to the legend of Figure 3.</p><p>– Minor changes were made to Figure 2 and its legend.</p><p>– Included four additional supplementary figures to Figure 1 (Figure 1—figure supplements 1, 2, 3, and 4) documenting the life histories of the animals associated with clades 1, 2, 3 and 5.

However, the transmission rates estimated in BASTA (our structured coalescent approach) are done at the population level and for these analyses it is the time from infection to transmission that is important. In addition, the transmission rates are at the deme level rather than the individual level. Lastly, the average lifespan of dairy cattle (6.5 years) and badgers (5-8 years) are fairly similar.</p><p>In the manuscript, we had incorrectly referred to the transmission rates (Figure 3B) as “cattle-to-badger” or “badger-to-cattle”, which should have used “badgers” – this has been corrected.</p><p>Similarly, in reference to the estimation of the number of within and between species transition events (Figure 3D) we incorrectly used “badgers” and “cattle” – these have been corrected to “cow” and “badger”.</p><p>To help with the interpretation of the results of the BASTA analyses, an additional panel was added to Figure 3C. Figure 3C presents the median ratio of the badgers-to-cattle transmission rate divided by the cattle-to-badgers transmission rate estimated by each model analysed in BASTA. Additional references in the text for Figure 3C were added.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Assuming that the reviewing editor, a nonexpert in the substantive field, has understood the above correctly, please modify the Discussion to give careful consideration of the contrasting observations (3 and 4 support the hypothesis, 2 argues against it) and how they can be reconciled.

In the revised manuscript the Discussion has been re-written. The aim of this re-write was to produce a shorter and clearer discussion that describes how each analysis and its results should be interpreted in the context of our hypothesis and the broader literature. We note that, while we understand why it seemed like the observations contradict each other, by recognising the role that biases played in the analysis 2, these are now consistent.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>This paper has been extensively revised, and the scientific logic is now far clearer.

There were very few examples of non-SB0263 isolates in the sampled badgers (&gt;90%), and therefore, for this population, we believe our results are a good representation of the epidemiological characteristics of the system. Further, given the small number of samples of differing spoligotypes and the large genetic distances between them, we would likely be unable to improve the accuracy of our estimates even if we added these samples. However, we do agree that the selection of SB0263 may artificially inflate the importance of badger-to-cattle transmission over cattle-to-cattle transmission. This selection bias is alluded to in the Discussion:</p><p>“In addition, we have only considered spoligotype SB0263 and there are known phenotypic differences between spoligotypes, though such differences are unlikely to fundamentally change the epidemiology (Garbaccio et al., 2014; Wright et al., 2013).”</p><p>In addition, more detail is provided in the Materials and methods section:</p><p>“More than 90% of the badger-derived isolates were spoligotype SB0263. More than 75% (1096/1442) of the isolates available from cattle within 10km of Woodchester Park shared the same spoligotype and it is the second most common type found across England (Smith et al., 2003; Smith, Gordon, de la Rua-Domenech, Clifton-Hadley, and Hewinson, 2006).”</p><p>The section in the Discussion has been edited and expanded:</p><p>“In addition, we selected only isolates of spoligotype SB0263, since this was the dominant type in the badger population. […] In addition, many different <italic>M. bovis</italic> spoligotypes have been observed in sympatric badger and cattle populations (Smith et al., 2003) and SB0263 is not only one of the commonest spoligotypes in the UK (Smith et al., 2003), it is also highly prevalent in cattle around Woodchester Park.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The phylogeny and BASTA analyses document interspecies transfer in both directions. The regression trees seemingly show the relevance of within-species transmission. Neither alone nor together do they answer the question of reservoir – is transmission in either species sufficient on its own for maintenance of the infection and continuing spillover into the other?

If it is right, please note this in the Discussion and soften the call for integrated control.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for highlighting this issue and we agree that the language used needs to be tightened.</p><p>We have replaced the use of the term ‘reservoir’ with respect to the badger population and have removed our statements suggesting the badgers are maintaining infection. Instead, we note that our evidence suggests that infection can persist in the badger population independently for over 10 years. We have softened our statement calling for coordinated control by changing “it will be necessary” to “it may be necessary” in the Discussion. Lastly, we have edited the final sentence of the abstract to state:</p><p>“If representative, our results suggest that control operations should target both cattle and badgers.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Is there any way to quantify the ratio of within to between-species transmissions? This is hinted at frequently, but the numbers are never given.</p></disp-quote><p>It would be possible to quantify the ratio of the estimated number of within- and between-individual transmission events (from Figure 3C) but we don’t feel this is appropriate. These counts of the transmission events between individual animals can only be considered conservative estimates of the minimum number of events because they don’t account for multiple host transitions (badger or cow) on a single branch from a parent node to its child. In addition, we assumed that, where possible, the host animal represented the parent and one of the child nodes. In contrast, the more robust inter-species transmission rates are explicitly estimated at the population level and account for missed individuals on the transmission chains by allowing multiple host transitions on a single branch.</p><p>We included additional sentences describing the transmission event counts in the discussion in the Results section:</p><p>“The counts of events between individual animals outputted by BASTA represent the lower bound of the number of transmission events that occurred over the evolutionary history of the sampled <italic>M. bovis</italic> population because they are estimated on the transmission chains between the sampled and ancestral host animals and don’t account for missing individuals in these chains.”</p><p>Also, additional lines were added in the Discussion section:</p><p>“These counts provide a conservative estimate of the minimum number of transitions between the sampled animals and their ancestors. While it is not appropriate to directly compare the counts within- and between-species, they do demonstrate that, at a minimum, within-species transmission occurs at least twice as frequently as between-species transmission.”</p><p>Lastly, we created a supplementary figure to Figure 3 (Figure 3—figure supplement 1) that illustrates how the estimated transmission events were counted on each phylogeny in the posterior distribution of trees estimated by the two deme model in BASTA.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The inclusion of a factor in the RF and BRT analyses does not guarantee that it is included in the expected direction. Can the authors report the direction of the effect for each included factor and explain any discrepancies from expectation, e.g. that overlapping lifespan = lower distance?</p></disp-quote><p>Partial dependence plots were produced from the Random Forest analyses estimating the direction of the relationship between each epidemiological metric and genetic distances. These plots were added into Appendix 1—figures 5, 6, and 7. In addition, two new random metrics were included in the Random Forest and Boosted Regression analyses to provide an indication of the importance that could be attributed to a variable that had no relationship to the genetic distances (see updates to Appendix 1— figures 2, 3, and 4). Sentences describing the trends between the epidemiological trends and genetic distances have been included in Appendix 1:</p><p>“Partial dependence plots were used to estimate the direction of the effect between each of the epidemiological metrics (predictor variables) and the genetics distances (response variable) (Appendix 1—figure 5, Appendix 1—figure 6, and Appendix 1—figure 7). […] There was a lot of noise around these relationships, but these trends were in-line with our expectations that cattle and wildlife in close proximity in time and space are more likely to transmit infection to one another.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Can the authors explain, in Figure 3 a) what &quot;mean posterior probability of each rate&quot; means (I think it means posterior probability that it is positive) and b) why the ratio of transition counts and ratio of transition rates is so different?</p></disp-quote><p>a) We apologise for the confusion. Based on the number of inter-species rates estimated, this value is either the posterior probability directly (for the first three models) or the mean calculated across the different inter-species transmission rates that were estimated and summed, as seen in <xref ref-type="table" rid="resptable1">Author response table 1</xref> (derived from Figure 5).</p><table-wrap id="resptable1" position="anchor"><label>Author response table 1.</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top"/><th valign="top">2 demes</th><th valign="top">3 demes – outer is both</th><th valign="top">3 demes – outer is cattle</th><th valign="top">3 demes – outer is badgers</th><th valign="top">4 demes</th><th valign="top">6 demes – north and south</th><th valign="top">6 demes – east and west</th><th valign="top">8 demes – north and south</th><th valign="top">8 demes – east and west</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">CB</td><td valign="top">1</td><td valign="top">1</td><td valign="top">1</td><td valign="top">2</td><td valign="top">2</td><td valign="top">3</td><td valign="top">3</td><td valign="top">4</td><td valign="top">4</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">BC</td><td valign="top">1</td><td valign="top">1</td><td valign="top">1</td><td valign="top">2</td><td valign="top">2</td><td valign="top">3</td><td valign="top">3</td><td valign="top">4</td><td valign="top">4</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>To improve clarity, text has been added to the legend of Figure 3, clarifying how the numbers representing the posterior probabilities were calculated:</p><p>“The values above each vertical line represent the posterior probability of each rate, either as a mean of probabilities associated with multiple estimated rates (for the 3Deme_outerIsBadgers, 4Deme, 6Deme and 8Deme models) or a single probability (for the 2Deme, 3Deme_outerIsBoth, and 3Deme_outerIsCattle models).”</p><p>b) As stated in our response to point 3, the transmission counts represent the lower bounds on the number of events between individual animals. In contrast, the inter-species transmission rates are estimated at the population and can’t be directly compared to these counts. In addition, because the counts don’t account for missing individuals on the transmission chains from the ancestral individuals to the sampled animals, they are susceptible to sampling biases.</p><p>To avoid confusion panel C of Figure 3 was removed. In addition, the new panel C (previously D) has been edited to improve its clarity. The counts for within species and between species events have been separated and the number of badgers and cattle sampled at the tips of the phylogenies that the counts are derived from has been noted.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) No clear answer was given to essential revision 4, which asked in what if any sense these transition rate ratios can be interpreted as reproductive number ratios or something else epidemiological. Please comment on this in the Discussion. Also please edit carefully to use &quot;transition&quot; rather than &quot;transmission&quot; or explain why both these terms appear (as far as I can tell interchangeably) in the text.</p></disp-quote><p>a) The relative transmission rates are the most appropriate calculations given the evolutionary analysis methods that were used in this paper. It isn’t appropriate to discuss these in terms of the reproductive ratio because we are calculating population-level rather than individual transmission rates. We note that direct estimates of reproductive numbers are possible but would require extensive additional work using different methods.</p><p>b) In our case the inter-population transition rates estimated here can be considered inter-species transmission rates because the populations we consider are species specific. As noted above in 6a above, these are estimates at the population rather than individual animal level.</p><p>Any instances of the misuse of these terms in the manuscript were corrected. Additional text added into the discussion to clearly define our use of transmission and transition:</p><p>“The BASTA analyses estimated transition rates between demes within a structured population. Since the demes within the structured model were species-specific the estimated transition rates can be considered equivalent to transmission rates between populations of badgers and cattle.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
