instigate genomic changes that fuel cancer and evolution, yet direct quantification of double-strand breaks (DSBs) has been limited. Predominant sources of spontaneous DSBs remain elusive. We report synthetic technology for quantifying DSBs using fluorescent-protein fusions of double-strand DNA end-binding protein, Gam of bacteriophage Mu. In <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> GamGFP forms foci at chromosomal DSBs and pinpoints their subgenomic locations. Spontaneous DSBs occur mostly one per cell, and correspond with generations, supporting replicative models for spontaneous breakage, and providing the first true breakage rates. In mammalian cells GamGFP—labels laser-induced DSBs antagonized by end-binding protein Ku; co-localizes incompletely with DSB marker 53BP1 suggesting superior DSB-specificity; blocks resection; and demonstrates DNA breakage via APOBEC3A cytosine deaminase. We demonstrate directly that some spontaneous DSBs occur outside of S phase. The data illuminate spontaneous DNA breakage in <italic>E. coli</italic> and human cells and illustrate the versatility of fluorescent-Gam for interrogation of DSBs in living cells.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01222.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01222.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01222.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cells have developed a variety of mechanisms for repairing DNA molecules when breaks occur in one or both of the DNA strands. However, we know relatively little about the causes of these breaks, which often occur naturally, or even about how common they are. Learning more about the most common forms of DNA breakage is important because the genomic changes caused by these breaks are driving forces behind both cancer and evolution, including the evolution of drug resistance in bacteria.</p><p>Shee et al. have developed a new method for detecting double-strand breaks in both bacterial and mammalian cells. The method involved combining a natural virus protein called Gam with a fluorescent protein called GFP (short for green fluorescent protein) to make a fusion protein called GamGFP. Gam was chosen because it binds only to double-strand breaks, traps double-strand breaks, and does not bind to any proteins. Genetic engineering techniques were used to introduce GamGFP into cells, with DNA breaks in these cells showing up as fluorescent spots when viewed under a microscope.</p><p>Shee et al. used this approach to detect double-strand breaks in both <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> cells and mammalian cells, and to measure the rate of spontaneous DNA breakage in <italic>E. coli</italic>. The number of double-strand breaks in <italic>E. coli</italic> was proportional to the number of times the cells had divided, which provides support for DNA replication-dependent models of spontaneous DNA breakage.</p><p>The GamGFP method also provided various insights into DNA breaks in mouse and human cells. In particular, Shee et al. found evidence for a mechanism of DNA breakage that appears to be specific to primates. This mechanism involves an enzyme that is only found in the innate immune system of primates removing an amine group from a cytosine. In future, this approach might allow the trapping, mapping and quantification of DNA breaks in all kinds of cells, and the highly specific way GamGFP binds to breaks could make it the preferred tool for studying DNA breakage in mammalian cells.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi"

genome-destabilizing DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Jackson and Bartek, 2009</xref>). ‘DSBs’ is used here as a collective term that includes two-ended structures (DSBs, e.g., as caused by double-strand endonucleases or ionizing radiation) and single double-stranded ends of DNA (DSEs, or one-ended DSBs), such as are caused by replication-fork collapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kuzminov, 2001</xref>). We use ‘DSE’ to refer to each single DSE in a two-ended DSB and to the sole DSE in a one-ended DSB. DSBs (one- and two-ended) promote deletions, genome rearrangements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hastings et al., 2009</xref>), chromosome loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Paques and Haber, 1999</xref>), and point mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Harris et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Rosenberg et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Strathern et al., 1995</xref>). DSB-induced genomic instability promotes cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Negrini et al., 2010</xref>) and genetic diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">O’Driscoll and Jeggo, 2006</xref>), evolution of antibiotic resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Cirz et al., 2005</xref>) and of pathogenic bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Prieto et al., 2006</xref>) including in biofilms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Boles and Singh, 2008</xref>). The latter reflect the role of DSBs in inducing mutagenesis and genome rearrangement under stress, which may accelerate evolution of bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Al Mamun et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Rosenberg et al., 2012</xref>), and human cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bindra et al., 2007</xref>). DSBs are implicated in mutation hotspots in cancer genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Nik-Zainal et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Roberts et al., 2012</xref>). Breaks induced by ionizing radiation and alkylating drugs are used as anti-cancer therapy, and conversely DSBs are likely to foretell genomic instability that drives malignancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Negrini et al., 2010</xref>). Despite the importance of DSBs to many biological processes, quantification of DSBs has been limited. Moreover, although some mechanisms of DSB formation are being explicated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Merrikh et al., 2012</xref>), the main mechanisms underlying spontaneous DNA breakage in bacterial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Pennington and Rosenberg, 2007</xref>) and human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Vilenchik and Knudson, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kongruttanachok et al., 2010</xref>) remain elusive.</p><p>DSBs have been quantified via neutral sucrose gradients (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bonura and Smith, 1977</xref>), or pulse-field gels (PFGE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Michel et al., 1997</xref>), neither of which routinely detects DSBs present in fewer than ∼10% of a population of molecules, far above DSB levels that occur in cells spontaneously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Pennington and Rosenberg, 2007</xref>). The standard single-cell gel electrophoresis (‘comet’) assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Olive et al., 1990</xref>) detects single-strand (ss) DNA nicks and DSBs, and thus is not specific to DSBs, whereas the neutral comet assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Wojewodzka et al., 2002</xref>) is DSB-specific, but lacks sensitivity. The terminal transferase dUTP nick end-labeling (TUNEL) assay detects free ends of DNA, and so (nonspecifically) labels both ssDNA nicks and DSBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gavrieli et al., 1992</xref>).</p><p>Cytological assays for foci of DSB-repair proteins identify locations of DSBs in situ via surrogate markers γ-H2AX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Rogakou et al., 1999</xref>), Mre11, Rad50 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Maser et al., 1997</xref>), Rad51 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Haaf et al., 1995</xref>), Rad52 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Liu et al., 1999</xref>), BRAC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Scully et al., 1997</xref>), Ku80/70 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Koike et al., 2011</xref>), and 53BP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Rappold et al., 2001</xref>) in eukaryotes, and RecA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Renzette et al., 2005</xref>), RecFON (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kidane et al., 2004</xref>), and bacterial Ku (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kobayashi et al., 2008</xref>) in bacteria. Only some of these may be DSB-specific. γ-H2AX and 53BP1, the most commonly used DSB markers in mammalian cells, are indirect markers. Antibodies to γ-H2AX and 53BP1 detect a modified histone and a DNA repair protein respectively, rather than DNA ends, and are likely to label sites not currently possessing a DSB. γ-H2AX is a histone variant phosphorylated at sites of DNA damage during DNA damage signaling. γ-H2AX spreads over up to ∼2-Mbp regions that comprise 500 to 8000 γ-H2AX molecules, so does not pinpoint DSB sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Rogakou et al., 1999</xref>). Numbers of γ-H2AX foci induced by DNA damage may not represent true numbers of DSBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bouquet et al., 2006</xref>), and γ-H2AX focus formation is variable and can occur at non-DSB sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Han et al., 2006</xref>). Thus, γ-H2AX may not always signify a physical break. 53BP1 is a non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) protein and forms nuclear foci upon ionizing radiation (IR) treatment, dependently on several histone modifications including γ-H2AX, H2A/X ubiquitylation and H4K20 methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lukas et al., 2011b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fradet-Turcotte et al., 2013</xref>). Because these histone modifications do not exist equally throughout the genome, the efficiency and DSB-specificity of 53BP1 are not known. Moreover, γ-H2AX, and all histological markers provide ‘snapshots’ of fixed cells and do not allow the possibility of measuring accrual of DSBs over time. Although Ku is likely to be most specific for DSBs via its function in NHEJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Taccioli et al., 1994</xref>), Ku also functions at telomeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gravel et al., 1998</xref>) and appears to interact with RNA polymerase II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Dynan and Yoo, 1998</xref>), raising questions about its specificity. Ku also binds ssDNA nicks, gaps, and regions of transition between single- and double-stranded structures, supporting concerns about its specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Paillard and Strauss, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Blier et al., 1993</xref>).</p><p>In bacteria, RecA binds ssDNA assisted by RecF. Neither is specific for DSEs of DNA. Bacterial Ku has also been used to visualize DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kobayashi et al., 2008</xref>). Quantification of DSBs in living <italic>E. coli</italic> was achieved by measuring the RecB-dependent (DSB-specific) induction of the SOS response in individual cells by flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Pennington and Rosenberg, 2007</xref>). Although this assay allowed quantification of rates of formation of living cells with DSBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Pennington and Rosenberg, 2007</xref>), it could not determine the numbers of DSBs per cell. Thus, to date, neither precise rates of spontaneous DNA breakage in living cells nor the mechanisms that underlie most spontaneous DNA breakage are known, even in <italic>E. coli</italic>.</p><p>DSBs can arise by several different mechanisms, many involving DNA replication. Replication-fork collapse at ssDNA nicks creates one-ended DSBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kuzminov, 2001</xref>) (illustrated below). Collisions of the replisome with transcription complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Merrikh et al., 2012</xref>) and other proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gupta et al., 2013</xref>) cause DNA breakage. In stationary-phase (non-replicating) cells, RNA/DNA hybrids left by transcription (R-loops) promote DNA breakage apparently by priming replication forks that then collapse at ssDNA nicks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Wimberly et al., 2013</xref>). Though replication can generate DSBs, whether it is the principle generator of DSBs spontaneously, in cells/sites not specifically engineered to maximize collisions, has not been addressed. Similarly, spontaneous 53BP1 foci can be detected in G1 (non-replicating) human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Lukas et al., 2011a</xref>). Given the uncertainly of the DSB-specificity of 53BP1, whether these reflect genuine DSBs formed outside of S phase, when most replication occurs, is unclear.</p><p>Additional processes may generate DSBs in human cells. Most humans express up to nine primate-specific ssDNA deaminases, AID, APOBEC1, and seven distinct APOBEC3s, all of which convert DNA cytosines to uracils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Conticello et al., 2007</xref>). In human, uracils in DNA can be processed by UNG2 into abasic sites and subsequently into ssDNA nicks by APEX. Such nicks could potentially produce DSBs via opposing strand nicks or replication-fork collapses, as occurs with uracil excision from DNA in <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kuzminova and Kuzminov, 2008</xref>). Although DSBs have been inferred and associated with AID for Ig translocations in some B-cell cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Robbiani and Nussenzweig, 2013</xref>), DSBs have yet to be identified directly. DSBs have also been inferred as intermediates in the generation of strand-biased cytosine mutation clusters in many cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Nik-Zainal et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Roberts et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Burns et al., 2013b</xref>). This inference is further supported by the demonstration of similar-sized mutation hotspots targeted to DSBs created by I-SceI endonucleolytic cleavage in <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Shee et al., 2012</xref>), and by similar mutation clustering in yeast cells exposed to alkylating agents or engineered to express various human DNA deaminases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Roberts et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Taylor et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we develop engineered proteins for specific detection of DSBs in bacterial and mammalian cells, and use them to illuminate spontaneous DNA breakage in both.

Gam is the ortholog of eukaryotic and bacterial Ku (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">d’Adda di Fagagna et al., 2003</xref>), but, unlike Ku proteins, does not perform DNA repair reactions nor bind any other known protein. During phage infection, Gam binds and protects ends of linear phage DNA, preventing degradation by host exonucleases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akroyd and Symonds, 1986</xref>). Biochemically, Mu Gam is a highly specific DSE-binding protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Williams and Radding, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abraham and Symonds, 1990</xref>).

Moreover, we track the origins of spontaneous DSBs in live, proliferating <italic>E. coli</italic>. We find precise correlation of DSBs with the numbers of divisions, implying that replication-dependent mechanism(s) underlie most spontaneous DNA breakage. In human and mouse cells, we show that GamGFP labels DSBs and we provide evidence that—(i) GamGFP competes with Ku for DSBs; (ii) 53BP1 appears less specific for DSBs than GamGFP; (iii) GamGFP inhibits end resection at DSBs; (iv) DNA cytosine deamination produces DSBs in human cells, identifying a potentially primate-specific mechanism of DNA breakage; and (iv) G1 cells show multiple clustered foci, implying that some spontaneous DNA breakage occurs outside of S phase when most replication takes place.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Production of functional GamGFP from the <italic>E. coli</italic> chromosome</title><p>We constructed a regulatable chromosomal expression cassette of Mu <italic>gam</italic> and a Mu <italic>gam-gfp</italic> fusion gene in the <italic>E. coli</italic> chromosome, controlled by the doxycyline/tetracycline-inducible P<sub>N25<italic>tetO</italic></sub> promoter (‘Materials and methods’, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

Saturated LBH cultures of SMR14327 (WT), SMR14333 (Gam) and SMR14334 (GamGFP) were diluted 1:100 in fresh LBH medium and grown shaking at 37°C for 90 min, then either induced with 200 ng/ml of doxycycline or not, and grown for an additional 2 hours shaking at 37°C prior to plating for cfu on LBH solid medium with or without 200 ng/ml doxycycline. The colonies were scored after overnight incubation at 37°C. We observe that induced cultures of the Gam- and GamGFP-producing strains show, respectively, 32 ± 9% and 0.47 ± 0.06% the number of viable cfu as either WT cells with no <italic>gam</italic> gene or uninduced <italic>gam-</italic> or <italic>gam-gfp-</italic>containing cells (mean ± SD, three experiments). These data imply that DSBs bound by GamGFP are not repaired or are repaired inefficiently.

These data suggest that GamGFP is a more permanent DSE-trap and blocker of repair than Gam is, and that there is residual RecBC-independent DSB repair in <italic>recBC</italic>-defective cells. We speculate that the GFP moiety might confer more permanence to the GamGFP binding of DSBs either because the GamGFP protein inherently possesses a reduced dissociation constant or perhaps because the GFP moiety instigates multimerization with other GFP moieties in other GamGFP molecules present in the cell. This could both confer its outstanding focus-forming ability and might additionally retard end dissociation.

First, when GamGFP is produced for 3 hr in cells without I-<italic>Sce</italic>I endonuclease, spontaneous foci (presumably reflecting spontaneous DSBs, validated below) are visible in ∼7.5% of cells, a number higher than the 2.1% of cells with DSBs reported in a previous assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Pennington and Rosenberg, 2007</xref>).

However, two problems cloud interpretation of the previous data. First, the previous method could not distinguish whether most spontaneous DSBs occur singly in cells or via multi-break catastrophes. Second, whether most spontaneous DSBs occur replication- and thus generation-dependently was unknown (reviewed in ‘Introduction’). GamGFP allowed solution of both problems.</p><p>First, time-lapse microfluidic imaging shows that most spontaneous DSBs form with precise correlation to numbers of cell divisions, and as above (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–C</xref>) they form mostly 1 DSB per cell, not in multi-break catastrophes. In microfluidic chambers, we captured images of growing microcolonies from the 1-cell to ∼100-cell stage measuring divisions and appearance of spontaneous GamGFP foci while varying cell-division rates by withdrawal of glucose from the flowing medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). If spontaneous DSBs form independently of replication/generations, then the focus appearance might correlate with time not generations, whereas replication-dependent mechanisms of DSB formation predict correspondence with generations. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, cells that were kept dividing in log-phase for 9 hr, then shifted to no-glucose for an additional 18 hr, show severely slowed divisions after the shift, and a highly precise correspondence of the numbers of spontaneous DSB foci with numbers of cell divisions at all division rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). To verify that the cells experiencing slow/no growth were still capable of forming GamGFP foci had breaks been present, we gave 20 μg/ml of DSB-producing agent phleomycin after 27 hr and found that 45 ± 5% (mean ± SEM) of cells then formed GamGFP foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>, 32 hr).

In all six experiments summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, one focus appeared per cell, and cells with a focus did not divide further (probably because GamGFP is a DSE ‘trap’ that prevents repair of the break (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>) and shown for native Mu Gam protein in phage λ repair assays, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Thaler et al. [1987]</xref>). Therefore, 0.0145 ± 0.006 foci per cell division represents the rate of formation of foci per division. Correcting this rate for ∼71% efficiency of detection of DSBs as foci (above), provides a rate of 0.021 ± 0.008 DSBs per cell division.</p><p>Third, the data obtained here additionally allow accurate interpretation of previous data from experiments that used flow-cytometric detection of cells with one or more DSBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Pennington and Rosenberg, 2007</xref>) for a separate rate measurement as follows: (i) we now know that most of these cells have one DSB, not multi-break catastrophes and so can estimate real DSB formation rates; (ii) whereas previously, we assumed generation-dependence, a point that was not known, here we showed that spontaneous breaks do form generation-dependently (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Thus we can translate the previously estimated rate to real rates of DSBs per cell division. Previously, the rate of formation of cells with ≥1 DSB per generation was estimated to be 0.01 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Pennington and Rosenberg, 2007</xref>). We can correct this for the number of DSBs per cell by noting that under the same growth conditions (exponential growth in minimal glucose) we observed 108 foci in 98 cells with foci, or ∼1.1 foci per focus-carrying cell. Applying this function to an estimate of 0.01 of cells producing ≥1 DSBs per generation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Pennington and Rosenberg, 2007</xref>), we have 0.01 × 108/98 = 0.011 DSBs per cell division. This is similar to the 0.021 ± 0.008 DSBs per cell division obtained from the microfluidic data above, and both are far lower than initial estimates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Cox et al., 2000</xref>), discussed below.</p><p>These rates hold for log-phase cells grown in minimal 0.1% glucose medium, in which most cells possess two chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Pennington and Rosenberg, 2007</xref>), the growth medium and condition used by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Pennington and Rosenberg (2007)</xref>. When growing in rich LBH medium, as we did in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–C</xref>, replication is faster, the number of chromosomes per cell is increased, and the frequency of cells with DSB(s) is higher (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Pennington, 2006</xref>). Similarly, we observed the higher 0.075 foci per cell in rich medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). In the moderately richer M9 0.4% glucose medium used in the zero-dose of the IR experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>), we observed the moderately higher frequency of 0.043 foci per cell.

This result is expected because, first, Gam is specific for flush DSEs with up to a four-base single-strand DNA overhang (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akroyd and Symonds, 1986</xref>), not the long single-strand DNA overhangs created by resection of DSBs by repair exonucleases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Symington and Gautier, 2011</xref>). Therefore, there are expected to be 53BP1 foci unoccupied by GamGFP, as we observe in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>, because GamGFP is a more specific reagent. Second, 53BP1 is expected to have a post-DSB-repair presence because it binds modified nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lukas et al., 2011b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fradet-Turcotte et al., 2013</xref>) rather than DNA, which is also compatible with our data. The mechanism that predominates remains to be determined.</p><p>Similarly, the ∼23% of foci per cell with GamGFP alone indicates that some DSBs are present but not bound by sufficient 53BP1 to form a visible focus. These DSBs could lack DNA-damage-response signaling due to occlusion of the ends by GamGFP or exist in areas without the chromatin response that recruits 53BP1. At least in <italic>E. coli</italic>, GamGFP focus formation is very rapid, with 91 ± 0.5% (mean ± SEM, three independent experiments) of the foci resulting from a 10-min (pulse) exposure to 20 µg/ml phleomycin appearing at 10 min. Whether because of timing, location or signaling, the data suggest that a more accurate picture of the locations of current DSBs containing frank DSEs might be obtained with GamGFP than 53BP1.</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>GamGFP inhibits IR-induced end resection</title><p>We find that GamGFP appears to block resection.

However, 53BP1 forms unusually large nuclear foci exclusively in a subset of undamaged G1 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Harrigan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Lukas et al., 2011a</xref>).

Although this might suggest that some spontaneous DSBs might form outside of S phase, it has been argued that not all 53BP1 foci indicate DSBs because different types of DNA damage nucleate 53BP1 foci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Lukas et al., 2011a</xref>). In this study, we examined the large nuclear 53BP1 foci in undamaged cells, previously shown to form exclusively in G1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Harrigan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Lukas et al., 2011a</xref>), and find that ∼60% of the 53BP1 foci in Ku80-deficient cells correspond to genuine GamGFP-detectable DSBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Moreover, the GamGFP that coincides with 53BP1 foci contain multiple individual foci, implying that these DSBs may be in large multi-break clusters. Because GamGFP does not spread along DNA, it can resolve multiple nearby DSBs, which was not possible with 53BP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Harrigan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Lukas et al., 2011a</xref>).

In living <italic>E. coli</italic>, chromosomally encoded GamGFP forms foci at I-<italic>Sce</italic>I endonuclease-produced two-ended DSBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2 fig3">Figures 2A–C and 3</xref>), at one-ended DSBs made by replication-fork collapse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D,E</xref>), and DSBs generated by gamma-irradiation and bleomycin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). GamGFP detects about 71–82% of DSBs, a robust efficiency. A single GamGFP focus occurs per two-ended DSB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2 fig3">Figures 2A–C and 3</xref>) or per one-ended DSB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Either <italic>E. coli</italic> DNA-repair or other proteins, or GamGFP itself, might keep the two ends in close enough proximity that only a single focus forms (discussed in ‘Results’: <italic>GamGFP pinpoints subgenomic locations of DSBs in E. coli</italic>). GamGFP also allowed subcellular localization of site-specific DSBs relative to a chromosomal mCherry marker in <italic>E. coli</italic>, which are distinct even as close as 55 kb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Similarly, GamGFP and GamEmGFP protein fusions produced in mammalian cells showed localization at laser-induced DSBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), were inhibited by Ku in those cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B–D</xref>), and inhibited resection at DSBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), indicating that GamGFPs label DSBs also in mammalian cells. GamGFP and its derivatives also allowed important novel conclusions about the origins of spontaneous DNA breaks in <italic>E. coli</italic> and mammalian cells.</p><p>In mammalian cells, GamGFPs may have considerable utility as a marker for DSBs, particularly when levels of DNA insults/damage are high. However, we note that a failure to detect DSBs using Gam may be due to competition with Ku (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B,C</xref>) and/or to relatively low levels of DNA damage. Additionally, in mammalian cells GamGFP foci were more dramatic in fixed than living cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>), perhaps because depletion of background unbound GamGFP in the fixed cells improved contrast. Nevertheless, this tool can be extremely valuable for a number of studies. For instance, GamGFPs allowed us to validate indirect markers γ-H2AX and 53BP1 as genuine DSB markers by showing co-localization at laser and IR-induced DSBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5 fig7 fig8">Figures 5A,C,E–G, 7, 8</xref>), and GamGFP inhibits DNA end exonucleolytic resection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Consistent with these results, we also demonstrate that 53BP1 foci in G1 contain DSBs that previously had been inferred only (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). We are working to develop Ku-resistant DSE-binding fusions currently.</p><p>In work published while this paper was in review, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Britton et al. (2013)</xref> use Ku foci for detection of DSBs similarly to our use of GamGFP. They show that Ku interacts with chromatin via RNA and that foci can be seen in RNase-treated samples. An advantage of Ku is that competition with Ku is not a problem, whereas an advantage of GamGFP is its greater specificity for double-strand ends (reviewed in ‘Introduction’).</p><p>Second, one aspect of the incomplete co-localization of 53BP1 with GamGFPs is that there are DSBs identifiable with GamGFPs that are not seen with 53BP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5G and 7C</xref>). One possible explanation is that, particularly in the Ku-defective MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5 fig8">Figures 5G and 8</xref>), GamGFPs may be more sensitive than 53BP1 to DSBs, and might make visible DSB foci <italic>before</italic> DNA-damage signaling has allowed sufficient 53BP1 accumulation to produce a visible focus. At least in <italic>E. coli</italic> GamGFP labels DSBs very rapidly, showing most foci by 10 min after phleomycin exposure. Thus, in some circumstances, GamGFPs may be more sensitive than 53BP1. Conversely, the presence of 53BP1 foci at sites that do not show GamGFP foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5 fig7">Figures 5E–G, 7B,C</xref>), even in Ku80-deficient MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>), may indicate that some of the sites bound by 53BP1 may not possess frank DSEs, the Gam DNA substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Williams and Radding, 1981</xref>). This could be because either the DSB has been repaired, but the 53BP1 at the site has not yet dissipated, or because exonucleolytic ssDNA resection has created a long ssDNA overhang, which cannot be bound by Gam (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Williams and Radding, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akroyd and Symonds, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abraham and Symonds, 1990</xref>). With either possibility, the data suggest that GamGFPs may be more selective and specific markers for DSBs. Given the widespread use of 53BP1 as a DSB marker, understanding its potential limitations of possibly lower specificity relative to GamGFPs is important.</p><p>Third, we demonstrate directly that primate-specific deaminase APOBEC3A caused GamGFP foci, and thus DSBs in human cells, indicating that DSBs result from DNA cytosine deamination. This supports previous, less specific evidence from the appearance of γ-H2AX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Landry et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Burns et al., 2013a</xref>) and 53BP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Taylor et al., 2013</xref>) foci induced by APOBEC3A expression. A possible mechanism could be that removal of uracil from DNA after cytosine deamination followed by cleavage at the abasic site creates a ssDNA nick, which becomes a one-ended DSB either by replication-fork collapse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), or similar ssDNA nick creation on the opposing strand. DNA breaks occur upon uracil excision from DNA in <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kuzminova and Kuzminov, 2008</xref>). Regardless of the specific mechanisms, the data indicate that cytosine-deamination may be a general mechanism of DSB generation in mammalian cells. Cytosine deamination clearly contributes a significant part of the cancer genome mutational landscape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Nik-Zainal et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Roberts et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Taylor et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Burns et al., 2013a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">2013b</xref>) and it is likely that some of this could be by DSB induction.</p><p>In <italic>E. coli</italic>, GamGFP allowed demonstration that, first and importantly, spontaneous DNA breakage is precisely correlated with the number of cell divisions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), providing the first evidence that most spontaneous breakage results from DNA replication-based mechanisms. Previously, DNA replication has been implicated in several mechanisms of DSB formation. These include fork collapse in engineered lambda phage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kuzminov, 2001</xref>), fork-regression or ‘chicken-foot’ formation, to produce one-ended DSBs, in cells with defective replication proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Michel et al., 1997</xref>), and DSBs created by collisions of replication forks with transcription complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Merrikh et al., 2012</xref>), and other proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gupta et al., 2013</xref>). However, nearly all of the work required engineered constructs or situations (to maximize collisions, fork collapses, etc) or mutant proteins, and so did not address how <italic>spontaneous</italic> DSBs occur normally. Our results demonstrate the correspondence of spontaneous DSBs with the number of cell divisions and imply that some or all of these mechanisms, and replication generally, are in fact predominant causes of spontaneous DNA breakage normally in proliferating <italic>E. coli.</italic></p><p>In separate work, we found that one particular replicative mechanism, in which RNA (R-loop)-primed replication-fork collapse produces DSBs, occurs spontaneously in stationary-phase (non-proliferating) <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Wimberly et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Second, the demonstration that spontaneous DSBs are generation dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), and our finding that most spontaneous DSBs result as single events per cell, not multi-break catastrophes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2 fig4">Figures 2C and 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>), allowed calculation of the first true rates of spontaneous DNA breakage. Our microfluidic data directly show rates of 0.021±0.008 spontaneous DSBs per cell division, and the use of our data to re-interpret and correct previous indirect, low-resolution data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Pennington and Rosenberg, 2007</xref>) indicates a roughly similar rate of 0.011 spontaneous DSBs per cell division (‘Results’). These true rates are 10–20-times lower than initial postulates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Cox et al., 2000</xref>), but in line with each other. Because genomic rearrangement frequencies remain the same regardless of estimations of DSB numbers, these rarer and more accurate break rates imply that each DSB is 10–20 times more genome destabilizing than had initially been postulated. Spontaneous DSBs are infrequent but dangerous, and now that their generation-dependence is unequivocal, their origins in replication are supported.</p><p>Whereas mechanisms underlying spontaneous DNA breakage have been elusive, our data support major roles for replication in <italic>E. coli</italic>, and for some DNA breakage outside of S phase, in G1 in human cells. Our results show a novel DNA breakage mechanism in human cells, and indicate the utility of fluorescent-Gam for interrogating DSB formation, location, and dynamics in living cells. Understanding the origins of spontaneous DNA breakage obtainable with improved synthetic reagents such as GamGFP will illuminate the underlying causes, and possible means of prevention, of important biological consequences of DNA breakage in living cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Strains, media and growth</title><p><italic>E. coli</italic> strains used are given in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1A</xref>.
