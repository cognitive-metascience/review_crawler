Previous studies of thermosensitive yeast COPI mutants yielded the surprising conclusion that COPI was dispensable both for the secretion of certain proteins and for Golgi cisternal maturation. To revisit these issues, we optimized the anchor-away method, which allows peripheral membrane proteins such as COPI to be sequestered rapidly by adding rapamycin. Video fluorescence microscopy revealed that COPI inactivation causes an early Golgi protein to remain in place while late Golgi proteins undergo cycles of arrival and departure. These dynamics generate partially functional hybrid Golgi structures that contain both early and late Golgi proteins, explaining how secretion can persist when COPI has been inactivated. Our findings suggest that cisternal maturation involves a COPI-dependent pathway that recycles early Golgi proteins, followed by multiple COPI-independent pathways that recycle late Golgi proteins.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.13232.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.13232.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13232.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Proteins play many important roles for cells, and these roles often require the proteins to be in particular locations in or around the cells. A set of cell compartments called the Golgi packages certain proteins into bubble-like structures called vesicles to enable the proteins to be used elsewhere in the cell or released to the outside of the cell, in a process called the secretory pathway. The operation of the secretory pathway requires the Golgi compartments to be continually remodeled.</p><p>Proteins and other materials can be ferried between the compartments of the Golgi by another type of vesicle. These vesicles are coated with a group, or complex, of proteins called COPI, which forms a curved lattice around the vesicles and helps them to capture the materials they will transport. However, it is not clear whether COPI is also involved in remodeling of the Golgi compartments.</p><p>Papanikou, Day et al. addressed this question using a technique called the “anchor-away method” combined with microscopy to study COPI in yeast cells. The yeast were genetically engineered so that COPI activity was effectively shut down in the presence of a drug called rapamycin. The experiments show that COPI is involved in the early stages of remodeling the Golgi compartments, but not the later stages. This finding supports the emerging view of the Golgi as a self-organizing cellular machine, and it provides a framework for uncovering the engineering principles that underlie the secretory pathway.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.13232.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.13232.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>COPI</kwd><kwd>Golgi</kwd><kwd>cisternal maturation</kwd><kwd>Sec7</kwd><kwd>Kex2</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 GM104010</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Glick</surname><given-names>Benjamin S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000015</institution-id><institution>U.S. Department of Energy</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DE-AC02-06CH11357</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Glick</surname><given-names>Benjamin S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32 GM007183</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Day</surname><given-names>Kasey J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Inactivation of the COPI vesicle coat in yeast reveals that COPI recycles early but not late Golgi proteins.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The COPI coat was first visualized nearly 30 years ago on vesicles budding from Golgi cisternae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Orci et al., 1986</xref>). This coat was shown to consist of a soluble heptameric complex that is recruited to Golgi membranes by the small GTPase Arf1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Serafini et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib135">Waters et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib143">Yu et al., 2012</xref>). During vesicle formation, COPI polymerizes to form a curved lattice that captures specific cargoes, including p24 family proteins and certain SNAREs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Beck et al., 2009</xref>). COPI can be divided into the B subcomplex, which consists of α-, β’- and ε-COP, and the F subcomplex, which consists of β-, δ-, γ-, and ζ-COP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Lowe and Kreis, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Gaynor et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Lee and Goldberg, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Jackson, 2014</xref>). In mammalian and plant cells, COPI vesicles bud from cisternae throughout the Golgi stack except for cisternae of the <italic>trans</italic>-Golgi network (TGN), which produces clathrin-coated vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Ladinsky et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib126">Staehelin and Kang, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Klumperman, 2011</xref>). Yet despite this wealth of biochemical, morphological, and structural information, the functions of COPI have been hard to elucidate.</p><p>The strongest data implicate COPI in retrograde transport to the ER. Transmembrane ER resident proteins occasionally escape from the ER, and are then retrieved from the Golgi or ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) in retrograde COPI vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib130">Szul and Sztul, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Barlowe and Miller, 2013</xref>). Some transmembrane ER proteins contain cytosolically-oriented C-terminal KKxx-type signals, which are recognized by COPI for retrieval to the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Cosson and Letourneur, 1997</xref>). COPI also retrieves transmembrane ER proteins that associate with the Rer1 recycling factor, as well as transmembrane ER proteins that contain arginine-based sorting signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Sato et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Michelsen et al., 2007</xref>). Finally, COPI plays a role in retrieving the KDEL receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Orci et al., 1997</xref>), which binds escaped luminal ER proteins. Retrograde COPI vesicles are captured at the ER by the Dsl1 tethering complex in a process that involves recognition of the coat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Ren et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib145">Zink et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>COPI also plays a role in intra-Golgi traffic, but the evidence is open to multiple interpretations. Initially the proposal was that COPI vesicles carry secretory cargoes forward from one Golgi cisterna to the next in a “vesicle shuttle” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Malhotra et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Orci et al., 1989</xref>). After the discovery of COPI-mediated Golgi-to-ER recycling, the vesicle shuttle model was extended by proposing that COPI vesicles act as bidirectional carriers in the ER-Golgi system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Pelham, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Rothman, 1996</xref>). However, the idea that COPI vesicles carry secretory cargoes from one cisterna to the next faced the problem that some secretory cargoes are much larger than COPI vesicles. Examples include the cell-surface scales that are secreted by certain algae, and procollagen bundles in mammalian fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Leblond, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Becker et al., 1995</xref>).</p><p>This problem was addressed by the cisternal maturation model, which states that cisternae form at the <italic>cis</italic> face of the Golgi, then move through the stack to the <italic>trans</italic> face, then finally peel off to become secretory vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Glick et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Mironov et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Bonfanti et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Glick and Malhotra, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Pelham, 1998</xref>). Thus, entire cisternae could act as forward carriers for secretory cargoes. COPI vesicles have been proposed to recycle resident Golgi proteins within the organelle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Rabouille and Klumperman, 2005</xref>). Consistent with this idea, resident Golgi proteins have been detected in mammalian COPI vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Martínez-Menárguez et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Malsam et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Gilchrist et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Pellett et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Eckert et al., 2014</xref>)—although conflicting results have been reported in other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Orci et al., 2000a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Cosson et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Kweon et al., 2004</xref>)—and the localization of some yeast and plant Golgi proteins has been shown to involve COPI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib132">Todorow et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib133">Tu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib138">Woo et al., 2015</xref> ). Early versions of the cisternal maturation model postulated that COPI vesicles move in a directed fashion from older to younger cisternae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Glick et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Glick and Malhotra, 1998</xref>). However, no mechanism for such directed movement has yet emerged, suggesting instead that COPI vesicles “percolate” bidirectionally between different cisternae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Orci et al., 2000b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Day et al., 2013</xref>). Regardless of the specific traffic pattern of COPI vesicles within the Golgi, the result is thought to be a net retrograde movement of resident Golgi proteins as the cisternae mature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Glick and Malhotra, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Day et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>The cisternal maturation model does not rule out additional roles for COPI in the traffic of secretory cargoes. For example, some secretory cargoes could move forward through the Golgi on a “fast track” involving anterograde COPI vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Pelham and Rothman, 2000</xref>). This concept is supported by evidence that both resident Golgi proteins and secretory cargoes can be incorporated into COPI vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Orci et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Malsam et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Pellett et al., 2013</xref>). Furthermore, COPI-dependent tubules that connect heterologous cisternae have been implicated in anterograde traffic through the mammalian Golgi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib141">Yang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Park et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>A prediction of current models is that COPI should be required for secretion. According to the vesicle shuttle model, COPI carries secretory cargoes through the Golgi. According to the cisternal maturation model, COPI drives the maturation process, thereby continually regenerating the Golgi cisternae that serve as anterograde carriers for secretory cargoes.</p><p>A second prediction is that COPI should be required for Golgi maturation. Presumably, as a Golgi cisterna matures into a <italic>trans</italic>-Golgi network (TGN) compartment, COPI vesicles bud to remove resident Golgi proteins, thereby helping to drive the Golgi-to-TGN biochemical conversion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Papanikou and Glick, 2014</xref>).</p><p>Both of these predictions about the role of COPI have been tested using the yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>. Golgi stacking was lost during the evolution of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Mowbrey and Dacks, 2009</xref>), but this yeast retains a compartmentalized Golgi that functionally resembles the stacked organelle seen in other organisms, with a late Golgi compartment that corresponds to the mammalian TGN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Papanikou and Glick, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Myers and Payne, 2013</xref>). Surprisingly, when COPI function was disrupted in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> using thermosensitive mutant COPI subunits, secretion was reportedly inhibited for some proteins but not others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Gaynor and Emr, 1997</xref>). Equally surprising results were obtained when a strain with a thermosensitive mutant COPI subunit was examined by video fluorescence microscopy. Golgi maturation can be readily observed in wild-type <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Losev et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Matsuura-Tokita et al., 2006</xref>), and when the COPI mutant strain was imaged at the nonpermissive temperature, maturation was slowed but not blocked (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Matsuura-Tokita et al., 2006</xref>). The mildness of these phenotypes has added to the uncertainty about how COPI acts in the secretory pathway.</p><p>Here, we have reexamined the functions of yeast COPI using a new approach. Yeast COPI was rapidly inactivated using the anchor-away method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Haruki et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Bharucha et al., 2013</xref>), in which FK506-rapamycin binding protein (FKBP) was fused to an “anchor” protein while FKBP-rapamycin binding domain (FRB) was fused to a COPI subunit. Addition of rapamycin caused the FRB-tagged protein to be tethered at the anchor site, thereby preventing COPI from carrying out its cellular activities.</p><p>Fluorescence microscopy revealed that COPI inactivation generated hybrid Golgi structures that contained both early and late Golgi proteins. These structures showed unusual dynamics, with an early Golgi protein often persisting for many minutes while late Golgi proteins underwent relatively normal cycles of arrival and departure. The implication is that COPI selectively drives recycling of early but not of late Golgi proteins. After COPI inactivation, the Golgi remained partially functional, indicating that recycling of early Golgi proteins is dispensable for secretion. This analysis helps to integrate the yeast data into a broader understanding of COPI function.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The two subcomplexes of yeast COPI localize to the early Golgi</title><p>COPI has been assumed to operate in vivo as a stable heptameric complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Hara-Kuge et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Sahlmüller et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib142">Yip and Walz, 2011</xref>). Although COPI can be experimentally separated into the coat-like B subcomplex and the adaptor-like F subcomplex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Beck et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Jackson, 2014</xref>), recent structural data indicate that the two subcomplexes assemble together to generate the coat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Dodonova et al., 2015</xref>). However, an earlier genetic study hinted that different yeast COPI subunits might act in distinct cellular pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Gabriely et al., 2007</xref>). To examine the in vivo distribution of COPI, we used fluorescence microscopy to visualize several COPI subunits in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Gaynor et al., 1998</xref>). The tagged subunits were Sec26 (β-COP), which is part of the F subcomplex, together with either the Sec21 (γ-COP) subunit of the F subcomplex or the Ret1 (α-COP) subunit of the B subcomplex. Gene replacement was used to tag Sec26 with GFP, and then to tag Sec21 or Ret1 with mCherry. In both cases the colocalization at punctate structures was essentially complete (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). This result suggests that the two subcomplexes of COPI are associated in vivo, at least when COPI is bound to membranes.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13232.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Localization of COPI subunits in yeast.</title><p>(<bold><bold>A</bold></bold>) COPI subunits were tagged by gene replacement to generate Sec26-GFP, Sec21-mCherry, or Ret1-mCherry.

COPI colocalized strongly with GFP-Vrg4, which is a GDP-mannose transporter that marks the early Golgi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Dean et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Abe et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Losev et al., 2006</xref>).

Some commonly used FRB variants have the T2098L mutation, which allows binding of rapamycin derivatives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bayle et al., 2006</xref>). The T2098L mutation has also been reported to strengthen the affinity of FRB for FKBP-rapamycin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Grünberg et al., 2010</xref>). Therefore, gene replacement was used to tag Sec21, which is essential for viability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Hosobuchi et al., 1992</xref>), with either wild-type FRB or FRB(T2098L).</p><p>The Sec21-FRB strain grew as well as the strain carrying untagged Sec21, but the Sec21-FRB(T2098L) strain showed a pronounced growth defect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). T2098L is known to be a destabilizing mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib127">Stankunas et al., 2007</xref>), so we suspect that FRB(T2098L) caused degradation of tagged Sec21. Interestingly, the growth defect could be rescued by appending maltose-binding protein (MPB) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) or GFP (data not shown) to the C-terminus of FRB(T2098L). After appending MBP or GFP, the destabilized FRB(T2098L) domain was no longer at an end of the polypeptide chain, and this change may have slowed degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Prakash et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Fishbain et al., 2011</xref>).

Rpl13A-FKBPx2 served as an anchor on ribosomes. When this anchor was present in a rapamycin-resistant strain encoding wild-type Sec21, rapamycin addition had no effect on growth, as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). By contrast, when Sec21 was tagged with FRB, rapamycin completely blocked growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). This experiment employed rapamycin at 1 μg/mL, a concentration that was sufficient for maximal growth inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>A similar analysis was performed using the mitochondrial outer membrane protein OM45 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib140">Yaffe et al., 1989</xref>) as an anchor. As previously observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Cerveny et al., 2001</xref>), tagged and overexpressed OM45 localized to mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). With a strain expressing OM45-FKBPx2 and Sec21-FRB, growth was only partially inhibited by rapamycin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). A likely explanation is that binding of FRB to FKBP-rapamycin is readily reversible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Banaszynski et al., 2005</xref>). If so, then why is the ribosomal anchor more effective than the mitochondrial anchor? We believe the answer is that ribosomes are present throughout the cytoplasm whereas mitochondria have a more restricted location. After dissociating from an Rpl13A-FKBPx2 anchor, Sec21-FRB will quickly be captured again by encountering another ribosome, whereas after dissociating from an OM45-FKBPx2 anchor, Sec21-FRB may have time to function at the Golgi before encountering another mitochondrion.</p><p>To test this hypothesis, we added a double FRB tag to Sec21 while increasing the number of FKBP domains on OM45 to four. These changes were predicted to increase the functional affinity of the anchoring interaction at mitochondria. Indeed, with a strain expressing OM45-FKBPx4 and Sec21-FRBx2, rapamycin completely blocked growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). We also tried constructing a strain that expressed Rpl13A-FKBPx4 and Sec21-FRBx2, but growth was slow, perhaps because the functional affinity of the interaction was high enough to compromise COPI even in the absence of rapamycin (data not shown). In conclusion, growth assays indicate that effective anchoring can be achieved using either Sec21-FRB with a ribosomal Rpl13A-FKBPx2 anchor, or Sec21-FRBx2 with a mitochondrial OM45-FKBPx4 anchor.</p><p>As a control, we verified that anchoring of COPII also caused growth inhibition, as previously observed with <italic>Pichia pastoris</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Bharucha et al., 2013</xref>). For this purpose, we added a single- or double-FRB tag to the essential COPII coat subunit Sec31 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Salama et al., 1997</xref>). The anchors were Rpl13A or OM45, linked to either two or four copies of FKBP. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, all of the strains grew well, even the one with the Rpl13A-FKBPx4/Sec31-FRBx2 combination, and rapamycin blocked growth of all of the strains, even the one with the OM45-FKBPx2/Sec31-FRB combination. Thus, the anchor-away method is effective for inactivating components of the secretory pathway, but different components vary in their sensitivities to specific tag-anchor combinations.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Anchoring Sec21 to mitochondria also displaces other COPI subunits</title><p>For further analysis, we relied mainly on the mitochondrial anchor because rapamycin-driven redistribution of labeled proteins to mitochondria can be easily visualized. The first step was to monitor the time course of the anchor-away process using Sec21-FRBx2-GFP with OM45-FKBPx4. The mitochondria were also labeled with matrix-localized mCherry. Prior to rapamycin addition, Sec21-FRBx2-GFP was present on punctate early Golgi structures that showed no consistent association with mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). At 10 min after addition of rapamycin at 23°C, Sec21-FRBx2-GFP showed substantial association with mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Quantitation of the overlap indicated that this redistribution was maximal by 10–15 min after rapamycin addition, reaching a level of 75–80% colocalization of Sec21-FRBx2-GFP with the mitochondrial matrix marker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). We then examined strains in which Sec21-FRBx2 was nonfluorescent, with the GFP tag fused instead to other COPI subunits. Rapamycin-driven anchoring of Sec21-FRBx2 caused redistribution of Ret1-GFP or Sec26-GFP to mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Thus, the anchor-away method redistributes the entire COPI complex.<fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13232.007</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Visualization of COPI anchoring to mitochondria.</title><p>(<bold><bold>A</bold></bold>) Sec21 tagged with FRBx2-GFP can be anchored to mitochondria containing OM45-FKBPx4.

The anchored COPI was often punctate rather than being evenly distributed over the mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), suggesting that entire Golgi compartments were being tethered. We analyzed cells that contained GFP-Vrg4 as an early Golgi marker and Ret1-mCherry as a COPI marker, plus a blue fluorescent marker for the mitochondrial matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Murley et al., 2013</xref>). Rapamycin-driven anchoring of COPI to mitochondria using Sec21-FRBx2 also displaced GFP-Vrg4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), indicating that at least some of the anchored COPI retained its association with Golgi membranes. Although anchored COPI can still bind to the Golgi, the simultaneous anchoring to mitochondria or ribosomes evidently prevents COPI from performing its essential functions.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Anchoring COPI inhibits recycling to the ER</title><p>If anchored COPI is functionally inactive as suggested by the growth curve analysis, then recycling of proteins from the Golgi to the ER should be inhibited. To test this prediction, we used a construct encoding the transmembrane domain (TMD) of the ER protein Sec71 fused to GFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Sato et al., 2003</xref>). Sec71TMD-GFP localizes to the ER with the aid of the retrieval receptor Rer1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Sato et al., 2003</xref>), which recycles from the Golgi to the ER in a COPI-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Boehm et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Sato et al., 2001</xref>).

These results fit with the growth tests indicating that a single copy of FRB is sufficient to inactivate COPI using the ribosomal anchor, but that two copies of FRB are needed using the mitochondrial anchor (see above).</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> shows that after anchoring COPI, the secretion of some proteins was only weakly inhibited as marked by the arrow, whereas the secretion of other proteins was strongly inhibited as marked by the arrowhead. Many proteins fell between these two extremes, showing extensive but not complete inhibition. Similar results were obtained when the rapamycin concentration was doubled to 2 µg/mL and the drug pretreatment was varied between 5 and 30 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). Moreover, when the FRBx2 tag was placed on Ret1 instead of Sec21, rapamycin inhibited growth and anchored COPI but only partially inhibited secretion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>), mimicking the effects seen with Sec21-FRBx2. Even when both Sec21 and Ret1 were tagged with FRBx2, rapamycin did not fully inhibit secretion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>). Based on these data, we conclude that COPI inactivation allows general secretion to continue at a reduced level, with the magnitude of the reduction varying for different proteins.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>The effects of anchoring COPI resemble the effects of the <italic>sec21-3</italic> mutation</title><p>Because the effects of anchoring COPI are similar to those previously seen after thermal inactivation of COPI in a <italic>sec21-3</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Gaynor and Emr, 1997</xref>), we performed a direct comparison of the two approaches.

To exclude this possibility, we visualized Golgi markers after inactivating COPII. When a strain carrying OM45-FKBPx4 plus Sec31-FRBx2 was treated with rapamycin to anchor COPII, most of the GFP-Vrg4 and Sec7-DsRed were dispersed in the cytoplasm, with the remaining punctate structures showing little colocalization of the two markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). This result is consistent with an earlier report that inactivation of yeast COPII disrupts the Golgi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Morin-Ganet et al., 2000</xref>). Thus, the association of early and late Golgi markers after anchoring COPI is a specific effect.</p><p>To visualize the hybrid Golgi structures at higher resolution, we built on our previous experience with imaging GFP-tagged yeast compartments by correlative fluorescence microscopy and electron tomography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Bhave et al., 2014</xref>). This method was extended to dual-color imaging by visualizing both GFP-Vrg4 and Sec7-DsRed in plastic-embedded samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, insets), and was further enhanced by examining thicker sections with scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) tomography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aoyama et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Hohmann-Marriott et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Sousa et al., 2011</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref> shows Golgi cisternae in untreated cells.

This question was addressed using 4D confocal microscopy. We previously showed that in unperturbed cells expressing GFP-Vrg4 and Sec7-DsRed, a cisterna labels for ~1–3 min with the green early Golgi marker, then loses green fluorescence while acquiring red fluorescence, then labels for ~1–3 min with the red late Golgi marker, then loses red fluorescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Losev et al., 2006</xref>). The same maturation dynamics for GFP-Vrg4 and Sec7-DsRed were seen when a strain expressing the OM45-FKBPx4 anchor plus Sec21-FRBx2 was imaged in the absence of rapamycin (data not shown). By contrast, after the same strain had been incubated with rapamycin for 10 min to inactivate COPI, Golgi dynamics were markedly altered as described below. Rapamycin-driven tethering to mitochondria probably facilitated this analysis by making the Golgi structures less mobile and easier to track.</p><p>After COPI inactivation, two behaviors were evident from the 4D movies (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media3">Video 3</xref>). First, when the early and late Golgi markers were both present in a hybrid structure, the two markers remained closely associated even though the shape of the structure fluctuated rapidly. Second, in many of the hybrid Golgi structures, the Sec7-DsRed marker disappeared and then subsequently returned while the GFP-Vrg4 marker persisted the entire time. An example from <xref ref-type="other" rid="media3">Video 3</xref> is the Golgi structure marked by an arrowhead in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref>. The dynamics of this structure are illustrated in <xref ref-type="other" rid="media4">Video 4</xref>, which was generated by cropping the movie frames and then manually erasing the fluorescence of nearby structures at each time point. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref> shows representative frames from <xref ref-type="other" rid="media4">Video 4</xref> together with a quantitation of the green and red fluorescence intensities for the entire 15-min movie. The red signal lasted for ~4.5 min, then completely disappeared, then returned for ~7 min, then briefly disappeared before beginning to increase once again. A similar pattern was seen with the structure marked by the arrow in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref>, although this structure could be tracked reliably for only ~8.5 min, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="other" rid="media5">Video 5</xref>.

In this case, the red signal disappeared for ~2 min before returning even stronger than before. More generally, although the kinetics varied for different Golgi structures, many of them showed persistent GFP-Vrg4 labeling with alternating high and low levels of Sec7-DsRed labeling.

It has been proposed that Kex2 traffics between the Golgi and prevacuolar endosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib123">Sipos et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">De et al., 2013</xref>), but Kex2 has no known role at prevacuolar endosomes, and the following two results suggest that the major recycling pathway for Kex2 is actually within the Golgi.</p><p>First, we looked for colocalization of Kex2 with markers of the late Golgi or prevacuolar endosomes. The marker for the late Golgi was Sec7. The marker for prevacuolar endosomes was Vps8, a subunit of the CORVET tether (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Arlt et al., 2015</xref>). Late Golgi compartments and prevacuolar endosomes are clearly distinct because in projected confocal images, Sec7-mCherry and Vps8-GFP showed no colocalization apart from a background level that likely represents chance overlap after projection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Arlt et al., 2015</xref>). As a control, we examined Vps10, a vacuolar hydrolase receptor that cycles between the late Golgi and prevacuolar endosomes and localizes to both compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Marcusson et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Cooper and Stevens, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Chi et al., 2014</xref>). Vps10-GFP was present in a subset of the late Golgi structures labeled with Sec7-mCherry and in almost all of the prevacuolar endosomes labeled with Vps8-mCherry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). By contrast, Kex2-GFP colocalized strongly with Sec7-mCherry but showed very little colocalization with Vps8-mCherry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). In some cells, prevacuolar endosomes did contain detectable Kex2-GFP, but this green signal was weak (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10—figure supplement 1</xref>). These results suggest that Kex2 resides in the Golgi, and that cycling through prevacuolar endosomes represents at most a minor pathway for Kex2 trafficking.<fig-group><fig id="fig10" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13232.029</object-id><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>Distinct localization patterns of tagged Vps10 and Kex2.</title><p>(<bold><bold>A</bold></bold>) Vps10-GFP localizes to both the Golgi and prevacuolar endosomes whereas Kex2-GFP is largely restricted to the Golgi. Late Golgi compartments were tagged with Sec7-mCherry, or else prevacuolar endosome compartments were tagged with Vps8-mCherry. The localizations of the Vps10-GFP and Kex2-GFP proteins were then examined with reference to these two compartments.

It was recently reported that Kex2 departs from Golgi cisternae somewhat earlier than Sec7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">McDonold and Fromme, 2014</xref>). We confirmed and extended that result by showing that Kex2-GFP both arrived and departed slightly before Sec7-mCherry, with the two kinetic traces typically offset by 5–20 s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11A</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media6">Video 6</xref>). Thus, a green spot that lacks red fluorescence could represent a Golgi cisterna that has acquired Kex2-GFP and will soon acquire Sec7-mCherry. Alternatively, a green spot that lacks red fluorescence could represent a non-Golgi compartment that contains Kex2-GFP and will never contain Sec7-mCherry. To determine the relative abundance of these two classes of Kex2-GFP-labeled structures, we analyzed <xref ref-type="other" rid="media6">Video 6</xref> and identified the green spots that lacked red fluorescence and that could be reliably tracked for at least 30 s after their initial appearance.

Additional Kex2-GFP-labeled structures that could not be tracked for the full 30 s also acquired Sec7-mCherry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11s1">Figure 11—figure supplement 1</xref>). Therefore, most or all of the structures that label strongly with Kex2-GFP are late Golgi cisternae. The straightforward interpretation of these data is that Kex2 recycles within the Golgi, with kinetics slightly offset from those of Sec7.<fig-group><fig id="fig11" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13232.031</object-id><label>Figure 11.</label><caption><title>Analysis of Kex2 maturation dynamics with functional or inactivated COPI.</title><p>(<bold><bold>A</bold></bold>) Kex2 maturation dynamics are slightly offset from those of Sec7.

The molecular basis of the thermosensitivity is typically unknown, creating uncertainty about whether the mutant protein has been completely inactivated by the temperature shift. Moreover, a thermosensitive mutation may have detrimental effects even at the permissive temperature, in which case cellular functions will be compromised before the experiment begins. Both of these issues have been encountered with thermosensitive COPI mutants. For example, some of the commonly used COPI mutants show variable and relatively weak phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Gaynor and Emr, 1997</xref>). That issue was addressed by isolating the strong <italic>sec21-3</italic> mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Gaynor and Emr, 1997</xref>), but in our hands, Golgi morphology was perturbed in <italic>sec21-3</italic> cells even at the permissive temperature. Thus, thermosensitive mutants have not been ideal for examining the role of COPI in yeast.</p><p>We addressed this problem by using the anchor-away method. Growth tests indicated that wild-type FRB is suitable as a tag for gene replacement while the destabilized FRB(T2098L) mutant is not. With regard to anchors, our initial trials employed an FKBPx2-tagged version of the plasma membrane protein Pma1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Haruki et al., 2008</xref>), but strains expressing Pma1-FKBPx2 had growth defects and were genetically unstable. Better results were obtained with the ribosomal Rpl13A-FKBPx2 anchor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Haruki et al., 2008</xref>). We also generated a mitochondrial OM45-FKBPx4 anchor, which is effective in combination with an FRBx2 tag. Control experiments indicated that these versions of the anchor-away system allow COPI to be inactivated quickly and reliably, and can therefore serve to complement thermosensitive mutants for studying COPI function. COPII can also be inactivated with the anchor-away system, although the response is slightly different than for COPI, indicating that this system needs to be tested for each component that is being inactivated.</p><p>It should be noted that “anchor-away” is something of a misnomer here because the anchored COPI remained associated with Golgi membranes. Thus, when OM45-FKBPx4 was used as the anchor, entire Golgi compartments apparently became tethered to mitochondria. Such an effect is not unexpected because Golgi cisternae are mobile in the yeast cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Wooding and Pelham, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Losev et al., 2006</xref>). Despite retaining its association with Golgi membranes, the anchored COPI was no longer functional as judged by inhibition of cell growth and of Golgi-to-ER recycling, implying that this method is suitable for studying the roles of COPI.</p><p>Our data confirm the earlier conclusion that general secretion is arrested by inactivating COPII but is only partially inhibited by inactivating COPI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Gaynor and Emr, 1997</xref>). However, instead of classifying secretory proteins in a binary fashion as being either COPI-dependent or -independent, we propose that COPI inactivation has a spectrum of effects that range from mild to severe depending on the protein. Among the proteins whose traffic was reported to be severely reduced in <italic>sec21-3</italic> cells at 37°C were the α-factor and carboxypeptidase Y precursors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Gaynor and Emr, 1997</xref>), both of which rely on the ER export receptor Erv29, which recycles from the Golgi to the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Dancourt and Barlowe, 2010</xref>). A plausible interpretation is that for certain secretory proteins, preventing COPI-dependent recycling of the cognate ER export receptors strongly inhibits traffic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Gaynor and Emr, 1997</xref>).</p><p>This line of reasoning raises a question: how can the secretory pathway operate at all after a block in COPI-dependent recycling, given that ER-to-Golgi traffic relies on SNARE proteins that are retrieved to the ER by COPI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Barlowe and Miller, 2013</xref>)? We propose that when COPI is inactivated, the cell replenishes ER-to-Golgi SNAREs through new protein synthesis. Other components such as ER export receptors will also be replenished, but at varying rates depending on their synthesis kinetics. According to this model, COPI inactivation will have the following effects on ER export. (a) COPII vesicle production will be slowed but not halted. (b) For a given secretory protein, the rate of ER export will depend on how rapidly the cognate ER export receptor is replenished and/or how efficiently the protein is packaged into COPII vesicles in the absence of an ER export receptor.</p><p>After a secretory protein leaves the ER, COPI is thought to help drive traffic through the Golgi, yet when yeast COPI is inactivated, proteins can still be secreted. Insight into this puzzle came from fluorescence microscopy. Soon after COPI is inactivated, early and late Golgi proteins change from marking separate compartments to associating with one another in hybrid Golgi structures. These hybrid structures are very dynamic, and we suspect that the compartments containing early and late Golgi markers exchange material, although our analysis cannot determine whether this exchange involves transient fusion events or other types of transport intermediates. In any case, the hybrid Golgi structures have early Golgi character, so secretory proteins can presumably reach these structures in COPII vesicles, and the hybrid Golgi structures show relatively normal cycling of late Golgi components, so secretory proteins can presumably depart to the cell surface in transport carriers. Compared to the unperturbed Golgi, the hybrid Golgi structures may yield altered glycosylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Gaynor and Emr, 1997</xref>) but they are functional for membrane traffic. This analysis plausibly explains how yeast cells can continue to secrete after COPI inactivation.</p><p>While it is interesting to explore the effects of COPI inactivation, the larger goal is to understand the normal role of COPI in Golgi traffic. We have proposed that Golgi maturation occurs in discrete stages, and that the transition from the “carbohydrate synthesis” stage to the “carrier formation” stage involves the COPI-dependent recycling of resident Golgi proteins to younger cisternae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Day et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Papanikou and Glick, 2014</xref>). In yeast, Vrg4 is a marker of the carbohydrate synthesis stage while Sec7 is a marker of the carrier formation stage. As a cisterna acquires Sec7, it loses Vrg4. Loss of Vrg4 probably occurs by COPI-mediated transport, based on genetic, biochemical, and electron microscopic evidence that Vrg4 is recycled in COPI vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Abe et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Mari et al., 2014</xref>). The implication is that if COPI is inactivated, a cisterna could acquire Sec7 while failing to lose Vrg4, thereby generating a hybrid compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12A</xref>).<fig id="fig12" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13232.037</object-id><label>Figure 12.</label><caption><title>Working hypotheses for Golgi protein recycling by COPI-dependent and COPI-independent pathways.</title><p>(<bold><bold>A</bold></bold>) The existence of multiple intra-Golgi recycling pathways can explain why inactivating COPI generates hybrid structures that repeatedly gain and lose late Golgi proteins. Green represents early Golgi proteins that recycle in COPI vesicles, and red represents late Golgi proteins that recycle by COPI-independent pathways. Under normal conditions, early Golgi proteins depart while late Golgi proteins arrive, and then late Golgi proteins depart in turn. When COPI is inactivated, the recycling of early Golgi proteins is inhibited, so when late Golgi proteins arrive, a hybrid structure is generated. This hybrid structure can subsequently lose late Golgi proteins by COPI-independent pathways, and then the process begins again. (<bold><bold>B</bold></bold>) During maturation of the late Golgi, proteins are likely to recycle by several pathways. The thick arrow represents cisternal maturation that occurs during and after conversion to a late Golgi compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Daboussi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Day et al., 2013</xref>). Peripheral membrane proteins such as Sec7 are recruited to late Golgi cisternae by activated GTPases, and are subsequently released from the membrane by GTP hydrolysis. Some transmembrane proteins such as Vps10 travel to the prevacuolar endosome in clathrin-coated vesicles with the aid of the Gga1 and Gga2 adaptors, and then recycle to newly formed late Golgi cisternae with the aid of cargo scaffolds such as retromer. Other transmembrane proteins such as Kex2 are postulated to recycle from older to younger late Golgi cisternae in clathrin-coated vesicles with the aid of the AP-1 adaptor.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.13232.037">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.13232.037</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-13232-fig12-v2.tif"/></fig></p><p>We tested this idea by capturing 4D movies after COPI had been inactivated. As predicted, after COPI inactivation, Golgi structures acquired Sec7-DsRed while failing to lose GFP-Vrg4. This result provides the first direct evidence that COPI plays a role in cisternal maturation. Specifically, we conclude that COPI helps to drive cisternal maturation by recycling early Golgi proteins such as Vrg4 from maturing cisternae. Vrg4 could recycle to younger cisternae either by intra-Golgi traffic, or by Golgi-to-ER traffic followed by delivery to newly forming cisternae. To evaluate these possibilities, we note that when COPII was inactivated by anchoring to mitochondria, GFP-Vrg4 showed no ER accumulation of the type that would be expected if this protein frequently returned to the ER. The data therefore suggest that COPI recycles Vrg4 within the Golgi.</p><p>After a hybrid Golgi structure was generated by COPI inactivation, Sec7-DsRed frequently disappeared from the structure and subsequently reappeared. Thus, the recycling pathway for Sec7 remained functional after COPI inactivation. A likely mechanism for COPI-independent recycling of Sec7 is dissociation from the membrane of one cisterna followed by reassociation with the membrane of a younger cisterna (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12B</xref>). Consistent with this model, Sec7 recruitment to the membrane is known to require activated GTPases, implying that GTP hydrolysis releases Sec7 into the cytosol for another round of recruitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">McDonold and Fromme, 2014</xref>).</p><p>Can late Golgi transmembrane proteins also recycle independently of COPI? Some late Golgi transmembrane proteins traffic to prevacuolar endosomes and back. An example is Vps10, which is delivered to prevacuolar endosomes in clathrin-coated vesicles with the aid of Gga adaptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Costaguta et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Deloche et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Abazeed and Fuller, 2008</xref>). Recycling of Vps10 from prevacuolar endosomes to the Golgi is mediated by the retromer complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Seaman et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Seaman, 2005</xref>). This loop through the prevacuolar endosome is presumably independent of COPI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12B</xref>). Other late Golgi transmembrane proteins may recycle within the Golgi itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib137">Wong and Munro, 2014</xref>). Candidates for such an intra-Golgi recycling pathway include trafficking machinery proteins such as Tlg1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib134">Valdivia et al., 2002</xref>), phospholipid translocases such as Drs2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Liu et al., 2008</xref>), proteins such as Chs3 and Pin2 that reside in the late Golgi before undergoing regulated export to the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib134">Valdivia et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Ritz et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib125">Spang, 2015</xref>), and processing proteases such as Kex2 that act on secretory cargoes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Fuller et al., 1988</xref>). These proteins are often assumed to recycle from early endosomes to the late Golgi, but we found that at least some of the yeast compartments described as early endosomes are identical to the late Golgi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Bhave et al., 2014</xref>), suggesting that the proposed early endosome-to-Golgi recycling pathway could actually be an intra-Golgi recycling pathway. This intra-Golgi recycling pathway might or might not involve COPI.</p><p>To explore this issue, we focused on Kex2, which was described together with Sec7 as one of the first known markers of the yeast Golgi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Franzusoff et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Redding et al., 1991</xref>). By fluorescence microscopy, Kex2 and Sec7 show substantial but incomplete overlap. The existence of structures that label with either Kex2 alone or Sec7 alone can now be explained, by our work plus a recent study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">McDonold and Fromme, 2014</xref>), as being due to an offset in the kinetic behaviors of these two proteins during cisternal maturation. Kex2 arrives at a Golgi cisterna ~5–20 s before Sec7 and then departs ~5–20 s before Sec7. Thus, Kex2 apparently recycles within the Golgi somewhat ahead of Sec7. Our interpretation argues against the view that Kex2 resembles Vps10 in cycling between the Golgi and prevacuolar endosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abazeed et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">De et al., 2013</xref>). Although we occasionally see Kex2-GFP in prevacuolar endosomes, this pool is very small, probably because Kex2 trafficking to prevacuolar endosomes reflects either a secondary recycling pathway or a degradation pathway. The proposed recycling of Kex2 within the Golgi merits further exploration. Meanwhile, we found that COPI inactivation did not prevent recycling of Kex2. This result, together with the finding that COPI is concentrated at the early Golgi, suggests that intra-Golgi recycling of late Golgi transmembrane proteins is independent of COPI.</p><p>A candidate for the carriers that recycle late Golgi transmembrane proteins is clathrin-coated vesicles containing the AP-1 adaptor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12B</xref>). Yeast AP-1 has been implicated in the late Golgi localization of multiple proteins including Tlg1, Drs2, Chs3, and Pin2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib134">Valdivia et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Foote and Nothwehr, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Liu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Barfield et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Myers and Payne, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Ritz et al., 2014</xref>). One study provided evidence that AP-1 also plays a role in Kex2 localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Abazeed and Fuller, 2008</xref>). Those data have been thought to reflect a recycling pathway from early endosomes, but yeast AP-1 localizes to the late Golgi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Daboussi et al., 2012</xref>), supporting the alternative view that AP-1 mediates recycling from older to younger cisternae at a late stage in Golgi maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib134">Valdivia et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Liu et al., 2008</xref>). We speculate that Kex2 recycling involves AP-1, which might act in conjunction with the co-adaptor Ent5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Costaguta et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Copic et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Daboussi et al., 2012</xref>). In mammalian cells, the functions attributed to AP-1 include retrograde transport from recycling endosomes and TGN-derived transport carriers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Hirst et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Bonifacino, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Matsudaira et al., 2015</xref>), and those pathways are potentially analogous to recycling within the late Golgi of yeast.</p><p>AP-1-containing retrograde vesicles may be captured at the yeast Golgi by effectors of Ypt6, a Rab GTPase that is recruited prior to Sec7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib129">Suda et al., 2013</xref>). One Ypt6 effector is the GARP complex, which has been implicated in endosome-to-Golgi recycling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Bonifacino and Hierro, 2011</xref>) but could also play a similar role in intra-Golgi recycling. Another Ypt6 effector is the Sgm1 tether (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Siniossoglou and Pelham, 2001</xref>), and intriguingly, the homologous TMF tether in mammalian cells captures intra-Golgi transport carriers carrying late Golgi proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib137">Wong and Munro, 2014</xref>). The roles of Ypt6 effectors and AP-1 in late Golgi recycling can be tested in yeast using approaches like the ones described here.</p><p>Our working hypothesis is that yeast Golgi maturation involves distinct pathways that act in sequence. At the early Golgi, transmembrane proteins are recycled by intra-Golgi COPI vesicles. At the late Golgi, proteins are recycled by multiple mechanisms that involve either transit through the cytosol, or traffic to prevacuolar endosomes and back, or retrograde transport from older to younger cisternae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12B</xref>). An open question is how these various pathways are coordinated to maintain organellar homeostasis.</p><p>When COPI is inactivated, Golgi compartmentation is lost, and when Golgi compartmentation is lost, COPI is no longer needed for secretion. We interpret these findings to mean that Golgi compartmentation and COPI-driven cisternal maturation are aspects of the same phenomenon. Although Golgi compartmentation is broadly conserved, and is thought to provide fine control of glycan assembly while keeping secretory cargoes in the organelle long enough for complete processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib128">Stanley, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Ruiz-May et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Day et al., 2013</xref>), some organisms such as microsporidia forgo Golgi compartmentation and rely instead on a fused Golgi network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Beznoussenko et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib131">Takvorian et al., 2013</xref>). Yet COPI components are present in microsporidia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Beznoussenko et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Mowbrey and Dacks, 2009</xref>), perhaps because an efficient secretory pathway always requires Golgi-to-ER recycling, even with a non-compartmentalized Golgi. In this view, Golgi-to-ER recycling is the core function of COPI, and many eukaryotes have adapted COPI for the additional purpose of maintaining separate Golgi compartments through cisternal maturation.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Strains and plasmids</title><p>Experiments were done with derivatives of the haploid <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> strain JK9-3da, which carries the mutations <italic>leu2-3,112 ura3-52 rme1 trp1 his4</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Kunz et al., 1993</xref>).

The previous decision letter after peer review is shown below.]</p><p>Thank you for choosing to send your work entitled &quot;COPI selectively drives maturation of the early Golgi&quot; for consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your full submission has been evaluated by Vivek Malhotra (Senior editor) and three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the decision was reached after discussions between the reviewers. Based on our discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. While the reviewers lauded the high quality of your study, the consensus view was that the advances that it presents do not carry the significance required to merit publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. In addition, as described in the comments from Reviewer 3 (point 2), your argument that Kex2 recycles within the Golgi, rather than from the endosome to the Golgi, is undermined by a published report (Suda et al, 2013). The reviews are included in their entirety below.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>This is an investigation of the role of COPI in the secretory pathway. The authors have optimized the anchor-away technique as a means to rapidly inactivate COPI function in yeast cells in order to assess the consequences to the maturation of Golgi cisternae and to secretion. They report that the transition from an early cisterna, marked by GFP-Vrg4, to a late cisterna, marked by Sec7-GFP, fails upon inactivation of COPI. In contrast, a maturation event monitored by Kex2-GFP dynamics is not affected, leading the authors to conclude that COPI is required solely for recycling of early Golgi proteins.</p><p>This is a carefully executed, nicely presented study and I don't have any serious technical concerns, as much of the paper is an extensive validation of the anchor away approach. The significance of the major points of the work, however, is lessened by several factors.</p><p>1) Prior reports (esp. Todorow et al, 2000; Tu et al. Science, 2008; Tu et al. 2012) implicated a role for COPI in Golgi localization of multiple early/medial Golgi residents in yeast cells via recycling through the ER. Although this paper more directly visualizes a role for COPI for recycling of an early Golgi resident (Vrg4), the advance presented here is modest and questions regarding the role of COPI recycling pathway remain to be addressed. Does COPI direct Vrg4 to the ER, or to an earlier Golgi compartment? Related, Rizzo et al. (2013) provided evidence that an artificial Golgi resident based on mannosidase II (MAN-FM) recycles via COPI vesicles/tubules from the trans Golgi cisterna of HeLa cells. Is Vrg4 recognized by COPI?</p><p>2) As the authors point out, it has been established that multiple late Golgi proteins (including Kex2) rely on AP-1/clathrin to maintain Golgi residence, and that COPI localizes predominantly to early Golgi compartments, so the finding that COPI inactivation does not prevent removal of Kex2 from the hybrid Golgi compartment is not unexpected. Further, I don't find the argument that Kex2 recycles within the Golgi (rather than from endosomes to the Golgi) to be sufficiently substantiated.</p><p>3) This work confirms, and modestly elaborates, that secretion of some proteins continues in COPI temperature sensitive mutants (Gaynor and Emr, 1998), which was shown many years ago (as the authors point out).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>In this study, the authors test the effects of functional removal of the COPI machinery on protein secretion and cisternal maturation in yeast. Previous studies with thermosensitive COPI mutants had indicated that COPI ablation inhibits the secretion of certain proteins, but not of others, and that it slows down, but does not block, cisternal maturation.</p><p>They now use a potentially 'cleaner' and more radical approach based on anchoring away specific COPI subunits to revisit the same issues. Using this technique, they find that secretion is strongly inhibited, although to different extents for different proteins, and that the maturation process and the organization of the Golgi are markedly altered. In control cells, early cisternae lose their residents to newly forming cis elements and simultaneously acquire trans Golgi markers, which they later loose, presumably during formation of secretory post Golgi carriers. In cells where COPI is inactivated by the anchoring away approach, early and late Golgi residents merge (partially) into a hybrid compartment, where they behave differently: the cis residents become unable to cycle and remain stably in this compartment (suggesting that they normally cycle through COPI) while trans residents can still cycle on and off the hybrid Golgi body though with delayed kinetics (suggesting that they cycle via a COPI- independent mechanism).</p><p>The authors interpret these data in the framework of the cisternal maturation scheme: because of the loss of COPI, the maturation process is inhibited at the cis side and cis-cisternae are 'stabilized'; they can thus serve as 'acceptors' of the trans residents, resulting in a hybrid Golgi. This hybrid compartment can still absorb input from the ER and release secretory material towards the surface, albeit at slow rates.</p><p>What are the new and important statements made by this study? One is that COPI is essential for recycling of cis residents. While the role of COPI in recycling from the Golgi to the ER was a relatively well established fact, this was not the case for the intra-Golgi stage. The other is that the cycling of trans Golgi residents is COPI-independent, and this represents a surprise. The mechanism of cisternal maturation is obviously an important issue in membrane biology and these findings represent a potentially significant advance.</p><p>The study is technically very thorough and the factual statements are convincing and well supported. We feel, however, that it has limitations, in that it leaves some essential question open and inconsistencies unresolved. Certain key issues should be addressed by suitable arguments and/or by additional experiments.</p><p>The main problem relates to the difference between the previous results based on thermosensitive mutants and the present ones based on the anchoring away approach. The anchoring method, as noted by the authors, results in the adhesion of the whole Golgi cisternae to the mitochondria, rather than in the 'removal' of the COPI machinery from Golgi cisternae. The results of this are hard to predict and may not always be congruent with the specific inactivation of the concerned proteins. It is conceivable that the strong block in recycling of the cis-Golgi residents might be due to extensive proximity/adhesion between Golgi and mitochondrial membrane, rather than to a specific block of the COPI function. This possibility undermines the author's central conclusions about the role of COPI in the recycling of cis residents and should be appropriately discussed or addressed experimentally. Some relevant questions and considerations and some possible approaches are suggested below:</p><p>1) A re-examination of the ultrastructure of the Golgi-mitochondria contact due to anchoring might help. How extensive are the contacting surfaces? Does the morphology of these contacts justify the above doubts about the effects of anchoring on recycling?</p><p>2) Could the anchoring of the Golgi membranes to mitochondria through a COP-unrelated cis-Golgi protein reproduce the recycling block?</p><p>3) The authors obtain similar results by anchoring COPI to ribosomes, which might be less likely than mitochondria to severely obstruct membrane exchanges at the Golgi surface. Exploiting and characterizing the ribosome data at the ultrastructural level might help resolve the issue.</p><p>4) Another approach might be to consider that while early Golgi markers are blocked, late markers keep cycling. How are they disposed with respect to the contacting Golgi and mitochondrial surfaces?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>This study from the Glick lab uses the anchor-away technique to inactivate the COPI complex in order to examine its role in Golgi maturation. The authors begin with a thorough analysis of the anchor-away method for inactivating COPI proteins. The analysis is aided by comparisons to anchor-away inactivation of the COPII complex.</p><p>The most surprising finding is that secretion is not completely blocked when COPI is inactivated. Anchoring-away different COPI subunits results in similar secretion phenotype. The secretion phenotype also appears identical when comparing COPI inactivation by anchor-away versus ts-mutant (sec21-3). The authors show that anchor-away is preferable to thermosensitivity because at permissive temperature the sec21-3 mutant appears compromised (Golgi morphology defects), meaning that indirect effects may be observed when using this mutant.</p><p>Anchor-away is used to show that Golgi dynamics are dramatically altered upon inactivation of COPI, although post-Golgi recycling appears to still occur. In wild-type cells, it is shown that the Kex2 transmembrane protein, a cargo that cycles between the Golgi and endosomes, normally appears at Golgi compartments after the peak of the Vrg4 transmembrane protein, a marker for early Golgi compartments. Kex2 remains present while Sec7 appears at that compartment, and Kex2 then leaves the compartment before the Sec7 signal completely disappears. However, in COPI-inactivated cells there are two major differences: First, the morphology of the compartments are quite different, with early and late markers showing partial colocalization to larger &quot;hybrid&quot; compartments. Second, in mutant cells maturation is altered so that compartments labeled with an early marker (Vrg4) persist for a longer time while later markers/cargos (Sec7 and Kex2) appear to cycle in and out of the &quot;hyrbrid&quot; compartment.</p><p>Given these results, the authors conclude that COPI is important for maturation and recycling of the early Golgi, but dispensable for late Golgi function. I agree that this overall conclusion is generally supported by the data, and I think this is a very important result that warrants publication in a journal like <italic>eLife</italic>. However, I have a couple of major concerns that need to be addressed before I would consider the manuscript to be suitable for publication:</p><p>1) One potential concern is that the anchored-away COPI proteins are still associated with the Golgi. Although cell growth is blocked by anchoring COPI, given the resolution of the growth curve data it is a formal possibility that partial COPI activity remains, and growth may not halt until after 1 or 2 more cell divisions. This might affect the interpretation of the data (especially the secretion phenotype), if partial COPI activity remains. The authors imply that because the sec21-3 mutant displays an identical secretion phenotype to the anchor-away COPI phenotype, it is likely that both methods result in complete inactivation of COPI. However, I think the authors need to demonstrate that the Golgi-ER COPI trafficking pathway is completely blocked by anchor-away inactivation of COPI. There are various &quot;retrieval assays&quot; in the literature. Another option would be to test by microscopy whether a protein that normally cycles between the ER and Golgi (i.e. a p24 protein or other cycling ER cargo receptor) is now exclusively found in the Golgi.</p><p>2) In the second half of the Discussion, the authors propose that AP-1 traffics Kex2 directly from late Golgi to early Golgi compartments. This would be a fairly radical idea, and would upend the current model that AP-1 traffics Kex2 from the Golgi to endosomes, and then Kex2 is retrieved from endosomes back to the Golgi by other machinery. Yet the only data provided specifically in support of this new model is the statement &quot;our video microscopy revealed that most and perhaps all of the Kex2-labeled compartments acquire Sec7, suggesting that Kex2 recycles from older to younger cisternae within the Golgi&quot;. I disagree with both the data and interpretations contained in this statement. First, by watching their videos it appears that there are a few smaller Kex2 structures that may disappear without acquiring Sec7. Second, if we assume the first part of the statement is correct, this observation is consistent with Kex2 being retrieved from endosomes (where it may reside for only a few seconds), via vesicles, to Golgi compartments that have not yet acquired Sec7. To my knowledge, the precise Golgi compartment that fuses with endosomally-derived vesicles has not been firmly established in yeast, but the Nakano lab found that Ypt6 precedes Sec7 at the Golgi (PNAS 2013). As Ypt6 (together with the GARP complex) is primarily responsible for tethering/fusing vesicles from endosomes, this suggests Kex2 retrieval from endosomes to the Golgi occurs at a stage of Golgi maturation just prior to acquisition of Sec7. Therefore, it seems unfounded to propose a role for AP-1 in recycling cargos from late Golgi to early Golgi compartments.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what now follows is the decision letter after the authors submitted for further consideration.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;COPI selectively drives maturation of the early Golgi&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Randy Schekman (Senior editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a Member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining minor issues that the reviewers feel should be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>The reviewers recommend that you address the following points with revisions to the text:</p><p>1) Reviewer 1 and Reviewer 2 raise the issue that the anchor away approach that you employed results in different outcomes for Golgi residents when compared to the sec21-3 mutant and a Vps74/Golph3 mutant. They feel that this should be directly addressed in the Discussion. The comments from Reviewer 1 and 2 (below) elaborate this point.</p><p>2) Since the arrested cisterna ('hybrid compartment') appears to remain competent to receive ER-derived material, and to export material, a brief discussion of the implications of this with regard to interpreting the results from both a cisternal maturation mechanism and a stable compartment mechanism of transport should be included in the Discussion. The comments from Reviewer 2 are most relevant for this point.</p><p>3) Can the authors clarify in the text which of the studies cited in the Discussion (tenth paragraph) demonstrated that AP-1 was involved in Kex2 trafficking and describe the Kex2-localization phenotype(s) seen previously by others in AP-1 mutant strains?</p><p>The entire reviews from each of the referees are included below to help you appreciate their suggestions. Addressing any other points raised in the reviews is left to your discretion.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>In light of the observation that the anchor away approach results in entire COPI-coated cisternae to be associated with mitochondria, a major point of discussion amongst the reviewers during review of the earlier version of the manuscript regarded the question, does the technical approach (anchor away) impinge on cisterna function independently of COPI? It is puzzling to me that in the sec21-3 mutant (permissive temperature) GFP-Vrg4 transits the Golgi and is sorted to the vacuole, but it remains in place (in the hybrid compartment) in anchor away cells. The reason may lie in incomplete inactivation of COPI in the sec21-3 mutant (the figure shows permissive temperature), but difference in outcome is striking and begs resolution. The only way that I can think of that might meaningfully address this would be to compare results with 'inert' anchor away targets. What, for example, happens when if FRB is appended to a Golgi resident (e.g., Vrg4), so that the cisterna is addressed to the mitochondrion, but COPI is not manipulated? Despite this shortcoming, I think that in its present form the manuscript makes an important contribution to the field, even though the message, as summarized in the title, may be open to continuing debate.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>In this study, the authors test the effects of inactivating the COPI complex on cisternal maturation and protein secretion in yeast. Previous studies with thermosensitive COPI mutants had indicated that COPI inactivation inhibits the secretion of many but not all proteins (Gaynor and Emr), and that it slows down, but does not block, cisternal maturation as visualized by live microscopy (Matsuura-Tokita and Nakano).</p><p>The authors attribute these inconclusive results to the fact that the available ts mutants can be either still partially active (Matsuura-Tokita and Nakano) or, when fully inactive, can markedly perturb the morphology of the Golgi (this manuscript), making it impossible to monitor directly the maturation process by live microscopy.</p><p>To resolve these uncertainties, they use the anchoring-away technique applied to specific COPI subunits. They find that COPI inactivation results in complete block of the recycling of the cis Golgi marker Vrg4, which now permanently labels the cis cisternae. This indicates that Vrg4 normally recycles through COPI. Moreover, they find that trans-Golgi residents (Sec7 and Kex2) partially merge with these stabilized cis cisternae, forming hybrid cis/trans Golgi bodies; and also that these trans markers cycle on and off the hybrid structures (though with somewhat delayed kinetics). This suggests that these markers cycle via a COPI-independent mechanism.</p><p>The study is technically very thorough and the factual statements are convincing and well supported. My comments will therefore concern only the novelty and the significance of the results.</p><p>As the authors emphasize, their data are the first direct demonstration that COPI is required for cisternal maturation. Evidence that COPI is required for maintaining the localization of Golgi residents (via Vps74/Golph3) has been available for some time (e.g., Tu and Banfield), but these previous observations are compatible both with the stable cisternae model and the cisternal maturation model. Thus, while not unexpected, these results are an important step towards establishing the molecular mechanism of cisternal maturation, and in principle deserve publication in a major journal such as <italic>eLife</italic>. They also raise the following questions and comments.</p><p>The stabilization of cis Golgi markers in cis cisternae probably results from the specific type of COPI inactivation that is induced by the anchoring-away approach, which causes COPI to remain bound to the cis Golgi and so possibly to retain cis markers in the cis cisterna. However, the stabilization of the cis Golgi it is not the only possible outcome of COPI inactivation, under the maturation model. One might imagine, for instance, that if COPI were inactivated in a different way, e.g., by rapid degradation, this might cause cis markers to move forward along with cargo proteins to reach the vacuole or the plasma membrane. This is actually what happens when the COPI-bound adaptor Vps74 is removed: the Golgi enzymes leave the Golgi and move to the vacuole (Tu-Banfield). This apparent discrepancy might disconcert the reader. I therefore feel that the above point should be discussed, even though it does not in my view undermine the conclusion that COPI is needed for cis Golgi maturation.</p><p>The authors appear to interpret the data in the framework of the cisternal maturation scheme. However, the observation that the hybrid compartment can still absorb input from the ER and release secretory material towards the surface, albeit at slow rates, is difficult to reconcile with the maturation model. Since the recycling of cis markers is inhibited, and the formation of a new cis cisterna (a necessary step in the cisternal maturation mechanism) requires such recycling, a logical suggestion deriving from these data would be that the hybrid Golgi incorporates cargo and membrane from the ER by a mechanism different from cisternal maturation. In my view, these results are consistent with the idea that the main intra-Golgi transport mechanism is cisternal maturation, but they also suggest the existence of secondary mechanisms that are used by some protein classes, and/or of backup mechanisms used by the system when maturation fails. Again, I feel that, in order to avoid confusing the reader in a field that is already rich in controversies, the authors should discuss these issues, which, incidentally, are referred to also in the Introduction.</p><p>As noted, we do not have comments worthy of mention regarding the (high) technical quality of the figures and in general of the data.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>This work convincingly clarifies the role of COPI, providing further evidence for a primary function in retrograde trafficking that is important for Golgi maturation. I think the authors now do a good job of explaining why some cargos are more sensitive to COPI inactivation than others, and how a basal level of secretion can be supported in the absence of COPI function. Furthermore, they have clarified the itinerary of Kex2. Therefore, I am in support of publication.</p><p>My only remaining concern is a relatively minor one, which I would expect could be addressed through small changes in the text: Can the authors clarify in the text which of the studies cited in the Discussion (tenth paragraph) demonstrated that AP-1 was involved in Kex2 trafficking and describe the Kex2-localization phenotype(s) seen previously by others in AP-1 mutant strains? In other words, what is the existing evidence in the literature that led to the model of AP-1 functioning in Kex2 traffic between the Golgi and endosomes? Furthermore, can the authors briefly discuss the established role of AP-1 in mammalian cells (i.e., papers from Bonifacino and other labs), and whether the authors think AP-1 has similar or different functions in yeast? I think explicitly addressing these points will help readers to better understand the insights from the current data in light of previous studies.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13232.041</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the previous round of peer review follow.]</p><p>An issue with the initial submission was that we got ahead of ourselves by building the interpretations on additional data from ongoing work. The COPI results have inspired us to explore the relationship between endosomes and the Golgi, and we have obtained evidence that yeast cells lack an early endosome compartment that is distinct from the TGN. That story is still coming together, but last year we published a crucial result by showing that compartments previously termed early endosomes are actually identical to the Sec7-labeled TGN (M. Bhave et al., 2014, J. Cell Sci. 127:250-7). As described below, an implication is that many late Golgi proteins likely recycle within the Golgi. This unconventional idea is justified more thoroughly in the revised manuscript and is presented as a working hypothesis.</p><p>The revision also includes two new data figures. First, as suggested by a reviewer, we confirm that our COPI inactivation protocol inhibits Golgi-to-ER recycling. Second, because our inferences about Kex2 trafficking were a concern for the reviewers, we quantitatively characterize Kex2 localization and dynamics. The major contributions in the revised manuscript are as follows:</p><p>• We use 4D microscopy of GFP-Vrg4 to provide clear evidence that Golgi maturation requires COPI. Yeast 4D microscopy is the only method available for directly visualizing cisternal maturation. <italic>This advance answers a central and long-standing question in the field.</italic></p><p>• We show that when COPI is functionally inactivated, the yeast Golgi reorganizes into hybrid structures that remain dynamic with respect to the cycling of late Golgi components. This result can explain the puzzling earlier observation, reproduced and extended here, that the yeast secretory pathway remains partly operational in the absence of COPI function.</p><p>• We provide a carefully controlled analysis of the anchor-away method, which has attracted considerable interest. Our data document the effects of various parameters as well as strengths and limitations of the method.</p><p>• We provide evidence that Kex2 cycles within the Golgi rather than between endosomes and the Golgi as is generally assumed. Although this conclusion will benefit from further validation, the present results establish Kex2 as a model protein for studying COPI- independent intra-Golgi recycling.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p><italic>[…] This is a carefully executed, nicely presented study and I don't have any serious technical concerns, as much of the paper is an extensive validation of the anchor away approach. The significance of the major points of the work, however, is lessened by several factors.</italic> </p><p><italic>1) Prior reports (esp. Todorow et al, 2000; Tu et al. Science, 2008; Tu et al. 2012) implicated a role for COPI in Golgi localization of multiple early/medial Golgi residents in yeast cells via recycling through the ER. Although this paper more directly visualizes a role for COPI for recycling of an early Golgi resident (Vrg4), the advance presented here is modest and questions regarding the role of COPI recycling pathway remain to be addressed. Does COPI direct Vrg4 to the ER, or to an earlier Golgi compartment? Related, Rizzo et al. (2013) provided evidence that an artificial Golgi resident based on mannosidase II (MAN-FM) recycles via COPI vesicles/tubules from the trans Golgi cisterna of HeLa cells. Is Vrg4 recognized by COPI?</italic> </p><p>The papers mentioned by the reviewer are relevant and we now cite them in the Introduction. But while a role for COPI in the recycling of resident Golgi proteins has some experimental support, the COPI data from both yeast and mammalian studies have been confusing. For example:</p><p>• Yeast COPI subunits were originally implicated in anterograde ER-to-Golgi transport. That interpretation is no longer favoured, probably because the early papers reported indirect effects.</p><p>• Rizzo et al. did indeed provide evidence in 2013 that a resident Golgi protein could recycle from mammalian <italic>trans</italic>-Golgi cisternae as predicted by the maturation model, but a 2013 paper by Lavieu et al. (published in <italic>eLife</italic>) concluded that mammalian Golgi cisternae do not mature. The discrepancies between those parallel studies have yet to be resolved.</p><p>• Gaynor and Emr (1997) reported that COPI is dispensable for the secretion of some yeast proteins. To our minds, that paper has long been the most baffling in the field, because the experimental data were strong and yet the conclusion was seemingly at odds with all extant models for Golgi traffic.</p><p>Video microscopy of the yeast Golgi is currently the only direct assay for cisternal maturation, and our results with GFP-Vrg4 are the first direct evidence that maturation requires COPI. We believe that this advance is more than modest. Others in the field apparently agree that this sort of analysis is crucial because the Nakano lab is also trying to characterize how COPI inactivation affects Golgi dynamics.</p><p>Finally, an interaction of Vrg4 with COPI was nicely shown by Abe et al. (2004), and that evidence was one of our motivations for using Vrg4 as an early Golgi marker. The reviewer points out that we cannot say with certainty that Vrg4 recycles within the Golgi rather than returning to the ER. However, when we inactivated COPII by the anchor-away method, GFP- Vrg4 showed no ER accumulation (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>), implying that Vrg4 does not cycle rapidly back to the ER. We now discuss this point in the text.</p><p><italic>2) As the authors point out, it has been established that multiple late Golgi proteins (including Kex2) rely on AP-1/clathrin to maintain Golgi residence, and that COPI localizes predominantly to early Golgi compartments, so the finding that COPI inactivation does not prevent removal of Kex2 from the hybrid Golgi compartment is not unexpected. Further, I don't find the argument that Kex2 recycles within the Golgi (rather than from endosomes to the Golgi) to be sufficiently substantiated.</italic> </p><p>We got ahead of ourselves in the initial submission by inadequately justifying the proposal that Kex2 recycles within the Golgi. That limitation has been overcome with the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref> and accompanying supplementary data.</p><p>The COPI results inspired us to consider the possibility that late Golgi membrane proteins undergo intra-Golgi recycling. That idea has received surprisingly little attention. While pursuing it, we obtained evidence that yeast cells lack an early endosome compartment that is distinct from the TGN. Although that story is still coming together, last year we published a crucial result by showing that compartments previously termed early endosomes, as judged by labeling with newly internalized FM 4-64, are actually identical to the Sec7-labeled TGN (M. Bhave et al., 2014, J. Cell Sci. 127:250-7).</p><p>If we provisionally accept that there is no yeast early endosome distinct from the TGN, then a simple argument can be made:</p><p>• AP-1 has been shown to mediate recycling of a subset of late Golgi membrane proteins in yeast;</p><p>• AP-1 has been shown to localize to the TGN. Our ongoing work confirms data from the Payne lab indicating that AP-1 is found on Sec7-labeled compartments;</p><p>• The implication is that AP-1 mediates recycling of a subset of late Golgi proteins from the TGN to earlier Golgi compartments.</p><p>In light of this working hypothesis and the data presented here, a reasonable supposition is that Kex2 undergoes AP-1-dependent and COPI-independent intra-Golgi recycling. We are excited about this unconventional model, which is shown in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12B</xref>.</p><p><italic>3) This work confirms, and modestly elaborates, that secretion of some proteins continues in COPI temperature sensitive mutants (Gaynor and Emr, 1998), which was shown many years ago (as the authors point out).</italic> </p><p>The reason for our emphasis on the Gaynor and Emr (1997) paper is that it was the most careful prior analysis of the role of yeast COPI in Golgi traffic, and it was apparently inconsistent with cisternal maturation. At first we suspected that even the strong <italic>sec21-3</italic> mutation was unable to block COPI function completely. But after optimizing the anchor-away method, we concluded that yeast can indeed secrete without functional COPI. That result urgently needed an explanation.</p><p>Our data now provide a plausible explanation. When yeast COPI is inactivated, the Golgi forms a hybrid structure that can presumably continue to receive input from the ER, and late Golgi components of this structure continue to cycle in a manner consistent with ongoing secretory activity. We have therefore addressed the primary argument against an involvement of COPI in yeast Golgi maturation.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p><italic>[…] The study is technically very thorough and the factual statements are convincing and well supported. We feel, however, that it has limitations, in that it leaves some essential question open and inconsistencies unresolved. Certain key issues should be addressed by suitable arguments and/ or by additional experiments.</italic> </p><p><italic>The main problem relates to the difference between the previous results based on thermosensitive mutants and the present ones based on the anchoring away approach. The anchoring method, as noted by the authors, results in the adhesion of the whole Golgi cisternae to the mitochondria, rather than in the 'removal' of the COPI machinery from Golgi cisternae. The results of this are hard to predict and may not always be congruent with the specific inactivation of the concerned proteins. It is conceivable that the strong block in recycling of the cis-Golgi residents might be due to extensive proximity/adhesion between Golgi and mitochondrial membrane, rather than to a specific block of the COPI function. This possibility undermines the author's central conclusions about the role of COPI in the recycling of cis residents and should be appropriately discussed or addressed experimentally. Some relevant questions and considerations and some possible approaches are suggested below:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) A re-examination of the ultrastructure of the Golgi-mitochondria contact due to anchoring might help. How extensive are the contacting surfaces? Does the morphology of these contacts justify the above doubts about the effects of anchoring on recycling?</italic> </p><p><italic>2) Could the anchoring of the Golgi membranes to mitochondria through a COP-unrelated cis-Golgi protein reproduce the recycling block?</italic> </p><p><italic>3) The authors obtain similar results by anchoring COPI to ribosomes, which might be less likely than mitochondria to severely obstruct membrane exchanges at the Golgi surface. Exploiting and characterizing the ribosome data at the ultrastructural level might help resolve the issue.</italic> </p><p><italic>4) Another approach might be to consider that while early Golgi markers are blocked, late markers keep cycling. How are they disposed with respect to the contacting Golgi and mitochondrial surfaces?</italic> </p><p>We were not overjoyed to learn that when COPI was anchored to mitochondria, the Golgi cisternae were anchored as well. This experiment arguably falls in the “one control too many” category. Yet the Golgi-mitochondria association is not surprising in hindsight because Golgi cisternae in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> are mobile, and nothing should prevent anchored COPI from interacting with and capturing mobile cisternae. Fortunately, all of our data, including the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, indicate that mitochondrially anchored COPI is disabled for membrane traffic.</p><p>We believe that the concerns and suggestions from the reviewer are addressed by the ribosomal anchoring data. If mitochondrial anchoring had specific effects, then ribosomal anchoring should have different effects, but we saw essentially identical results with the two types of anchor.</p><p>A more extensive analysis of the Golgi-mitochondria association could be carried out. However, that approach is very labor-intensive, and we are unsure how much more insight would be gained.</p><p>We hope the reviewer will appreciate that our characterization of COPI anchoring to mitochondria is an attempt to be thorough in exploring the strengths and limitations of the anchor-away method. In the end, our judgment is that this method provides an efficient way to inactivate COPI.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3: 1) One potential concern is that the anchored-away COPI proteins are still associated with the Golgi. Although cell growth is blocked by anchoring COPI, given the resolution of the growth curve data it is a formal possibility that partial COPI activity remains, and growth may not halt until after 1 or 2 more cell divisions. This might affect the interpretation of the data (especially the secretion phenotype), if partial COPI activity remains. The authors imply that because the sec21-3 mutant displays an identical secretion phenotype to the anchor-away COPI phenotype, it is likely that both methods result in complete inactivation of COPI. However, I think the authors need to demonstrate that the Golgi-ER COPI trafficking pathway is completely blocked by anchor-away inactivation of COPI. There are various &quot;retrieval assays&quot; in the literature. Another option would be to test by microscopy whether a protein that normally cycles between the ER and Golgi (i.e. a p24 protein or other cycling ER cargo receptor) is now exclusively found in the Golgi.</italic> </p><p>We note that a gradual increase in OD<sub>600</sub> is common for <italic>sec</italic> mutants at the nonpermissive temperature as the cells become denser, and a similar effect could explain the small increase in OD<sub>600</sub> after anchoring COPI.</p><p>The reviewer points out that we cannot fully exclude the possibility that COPI retains residual activity. We have done our best by anchoring different COPI subunits alone or in combination, and by varying the rapamycin concentration and the duration of rapamycin treatment. No matter how hard we tried to inactivate COPI, secretion persisted. Those results fit with the data from Gaynor and Emr (1997), who used the strongest available COPI thermosensitive mutants. Ultimately, we concluded that yeast cells can almost certainly continue to secrete at some level in the absence of functional COPI.</p><p>Given the importance of this point, an additional control is merited. Thanks to the reviewer for the excellent suggestion of examining Golgi-to-ER retrograde traffic. The Sec71TMD-GFP construct from Sato and Nakano proved to be a suitable marker because it localizes to the ER by COPI-dependent recycling of the Rer1 retrieval receptor. In the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, we show that anchoring COPI causes Sec71TMD-GFP to be depleted from the ER, as predicted if anchoring COPI blocks Golgi-to-ER recycling. This control provides a further validation of the anchor-away method.</p><p><italic>2) In the second half of the Discussion, the authors propose that AP-1 traffics Kex2 directly from late Golgi to early Golgi compartments. This would be a fairly radical idea, and would upend the current model that AP-1 traffics Kex2 from the Golgi to endosomes, and then Kex2 is retrieved from endosomes back to the Golgi by other machinery. Yet the only data provided specifically in support of this new model is the statement &quot;our video microscopy revealed that most and perhaps all of the Kex2-labeled compartments acquire Sec7, suggesting that Kex2 recycles from older to younger cisternae within the Golgi&quot;. I disagree with both the data and interpretations contained in this statement. First, by watching their videos it appears that there are a few smaller Kex2 structures that may disappear without acquiring Sec7. Second, if we assume the first part of the statement is correct, this observation is consistent with Kex2 being retrieved from endosomes (where it may reside for only a few seconds), via vesicles, to Golgi compartments that have not yet acquired Sec7. To my knowledge, the precise Golgi compartment that fuses with endosomally-derived vesicles has not been firmly established in yeast, but the Nakano lab found that Ypt6 precedes Sec7 at the Golgi (PNAS 2013). As Ypt6 (together with the GARP complex) is primarily responsible for tethering/fusing vesicles from endosomes, this suggests Kex2 retrieval from endosomes to the Golgi occurs at a stage of Golgi maturation just prior to acquisition of Sec7. Therefore, it seems unfounded to propose a role for AP-1 in recycling cargos from late Golgi to early Golgi compartments.</italic> </p><p>We are indeed proposing a fairly radical idea, and many in the field would likely have responded with similar skepticism to our initial submission. The revised manuscript tackles these issues with additional data and discussion. Our analysis began with the perception that current ideas about Kex2 trafficking are murky:</p><p>• One model is that Kex2 traffics in a similar manner as the vacuolar hydrolase receptor Vps10, by traveling to prevacuolar endosomes with the aid of Gga1/2 and then recycling to the Golgi. But this idea is puzzling because unlike Vps10, Kex2 has no obvious reason to visit prevacuolar endosomes;</p><p>• Another model is that Kex2 recycles from an early endosome to the Golgi with the aid of AP-1. But the molecular identity of this putative early endosome is unclear. Moreover, AP-1 localizes to the TGN.</p><p>Two results from our work support a simpler model in which Kex2 recycles within the Golgi. First, as shown in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>, Vps10 is readily detected in prevacuolar endosomes but Kex2 is not, suggesting that these two proteins follow different itineraries. Second, our video microscopy data demonstrate that Kex2 arrives at the Golgi shortly before Sec7, and then departs shortly before Sec7.</p><p>Prompted by the reviewer’s comment, we carefully reexamined <xref ref-type="other" rid="media6">Video 6</xref>, which shows 4D microscopy of cells expressing Kex2-GFP and Sec7-mCherry. The results are presented in the new <xref ref-type="other" rid="media7">Video 7</xref> and summarized in the text. We identified the structures that exclusively contained Kex2-GFP and that could be tracked for at least 30 sec. All of those Kex2-GFP-containing structures soon acquired Sec7-mCherry.</p><p>Our tests cannot rule out very transient passage of Kex2 through an endosomal compartment, and follow-up work will tackle this question with additional experiments. However, given the data presented here and the relative weakness of the published evidence supporting other views of Kex2 trafficking, we think it is justified to use Kex2 as a model late Golgi transmembrane protein for studying cisternal maturation.</p><p>If Kex2 and other late Golgi proteins recycle within the Golgi, candidate tethers include Ypt6 effectors. GARP functions in endosome-to-Golgi traffic but could also function in intra-Golgi recycling. Importantly, another Ypt6 effector is Sgm1, and its mammalian homolog is TMF, which was recently implicated in the intra-Golgi recycling of late Golgi proteins (Wong and Munro, 2014). These points are now emphasized in the Discussion.</p><p>[Editors' note: the author responses to the re-review follow.]</p><p><italic>The reviewers recommend that you address the following points with revisions to the text:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) Reviewer 1 and reviewer 2 raise the issue that the anchor away approach that you employed results in different outcomes for Golgi residents when compared to the sec21-3 mutant and a Vps74/Golph3 mutant. They feel that this should be directly addressed in the Discussion. The comments from Reviewer 1 and 2 (below) elaborate this point.</italic> </p><p>After prolonged treatment with rapamycin, GFP-Vrg4 shows progressive accumulation at the vacuolar membrane and plasma membrane, as would be expected given the block in recycling. This finding is now stated in the Results section as “data not shown”. Because there is actually no discrepancy between the expected and observed results, we chose not to elaborate in the Discussion.</p><p><italic>2) Since the arrested cisterna ('hybrid compartment') appears to remain competent to receive ER-derived material, and to export material, a brief discussion of the implications of this with regard to interpreting the results from both a cisternal maturation mechanism and a stable compartment mechanism of transport should be included in the Discussion. The comments from reviewer 2 are most relevant for this point.</italic> </p><p>The last paragraph of the Discussion has been rewritten to address this issue more directly. We propose that Golgi compartmentation and COPI-driven cisternal maturation are aspects of the same phenomenon. Cisternal maturation is only needed, and can only occur, in the context of a compartmentalized Golgi. When Golgi compartmentation is lost, the yeast secretory pathway apparently operates in an alternative mode in which a single hybrid compartment receives COPII vesicles and produces secretory vesicles.</p><p><italic>3) Can the authors clarify in the text which of the studies cited in the Discussion (tenth paragraph) demonstrated that AP-1 was involved in Kex2 trafficking and describe the Kex2-localization phenotype(s) seen previously by others in AP-1 mutant strains?</italic> </p><p>We had accidentally omitted the Abazeed and Fuller reference, which provides indirect evidence that AP-1 influences the localization of Kex2. That oversight has been corrected, and the discussion of AP-1 has been modified to emphasize that a role for AP-1 in Kex2 recycling is currently speculative.</p><p><italic>The entire reviews from each of the referees are included below to help you appreciate their suggestions. Addressing any other points raised in the reviews is left to your discretion.</italic> </p><p><italic>Reviewer #1: In light of the observation that the anchor away approach results in entire COPI-coated cisternae to be associated with mitochondria, a major point of discussion amongst the reviewers during review of the earlier version of the manuscript regarded the question, does the technical approach (anchor away) impinge on cisterna function independently of COPI? It is puzzling to me that in the sec21-3 mutant (permissive temperature) GFP-Vrg4 transits the Golgi and is sorted to the vacuole, but it remains in place (in the hybrid compartment) in anchor away cells. The reason may lie in incomplete inactivation of COPI in the sec21-3 mutant (the figure shows permissive temperature), but difference in outcome is striking and begs resolution. The only way that I can think of that might meaningfully address this would be to compare results with 'inert' anchor away targets. What, for example, happens when if FRB is appended to a Golgi resident (e.g., Vrg4), so that the cisterna is addressed to the mitochondrion, but COPI is not manipulated? Despite this shortcoming, I think that in its present form the manuscript makes an important contribution to the field, even though the message, as summarized in the title, may be open to continuing debate.</italic> As described above, we now state that GFP-Vrg4 accumulates in post-Golgi compartments after prolonged treatment with rapamycin.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p><italic>In this study, the authors test the effects of inactivating the COPI complex on cisternal maturation and protein secretion in yeast. Previous studies with thermosensitive COPI mutants had indicated that COPI inactivation inhibits the secretion of many but not all proteins (Gaynor and Emr), and that it slows down, but does not block, cisternal maturation as visualized by live microscopy (Matsuura-Tokita and Nakano).</italic> </p><p><italic>The authors attribute these inconclusive results to the fact that the available ts mutants can be either still partially active (Matsuura-Tokita and Nakano) or, when fully inactive, can markedly perturb the morphology of the Golgi (this manuscript), making it impossible to monitor directly the maturation process by live microscopy.</italic> </p><p><italic>To resolve these uncertainties, they use the anchoring-away technique applied to specific COPI subunits. They find that COPI inactivation results in complete block of the recycling of the cis Golgi marker Vrg4, which now permanently labels the cis cisternae. This indicates that Vrg4 normally recycles through COPI. Moreover, they find that trans-Golgi residents (Sec7 and Kex2) partially merge with these stabilized cis cisternae, forming hybrid cis/trans Golgi bodies; and also that these trans markers cycle on and off the hybrid structures (though with somewhat delayed kinetics). This suggests that that</italic> that <italic>these markers cycle via a COPI-independent mechanism.</italic> </p><p><italic>The study is technically very thorough and the factual statements are convincing and well supported. My comments will therefore concern only the novelty and the significance of the results.</italic> </p><p><italic>As the authors emphasize, their data are the first direct demonstration that COPI is required for cisternal maturation. Evidence that COPI is required for maintaining the localization of Golgi residents (via Vps74/Golph3) has been available for some time (e.g., Tu and Banfield), but these previous observations are compatible both with the stable cisternae model and the cisternal maturation model. Thus, while not unexpected, these results are an important step towards establishing the molecular mechanism of cisternal maturation, and in principle deserve publication in a major journal such as eLife. They also raise the following questions and comments. The stabilization of cis Golgi markers in cis cisternae probably results from the specific type of COPI inactivation that is induced by the anchoring-away approach, which causes COPI to remain bound to the cis Golgi and so possibly to retain cis markers in the cis cisterna. However, the stabilization of the cis Golgi it is not the only possible outcome of COPI inactivation, under the maturation model. One might imagine, for instance, that if COPI were inactivated in a different way, e.g., by rapid degradation, this might cause cis markers to move forward along with cargo proteins to reach the vacuole or the plasma membrane. This is actually what happens when the COPI-bound adaptor Vps74 is removed: the Golgi enzymes leave the Golgi and move to the vacuole (Tu-Banfield). This apparent discrepancy might disconcert the reader. I therefore feel that the above point should be discussed, even though it does not in my view undermine the conclusion that COPI is needed for cis Golgi maturation.</italic> </p><p>This point is important, but as described above, there is actually no discrepancy because anchoring COPI eventually leads to the appearance of GFP-Vrg4 in the vacuolar membrane and plasma membrane.</p><p><italic>The authors appear to interpret the data in the framework of the cisternal maturation scheme. However, the observation that the hybrid compartment can still absorb input from the ER and release secretory material towards the surface, albeit at slow rates, is difficult to reconcile with the maturation model. Since the recycling of cis markers is inhibited, and the formation of a new cis cisterna (a necessary step in the cisternal maturation mechanism) requires such recycling, a logical suggestion deriving from these data would be that the hybrid Golgi incorporates cargo and membrane from the ER by a mechanism different from cisternal maturation. In my view, these results are consistent with the idea that the main intra-Golgi transport mechanism is cisternal maturation, but they also suggest the existence of secondary mechanisms that are used by some protein classes, and/or of backup mechanisms used by the system when maturation fails. Again, I feel that, in order to avoid confusing the reader in a field that is already rich in controversies, the authors should discuss these issues, which, incidentally, are referred to also in the Introduction.</italic> </p><p>The arguments here are somewhat subtle. As described above, we modified the Discussion in an attempt to clarify our ideas about how the Golgi operates in unperturbed cells and in cells with inactivated COPI.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p><italic>This work convincingly clarifies the role of COPI, providing further evidence for a primary function in retrograde trafficking that is important for Golgi maturation. I think the authors now do a good job of explaining why some cargos are more sensitive to COPI inactivation than others, and how a basal level of secretion can be supported in the absence of COPI function. Furthermore, they have clarified the itinerary of Kex2. Therefore, I am in support of publication. My only remaining concern is a relatively minor one, which I would expect could be addressed through small changes in the text: Can the authors clarify in the text which of the studies cited in the Discussion on (tenth paragraph) demonstrated that AP-1 was involved in Kex2 trafficking and describe the Kex2-localization phenotype(s) seen previously by others in AP-1 mutant strains? In other words, what is the existing evidence in the literature that led to the model of AP-1 functioning in Kex2 traffic between the Golgi and endosomes? Furthermore, can the authors briefly discuss the established role of AP-1 in mammalian cells (i.e., papers from Bonifacino and other labs), and whether the authors think AP-1 has similar or different functions in yeast? I think explicitly addressing these points will help readers to better understand the insights from the current data in light of previous studies.</italic> </p><p>As described above, we added the relevant reference about AP-1 and Kex2, and revised the accompanying text to emphasize that an involvement of AP-1 in Kex2 recycling needs further investigation. We also now briefly discuss how studies of mammalian AP-1 are potentially consistent with our model for AP-1-dependent recycling in yeast.</p></body></sub-article></article>
