replication. The zinc finger antiviral protein (ZAP) binds regions of viral RNA containing CpGs and targets them for degradation. ZAP does not have enzymatic activity and recruits other cellular proteins to inhibit viral replication. We found that KHNYN, a protein with no previously known function, interacts with ZAP. KHNYN overexpression selectively inhibits HIV-1 containing clustered CpG dinucleotides and this requires ZAP and its cofactor TRIM25. KHNYN requires both its KH-like domain and NYN endonuclease domain for antiviral activity. Crucially, depletion of KHNYN eliminated the deleterious effect of CpG dinucleotides on HIV-1 RNA abundance and infectious virus production and also enhanced the production of murine leukemia virus. Overall, we have identified KHNYN as a novel cofactor for ZAP to target CpG-containing retroviral RNA for degradation.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46767.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Like many viruses, the genetic information of the human immunodeficiency virus (or HIV for short) is formed of molecules of RNA, which are sequences of building blocks called nucleotides. Once the virus is inside human cells, a protein called ZAP can identify viral RNAs by binding to a precise motif, a combination of two nucleotides called CpG. This allows the cell to destroy the viral RNA, thus preventing the virus from multiplying. However, HIV and other viruses that infect mammals are often able to ‘hide’ from ZAP because their genetic codes have many fewer CpG nucleotides than what would be expected by chance.</p><p>ZAP by itself does not appear to be able to cut up RNA, so it is thought that it recruits other, as yet unidentified, proteins to destroy the genome of viruses. Here, Ficarelli et al. used genetic techniques to identify a new human protein called KHNYN that interacts with ZAP.</p><p>First, a new version of the RNA genome of HIV was engineered, which contained higher numbers of CpGs: this CpG-enriched virus could be inhibited by ZAP in human cells. The experiments showed that increasing the amount of KHNYN protein led to lower levels of HIV genomes enriched in CpG. However, increasing the levels of KHNYN protein in mutant cells without ZAP had no effect on how well CpG-enriched HIV multiplied. CpG-enriched HIV and another related virus with many CpG nucleotides were able to multiply more successfully in mutant cells lacking the KHNYN protein than in normal cells. Further experiments also suggested that mutating a region of KHNYN which is likely to cut RNA prevented it from inhibiting HIV enriched with CpGs.</p><p>Artificially manipulating the CpG nucleotide content of viral sequences could help create viruses useful for human health. For instance, weakened viruses could be designed for use in vaccines. Some human tumors have decreased levels of ZAP, and it could therefore be possible to build viruses that healthy cells can destroy, but which could multiply in and kill cancer cells. However, before these approaches can be developed, exactly how ZAP and KHNYN degrade strands of viral RNA needs to be characterized.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>HIV</kwd><kwd>CpG dinucleotide</kwd><kwd>ZAP</kwd><kwd>TRIM25</kwd><kwd>KHNYN</kwd><kwd>innate immunity</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Virus</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MC/PC/15068</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Neil</surname><given-names>Stuart JD</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>WT098049AIA</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Neil</surname><given-names>Stuart JD</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MR/M019756/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Swanson</surname><given-names>Chad M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MR/R50225X/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ficarelli</surname><given-names>Mattia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MR/S000844/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Neil</surname><given-names>Stuart JD</given-names></name><name><surname>Swanson</surname><given-names>Chad M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MC_UU_12018/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Marsh</surname><given-names>Mark</given-names></name><name><surname>Mazzon</surname><given-names>Michela</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>KHNYN, a putative endoribonuclease, interacts with the zinc-finger antiviral protein (ZAP) and is required for the inhibition of HIV replication and RNA abundance by CpG dinucleotides.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>A major component of the innate immune system are cell intrinsic antiviral proteins. These act at multiple steps in viral replication cycles and some are induced by type I interferons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Schneider et al., 2014</xref>). Many viruses have evolved mechanisms to evade inhibition by these proteins. First, viruses can encode proteins that counteract specific antiviral factors. Examples of this mechanism in HIV-1 are the accessory proteins Vif and Vpu that counteract APOBEC3 cytosine deaminases and Tetherin, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Malim and Bieniasz, 2012</xref>). Second, viral protein or nucleic acid sequences can evolve to prevent recognition by antiviral factors. The abundance of CpG dinucleotides is suppressed in many vertebrate RNA virus genomes and when CpGs are experimentally introduced into picornaviruses or influenza A virus, replication is inhibited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Atkinson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burns et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gaunt et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Karlin et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tulloch et al., 2014</xref>). This shows that CpG suppression in diverse RNA viruses is required for efficient replication.</p><p>CpG dinucleotides are also suppressed in the HIV-1 genome and multiple studies have shown that they are deleterious for replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Antzin-Anduetza et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kypr et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Shpaer and Mullins, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Takata et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Theys et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wasson et al., 2017</xref>). Recently, the cellular antiviral protein ZAP was shown to bind regions of HIV-1 RNA with high CpG abundance and target them for degradation, which at least partly explains why this dinucleotide inhibits viral replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Takata et al., 2017</xref>). ZAP (also known as ZC3HAV1) is a component of the innate immune response targeting viral RNAs in the cytoplasm to prevent viral protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Li et al., 2015</xref>). ZAP inhibits the replication of a diverse range of viruses including retroviruses, alphaviruses, filoviruses, hepatitis B virus and Japanese encephalitis virus as well as retroelements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bick et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chiu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gao et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Goodier et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mao et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Moldovan and Moran, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Müller et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Takata et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zhu et al., 2011</xref>). There are two human ZAP isoforms, ZAP-L and ZAP-S (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kerns et al., 2008</xref>). Both isoforms contain a N-terminal RNA binding domain containing four CCCH-type zinc finger motifs but ZAP-L also contains a catalytically inactive C-terminal poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP)-like domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Guo et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kerns et al., 2008</xref>). Importantly, neither isoform of ZAP has nuclease activity and it likely recruits other cellular proteins to degrade viral RNAs. Identifying and characterizing these cofactors for ZAP is essential to understand how it restricts viral replication.</p><p>ZAP requires the E3 ubiquitin ligase TRIM25 for its antiviral activity against Sindbis virus and HIV-1 with clustered CpGs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Li et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Takata et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zheng et al., 2017</xref>). While ZAP has been reported to interact with several components of the 5’−3’ and 3’−5’ RNA degradation pathways, depletion of these proteins did not substantially increase infectious virus production for HIV-1 containing clustered CpG dinucleotides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Goodier et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Guo et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Takata et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zhu et al., 2011</xref>). This suggests that additional proteins may be required for ZAP to inhibit viral replication. Herein, we identify KHNYN as a cytoplasmic protein that interacts with ZAP and is necessary for CpG dinucleotides to inhibit HIV-1 RNA and protein abundance.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>KHNYN interacts with ZAP and selectively inhibits HIV-1 containing clustered CpG dinucleotides in a ZAP- and TRIM25-dependent manner</title><p>To identify candidate interaction partners for ZAP, a yeast two-hybrid screen was performed for full-length ZAP-S and ZAP-L using prey fragments from a mixed Pam3CSK4-induced and IFNβ-induced human macrophage cDNA library. Candidate interacting proteins were assigned a Predicted Biological Score (PBS) of A to F (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Formstecher et al., 2005</xref>): A = very high confidence in the interaction, B = high confidence in the interaction and C = good confidence in the interaction. Scores of D to F are low confidence interactions, non-specific interactions or proven technical artifacts. For ZAP-S, 11 clones were obtained from 60.4 million tested interactions. 10 of these contained a prey fragment encoding KHNYN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) and had a PBS = A. One clone had an insert encoding MARK3 but this was in the antisense orientation and therefore did not receive a score. For ZAP-L, two positive clones were analyzed from 104 million tested interactions. Both of these had an insert encoding KHNYN and had a PBS = C. KHNYN has two isoforms (KHNYN-1 and KHNYN-2) that contain a N-terminal KH-like domain and a C-terminal NYN endoribonuclease domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anantharaman and Aravind, 2006</xref>). The selected interaction domain, which is the amino acid sequence shared by all prey fragments matching KHNYN, comprised amino acids 572–719 of KHNYN-2 for the clones identified in both screens. A yeast two-hybrid screen was then performed using the same library with full length KHNYN-2 as the bait. Nine clones were isolated that encode ZAP and these had a PBS = A. The selected interaction domain was amino acids 4–352, which is present in both isoforms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Supporting the reproducibility of this interaction, KHNYN has also been identified as a ZAP-interacting factor in large-scale affinity purification–mass spectrometry and in vivo proximity-dependent biotinylation (BioID) screens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Huttlin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Youn et al., 2018</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46767.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>KHNYN is a ZAP-interacting factor identified by yeast two-hybrid screening.</title><p>A yeast two-hybrid screen for ZAP-S and ZAP-L interacting factors identified a region in KHNYN-1 and KHNYN-2.

Since ZAP mediates degradation of HIV-1 RNAs with clustered CpG dinucleotides in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Takata et al., 2017</xref>), its cofactors are likely to be localized in this compartment.

To determine if TRIM25 is necessary for the antiviral activity of KHNYN, 62.5 ng of pKHNYN-1 or pKHNYN-2 was co-transfected with pHIV-1 or pHIV-1<sub>EnvCpG86-561</sub> in control and TRIM25 knockout cells.

One possible reason that TRIM25 is necessary for KHNYN antiviral activity could be that it regulates the interaction between ZAP and KHNYN. We pulled down KHNYN-FLAG and western blotted for ZAP in control and TRIM25 knockdown cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Both isoforms of KHNYN pulled down ZAP in both cell lines, indicating that TRIM25 is not required for the interaction between these proteins. Interestingly, KHNYN also pulled down TRIM25 in control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Therefore, we analyzed whether KHNYN interacted with TRIM25 in control and ZAP knockout cells and observed that both isoforms of KHNYN-FLAG immunoprecipitated TRIM25 in the presence and absence of ZAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). In sum, KHNYN requires TRIM25 to inhibit HIV-1 containing clustered CpG dinucleotides, but TRIM25 is not necessary for the interaction between ZAP and KHNYN.

For example, ZC3H12A degrades pro-inflammatory cytokine mRNAs and also inhibits the replication of several viruses, including HIV-1 and hepatitis C virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Liu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Matsushita et al., 2009</xref>).

ZAP has four CCCH zinc finger domains and specifically interacts with CpG dinucleotides in RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gao et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Guo et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Takata et al., 2017</xref>). However, it does not contain nuclease activity. While ZAP has been reported to directly or indirectly interact with components of the 5’−3’ and 3’−5’ degradation pathways including DCP1-DCP2, XRN1, PARN and the exosome, knockdown of several proteins in these pathways did not substantially rescue infectious virus production of HIV-1 containing clustered CpG dinucleotides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Goodier et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Guo et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Takata et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zhu et al., 2011</xref>). Therefore, we hypothesized that ZAP may interact with additional unidentified proteins that regulate viral RNA degradation.</p><p>Herein, we have identified that KHNYN is an essential ZAP cofactor that inhibits HIV-1 gene expression and infectious virus production when the viral RNA contains clustered CpG dinucleotides. KHNYN overexpression inhibits genomic RNA abundance, Gag expression, Env expression and infectious virus production for HIV-1 containing clustered CpG dinucleotides. This activity requires ZAP and TRIM25. Furthermore, depletion of KHNYN using CRISPR-Cas9 specifically increased genomic RNA abundance, Gag expression, Env expression and infectious virus production for HIV-1 containing clustered CpG dinucleotides. This indicates that KHNYN is essential for CpG dinucleotides to inhibit infectious virus production. Similarly, KHNYN depletion increased MLV Gag expression and virion production. However, Sindbis virus replication was not substantially increased in the KHNYN knockout cells. The difference between the requirement for KHNYN to inhibit retroviruses versus Sindbis virus may be because the antiviral effect for retroviruses is predominantly at the level of RNA stability and for alphaviruses it is predominately at the level of translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bick et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gao et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Guo et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Guo et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">MacDonald et al., 2007</xref>). A mechanistic explanation for why the major antiviral effect of ZAP appears to be promoting RNA degradation for some viruses and inhibiting translation for other viruses remains unclear, although ZAP has been reported to inhibit translation initiation by interfering with the interaction between eIF4A and eIF4G (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zhu et al., 2012</xref>). Therefore, KHNYN may not be required for ZAP to inhibit translation.</p><p>We hypothesize that a complex containing ZAP and KHNYN binds HIV-1 CpG-containing RNA. ZAP and KHNYN could directly interact to form a heterodimer or there could be other factors mediating this interaction. The interaction between ZAP and KHNYN has been detected using several different assays including yeast-two-hybrid, co-immunoprecipitation, affinity purification–mass spectrometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Huttlin et al., 2017</xref>) and BioID (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Youn et al., 2018</xref>). If there is an unknown factor mediating this interaction, it would have to present in the yeast-two-hybrid assay. It remains unclear how TRIM25 regulates ZAP, but it is not required for ZAP and KHNYN to interact. Interestingly, TRIM25 co-immunoprecipitates with KHNYN and the ZAP antiviral complex may simultaneously consist of all three proteins. ZAP and TRIM25 are interferon-stimulated genes while KHNYN is not induced by interferon in human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Shaw et al., 2017</xref>). Whether KHNYN is regulated by type I interferons or viral infection in a different way, such as post-translational modification, is not known.</p><p>The zinc finger RNA binding domains in ZAP could target KHNYN to CpG regions in viral RNA. This would allow the endonuclease domain in KHNYN to cleave this RNA, thereby inhibiting viral RNA abundance. Conceptually, the ZAP-KHNYN complex could function similarly to ZC3H12A, but with the RNA binding and endonuclease domains divided between the two proteins. The NYN domain in KHNYN could cleave HIV-1 RNA containing CpG dinucleotides similar to how ZC3H12A cleaves a specific site in the 3’ UTR of the IL-6 mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Matsushita et al., 2009</xref>). While we do not yet have evidence that the NYN domain in KHNYN is an active endonuclease domain, it is highly conserved with the active NYN domain in ZC3H12A and is required for KHNYN antiviral activity. Strikingly, mutation of two conserved aspartic acid residues in the NYN domain predicted to coordinate a magnesium ion necessary for nucleophilic attack of the target RNA eliminated KHNYN antiviral activity. However, biochemical and structural studies will be necessary to determine the specific nature of the interaction between ZAP, KHNYN, TRIM25 and RNA and how these interactions promote viral RNA degradation.</p><p>An increasingly common theme for RNA decay is that endonucleic and exonucleic degradation pathways work together to fully degrade RNAs. For example, nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) targets mRNAs that do not efficiently terminate translation at the stop codon and uses up to four mechanisms to degrade these mRNAs: endonucleic cleavage, deadenylation, decapping and exonucleic degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lykke-Andersen and Jensen, 2015</xref>). In this pathway, the endonuclease SMG6 interacts with the core regulatory protein UPF1 and cleaves mRNA near a premature termination codon. The 5’ and 3’ cleavage fragments are then degraded by the 5’−3’ exonuclease XRN1 and the 3’−5’ exonuclease exosome complex. The CCR4–NOT deadenylase complex and DCP1-DCP2 decapping complex are recruited by proteins in the NMD complex including UPF1, SMG5, SMG7 and PNRC2. Similarly, the 5’−3’ and 3’−5’ degradation pathway components previously shown to interact with ZAP could work in conjunction with KHNYN-mediated endonucleic decay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Goodier et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Guo et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zhu et al., 2011</xref>). In this model, KHNYN would initiate cleavage of the viral RNA and the exonucleic pathways would then degrade the resulting RNA fragments. Identifying the full complement of ZAP-interacting factors and characterizing how these target viral RNAs for degradation will be an exciting area of future investigation.</p><p>Another important area of future research will be to determine how KHNYN and other cellular proteins that contain an NYN endonuclease domain inhibit the replication of different viruses in different cell types with and without interferon treatment. The interferon-stimulated gene N4BP1, which is a KHNYN paralog (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anantharaman and Aravind, 2006</xref>), was recently identified to genetically interact with ZAP in a CRISPR-based screen to identify interferon-induced antiviral proteins targeting HIV-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">OhAinle et al., 2018</xref>). In the monocytic THP-1 cell line, depletion of N4BP1 led to a small increase in wild-type HIV-1 replication. However, N4BP1 depletion did not inhibit replication of the alphavirus Semliki Forest virus, indicating that it may have a virus specific effect. While ZAP inhibits a range of viruses in different cell types, it remains unknown whether its cofactor requirements are cell type dependent. In this study, we have analyzed the antiviral activity of ZAP and KHNYN on HIV-1 and MLV in HeLa cells, but the role of NYN domain-containing proteins in targeting viral RNAs for degradation may be an important component of the antiviral innate immune response in a variety of cell types. It will also be interesting to determine if proteins containing an endonuclease domain other than KHNYN interact with CCCH zinc finger proteins to mediate antiviral activity. There are 57 human CCCH zinc finger proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fu and Blackshear, 2017</xref>). At least 15 of these proteins are known to promote RNA decay and, including ZAP, six human CCCH zinc finger proteins are antiviral (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fu and Blackshear, 2017</xref>). Identifying the full complement of CCCH zinc finger proteins that inhibit viral replication and determining whether they require proteins containing endonuclease domains such as KHNYN or N4BP1 for this activity will increase our understanding of antiviral responses targeting viral RNA.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plasmids</title><p>All primers were ordered from Eurofins.

Clones were screened using a mating approach with YHGX13 (Y187 ade2-101::loxP-kanMX-loxP, matα) and L40∆Gal4 (mata) yeast strains as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fromont-Racine et al., 1997</xref>). His + colonies were selected on a medium lacking tryptophan, leucine and histidine. Because KHNYN-2 had some autoactivating activity, the selection medium was supplemented with 10 mM 3-Aminotriazol.</p><p>The prey fragments of the positive clones were amplified by PCR and sequenced at their 5’ and 3’ junctions. The resulting sequences were used to identify the corresponding interacting proteins in the GenBank database (NCBI) using a fully automated procedure. A confidence score (PBS, for Predicted Biological Score) was attributed to each interaction as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Formstecher et al., 2005</xref>). The PBS relies on two different levels of analysis. First, a local score takes into account the redundancy and independency of prey fragments, as well as the distribution of reading frames and stop codons in overlapping fragments. Second, a global score takes into account the interactions found in all the screens performed at Hybrigenics using the same library. This global score represents the probability of an interaction being nonspecific. The scores were divided into six categories: A (highest confidence) to D (lowest confidence) plus category E that demarcates interactions involving highly connected prey domains previously found several times in screens performed on libraries derived from the same organism and category F that indicates highly connected domains that have been confirmed as false-positives. The PBS scores have been shown to positively correlate with the biological significance of interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rain et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wojcik et al., 2002</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Transfections</title><p>HeLa and HEK293T cells were grown to 70% confluence in six-well plates.

Your article has been reviewed by Päivi Ojala as the Senior Editor, a Reviewing Editor, and two reviewers. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Michael Emerman (Reviewer #1); Eric Freed (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this study, Ficarelli and colleagues identify KHNYN, a protein with no previously defined function, as a co-factor in ZAP-mediated degradation of viral RNAs containing CpG dinucleotides. While other co-factors for ZAP have previously been described, the factor encoding a putative RNA-degrading activity had not been found. The authors identify KHNYN as a ZAP-interacting protein in a yeast two-hybrid screen, confirming the results of previous screens for ZAP interactors performed by other groups. Overexpression of KHNYN resulted in the degradation of an HIV-1 variant engineered to contain 36 introduced CpG dinucleotides but had only a small effect of WT HIV-1, which, like many viral RNA genomes, is underrepresented for CpGs. Reductions in RNA levels were accompanied by reductions in viral protein production. The effect of KHNYN overexpression was found to be dependent on ZAP and also on expression of TRIM25, confirming earlier findings that TRIM25 is involved in ZAP-mediated antiviral activity. The authors show that knock-out of KHNYN prevented ZAP-mediated degradation of the CpG-containing HIV-1 RNA.</p><p>In summary, this is a very nice study with straightforward assays showing that KHNYN is essential for this function of ZAP. The data are clear-cut and of high quality, and add important information to the mechanism of ZAP-mediated antiviral activity. The narrow focus on a high CG-containing HIV-1, an unnatural target of ZAP, limits the conclusions and slightly reduces the overall high impact of the study. This work will, nonetheless, be of great interest to a broad audience well beyond the HIV field.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors convincingly show that KHNYN is required and necessary for ZAP to inhibit a high CG-containing HIV. While this makes a nice model, it is not a natural target of ZAP. The authors could broaden their claims by using other viruses to show whether or not KHNYN is needed for ZAP-mediated inhibition of other targets; for example, MLV would work, and/or alphaviruses. The existing knockout cells should be sufficient for these assays.</p><p>2) The authors confine their studies to HeLa and 293 cells. It is possible that the factor needed to degrade high CG RNA via ZAP is different in different cells. Specifically, the authors should look at OhAinle et al., 2018, especially the data and text describing ZAP and N4BP1 in THP-1 cells. The authors are welcome to these reagents if they want them.</p><p>N4BP1 is the other NYN protein described in the Marco and Marin, (2009). While additional experiments are not expected here, the authors should discuss the possibility that the effector protein needed for ZAP might be different in different cells and could confer different specificity on the CG-containing RNAs that are degraded (also note that N4BP1 is on the list of interactors in the Youn et al., 2018).</p><p>3) In Figure 1 please show the entire dataset of high confidence interactors unless KHNYN is the only one. What is the overlap between this list and the ZAP-interactors identified by BioID (Youn et al., 2018)?</p><p>4) The authors need to more thoroughly examine effects of KHNYN on RNA levels. While most of the assays used are measuring protein or infectivity, the essential data for the proposed mechanism is examining RNA levels. Figure 8A is the only one that measures this, but is not quite satisfying. Importantly, they should show levels of different spliced forms of HIV-1 RNA. Presumably, the Nef spliced message should not be decreased and would be a good control. The authors should also present the data as actual levels of HIV-1 RNA normalized to a cellular message, rather than only relative RNA abundance of HIV-1.</p><p>5) The authors state that they do not have a good anti-KHNYN antibody to detect endogenous protein levels in their KO cells, but the KOs should be analyzed by providing the genomic analysis in the supplement to determine the percentage knockouts in the pool and to show the nature of the lesions in the clones.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46767.022</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Summary:</p><p>[…] In summary, this is a very nice study with straightforward assays showing that KHNYN is essential for this function of ZAP.

ZAP has previously been shown to target MLV RNA for degradation. Depletion of KHNYN increases MLV Gag expression and virion production to similar levels as knocking out ZAP. This phenotype is particularly pronounced after treatment of the cells with type 1 interferon. Interestingly, KHNYN does not restrict Sindbis virus. Depletion of ZAP or TRIM25 increased viral replication as expected, but, in contrast, KHNYN depletion had no effect. Since the major role of ZAP in restricting Sindbis virus has been shown to be inhibition of viral RNA translation, this may indicate that ZAP uses different cofactors depending on whether it inhibits translation or targets the RNA for degradation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors confine their studies to HeLa and 293 cells.

In the Discussion section, we have highlighted the N4BP1 results in the context of a paragraph on how ZAP could use different cofactors in different cell types. Of note, N4BP1 is not a ZAP-interacting protein in Youn et al., 2018, though it did interact with TRIM25. How KHNYN and N4BP1 mediate ZAP antiviral activity in different cell types in the absence and presence of type I interferon will be an important area of future investigation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) In Figure 1 please show the entire dataset of high confidence interactors unless KHNYN is the only one.

We have modified the text in the Results section relating to Figure 1 to describe this.
