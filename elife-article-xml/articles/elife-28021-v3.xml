However, almost nothing is known about how AC activity is regulated through protein degradation mediated by ubiquitination or other mechanisms. Here, we show that transcriptional regulator interacting with the PHD-bromodomain 1 (TRIP-Br1, Sertad1), a newly identified protein with poorly characterized functions, acts as an adaptor that bridges the interaction of multiple AC isoforms with X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP), a RING-domain E3 ubiquitin ligase. XIAP ubiquitinates a highly conserved Lys residue in AC isoforms and thereby accelerates the endocytosis and degradation of multiple AC isoforms in human cell lines and mice. XIAP/TRIP-Br1-mediated degradation of ACs forms part of a negative-feedback loop that controls the homeostasis of cAMP signaling in mice. Our findings reveal a previously unrecognized mechanism for degrading multiple AC isoforms and modulating the homeostasis of cAMP signaling.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.28021.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.28021.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>cAMP</kwd><kwd>adenylyl cyclase</kwd><kwd>ubiquitination</kwd><kwd>TRIP-Br1</kwd><kwd>XIAP</kwd><kwd>degradation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>The Hong Kong Grants Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GRF660913</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Huang</surname><given-names>Pingbo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>XIAP/TRIP-Br1-mediated degradation of multiple adenylyl cyclase isoforms is a previously unrecognised general mechanism for controlling adenylyl cyclase expression and the homeostasis of cAMP signalling.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>eLife Digest</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction </title><p>cAMP, the first second messenger discovered by Earl Sutherland in 1957, plays a crucial role in regulating a vast array of biological processes in all kingdoms of life by targeting PKA, Epac, cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channels, and Popdc proteins. cAMP is produced from ATP by adenylyl cyclases (ACs). Based on their structural and functional similarities, 9 transmembrane ACs (tmACs) in mammals are classified into four groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Patel et al., 2001</xref>). All tmACs share the common feature of containing two catalytic domains and an N-terminal domain. All tmACs except AC9 are activated by both the heterotrimeric G protein subunit Gsα and forskolin. Furthermore, the distinct AC isoforms are regulated differentially by myriad molecules, including Giα, Gβγ, calmodulin, PKA, PKC, protein associated with Myc (PAM), AKAP79/150, Snapin, and RGS2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Patel et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wang et al., 2009</xref>). Surprisingly, almost all previous studies on ACs have focused on the regulation of their activities per se, and despite the pivotal role of ACs in cAMP signaling, next to nothing is known about the degradation of cell-surface ACs mediated by ubiquitination and/or other mechanisms that acutely and finely tune the signaling potential of cell-surface membrane proteins in response to environmental cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Piper and Luzio, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">MacGurn et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>TRIP-Br1 belongs to a recently discovered protein family that includes TRIP-Br1 (SEI-1, SERTAD1), TRIP-Br2 (SEI-2, SERTAD2), TRIP-Br3 (SEI-3, HEPP, CDCA4), and RBT1 (SERTAD3) in mammals and TARA in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lai et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zang et al., 2009</xref>). The functions of TRIP-Br1 and other members of its family have not been fully characterized. Although earlier studies suggested that TRIP-Br1 in the nucleus acts as a transcriptional co-regulator of E2F-responsive genes, or forms an active quaternary complex with cyclin D/CDK4/INK4a to promote normal cell cycle progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sugimoto et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hsu et al., 2001</xref>), recent studies showed that endogenous TRIP-Br1 is predominantly localized in the cytoplasm and undergoes regulated nucleo-cytoplasmic transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hong et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jung et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hong et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lee et al., 2009</xref>).

Stable expression of TRIP-Br1-V5 markedly reduced the total and cell-surface protein levels of endogenous AC1 in HEK293T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>), but exerted little effect on other membrane proteins such as endogenous transferrin receptor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>) and exogenous TRPV4 and TRPP2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Agreeing with this observation, stable expression of TRIP-Br1-V5 also substantially reduced the protein level and forskolin-stimulated cAMP production of exogenous AC1 in HEK293T cells (Figure 6b–d). Conversely, knocking down TRIP-Br1 with two different shRNAs elevated AC1 protein expression in HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>).

Because TRIP-Br1 reportedly binds to XIAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hong et al., 2009</xref>), a RING E3 ligase, we tested whether TRIP-Br1 recruits XIAP to AC1 and thereby promotes AC1 ubiquitination and degradation. First, we verified the interaction between TRIP-Br1 and XIAP by using GST pull-down assays. GST-TRIP-Br1 fusion protein but not GST alone captured XIAP purified from <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, which demonstrated a potential direct interaction between XIAP and TRIP-Br1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). Furthermore, we mapped the XIAP binding site in TRIP-Br1 to the first 49 amino acids of TRIP-Br1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). By contrast, purified FLAG-His-tagged AC1-N, AC1-M, and AC1-C2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>) did not coprecipitate with purified XIAP, which indicated a lack of direct interaction between XIAP and AC1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). However, FLAG-His-tagged AC1-M coprecipitated with purified XIAP in the presence of TRIP-Br1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>), which strongly suggested that TRIP-Br1 bridges the interaction between XIAP and AC1.

Overexpression of wild-type XIAP, but not its H467A and F495A mutants that lack E3 ligase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yang et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Damgaard et al., 2012</xref>), markedly reduced the expression of endogenous AC1 and increased its ubiquitination in HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>), implying that XIAP E3 ligase directly or indirectly targets AC1. Moreover, overexpression of TRIP-Br1-FLAG lowered the expression of endogenous AC1 in HeLa cells as in HEK293T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), and also elevated the ubiquitination of endogenous AC1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>); this suggested that TRIP-Br1 promotes the ubiquitination and degradation of AC1. Conversely, knockdown of XIAP or TRIP-Br1 with 2 or 3 different shRNAs produced the opposite effect of XIAP or TRIP-Br1 overexpression on endogenous AC1, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b–c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). More importantly, the effect of XIAP on AC1 was almost abolished following extensive knockdown of endogenous TRIP-Br1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>), and vice versa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>), and this suggested that XIAP and TRIP-Br1 collaboratively ubiquitinate and degrade AC1. Furthermore, in in vitro ubiquitination assays performed using only purified proteins, AC1 ubiquitination by XIAP required the presence of TRIP-Br1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>). Significantly, deleting the RING domain of XIAP in mice, in addition to increasing XIAP expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Schile et al., 2008</xref>), markedly increased AC1 protein expression in heart tissue, adipocytes, and the brain, which clearly demonstrated that the E3 ligase activity of XIAP modulates AC1 expression in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>). In addition, deleting the RING domain of XIAP abolished the effect of TRIP-Br1 knockout in the mouse brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e</xref>), further fortifying the notion that XIAP and TRIP-Br1 act in concert (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b–c</xref>). On the basis of all these results, we conclude that TRIP-Br1 acts as an adaptor for the ubiquitination and degradation of AC1 by XIAP E3 ligase.<fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28021.007</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>XIAP binding results in AC1 ubiquitination and degradation in a TRIP-Br1 dependent manner.</title><p>(<bold>a–c</bold>) Ubiquitinated and total endogenous AC1 were examined following overexpression of HA-XIAP or its 2 mutants (H467A and F495A) and TRIP-Br1-FLAG in control HeLa cells (<bold>a</bold>) and in HeLa cells in which we knocked down TRIP-Br1 (<bold>b</bold>) or XIAP (<bold>c</bold>). shTRIP-Br1-1 and shXIAP-1, small hairpin RNA; Ub, ubiquitin; GAPDH, loading control.

As in the case of AC1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>), expression of XIAP but not its H467A and F495A mutants and expression of TRIP-Br1-FLAG reduced the protein expression of endogenous AC2 and AC5/6 and increased the ubiquitination of enxogenous AC2 and AC5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a–c</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1a</xref>); this supports the conclusion that AC2 and AC5/6, like AC1, are substrates of the TRIP-Br1/XIAP E3 ligase complex. Conversely, knockdown of XIAP or TRIP-Br1 produced the opposite effect of XIAP or TRIP-Br1 overexpression on AC2 and AC5/6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1b–c</xref>).

Our study can potentially open up new avenues of research and development for designing therapeutic approaches to control AC functions in health and disease.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Antibodies</title><p>Antibodies against the following proteins and tags were from commercial sources: TRIP-Br1, Enzo Life Science (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2052741">AB_2052741</ext-link>); XIAP, R and D Systems (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2215008">AB_2215008</ext-link>); AC1 (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2223098">AB_2223098</ext-link>), AC5/6 (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2257941">AB_2257941</ext-link>), ubiquitin (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_778730">AB_778730</ext-link>), GAPDH (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_10847862">AB_10847862</ext-link>), and β-actin (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_626632">AB_626632</ext-link>), Santa Cruz Biotechnology; AC2, Novus Biologicals; V5 (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2556564">AB_2556564</ext-link>) and transferrin receptor (RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_86623">AB_86623</ext-link>), Life Technologies; HA (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2314672">AB_2314672</ext-link>), Covance; Ubiquitin (linkage-specific K27, K48, and K63), Abcam; Phospho-CREB, Cell Signaling Technology; NeuN, Millipore; and Na-K-ATPase (α subunit) (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_258029">AB_258029</ext-link>) and FLAG M2 (antibody RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_439685">AB_439685</ext-link> and affinity gel RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_10704031">AB_10704031</ext-link>), Sigma-Aldrich.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>cDNAs and plasmids</title><p>The cDNAs of human TRIP-Br1 were amplified from Calu-3 cells by means of reverse transcription-PCR performed using SuperScript Reverse Transcriptase with oligo(dT)<sub>12-18</sub> and Platinum Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen).

The sample was examined using STORM in an imaging buffer containing: 200 mM Tris-Cl (pH 9.0),10% (w/v) glucose, 5 U/mL glucose oxidase type VII (Sigma-Aldrich, cat# G2133), 57 μg/mL catalase (Sigma-Aldrich, cat#C3515), 2 mM cyclooctatetraene (Sigma-Aldrich, cat#138924), 25 mM TCEP (Sigma-Aldrich, cat#64654–7), 1 mM ascorbic acid (Sigma-Aldrich, cat#A92902) and 1 mM methyl viologen (Sigma-Aldrich, cat#856177). Images were analyzed using the image analysis software Fiji.</p></sec><sec id="s4-21"><title>Statistics</title><p>Protein bands in western blots were quantified using ImageJ software.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;The complex of TRIP-Br1 and <italic>XIAP</italic> ubiquitinates and degrades multiple adenylyl cyclase isoforms&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom, Volker Dötsch (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors and the evaluation has been overseen by Jonathan Cooper as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript, the authors describe extensive biochemical studies revealing a <italic>XIAP</italic>/TRIP-Br1-dependent mechanism for regulating cellular protein levels of adenylyl cyclases. The authors show several lines of evidence supporting that TRIP-br1 functions as an adaptor of <italic>XIAP</italic> E3 ligase for AC ubiquitination and degradation. The authors propose that <italic>XIAP</italic>/TRIP-Br1-mediated degradation of ACs can serve as a negative-feedback mechanism for controlling homeostasis of cAMP signaling. Most experiments were done with AC1. Interaction of TRIP-br1 with ACs and <italic>XIAP</italic>/TRIP-Br1-dependent AC ubiquitination and AC protein levels were shown in several other AC isoforms. TRIP-Br1 knockout mice and <italic>XIAP</italic>-deltaRING mice exhibit increased AC protein levels, consistent with the authors' model. The mutant mice also show AC-related physiological and behavioral phenotypes.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The conclusion for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> would be better supported by including quantification analysis.</p><p>2) The ubiquitination assay in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> seems to mainly consist of one major band instead of the usual smear as seen for example in B. Any explanation? In this figure the expression level of TRIP-Br1 does not seem to increase with the overexpression of the flag tagged protein. Should the effect of overexpression and the resulting reduction of AC1 levels not be larger?</p><p>3) K27 modifications are rather unusual. For degradation K48 would be the preferred one. The type of ubiquitination is linked to the E2. Is there any indication of which E2 is involved?</p><p>4) Connected to the point above: A complete model would have to consider the binding and interaction of the E2 enzyme. Where would it interact with in the model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>?</p><p>Mouse work:</p><p>5) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>, the authors show a battery of behavioral analyses and conclude that knocking out TRIP-Br1 causes anxiety-like behavior. However, the behavioral phenotypes could be more complex than simply being interpreted as anxiety-like disorder. For example, forced swimming test is conventionally used for depression or despair. Nesting test has not been generally adopted for anxiety disorder. The authors should provide more convincing justification in order to conclude an anxiety-like disorder or be more conservative in describing this apparent mood disorder phenotype.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28021.023</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p> <italic>1) The conclusion for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> would be better supported by including quantification analysis.</italic> </p><p>As suggested, the quantification of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2A and 2E</xref> is now included in the revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>.</p><p> <italic>2) The ubiquitination assay in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> seems to mainly consist of one major band instead of the usual smear as seen for example in B. Any explanation? In this figure the expression level of TRIP-Br1 does not seem to increase with the overexpression of the flag tagged protein. Should the effect of overexpression and the resulting reduction of AC1 levels not be larger?</italic> </p><p>Depending on the conditions of SDS-PAGE, such as gel concentrations and electrophoresis/separation time, the pattern of ubiquitinated AC1 may appear different. The experiment in original <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> used 10% gel (vs. 8% gel in other experiments; see the molecular markers) and relatively short running time and therefore ubiquitinated AC1 appeared more condensed, but still smeared, especially in the last two lanes. Nevertheless, most of the ubiquitinated AC1 are between 170 and 130 kD in both 8% and 10% gel.</p><p>It has been reported by various labs that FLAG tag masks the antigen of protein specific antibodies in western blotting for unclear reasons. In our case, FLAG-tagged TRIP-Br1 was barely detected by our anti-TRIP-Br1 antibody, unless the protein sample was boiled and added with 200 mM DTT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Author response image 1</xref>). However, boiling would make AC1 aggregate. Therefore, the protein sample in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> was not boiled, and FLAG-tagged TRIP-Br1 was hardly detected by anti-TRIP-Br1 antibody. The original purpose to display the signals detected by anti-TRIP-Br1 antibody in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> was mainly to show that endogenous TRIP-Br1 was not affected by overexpression of <italic>XIAP</italic>. This panel was removed in the revised figure to avoid confusion.</p><p>Overexpression of transient FLAG-tagged TRIP-Br1 seemed to result in average 50% reduction in AC1 (see the large collective sample size in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, including wild-type and mutant AC1). 30 to 70% reduction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and 4C</xref>) could be fluctuations around 50% because of the relative sample sizes.</p><p>In addition, we added a new panel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>) to further support the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> and other panels in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref> shows that deleting the RING domain of <italic>XIAP</italic> abolished the effect of TRIP-Br1 knockout in the mouse brain, further fortifying the notion that <italic>XIAP</italic> and TRIP-Br1 act in concert.<fig id="fig10" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28021.021</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>TRIP-Br1-FLAG was detected by TRIP-Br1 antibody.</title><p>HeLa cells were seeded in a 60-mm dish the day before the transfection. 5 ug TRIP-Br1-FLAG or control vector were transfected into the HeLa cells.

For degradation K48 would be the preferred one. The type of ubiquitination is linked to the E2. Is there any indication of which E2 is involved?</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewers to bring up this point. Although K27 linkages are indeed less abundant than K48 linkages, recent studies seem to suggest that K27 linkages are much more abundant than previously expected (9% K27 vs. 29% K48 linkages in the yeast) [1]. Numerous studies indicate that K27 linkage is involved in proteolytic functions [1-4].</p><p>UbcH5A, B, and C, which share 92% identity, have been functionally demonstrated to serve as the E2s of XIAP [5-9]. In our in-vitro ubiquitination assays, we used UbcH5B as the E2 of <italic>XIAP</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Importantly, UbcH5A or UbcH5B reportedly catalyses formation of K27 linages [2, 10]. Limited studies suggest that <italic>XIAP</italic> may physically interact with several other E2 enzymes [11, 12] but whether they serve as the E2s of <italic>XIAP</italic> is not known or rejected [9].</p><p>We added several sentences and relevant references in the revised paper to address this issue.</p><p> <italic>4) Connected to the point above: A complete model would have to consider the binding and interaction of the E2 enzyme. Where would it interact with in the model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>?</italic> </p><p>Previous studies show UbcH5B binds to the Ring domain of XIAP [7, 6]. We added UbcH5B in the model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>.</p><p> <italic>Mouse work:</italic> </p><p> <italic>5) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>, the authors show a battery of behavioral analyses and conclude that knocking out TRIP-Br1 causes anxiety-like behavior. However, the behavioral phenotypes could be more complex than simply being interpreted as anxiety-like disorder. For example, forced swimming test is conventionally used for depression or despair. Nesting test has not been generally adopted for anxiety disorder. The authors should provide more convincing justification in order to conclude an anxiety-like disorder or be more conservative in describing this apparent mood disorder phenotype.</italic></p><p>As suggested, we used a more conservative description: “anxiety-like behaviour” is replaced by “mood disorder, especially despair-like behaviour”.</p><p>1.
