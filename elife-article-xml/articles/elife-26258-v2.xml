Not only the local concentration but also duration of morphogen exposure is critical for correct cell fate decisions. Yet, how and when cells temporally integrate signals from a morphogen remains unclear. Here, we use optogenetic manipulation to switch off Bicoid-dependent transcription in the early <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo with high temporal resolution, allowing time-specific and reversible manipulation of morphogen signalling. We find that Bicoid transcriptional activity is dispensable for embryonic viability in the first hour after fertilization, but persistently required throughout the rest of the blastoderm stage. Short interruptions of Bicoid activity alter the most anterior cell fate decisions, while prolonged inactivation expands patterning defects from anterior to posterior. Such anterior susceptibility correlates with high reliance of anterior gap gene expression on Bicoid. Therefore, cell fates exposed to higher Bicoid concentration require input for longer duration, demonstrating a previously unknown aspect of Bicoid decoding.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.26258.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.26258.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>morphogen</kwd><kwd>temporal interpretation</kwd><kwd>pattern formation</kwd><kwd>optogenetics</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001381</institution-id><institution>National Research Foundation Singapore</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Saunders</surname><given-names>Timothy E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Cell fates endowed by higher Bicoid concentration require input for longer duration, demonstrating a temporally non-linear morphogen-mediated pattern formation.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>eLife Digest</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Morphogens are molecules distributed in spatial gradients that provide essential positional information in the process of development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Turing, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wolpert, 1969</xref>). By activating differential gene expression in a concentration-dependent manner, morphogens instruct the cells to adopt proper cell fates according to their positions in the developing embryos or tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gurdon and Bourillot, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Neumann and Cohen, 1997</xref>). The impact of a morphogen gradient on a developing system depends on two characteristics: first, its information capacity in terms of how many distinct cell types it has an effect on; second, its transferring precision – in essence, how reproducible cell fates are in different individuals at given positions. Each of these characteristics depends not only on the local concentration of morphogen molecules that the cells interpret, but also temporal components of such interpretation.</p><p>The temporal pattern of morphogen interpretation has been demonstrated in several vertebrate developing systems. Harfe et al. first proposed that the length of time of morphogen signalling is critical for correct cell fate specification. They found that during mouse limb development, cells exposed to Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) morphogen for longer time develop into digits of more posterior identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Harfe et al., 2004</xref>). Similarly, in chick neural tube formation the duration of Shh activity is translated into different cell types along the dorso-ventral axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dessaud et al., 2007</xref>). In comparison, in fish dorso-ventral patterning it is not the duration but the timing of BMP signaling that is important for correct cell fate determination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tucker et al., 2008</xref>). While in some cases the temporal integration of morphogen signaling is carried out by genetic feedback loops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dessaud et al., 2010</xref>), in many other systems the underlying mechanism has not been unveiled.</p><p>As the first protein identified to function as a morphogen, Bicoid (Bcd) patterns the cells along the antero-posterior axis in the early embryo of the fruitfly, <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Driever et al., 1989</xref>). Bcd is maternally deposited and localized at the anterior pole of the embryo in the form of mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Frohnhöfer and Nüsslein-Volhard, 1986</xref>). This localized mRNA is further translated upon fertilization, forming a protein gradient with exponential decay in concentration along the antero-posterior axis. Fundamentally acting as a transcription factor, Bcd activates different genes, with the more anteriorly expressed genes having lower Bcd binding affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Struhl et al., 1989</xref>). Quantitative studies have shown that the Bcd gradient is highly dynamic, with nuclear Bcd concentration constantly changing throughout the first 13 rounds of syncytial cell divisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Little et al., 2011</xref>). It has been suggested that precise positional information endowed by Bcd gradient at one single time point suffices to distinguish neighbor cell identities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gregor et al., 2007a</xref>). However, recent results have motivated intense debate over what is the exact time window when the information carried by Bcd is interpreted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bergmann et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gregor et al., 2007b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Liu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lucchetta et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>To address this question, fast and reversible temporal manipulation of Bcd activity is required. In this study, we have developed an optogenetic tool to control Bcd-dependent transcription in the early <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo with high temporal resolution. Using this tool, we provide a detailed dissection of the temporal components of Bcd decoding in vivo. The results unveil an unexpected temporal pattern of Bcd action – cell fates determined by higher Bcd concentration require Bcd for longer duration, while cells experiencing lower Bcd dosage commit to correct fates at earlier developmental stages. Further combining temporal perturbation with quantitative analyses, we find that the differential expression kinetics of target genes can partly explain the mechanism underlying such temporal interpretation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Precise temporal control of Bcd-dependent transcription via optogenetic manipulation</title><p>We built a light-responsive construct to switch off Bcd-dependent transcription by fusing the optogenetic cassette cryptochrome 2 (CRY2) together with mCherry (mCh) to the N-terminus of Bcd (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kennedy et al., 2010</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

The expression patterns of four gap genes – hunchback (hb), giant (gt), krüppel (kr) and knirps (kni) – are reminiscent of wild-type embryos when the light-responsive Bcd construct is expressed in an otherwise <italic>bcd</italic> mutant background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–E</xref>). These embryos hatch as healthy larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). In comparison, embryos illuminated with blue light during the first 2.5 hr after egg deposition fail to develop the head and thorax structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H’</xref>), resembling that of the <italic>bcd</italic> knockout phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H’’</xref>). Illuminated embryos show strong repression of the anterior, Bcd-dependent, expression of hb, gt and kni, while their posterior, Bcd-independent counterparts remain intact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B’–D’</xref>). Furthermore, the Kr band shifts anteriorly compared to the pattern observed in the dark (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E–E’</xref>, arrowheads). Noticeably, while <italic>bcd</italic> null embryos are characterized by expression of ectopic hb and gt stripes in the anterior regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B’’ and C’’</xref>, arrowheads) and a duplicated telson at the anterior end (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H’’</xref>, arrowhead), these features do not appear in illuminated embryos. Such phenotypic differences can be readily explained by the different distribution of Caudal (Cad) proteins in two different ways of Bcd perturbation. In wild-type embryos, Cad is expressed in a broad posterior domain in early blastoderm stages as a result of translational repression by Bcd and functions in posterior patterning by activating abdominal gap genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Schulz and Tautz, 1995</xref>). While Cad is uniformly expressed in <italic>bcd</italic> null embryos due to a lack of anterior repression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G’’</xref>), we saw no shift in Cad gradient in illuminated embryos when compared to those in the dark (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G,G’ and K</xref>). It suggests that light-induced conformational changes did not alter the translation inhibitory capability of Bcd in the cytoplasm (in comparison, Cad boundary shifts anteriorly with decreasing bcd dosages, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). We further quantified the Bcd gradient under dark and illuminated conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F–F’</xref>) and observed no significant change in Bcd profile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>), showing that the spatial distribution of Bcd molecules is not affected by our manipulation.</p><p>Next, we tested whether CRY2::mCh::Bcd under illumination inhibits transcription in a dominant negative manner. We selected two fly lines expressing CRY2::mCh::Bcd at comparatively lower and higher levels in a bcd wild-type background, denoted by CRY2<sup>low</sup> and CRY2<sup>high</sup>, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>) and utilized the MS2-MCP system to visualize the transcriptional activity of the Bcd target gene hb as shown by the GFP-tagged MS2 coat protein (MCP::GFP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Garcia et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lucas et al., 2013</xref>). Compared to wild-type embryos - where transcriptional activity of hb in the Bcd-dependent anterior domain persists throughout the interphase of nuclear cycle (n.c.) 13 (7.1 ± 3.2 min; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>) - CRY2<sup>low</sup> embryos show significantly reduced transcriptional persistence when illuminated with a 488 nm laser (3.6 ± 1.1 min; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and C</xref>). Such an inhibitory effect becomes more prominent in CRY2<sup>high</sup> embryos (3.0 ± 0.5 min, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and D</xref>). The transcription of the posterior hb domain is Bcd-independent and, reassuringly, we do not observe any inhibitory effect in this domain (4.3 ± 2.0 min, 5.2 ± 3.3 min, and 4.2 ± 2.0 min in control, CRY2<sup>low</sup>, and CRY2<sup>high</sup>, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Further, the inhibitory effect for the same genetic background and illumination conditions is uniform along the AP axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). As parallel evidence, ChIP-qPCR experiments show comparable CRY2::mCh::Bcd binding in dark or light to native Bcd binding sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>), with no noticeable unspecific DNA binding caused by light-induced conformational changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26258.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Inhibitory effect on Bcd-dependent transcription is gene-dosage and light-power dependent.</title><p>(<bold>A and E</bold>) Proportion of the nuclei positive for <italic>hb</italic> transcription plotted vs. the persistence of transcription activity during n.c. 13 in control (blue), CRY2<sup>low</sup> (orange) and CRY2<sup>high</sup> (red) embryos of <italic>hb</italic> anterior (<bold>A</bold>) and posterior (<bold>E</bold>) domain. n = 3 embryos per genotype.

First, we validated that in a wild-type bcd background MCP::mCh shows the same reporter kinetics as MCP::GFP regarding the density of transcriptionally active nuclei as well as transcription persistence from n.c. 12 to 14 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3B–E</xref>). Further, under dark conditions embryos expressing maternally loaded CRY2::mCh::Bcd and MCP::mCh show the same hb transcription dynamics as that of wild-type embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4A and A’</xref>). When these embryos are subjected to short illumination (1 min) two minutes after the onset of hb transcription in n.c. 13, we observed an abrupt diminishing number of active nuclei over a period of 4 min, and a complete cessation of fluorescent signals 4 min after illumination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4B and B’</xref>). Given that the MS2-yellow reporter gene is 6.4 kb in length and the measured PolII elongation rate is 1.54 kb/min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Garcia et al., 2013</xref>), we attribute the remnant reporter signals within these 4 min to the elongating transcripts initiated before illumination. When the embryos were illuminated during the 12th division, no transcription activity was detected until 5 min after dark recovery in n.c.13, with a full recovery in n.c.14 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4C and C’</xref>). These observations suggest that the optogenetic manipulation shows fast kinetics with immediate inhibition of transcription upon illumination and re-initiation of transcription 5 min after returning to dark condition.</p><p>We then explored the effect of tuning the inhibition of Bcd-dependent transcription by varying the blue-light illumination intensity. We illuminated embryos with blue light at different powers (0.04, 0.4 and 4 mW) during the hour prior to gastrulation. We used the Even-skipped (Eve) pattern, where Eve stripes 1 and 2 are Bcd-dependent and more posterior stripes are Bcd-independent as a readout of Bcd activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Frasch and Levine, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Stanojevic et al., 1991</xref>). In a WT background, low power illumination (0.04 mW) causes a moderate reduction and a slight anterior shift of the Eve stripes 1 and 2 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H and I</xref>). Increasing light power further decreases the expression level of the first two Eve stripes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J and K</xref>). When expressed in a <italic>bcd</italic> null background, CRY2::mCh::Bcd completely inhibits the expression of the anterior two Eve stripes, even at the lowest light power tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2L–O</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Persistent Bcd transcription activity is indispensable to embryonic viability</title><p>Bcd confers robust cell fate decisions by activating hierarchical segmentation gene networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jaeger et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kraut and Levine, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Manu et al., 2009a</xref>). Previous studies have shown that only at early n.c. 14 is the absolute Bcd concentration interpreted as positional information. In late n.c. 14, on the contrary, expression boundaries of downstream genes are subjected to cross-regulation and the Bcd gradient is believed to no longer be important (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Liu et al., 2013</xref>). To determine whether Bcd-dependent transcription in late n.c. 14 is actually irrelevant for cell fate determination, we collected embryos laid by females expressing CRY2::mCh::Bcd in a <italic>bcd</italic> null background (CRY2<sup>high</sup>, Bcd<sup>null</sup>; in all following experiments unless otherwise stated) and illuminated them before the initiation of gastrulation for time windows ranging from 10 to 60 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Surprisingly, 10 min of illumination at the end of n.c. 14 is sufficient to induce embryonic lethality. Cuticle preparation of these non-hatched embryos shows defective mouthparts, in particular the pharynx (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C and D</xref>, arrows). In addition, the structures between mouth hooks and cephalo-pharyngeal plates are missing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, arrowhead). Thirty minutes of illumination causes further deterioration in mouth development, with minimal mouth skeleton visible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Extending the illumination window depletes all mouthparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F and G</xref>), with the most severe phenotypes observed when illumination encompasses both n.c. 13 and n.c. 14. Under this condition, all thorax segments are lost, with only abdominal denticle belts remaining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>).<fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26258.010</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Illumination across different time windows causes embryonic lethality with varied severity.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic demonstration of illumination time windows.

We tested whether such early Bcd-dependent transcription was essential for embryonic viability by illuminating embryos during early developmental stages (<italic>i.e.</italic> before n.c. 14) and reverting them later to dark conditions to recover Bcd-dependent transcription. We find that a 30 min illumination window spanning n.c. 11 ~ 13 results in severe patterning defects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>), phenocopying the embryos illuminated during n.c. 13 and 14 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). This suggests that Bcd-dependent transcription before n.c. 14 is indispensable for initiating its downstream gene cascade. Shifting the 30 min illumination period to 10 min earlier results in the recovery of proper thoracic segment patterning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J</xref>, arrowhead). As the illumination time window is shifted sequentially earlier, more thorax and mouthparts are successively recovered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3K–M</xref>). Last, when the illumination time window is shifted before n.c. 10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3M</xref>), the cuticle patterns become equivalent to those of embryos developing in the dark (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>) or wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) and, moreover, the larval hatchability reaches that of dark conditions.</p><p>These temporal perturbation experiments reveal that persistent Bcd-dependent transcription activity from n.c.10 is required for robust embryonic patterning, and ultimately embryonic viability.

To determine which cell fates are altered by the lack of Bcd function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), we fixed illuminated CRY2<sup>high</sup>, Bcd<sup>null</sup> embryos at the end of germband extension (GBE, 4 hr after gastrulation initiates) and analyzed the expression of Engrailed (En) and various Hox genes. The most anterior morphological features that can be observed at GBE are the clypeolabrum lobe at the very tip of the embryo and the invagination of stomodeum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, red and orange dots, respectively). Blue-light illumination for 10 min before gastrulation impairs the formation of these very anterior structures while the expression of the more posterior En stripes remains intact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Extending illumination to 30 min prior to gastrulation, we observe the loss of the next two En stripes marking the mandibular (Mn) and maxillary (Mx) segments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Concomitantly, we observe diminished expression of Deformed, a Hox gene that controls morphogenesis of these same Mn and Mx segments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D’</xref>). This suggests that presumptive Mn and Mx cells commit to alternative cell fates. Similarly, 50 min of illumination prior to gastrulation results in the loss of expression of Sex Comb Reduced (Scr), the hox gene that regulates development of the labial segment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E’ and E’’</xref>). This correlates with the loss of the En stripe marking this very same segment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>).

Illumination during the last 30 min of the blastoderm stage does not affect Hb in neither protein level nor boundary position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), indicating that Hb expression is independent of the newly synthesized mRNA in the last 30 min of n.c. 14. This shows that the Hb protein level remains stable once the <italic>hb</italic> mRNA amount has exceeded a certain threshold value. However, extending illumination throughout n.c. 14 (or even earlier) results in deviations of the Hb anterior pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, arrows; and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B4</xref>). It has previously been reported that the Hb pattern due to the activity of the hb stripe enhancer at the posterior border evolves during n.c. 14 from a shallow and broad gradient to a steep and sharp one (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Perry et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">2012</xref>). Here, we show that the mRNA synthesized prior to n.c. 14 is sufficient to support the formation of the broad gradient, as demonstrated by the Hb expression profile in embryos illuminated throughout cycle 14 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, ④). Transcriptional activity in the first 15 min of n.c. 14 is hence critical for precise formation of the wild-type Hb expression profile, at both anterior and posterior (driven by the stripe enhancer) borders. Further, continuous illumination throughout n.c. 13 and n.c. 14 severely impairs the anterior Hb expression level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B5</xref>), showing that mRNA synthesized during n.c. 13 contributes significantly to the final Hb pattern. Interestingly, recovering the transcriptional activity during the last 30 min of n.c. 14 by reverting the embryos to the dark, results in a partial rescue of Hb anterior expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, arrow), supporting the presence of a <italic>hb</italic> mRNA threshold. Nevertheless, transcription activity in late n.c. 14 fails to recover the stripe enhancer activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, ⑥), potentially due to shifted borders of posterior repressive factors. Next, we tested the contribution of hb transcription prior to n.c. 13. Illumination during n.c. 10–12 results in a steep but narrow Hb gradient, where the posterior boundary shifts anteriorly by ~10% EL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, ⑦). Illumination carried out before n.c. 11 results in a recovery of the shape of the Hb gradient when comparing to that of dark conditions, although the posterior border is still anteriorly shifted by 5% EL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, ⑧ and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5E–F</xref>, anterior shift indicated by red dashed line). Consistent with this, we observed a significant anterior shift of cephalic furrow position in embryos illuminated during n.c.10–11 compared to dark condition (64.4 ± 1.5% EL in dark and 70.4 ± 1.3% EL in illuminated embryos; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). This suggests that the Bcd inputs during n.c. 10–12 are integrated into later decisions on boundary positions. Therefore, we can temporally dissect Bcd-dependent activation of Hb, including separating the contributions from different enhancers.</p><p>The expression of the gap genes Kr (58–45% EL) and Kni (45–37% EL) is subjected to fine-tuning by Bcd-dependent transcription (in combination with Hb) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hoch et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hülskamp et al., 1990</xref>). We find that the anterior boundary of Kr shows very high sensitivity to Bcd transcriptional inhibition - 20 min of illumination during the end of n.c. 14 causes an anterior shift by 3% EL, slightly widening the Kr domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>, ②, blue dot). Both the anterior and posterior borders of the Kr expression domain shift anteriorly upon illumination conditions ④, ⑤ and ⑥ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>), correlating with the shift of the Hb boundary (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, ④ and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5C</xref>, ⑤ and ⑥). The strongest anterior shift of Kr boundaries is observed when embryos are reverted to dark after early illumination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>, ⑥ and ⑦), as repressive Hb expression is anteriorly shifted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, ⑥ and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5D</xref>, ⑦) while Bcd transcriptional activity is recovered. The Kni anterior boundary shifts in correspondence with the posterior Kr boundary shifts, while its posterior boundary is much less sensitive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>). In summary we find that the more anterior expression boundaries are located, the more susceptible they are to temporal inhibition of Bcd-dependent transcription. Further, we find that a tight temporal interplay between Bcd and Hb is required for the precise positioning of gap gene expression boundaries.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Refining parameter estimation in models of gap gene network</title><p>Modelling has been a powerful tool in understanding early <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo development, with models identifying critical components in the gap gene network required for forming robust gene expression boundaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bieler et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jaeger et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Manu et al., 2009a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">2009b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Perkins et al., 2006</xref>). These models use coupled differential equations to incorporate interactions between gap genes (Hb, Gt, Kr and Kni) and with maternal inputs, along with diffusion and protein degradation. To test how such models perform under temporal perturbation of the Bcd input, we used the model outlined in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bieler et al.

However, the behaviour of the anterior domains of Hb and Gt are not consistent with the model predictions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3B</xref>).</p><p>We next used the 21 parameter sets identified in Bieler <italic>et al.</italic> that replicate satisfactorily the wild-type expression profiles for Hb, Gt, Kr and Kni, to explore whether our temporal perturbations can be used to refine the parameter estimations. We assessed the simulation predictions based on the following criteria derived from our optogenetic perturbations: (i) anterior shift in Kr anterior boundary; (ii) anterior shift in anterior boundary of Kni posterior domain; (iii) reduction in Kni anterior expression; (iv) reduction in Gt anterior expression; (v) anterior shift of posterior boundary of Hb anterior domain and reduction in anterior Hb expression. We identified 9 out of 21 parameter sets that qualitatively agreed with at least three of the above criteria. We compared how the average parameter values of this subset differed from the mean parameter values of all 21 parameter sets, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3D–E</xref>). While the selected subsets did not show much variation in values compared to all 21 parameter sets for interactions affecting the Hb and Kr genes, interactions regulating both Gt and Kni showed larger differences. For example, Bcd plays a more prominent role in activating Gt and Kni autoregulation is reduced in the parameter subset. This suggests that our temporal perturbations can be used to refine models of gap gene segmentation and that gap gene network models need to incorporate Bcd dynamics as well as potential additional interactions within the anterior domain.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Spatio-temporal atlas of Bcd decoding</title><p>We can construct a novel spatio-temporal atlas of Bcd-dependent gene transcription in the early <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo, with clear time windows for gene activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). A minimal 20 min illumination at the end of n.c. 14 abolishes the expression of the Knirps anterior domain (Kni1) capping the tip of the embryo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B and B’</xref>), as well as the first Giant stripe (Gt1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C and C’</xref>). Extending the Bcd inactivation across n.c. 14 further inhibits the gap gene expression domains located slightly more posterior, Orthodenticle (Otd) and the second Gt stripe (Gt2) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C’’, D and D’</xref>). Recovery of transcription activity in late stages fails to rescue the expression of most of these anterior gap gene domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C6</xref>, D6 and F6). When Bcd-dependent transcription is inhibited during n.c. 10–12 and then embryos returned to dark from n.c. 13, the time window for transcriptional recovery (approximately 1 hr) is insufficient to rescue the expression patterns of Kni1, Gt1 and Otd (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C7</xref>, D7 and F7). This supports a mechanism whereby Bcd-dependent transcription serves a priming role prior to n.c. 13 to activate anterior segmentation genes at later stages. Such a priming role is stage-specific, as it is not compensated by late recovery of Bcd transcriptional activity.

Any short interruption of Bcd transcriptional activity (from n.c. 10 till the very end of n.c. 14) abolishes the activation or maintenance of these gap gene expression domains. As they lie on top of the hierarchical gene network defining cell fates, their loss alters cell fate decisions and leads to morphological defects. Comparatively, the expression of gap gene domains at posterior positions is less susceptible to perturbations in Bcd function. Consequently, cells arising from these domains still commit to correct fates under Bcd deprivation at early or late stages, as reflected in Hox gene expression patterns. We summarize this spatio-temporally coordinated Bcd interpretation in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>. The more anterior structures, which have cell fates governed by high Bcd concentration, require Bcd for an extended period of time. On the contrary, cells at positions responding to low Bcd require a markedly shorter time window of exposure to Bcd activity to commit to cell fates appropriate for their spatial position.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Optogenetic manipulation of transcription activity in vivo</title><p>Several recent studies have used elegantly designed optogenetic systems to unveil the temporal role of signalling pathways in embryonic cell fate induction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Johnson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sako et al., 2016</xref>). As a common strategy, a ubiquitously expressed construct is utilized to activate the upstream components of the signalling pathway in a light-responsive manner. In this study, we developed and characterized an optogenetic tool to temporally switch on and off of the transcriptional activity of the morphogen protein Bcd. In contrast to the previous approaches, our light-sensitive protein CRY2::mCh::Bcd is present in the spatial distribution of a native Bcd gradient. While the protein remains transcriptionally active in the dark, blue light-induced conformational change of N-terminal CRY2 abolishes all direct target gene expressions instantaneously. This renders the construct ideal for studying temporal morphogen interpretation. It will be of general interest to further explore if the N-terminal CRY2 exerts transcriptional inhibition when tagged with other transcription factors, so that our optogenetic approach can be more widely applied to understand the temporal readout of spatially distributed transcription factors.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Mechanism underlying light-induced inhibition of Bcd transcription activity</title><p>The following results helped us to narrow down the possible mechanisms underlying light-responsive manipulation of Bcd transcriptional activity. (1) Illumination does not affect the spatial distribution of the protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>), suggesting that the normal Bcd diffusion is not hampered. (2) The fact that CRY2::mCh::Bcd inhibits Cad translation in the anterior region of illuminated embryos suggests that CRY2::mCh::Bcd in light can specifically recognize and bind to the Bcd response element in the 3’UTR of Caudal mRNA. This indicates that the homeodomain folding remains intact during illumination. (3) CRY2::mCh::Bcd competes with wild-type Bcd to inhibit target gene transcription in a dominant negative manner, indicating that CRY2::mCh::Bcd in light still binds to its native DNA binding sites. (4) Both cuticle patterns and segmentation gene expression patterns of illuminated embryos show more severe phenotypes compared to Bcd cooperativity mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lebrecht et al., 2005</xref>), suggesting that the perturbation affects more than just the cooperative binding of Bcd to its target sites. Altogether, these results point to the scenario where light-induced CRY2 conformational change does not alter Bcd specific DNA binding but abolishes its transcription activating potency due to the failure of proper assembly or the release of the transcriptional machinery. The difficulty here lies in specifying the molecular mechanism underlying such an inhibitory effect. Roles of the Bcd N-terminal domain in mediating protein interactions were elucidated previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fu et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ma et al., 1996</xref>). Here, it is unclear whether it is Bcd-Bcd interaction, Bcd interaction with its co-activators and/or other general transcription cofactors that is inhibited. Hopefully, future structural studies on Cryptochromes light-responsive conformational changes will help us to clarify this issue.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>The temporal pattern of Bcd signal integration is spatially inhomogeneous</title><p>The continuous transitions between cell states in a developing embryo are governed by both the transcriptional landscape and the transcriptional history of the cells. Therefore, not only the local concentrations of the combinatorial transcription factors but also the timing and duration of their presence are essential for the correct cell fate decisions. Bcd in the early fruit fly embryo provides the very initial positional cues along the antero-posterior axis, differentiating cells spanning ~10 embryonic segments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Driever et al., 1989</xref>). The gradient profile of Bcd is highly dynamic throughout the blastoderm stage, with no clear steady-state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Little et al., 2011</xref>). Such dynamics make the temporal aspects of Bcd interpretation critical for precise decoding of the morphogen. A previous study quantified the temporal evolution of Bcd dosage at several gap gene expression boundaries, and deduced that the absolute Bcd concentration is read out during early n.c. 14 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Liu et al., 2013</xref>). In comparison, data-driven models propose a much wider time window for Bcd readout, as decoding the gradient earlier in development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bergmann et al., 2007</xref>) or during its degradation in n.c. 14 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Verd et al., 2017</xref>) gives rise to more accurate predictions of gap gene expression patterns. Direct testing of these ideas has previously been difficult due to a lack of temporal manipulation of Bcd activity.</p><p>Consistent with previous studies, we find that the time window ranging from n.c. 13 to early n.c. 14 is indeed most critical for Bcd-dependent patterning of downstream genes; deprivation of Bcd transcriptional activity during this period leads to severe patterning defects in all the Bcd-dependent embryonic regions, from the most anterior to mesothoracic segment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G and I</xref>). On the other hand, Bcd activity in this critical time window is sufficient for the proper cell fate induction in mesothorax, regardless of Bcd activity in rest of the time points throughout the blastoderm stage. Further, the more anterior the cells locate, the wider time window of Bcd activity is required (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), as in the extreme case, the proper formation of the most ‘needy’ clypeolabrum segment, patterned by the highest Bcd concentration, requires Bcd-dependent transcription from n.c. 10 to the very end of n.c. 14 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B–C</xref>).</p><p>Similar correlations between morphogen concentration and required duration have been observed in Shh patterning of the vertebrate neural tube (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dessaud et al., 2007</xref>). Shh signalling is temporally integrated by a genetic feedback loop that leads to desensitization of cells to Shh signal over time. In this way, the duration of Shh input is translated into differential gene expression. Considering the rapid establishment Bcd target gene expression patterns, it is unlikely that the same mechanism is utilized here. Our quantitative analysis on gap gene expression stand in line with two alternative mechanisms underlying such temporal integration: (1) The anterior gap genes have slower transcription rates than the posterior gap genes, therefore they require Bcd for longer duration. A recent study has proposed a role of transcription kinetics in shaping the timing as well as the spatial range of morphogen response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dubrulle et al., 2015</xref>). Here, we find that the mRNA production and protein turnover of the anterior gap genes are in a tight balance. Once this balance is tipped by inhibiting transcription even for a short period of time, the protein expression can no longer be maintained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–D</xref>). In contrast, inhibiting the transcription of more posterior genes, such as hb, in mid to late n.c. 14 does not affect their expression, potentially due to an excessive mRNA pool. (2) Bcd-dependent transcription serves as a priming role in early stages for proper expression of anterior gap genes. Restoring native Bcd dosage in later stages fails to initiate <italic>bona fide</italic> gene expression in the very anterior domains, suggesting that cells are no longer competent to adopt anterior-most cell fates. Whether Bcd primes cell competency by chromosomal remodeling to increase accessibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blythe and Wieschaus, 2016</xref>) or inhibiting the otherwise ectopically expressed repressive factors must be subjected to further investigation. These recent results, including those outlined in this paper, suggest that models of gap gene expression need to incorporate temporal variation more carefully. In particular, anterior gap genes depend on Bcd for longer than more posterior genes, which is not reflected in current models. Our optogenetic tool allows precise and subtle perturbations to be performed, allowing a more systematic test of the models for gap gene expression.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Phenotypic resemblance between hypomorphic bcd alleles and short temporal perturbations</title><p>Three anterior embryonic regions with different sensitivity for bcd reduction can be distinguished, that is, the preantennal head region, the antennal and gnathocephalic head segments, and the thorax.

The resemblance between hypomorphic <italic>bcd</italic> alleles and short temporal perturbations demonstrates that constitutively low <italic>bcd</italic> activity is functionally equivalent to normal bcd activity with reduced active duration; both are sufficient to guide proper cell differentiation trajectories in the mid region of the embryo where target gene binding affinities are high. In comparison, in the more anterior region where target genes have low affinities, both wild-type level bcd activity and long duration are necessary for anterior induction. It is noteworthy that duplicated posterior structures only appear in strong allelic mutants but not in embryos subjected to long illumination due to a normal Cad gradient in our experiments. It would be interesting to understand whether hypomorphic <italic>bcd</italic> alleles can suppress Cad translation.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Temporal interpretation ensures developmental precision by buffering noises</title><p>What role does temporal coordination of morphogen interpretation play in achieving precise cell fate determination? In <italic>Drosophila</italic> - as in all long germband insects - the embryonic segments emerge simultaneously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sander, 1976</xref>). Bcd-dependent cell fate specification appears to move from posterior towards the anterior in a sequential manner. The most posterior cells ‘lock-in’ to their correct fate decisions by early cycle 14, becoming refractory to further alterations of Bcd dosage. Meanwhile, more anterior genes remain sensitive to Bcd dosage for much longer periods. Therefore, this mode of temporal interpretation can cope better with a temporally dynamic morphogen gradient or fluctuations in local concentration. This temporal sequence of boundary determination may help to assure robustness of gene boundary specification within such a short developmental time.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Tight coupling between transcription and morphogenesis</title><p>Our optogenetic transcriptional manipulation approach brings further insights into how transcription is tightly coupled to cell specification and could be extrapolated to other analyses as morphological movements during embryogenesis.

For the imaging of MCP::GFP lines, the embryos were imaged on a custom-built Spinning Disc microscope with a Nikon Apo 40X/1.25 water-immersion objective. The pixel size is 409 nm and the image resolution is 1024 × 1024 pixels. At each time point a stack of 35 images separated by 3 µm was acquired. The temporal resolution was 40 s.

Each Z-stack for each time point was Z-projected (maximum intensity). In order to automate the tracking and subsequent analysis, the following parameters were manually measured from the projections: lowest intensity value, spot size (matrix size, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>N</mml:mi><mml:mo>×</mml:mo><mml:mi>N</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>), maximum displacement distance within two frames and intensity difference between MS2 dots and surrounding background. The embryo boundary was automatically traced and extracted from projected images by using the ‘bwboundaries’ function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gonzalez et al., 2004</xref>). This measurement was later used to exclude false positive and to calculate the coordinates for each MS2 dots. At each time frame, MS2 dots were localized by applying a threshold corresponding to the lowest intensity value. Pixels showing an intensity higher than this threshold were selected. Following the selection, the pixels out of the embryo boundary were excluded. Next, a regional intensity comparison was performed by comparing the intensity of the selected pixels to its surrounding pixels within a <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf2"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>N</mml:mi><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>×</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>N</mml:mi><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo> </mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> matrix window. The intensity difference between the selected pixel and the average intensity of its neighbours was calculated and pixels having a value higher than the approximate intensity difference between MS2 dots and surrounding background were selected. Central coordinates, averaged intensity value and AP position were recorded for subsequent quantification. Tracking of MS2 dots used the maximum MS2 dots displacement distance calculated above to define a displacement range. Hence, a MS2 dot at the frame t was connected to the nearest dot at the frame t + 1 within the displacement range. Last, we excluded dot tracks lasting less than 160 s as it is shorter than a complete hb transcription event. The probability distribution of MS2 dots persistence in the anterior and posterior domains was calculated. The anterior domain was subdivided into five regions (100–75, 75–70, 70–65, 65–60 and 60–40 %EL) to refine the analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Chromatin immunoprecipitation and qPCR</title><p>Late n.c. 14 embryos aged in the dark or exposed to light (at 4 mW) for 45 min were dechorionated in household bleach. Embryos were crosslinked for 15 min in a solution containing 2 ml of PBS, 6 ml of Heptane and 180 µl of 20% paraformaldehyde. Embryos were transferred to a 1.5 ml tube and the crosslinking was quenched with the addition of 125 mM glycine in PBS 15 min after the start of fixation. ChIP samples were essentially prepared as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blythe and Wieschaus (2015)</xref>. Sonication was performed on a Sartorius stedim Labsonic M with a microtip horn. An input control corresponding to 2% of the volume per reaction was taken after sonication. Immunoprecipatations (IPs) were performed with a mCherry antibody (Clonetech #632496) for 15 hr at 4°C. ChIPped DNA were extracted with a Qiaquick spin column (Qiagen). Real-time quantitative PCR was performed using SYBR Green Assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific) on a Bio-Rad CFX96 Real-time system. Four primer pairs were used, respectively probing Hb (P2 enhancer), Gt, Otd and Kr. Additionally, a primer pair was designed 1 kb downstream of the P2 enhancer (HbP2 +1 kb) to be used as a negative control. The percent input method (100*2<sup>∧</sup>(Adjusted input – Ct(IP)) was used to normalize ChIP-qPCR data. Further, the relative % input for illuminated embryos was calculated as compared to the embryos in dark and summarized in a bar chart. In the case of the HbP2 +1 kb, data were compared to HbP2 results. Three independent replicates have been performed for each primer sets and the significance was calculated with a standard t-test.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Cuticle preparation</title><p>Embryos subjected to temporally patterned illumination were allowed to develop until the end of embryogenesis.

Embryos were then imaged on a custom-built Light-Sheet Microscope with a Nikon Apo 1 WD 25X/1.10 water-dipping objective. Embryos expressing CRY2::mCh::Bcd and the membrane marker Gap43::mCh were recorded using a 561 nm excitation laser. The pixel size was 510 nm and the image resolution was 1024 × 1024 pixels. At each time point a stack of 100 images separated by 2.5 µm was acquired. The temporal resolution was 30 s. This illumination setup mimics dark condition as no morphological defects were observed. To stimulate CRY2 conformational change in just one half of the embryo, a region on one lateral side of the embryo was defined from the most apical section up to 70 µm down. A stack of 100 sections separated by 0.7 µm were illuminated. The illumination was carried out from the beginning of the n.c. 14 (5 min after the establishment of the cellularization furrow) for 20 min with a 488 nm laser. Following illumination, embryos were imaged solely with the 561 nm excitation laser.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Eric Wieschaus, Thomas Gregor, Johannes Jaeger, Tiffany Cook, Thomas Kaufman and James Sharpe for sharing precious reagents.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Didier Stainier as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Jun Ma (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As you can see below, all three reviewers recommended your study and were particularly excited about your ability to manipulate temporal parameters of the Bicoid gradient.</p><p>The most significant recommendation was to perform some theoretical/computational analysis of the gap gene network, to examine your results, or call for the revision of existing models.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>For the last 30 years, the Bicoid gradient has been the most studied example of a morphogenetic gradient. It would thus seem difficult to find new important details that have been missed by these studies that went deep into molecular mechanisms and models of gene regulation. Yet, this paper appears to provide just that: not a huge amount of conceptual novelty, but a powerful way to manipulate temporal parameters of the gradient using a very clever method to render (some of) the activity of the protein light dependent.</p><p>The authors achieved this by fusing the Bicoid protein in the context of its own rescue construct to a light sensitive moiety. Interestingly, this appears to only affect the transcriptional activity of the protein and not its DNA binding or its RNA regulatory capacity: the activation domain might be more sensitive, which is surprising but the data show a full rescue without light and no rescue with light. This allowed the authors to stop activation by Bicoid at various times during development. They conclude that the temporal pattern of Bcd activation is important, which appears to be in slight contradiction with the work of Thomas Gregor who also quantified very carefully the effect of Bicoid but could not manipulate it so precisely. It appears that genes that require higher Bcd concentration require Bcd for longer duration, while exposed to low Bcd (whose targets have high affinity Bicoid binding sites) can be specified with short early exposure.</p><p>Other than that, it's the most novel contribution to the study of <italic>Drosophila</italic> AP patterning that I've seen in years. I'm not sure they solve a lot of the issues they raise, but the experiments and data are pretty interesting. I think understanding temporal contributions of transcription to cell fate are interesting, and it is great that the authors used this system to achieve this and their results are convincing: this is a powerful tool and they might be able to obtain new concepts with it.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>Huang et al. use an optogenetic system to investigate the temporal requirement for Bcd activity in <italic>Drosophila</italic> blastoderm patterning. The authors find that Bcd is required from 1h post-fertilisation (cell cycle 10) and that specification of anterior regions requires longer durations of Bcd activity than posterior regions. The authors used the approach to generate a map of the temporal requirements for Bcd activity.</p><p>An optogenetically controllable Bcd is an elegant and powerful reagent which provides a new perspective to this well established system. As the textbook example of a morphogen, this study will be of interest not only to the Bicoid field but to the wider developmental biology community. Overall the experiments are convincing and well documented and the manuscript is clear and accessible. Defining differential time requirements for different target genes and demonstrating a role of Bcd prior to cell cycle 13 are important results that will lead to a re-evaluation of currently favored models of Bcd dependent patterning.</p><p>The authors characterize the CRY2::mCh::Bcd in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and 2. Additional information would be helpful and some insight into the mechanism would be informative. This seems particularly important, given the dominant negative activity of the construct.</p><p>The authors suggest that illuminated embryos &quot;resemble&quot; the bcd knockout phenotype (subsection “Precise temporal control of Bcd-dependent transcription via optogenetic manipulation”, second paragraph). In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>—figure – supplement 2 the authors show that the phenotypes are not identical. This should be highlighted earlier in the text and the phenotypic comparison given more interpretation, to help readers not expert in the system.</p><p>The mechanism by which the cryptochrome cassette blocks Bcd activity is unclear. The authors note that spatial distribution of Bcd and DNA binding activity is unaffected and the Caudal gradient is also unaltered. These experiments would be strengthened by controls in which Bcd and Cad gradients are disrupted, to gauge the sensitivity of the assays. The genotypes of these embryos should also be clearly stated in the figure legend.</p><p>Experiments that directly test how quickly Bcd dependent transcription is lost in illuminated conditions and recovered following cessation of illumination would strengthen the interpretation of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> demonstrates the sequential loss of identities from the anterior as the illumination times are increased. It would be helpful to have a schematic of gene expression in this figure. While the loss of anterior gene expression is evident, the anterior expansion of more posterior fates (as would be expected in a homeotic-like transformation) is less evident.</p><p>The data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref> provide a detailed quantitative description of the temporal requirements for Bcd activity. These are novel and interesting findings that will help move the Bcd patterning field forward. Given the authors' expertise and the availability of dynamical models of the Gap gene system (from Reinitz, Jaeger and others) it seems a missed opportunity not to test whether in silico simulations using the existing models (interrupting Bcd activity during defined time windows) recapitulates the experimental results. Although developing an entirely new mathematical model might be beyond the scope of the current study, testing whether the data fit existing models would indicate whether new models (or new parameters for existing models) will be necessary. Related to this, the authors might want to extend their Discussion to consider the involvement of the dynamics of the Bcd controlled transcriptional network (as well as the kinetics of individual gene responses) in the differential sensitivity to durations of Bcd activity. This would allow a more direct comparison with the vertebrate neural tube where the dynamics of the Shh responsive transcriptional network are implicated.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>Huang et al. describe an optogenetic manipulation approach for investigating the temporal requirement of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> morphogen Bicoid (Bcd) for embryonic development. Their general conclusion is that cell fates dependent on higher Bcd concentration require the Bcd input for a longer duration of time. The concepts are interesting and most of the experiments are well controlled. The findings reported here are useful to the field. There are a few aspects that can be improved.</p><p>While the observed effects of light exposure on embryonic development and gene expression are convincing, the underlying mechanisms remain relatively unclear. This is because precisely how the CRY2::mCh::Bcd fusion protein becomes inactivated at the molecular or biochemical level has not been established. The authors describe experiments suggesting that neither the ability of Bcd in translation inhibition (monitored by Cad protein gradient profile) nor its DNA binding (monitored by ChIP) was affected. It is possible that, as suggested by the authors, the N-terminal fusion of CYR2 to Bcd may cause a light-induced conformational change that inhibits the transcriptional activity of Bcd (since its N-terminus does contain a regulatory motif modulating its transcription activity). But I am not fully convinced that the ChIP approach can sensitively and unambiguously rule out an effect on DNA binding. The fact that the expression domains of hb and Kr exhibit an anterior shift (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) is consistent with a potential effect on Bcd DNA binding (or Bcd gradient profile might also be altered – <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1O</xref>). While the distinction between DNA binding and transcriptional activation is crucial to understanding Bcd action as a transcription factor and several reports have recently described perturbations specifically altering the activation potency of Bcd, I believe the current manuscript can be written in a way that sidesteps this issue; but if the authors prefer to discuss it, they may need to provide a more detailed Discussion. Interestingly altering the activating potency of Bcd is known to cause changes in the shutdown timing of hb transcription and the hb expression level at nc14 in a specific manner. Whether and, if so, how these results are related to the current findings (particularly with regard to the persistence of transcription at nc13) should be discussed to give the reader a more comprehensive update of the current knowledge.</p><p>It is generally acknowledged that weaker bcd alleles tend to affect preferentially the formation of the most anterior structures, suggesting that such structures are more sensitive to perturbations of the Bcd input. It would be useful to discuss how this study may (or may not) provide mechanistic insights into those earlier findings.</p><p>It is useful to provide a brief discussion on the estimated time scales of both illumination-induced inactivation and &quot;reactivation&quot; in experimental setting described in the current study.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26258.024</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>The most significant recommendation was to perform some theoretical/computational analysis of the gap gene network, to examine your results, or call for the revision of existing models.</italic> </p><p>We would like to thank the reviewers for their comments about our work, and the constructive questions and suggestions.

These models use coupled differential equations to incorporate interactions between gap genes (Hb, Gt, Kr and Kni) and with maternal inputs, along with diffusion and protein degradation.</p><p>To test how such models perform under temporal perturbation of the Bcd input, we used the model outlined in Bieler et al., which is an advanced gap gene network model that incorporates the three-dimensional embryo shape, regulatory inputs from Bcd, Cad, Tailless and Huckebein, and the distinct regulatory functions of Hunchback monomers and dimers. The general form of this model is similar to other published models (though Bieler et al., represents one of the most up-to-date versions), and therefore we do not expect significant variation in our conclusions from using other, similar, models.</p><p>We were able to effectively introduce into the model Bcd temporal deprivation by setting the interaction strength with Bcd to zero at different times in the simulation, see Materials and methods and new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>. To briefly summarize these results, we find that our optogenetic perturbations enable us to refine the parameter estimations for the interaction parameters between gap genes and between gap genes and maternal inputs. Bieler et al., identified 21 in silicoparameter sets that agree well with observed gap gene expression profiles. Of these, a subset of 9 were qualitatively consistent with our observed optogenetic perturbations. We find that the parameter values representing regulation of Hb and Kr in this subset do not show much variation compared with the average parameter values for all 21 parameter sets. However, the parameters regulating Gt and Kni expression show larger variation between the subset and the complete parameter set. For example, on average the input of Bcd into Gt regulation is increased and Kni autoregulation is decreased in the parameter subset.</p><p>Results of these numerical simulations are provided in the main paper and in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>, with a new Materials and methods section outlining details of how the simulations were performed (subsection “Refining parameter estimation in models of gap gene network”. The simulations provide two key insights: (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>) they enable refinement of existing parameter sets, in particular by incorporating a more dynamic perturbation; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>) they predict that additional inputs are required for the model, particularly in the anterior of the embryo, to match our observations.</p><p>2) The mechanism underlying light-induced Bcd-dependent transcriptional inhibition</p><p>At the early phase of the project when we first observed the light-induced lethality in embryos expressing maternally loaded CRY2::mCh::Bcd protein in a wild-type bcd background, we considered several possible mechanisms underlying such phenomenon. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>) Light induces CRY2 dimerization/oligomerization and therefore the formation of CRY2::mCh::Bcd protein clusters. Wild-type Bcd proteins are also recruited into clusters due to Bcd-Bcd protein interaction. The enormous size of such clusters prevent Bcd proteins from entering nuclei or freely diffusing therefore abolishes the activity of Bcd-dependent transcription. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>) The conformational change of CRY2 masks the surface of Bcd protein that is essential for protein-protein interaction. This perturbs the cooperative binding of Bcd to its target sites and therefore alters the gene expression patterns. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>) The CRY2 conformational change affects the proper folding of the homeodomain, resulting in the failure of target recognition or ectopic DNA binding in the genome. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>) The change of the N-terminal CRY2 structure causes a conformational hindrance in the assembly of the transcription machinery, thus abolishing target gene expression.</p><p>Several lines of experimental evidences helped us to narrow down the possible scenarios. First, we carried out live imaging of CRY2::mCh::Bcd embryos and utilized the mCherry signal to indicate clustering events. In both dark and illuminated conditions, no obvious clusters were observed in the cytoplasm or in nuclei, even at the anterior-most region of the embryo where Bcd is present at its highest concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Author response image 1A</xref>). Neither was the Bcd gradient profile significantly altered indicating a normal diffusion rate. Second, both cuticle patterns and segmentation gene expression patterns of illuminated embryos show more severe phenotypes compared to Bcd cooperativity mutants (Lebrecht et al., 2005), although we do not rule out the fact that cooperative binding between Bcd proteins could also be interfered by light response. Third, the fact that CRY2::mCh::Bcd inhibits Caudal translation in the anterior region of illuminated embryos suggests that CRY2::mCh::Bcd in light can specifically recognize and bind to the BRE (Bcd response element) in the 3’UTR of Caudal mRNA. This indicates that the homeodomain folding remains intact under illuminated condition. Fourth, CRY2::mCh::Bcd competes with wild-type Bcd to inhibit target gene transcription in a dominant negative manner, indicating that CRY2::mCh::Bcd in light still binds to most of its native DNA binding sites. Finally, a cellularization phenotype was previously characterized in <italic>bcd</italic> mutant embryos (excessive membrane ingression in the anterior end of the embryos) although the linking factors between Bcd morphogen to the regulation of cytoskeletal components remains unclear (Blankenship and Wieschaus, 2001). We found that light also induces such cellularization phenotype in CRY2::mCh::Bcd embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Author response image 1B-D</xref>), again indicating that CRY2::mCh::Bcd in light still binds to its native target sites faithfully.<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26258.020</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Exploring the mechanism underlying optogenetic manipulation of Bcd-dependent transcription.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Live imaging of cry2::mch::bcd, <italic>bcd</italic><sup>-/-</sup> embryo in dark (left panels) and illuminated (right panels) conditions.

This renders the construct ideal for studying temporal morphogen interpretation. The difficulty here lies in specifying the molecular mechanism underlying such inhibitory effect as well as ruling out any unspecific binding effects. Roles of Bcd N-terminal domain in mediating protein interactions were elucidated previously (Fu et al., 2003; Ma et al., 1996). Here it is unclear whether it is Bcd-Bcd interaction, Bcd interaction with its co-activators and/or other general transcription cofactors that is inhibited. Perhaps future structural studies on Cryptochromes light-responsive conformational changes will help us to clarify this question.</p><p>We have included the above points in the Discussion, subsection “Mechanism underlying light-induced inhibition of Bcd transcription activity”.</p><p>3) Kinetics of light-responsive loss and recovery of transcription activity</p><p>Previously, we have used the MS2 coat protein (MCP) tagged with GFP to detect nascent transcripts driven by the <italic>hb</italic> P2 promoter. The limitation of this reporter system lies in that we cannot visualize the transcription under dark condition in CRY2::mCh::Bcd embryos as the GFP excitation wavelength (488 nm) overlaps with CRY2 light-sensitive range (405–488 nm). We have recently developed and characterized a new reporter system where the MCP is tagged with mCherry instead. The updated findings are (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>) MCP::mCh recapitulates the hb transcription dynamics observed with MCP::GFP; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>) Illumination (by LED light source) caused instantaneous and complete shutdown of hb transcription; and (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>) The transcription reinitiates 5 minutes after cessation of illumination. These results are quantitatively consistent with CRY2 light-responsive kinetics reported previously (Kennedy et al., 2010). These results are described in the fourth paragraph of the subsection “Precise temporal control of Bcd-dependent transcription via optogenetic manipulation” and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">4</xref>.</p><p>4) Precision in measurement of gene expression profiles</p><p>Gap gene profiles display extreme reproducibility in <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos given well-defined stages (Gregor et al., 2007; Houchmandzadeh et al., 2002).

As shown in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, we saw gradual posterior shift of Cad boundaries with increased bcd dosage. We quantified the Cad boundary position at which each embryo profile crosses the half maximum posterior expression value, and found that boundary positions in altered bcd dosages are significantly different (51.32 ± 4.95% EL, 45.55 ± 5.05% EL and 38.91 ± 3.66% EL for 1x, 2x and 4x bcd, respectively).</p><p>4.2) Further support for “5% anterior shift” in embryos subjected to early illumination</p><p>We have noticed that embryos illuminated before n.c.12 show a 5% anteriorly shifted Hb posterior boundary in the anterior domain as well as Kr anterior boundary, although these embryos are highly viable. A recent ChIP-seq study has shown that Bcd molecules serve a role of opening up chromatin states at a subset of its targets in early stages to gain accessibility for transcription (Hannon et al., 2017). Our data suggests that early Bcd-dependent transcription events may have a chromosomal remodeling effect for the target sites to interpret a normal Bcd concentration in later stages. If embryos are deprived of its early Bcd-dependent transcription, target sites ‘see’ a lower Bcd gradient due to the compromised chromatin accessibility. To further support this observation, we have quantified the position of the cephalic furrow which shifts its position along the AP axis with altered bcd dosage. In consistency with our postulate, we observed a significant anterior shift of cephalic furrow position in embryos illumination before n.c.12 compared to dark condition (64.4 ± 1.5% EL in dark and 70.4 ± 1.3% EL in illuminated embryos; new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref> and subsection “Temporal dissection of Bcd target gene expression”, second paragraph).</p><p>5) Incorporating current findings with previous studies on Bcd-dependent patterning</p><p>5.1) Reconciling temporal Bcd interpretation with previous quantitative work</p><p>Studies from Gregor’s lab have been focusing on using information theory to understand the precision and reproducibility in Bcd-mediated embryonic patterning. Among many important findings, the most relevant to the current study are (1) While early target gene boundaries are set by the absolute Bcd concentration, the cross-regulatory gap gene network kicks in later to adjust the boundary positions and therefore Bcd is <italic>no longer relevant</italic> for patterning precision (Liu et al., 2013); (2) The embryonic patterning operates in a precisionist mode in that the information carried by gap genes at one defined time point is not only sufficient but also fully utilized by cells for <italic>decoding positional information</italic>, as probed by pair-rule genes (Dubuis et al., 2013; Petkova et al., 2016).</p><p>Our findings do not dispute the important role of the gap gene network in refining segmentation boundaries. In fact, embryos subjected to short period of illumination in late n.c.14 show only slight gap gene boundary shifts as a result of self-organized gap gene cross-regulation. However, we argue against the claim that Bcd in late n.c. 14 becomes irrelevant for patterning for the reason that, as we have shown, Bcd-dependent transcription is indispensable at this time for sustaining the proper expression level of gap genes, especially the most anteriorly expressed ones (which are not considered in Liu et al., 2013). The proper expression level of the anterior gap genes is in turn essential for precise anterior-most cell fate commitment.</p><p>Our results are in agreement with a potentially optimized information flow from gap genes to downstream pair-rule gene patterns. We anticipate that the gap gene expression patterns under different illumination conditions can predict the pair-rule gene patterns using the same decoding algorithms as established by Petkova et al., 2016. However, what is not yet considered in these studies is the information flow from a snapshot patterning to the actual embryonic cell fate – just like Bcd, all the gap genes as well as pair-rule genes are transcription factors of which the duration of activity matters to cell fate determination. We have shown that indeed cell fates are determined not only by segmentation gene expression at a given time, but also its integration over time.</p><p>5.2) Insights from phenotypic resemblance between hypomorphic bcd alleles and short temporal perturbations</p><p>Three anterior embryonic regions with different sensitivity to bcd<sup>+</sup> reduction can be distinguished, that is, the preantennal head region, the antennal and gnathocephalic head segments, and the thorax. While the weakest <italic>bcd</italic> alleles only affect the first region, defects sequentially extend to the second and third regions with increased allelic strength (Frohnhofer and Nusslein-Volhard, 1987). Interestingly, the same distinction can be made by our temporally perturbed Bcd activity, with prolonged transcriptional inhibition giving rise to defects in sequentially extended regions.</p><p>The molecular properties of these hypomorphic <italic>bcd</italic> alleles affect either the DNA binding affinity (e.g. <italic>bcd</italic><sup>E3</sup>, point mutation in homeodomain) or the activation potency (e.g. <italic>bcd</italic><sup>2-13</sup>, partial deletion of the C-terminal activation domain) of the Bcd protein. The resemblance between hypomorphic <italic>bcd</italic> alleles and short temporal perturbations demonstrates that, constitutively low bcd activity is functionally equivalent to normal bcd activity with reduced active duration, both of which are sufficient to guide proper cell differentiation trajectories in the mid region of the embryo where target gene binding affinities are high. In comparison, in the more anterior region where target genes have low affinities, both wild-type level bcd activity and long duration are necessary for anterior induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Author response image 3</xref>). It is noteworthy that duplicated posterior structures only appear in strong allelic mutants but not in embryos subjected to long illumination due to a normal Caudal gradient in our experimental condition. It would be interesting to understand whether hypomorphic <italic>bcd</italic> alleles can suppress Caudal translation.</p><p>We have included within the Discussion a more detailed comparison between our optogenetic perturbations and the previously reported different <italic>bcd</italic> alleles (subsection “Phenotypic resemblance between hypomorphic bcd alleles and short temporal perturbations”).<fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26258.022</object-id><label>Author response image 3.</label><caption><title>Embryonic regions distinguished by different sensitivity of Bcd activity and duration.</title><p>Red, orange and blue segments represent distinct embryonic regions requiring Bcd activation potency at WT, intermediate hypomorphic and weak hypomorphic level for proper differentiation, respectively.

It would thus seem difficult to find new important details that have been missed by these studies that went deep into molecular mechanisms and models of gene regulation. Yet, this paper appears to provide just that: not a huge amount of conceptual novelty, but a powerful way to manipulate temporal parameters of the gradient using a very clever method to render (some of) the activity of the protein light dependent.</italic> </p><p><italic>The authors achieved this by fusing the Bicoid protein in the context of its own rescue construct to a light sensitive moiety. Interestingly, this appears to only affect the transcriptional activity of the protein and not its DNA binding or its RNA regulatory capacity: the activation domain might be more sensitive, which is surprising but the data show a full rescue without light and no rescue with light. This allowed the authors to stop activation by Bicoid at various times during development. They conclude that the temporal pattern of Bcd activation is important, which appears to be in slight contradiction with the work of Thomas Gregor who also quantified very carefully the effect of Bicoid but could not manipulate it so precisely. It appears that genes that require higher Bcd concentration require Bcd for longer duration, while exposed to low Bcd (whose targets have high affinity Bicoid binding sites) can be specified with short early exposure.</italic> </p><p>Please see section 5.1above, where we discuss our results in relation to other labs, particularly those of Thomas Gregor.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p><italic>[…] The authors characterize the CRY2::mCh::Bcd in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and 2.

Given the authors' expertise and the availability of dynamical models of the Gap gene system (from Reinitz, Jaeger and others) it seems a missed opportunity not to test whether in silico simulations using the existing models (interrupting Bcd activity during defined time windows) recapitulates the experimental results. Although developing an entirely new mathematical model might be beyond the scope of the current study, testing whether the data fit existing models would indicate whether new models (or new parameters for existing models) will be necessary.</italic> </p><p>We agree that testing our results against current models of gap gene systems is beneficial.

Their general conclusion is that cell fates dependent on higher Bcd concentration require the Bcd input for a longer duration of time. The concepts are interesting and most of the experiments are well controlled. The findings reported here are useful to the field. There are a few aspects that can be improved.</italic> </p><p><italic>While the observed effects of light exposure on embryonic development and gene expression are convincing, the underlying mechanisms remain relatively unclear. This is because precisely how the CRY2::mCh::Bcd fusion protein becomes inactivated at the molecular or biochemical level has not been established. The authors describe experiments suggesting that neither the ability of Bcd in translation inhibition (monitored by Cad protein gradient profile) nor its DNA binding (monitored by ChIP) was affected. It is possible that, as suggested by the authors, the N-terminal fusion of CYR2 to Bcd may cause a light-induced conformational change that inhibits the transcriptional activity of Bcd (since its N-terminus does contain a regulatory motif modulating its transcription activity). But I am not fully convinced that the ChIP approach can sensitively and unambiguously rule out an effect on DNA binding. The fact that the expression domains of hb and Kr exhibit an anterior shift (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) is consistent with a potential effect on Bcd DNA binding (or Bcd gradient profile might also be altered – <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1O</xref>). While the distinction between DNA binding and transcriptional activation is crucial to understanding Bcd action as a transcription factor and several reports have recently described perturbations specifically altering the activation potency of Bcd, I believe the current manuscript can be written in a way that sidesteps this issue; but if the authors prefer to discuss it, they may need to provide a more detailed Discussion. Interestingly altering the activating potency of Bcd is known to cause changes in the shutdown timing of hb transcription and the hb expression level at nc14 in a specific manner. Whether and, if so, how these results are related to the current findings (particularly with regard to the persistence of transcription at nc13) should be discussed to give the reader a more comprehensive update of the current knowledge.</italic> </p><p>We agree that ChIP-qPCR experiment does not have the resolution to rule out any unspecific DNA binding caused by CRY2 conformational change. However, several experimental observations support that light-induced conformational change does not alter DNA binding of CRY2::mCh::Bcd molecules. We provide a detailed discussion of possible mechanisms and evidence for each one in section 2above. We have also extended the Discussion (subsection “Mechanism underlying light-induced inhibition of Bcd transcription activity”) to outline the mechanism underlying Bcd-dependent transcriptional inhibition in our experiments.</p><p>Moreover, embryos illuminated before n.c. 12 should have wild-type Bcd activity present during n.c. 13-14; however, we still observed anterior shifts of Hb and Kr in these embryos. Since we have confirmed that the Bcd profile is not altered by illumination, we attribute the anterior shifts to the pre-patterning role of Bcd in early stages (see above section 4.2).</p><p>Lastly, while local illumination by confocal microscopy results in a reduced persistence of transcription in n.c. 13, a thorough illumination by LED source can immediately and completely abolish transcription in n.c. 13 (as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>).</p><p><italic>It is generally acknowledged that weaker bcd alleles tend to affect preferentially the formation of the most anterior structures, suggesting that such structures are more sensitive to perturbations of the Bcd input. It would be useful to discuss how this study may (or may not) provide mechanistic insights into those earlier findings.</italic> </p><p>We discuss these points in detail above in section 5.2.
