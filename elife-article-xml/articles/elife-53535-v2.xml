amplification and divergence. Previous experimental studies have followed the evolutionary trajectory of an amplified gene, but have not considered mutations elsewhere in the genome when fitness is limited by an evolving gene. We have evolved a strain of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> in which a secondary promiscuous activity has been recruited to serve an essential function. The gene encoding the ‘weak-link’ enzyme amplified in all eight populations, but mutations improving the newly needed activity occurred in only one. Most adaptive mutations occurred elsewhere in the genome. Some mutations increase expression of the enzyme upstream of the weak-link enzyme, pushing material through the dysfunctional metabolic pathway. Others enhance production of a co-substrate for a downstream enzyme, thereby pulling material through the pathway. Most of these latter mutations are detrimental in wild-type <italic>E. coli,</italic> and thus would require reversion or compensation once a sufficient new activity has evolved.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>promiscuity</kwd><kwd>amplification and divergence</kwd><kwd>ProA</kwd><kwd>evolution</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000104</institution-id><institution>National Aeronautics and Space Administration</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NNA15BB04A</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cooper</surname><given-names>Vaughn S</given-names></name><name><surname>Copley</surname><given-names>Shelley D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000005</institution-id><institution>Department of Defense</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>13-34-RTA-FP-007</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Old</surname><given-names>William M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007493</institution-id><institution>University of Colorado Boulder</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Libraries Open Access Fund</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Copley</surname><given-names>Shelley D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000185</institution-id><institution>Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>13-34-RTA-FP-007</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Old</surname><given-names>William M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Mutations elsewhere in the genome play critical roles in improving fitness during amplification and divergence of a gene encoding a weak-link enzyme whose inefficiency limits growth rate.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The expansion of huge superfamilies of enzymes, transcriptional regulators, transporters, and signaling molecules from single ancestral genes has been a dominant process in the evolution of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bergthorsson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chothia et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Glasner et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hughes, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Ohno, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Todd et al., 2001</xref>).

A newly useful enzymatic activity is often inefficient, making the enzyme the ‘weak-link’ in metabolism. Gene duplication/amplification provides a ready mechanism to improve fitness by increasing the abundance of a weak-link enzyme. If mutations lead to an enzyme capable of efficiently carrying out the newly needed function, selective pressure to maintain a high copy number will be removed, allowing extra copies to be lost and leaving behind two paralogs (or just one gene encoding a new enzyme if the original function is no longer needed).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The Innovation-Amplification-Divergence (IAD) model of gene evolution.</title><p>A promiscuous activity B of an enzyme may become physiologically relevant due to a mutation or environmental change.

Although the signatures of gene duplication and divergence are obvious in extant genomes, we have little information about the genome contexts and environments in which new enzymes arose. Laboratory evolution offers the possibility of tracking this process in real time. In a landmark study, Näsvall et al. used laboratory evolution to demonstrate that a gene encoding an enzyme with two inefficient activities required for synthesis of histidine and tryptophan amplified and diverged to alleles encoding two specialists within 2000 generations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Näsvall et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Newton et al., 2017</xref>). However, this study followed only mutations in the diverging gene. When an organism is exposed to a novel selection pressure that requires evolution of a new enzyme, any mutation – either in the gene encoding the weak-link enzyme or elsewhere in the genome – that improves fitness will provide a selective advantage.</p><p>We have explored the relative importance of mutations in a gene encoding a weak-link enzyme and elsewhere in the genome using a model system in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>. ProA (γ-glutamyl phosphate reductase, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) is essential for proline synthesis in <italic>E. coli</italic>. ArgC (<italic>N</italic>-acetylglutamyl phosphate reductase) catalyzes a similar reaction in the arginine synthesis pathway, although the two enzymes are not homologous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Goto et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ludovice et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Page et al., 2003</xref>). ProA can reduce <italic>N</italic>-acetylglutamyl phosphate (NAGP), but its activity is too inefficient to support growth of a <italic>∆argC</italic> strain of <italic>E. coli</italic> in glucose. However, a point mutation that changes Glu383 to Ala allows slow growth of the <italic>∆argC</italic> strain in glucose. Enzymatic assays show that E383A ProA (ProA*) has severely reduced activity with γ-glutamyl semialdehyde (GSA), but substantially improved activity with <italic>N</italic>-acetylglutamyl semialdehyde (NAGSA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Khanal et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">McLoughlin and Copley, 2008</xref>). (It is necessary to assay kinetic parameters in the reverse direction because the substrates for the forward reaction are too unstable to prepare and purify.) Glu383 is in the active site of the enzyme; the change to Ala may create extra room to accommodate the larger substrate for ArgC, but at a cost to the ability to bind and orient the native substrate. The poor efficiency of the weak-link ProA* creates strong selective pressure for improvement of both proline and arginine synthesis during growth of <italic>∆argC E. coli</italic> on glucose as a sole carbon source.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>E383A ProA (ProA*) replaces ArgC in the arginine synthesis pathway in ∆<italic>argC proA* E. coli</italic>, but is the bottleneck in the pathway due to its poor catalytic activity.</title><p>The reaction normally catalyzed by ArgC and replaced by ProA* in the parental strain is indicated by the red dotted line.

Our expectation that amplification of <italic>proA*</italic> would be beneficial was borne out in all populations. Whole-genome sequencing of the adapted populations and further biochemical analysis showed that an adaptive mutation in <italic>proA*</italic> followed by deamplification of <italic>proA*</italic> occurred in only one population. Indeed, most of the adaptive mutations occurred outside of <italic>proA*</italic>. We have identified the mechanisms by which three common classes of such mutations increase fitness: (1) restoration of a known defect in pyrimidine synthesis; (2) an increase in the amount of ArgB, the enzyme that synthesizes NAGP, the substrate for the weak-link ProA*; and (3) an increase in flux through carbamoyl phosphate synthetase, whose product feeds into the arginine synthesis pathway downstream of the weak-link enzyme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). The latter two types of mutations appear to increase flux through the bottlenecked arginine synthesis pathway while the more difficult process of improving the weak-link enzyme progresses. In the case of the mutations affecting carbamoyl phosphate synthetase, the fitness increase comes at a cost to presumably well-evolved regulatory functions.</p><p>Our results demonstrate that mutations elsewhere in the genome play an important role during the process of gene amplification and divergence when the inefficient activity of a weak-link enzyme limits fitness. Thus, the process of evolution of a new enzyme by gene duplication and divergence is inextricably intertwined with mutations elsewhere in the genome that improve fitness by different mechanisms.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Growth rate of <italic>∆argC proA* E. coli</italic> increased 3-fold within a few hundred generations of evolution in M9/glucose/proline</title><p>We generated a progenitor strain for laboratory evolution by replacing <italic>argC</italic> with the <italic>kan<sup>r</sup></italic> antibiotic resistance gene, modifying <italic>proA</italic> to encode ProA*, and introducing a mutation in the −10 region of the promoter of the <italic>proBA</italic> operon.

We used a turbidostat rather than a serial transfer protocol because turbidostats can maintain cultures in exponential phase and thereby avoid selection for mutations that simply decrease lag phase or improve survival in stationary phase.

The mutations increased growth rate by 36–61% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Levels of mRNAs for <italic>argB</italic> and <italic>argH</italic>, which is immediately downstream of <italic>argB</italic>, were little affected by the mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). However, levels of ArgB protein increased 2.6–8.2-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). In contrast, ArgH levels increased only modestly. These data suggest that the mutations upstream of <italic>argB</italic> increase translational efficiency of <italic>argB</italic> mRNA. An increase in the amount of ArgB will increase production of NAGP, the substrate for the weak-link enzyme ProA* (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p>While increasing the level of <italic>argB</italic> is clearly beneficial in AM187, it is possible that replacing <italic>argC</italic> with the <italic>kan<sup>r</sup></italic> cassette might have altered expression of the downstream <italic>argB</italic>, artificially creating a situation in which ArgB activity is insufficient. Expression of <italic>argB</italic> and <italic>argH</italic> in AM187 is controlled by both their native promoter and a constitutive <italic>kan<sup>r</sup></italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), possibly increasing transcription of the operon. Additionally, the different sequence of the intergenic region upstream of <italic>argB</italic> might influence translation of the <italic>argB</italic> mRNA. To determine the net effect of these two influences, we compared the levels of ArgB and ArgH in AM187 and a comparable strain (AM407) that lacks ArgC due to introduction of two stop codons in <italic>argC</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). The level of ArgH is 64% higher in AM187, probably due to increased transcription of the operon. In contrast, the level of ArgB is 2.3-fold lower, suggesting that the altered structure upstream of <italic>argB</italic> mRNA diminishes translation. Despite these changes, the growth rates of AM187 and AM407 are identical (µ = 0.27 ± 0.01 h<sup>−1</sup>).</p><p>We further investigated the effect of altering ArgB levels on the growth rate of AM187 by expressing ArgB from a low-copy plasmid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Growth rate of AM187 improves substantially when ArgB levels are increased by 25-fold, demonstrating that the beneficial effect of the mutations we observed in the evolved strains is not simply due to compensation for the 2.3-fold decrease in ArgB caused by replacement of <italic>argC</italic> with <italic>kan<sup>r</sup></italic>.</p><p>The increased translation efficiency of <italic>argB</italic> in the mutant strains might be due to decreased secondary structure around the Shine-Dalgarno site and start codon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bentele et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Espah Borujeni et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Goodman et al., 2013</xref>). The <italic>argB</italic> mRNA, like 16% of γ-proteobacterial mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Scharff et al., 2011</xref>), lacks a canonical Shine-Dalgarno sequence, but the ribosome is expected to bind to a region encompassing the start codon and at least the upstream 8–10 nucleotides. We calculated the minimum free energy secondary structures of 140-nt RNA sequences encompassing the upstream intergenic region affected by the various mutations through 33 bp downstream of the <italic>argB</italic> start codon using CLC Main Workbench (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). Note that, although <italic>argC</italic> was replaced by <italic>kan<sup>r</sup></italic> in the Keio strain used to construct AM187, the last 21 bp of <italic>argC</italic> and the 7 bp intergenic region between <italic>argC</italic> and <italic>argB</italic> are preserved. The FLP recognition target site downstream of <italic>kan<sup>r</sup></italic> (used to remove the <italic>kan<sup>r</sup></italic> cassette in the Keio strains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Baba et al., 2006</xref>]) forms a large stem-loop structure upstream of <italic>argB</italic>. However, this structure does not impact the region surrounding the putative <italic>argB</italic> ribosome binding site. The ribosome binding site is mostly sequestered in two stem-loops in the AM187 sequence. Four of the five point mutations occur in this region. The 58 bp and 51 bp deletions extend into this region, and the 38 bp duplication begins 13 bp upstream of the <italic>argB</italic> start codon within this region. For five of the eight mutant structures, the probability that the 5’-UTR upstream of the start codon is sequestered in the lowest free-energy structure is decreased relative to the parental sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>); the increased accessibility of this region should increase translation efficiency. However, for three mutants (−94 A→G, −22 C→A, and −18 C→A), this region is equally or more likely to be sequestered in a stem-loop. The thermodynamic stability of this region is clearly not the only factor responsible for the effects of the mutations upstream of <italic>argB.</italic></p><p>We also considered the possibility that mutations upstream of <italic>argB</italic> might increase expression by increasing ribosome drafting (binding of a ribosome to the unfolded mRNA emerging behind a preceding ribosome before the mRNA folds and obscures the Shine-Dalgarno sequence) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Espah Borujeni and Salis, 2016</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref> shows the predicted folding times of 63 nt RNA sequences centered around the start codon for each mutant except the −94 A→G mutant. (The point mutation at −94 relative to the start codon is outside of the window used for the calculation.) The significantly slower folding of three of the mutant RNAs (51 bp deletion, −24 C→G, and −18 C→A) should increase translation efficiency. For two of the mutants for which folding rate is either the same (the 58 bp deletion) or increased (the 38 bp duplication), the secondary structure prediction shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref> suggests that the ribosome binding site is less likely to be sequestered in a hairpin. Thus, the effects of 6 of the eight mutations can be explained by a decrease in secondary structure stability around the ribosome binding site, a decrease in the folding rate of the mRNA in this region, or both. The effects of the −94 A→G and −22 C→A mutations, however, cannot be explained by either mechanism.</p><p>A final possibility is that translation efficiency could be increased if a mutation weakens an sRNA:mRNA interaction that blocks the ribosome binding site. There is no known physiological interaction between an sRNA and the <italic>argB</italic> mRNA, so this explanation is unlikely. Alternatively, a mutation might strengthen a sRNA:mRNA interaction that competes with a mRNA secondary structure that inhibits ribosome binding, thereby increasing the accessibility of the ribosome binding site. We explored the effects of the mutations upstream of <italic>argB</italic> on the predicted binding energies of 65 annotated sRNAs to the RNA sequences used for the secondary structure predictions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4</xref>) using the IntaRNA algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Busch et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mann et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Raden et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Wright et al., 2014</xref>). The calculated binding energy sums the energy needed to denature sRNA and mRNA secondary structures and the hybridization energy of the unfolded sRNA and mRNA. None of the 65 sRNAs had a calculated binding energy for the parental <italic>argB</italic> region in the range of those for known physiological interactions between sRNAs and target mRNAs (e.g. −16.1 kcal/mol, ChiX and <italic>dpiB</italic>; −13.0 kcal/mol, OmrA and <italic>csgD</italic>; −14.9 kcal/mol, DsrA and <italic>rpoS</italic>), −14.3 kcal/mol, RprA and <italic>rpoS</italic>), with the strongest binding energy being −7.4 kcal/mol. Mutations decreased the predicted binding energy to &lt;-11 kcal/mol for only one sRNA, RyfA, and only for the 58 bp deletion, 38 bp duplication and −94 A→G point mutation. Binding of RyfA was predicted to increase in a region that is not involved in the secondary structure around the ribosome binding site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4B</xref>). Thus, differences in binding to sRNAs are unlikely to be responsible for the changes in translation efficiency.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Mutations in <italic>carB</italic> either increase activity or impact allosteric regulation</title><p>We found eight different mutations in <italic>carB</italic> in six of the evolved populations: four missense mutations, three deletions (≥12 bp), and one 21 bp duplication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>).

Regulation of the K966E variant, the enzyme for which <italic>k<sub>cat</sub>/K<sub>m,ATP</sub></italic> was nearly doubled, was minimally affected. Five of the variants showed complete loss of allosteric regulation. The variant with the 21 bp duplication retained modest inhibition by UMP, but only at very high concentrations of UMP; the apparent <italic>K<sub>d,UMP</sub></italic> was increased by 740-fold. Similarly, G369V CPS retained partial inhibition by UMP. While the apparent <italic>K<sub>d,UMP</sub></italic> of the G369V enzyme only doubled, this variant showed a 3.5-fold increase in activation at high ornithine concentrations.</p><p>The eight <italic>carB</italic> mutations result in increased CPS activity via three different mechanisms: (1) increased catalytic turnover (K966E); (2) increased activation by ornithine (G369V); and (3) decreased inhibition by UMP (L960P, L964Q, ∆12 bp at nt 2906, ∆132 bp at nt 2986, ∆12 bp at nt 3108, and 21 bp duplication at nt 3130). In vivo, the increased CPS activity would be expected to increase the level of carbamoyl phosphate, and thereby increase the rate at which ornithine transcarbamoylase produces citrulline from carbamoyl phosphate and ornithine downstream of the ProA* bottleneck in the arginine synthesis pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p>We introduced four of the <italic>carB</italic> mutations into the parental strain AM187 to confirm that they were beneficial. Three of the mutations (K966E, ∆12 bp at nt 2906, and ∆132 bp at nt 2986) increased growth rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). The two mutations that caused loss of UMP inhibition (∆12 bp at nt 2906 and ∆132 bp at nt 2986) showed the greatest increase in growth rate (47–54%). The mutation that increased CPS catalytic activity (K966E) increased growth rate by 26%.</p><p>The G369V mutation does not improve growth rate of AM187, which is not surprising because its major effect is to increase ornithine activation at high ornithine concentrations. In AM187, the ornithine concentration is likely to be low due to the bottleneck in the arginine synthesis pathway caused by ProA*. Thus, increasing ornithine activation of CPS would have little effect. We suspect that this mutation may only be beneficial after gene amplification increases ProA* levels.</p><p>We also considered the possibility that the <italic>carB</italic> mutations are beneficial because they boost production of carbamoyl phosphate for pyrimidine synthesis. <italic>E. coli</italic> K strains are known to have a pyrimidine synthesis deficiency due to a mutation in <italic>rph</italic> that impacts transcription of the downstream <italic>pyrE</italic>. The <italic>rph-pyrE</italic> mutation that occurred first in all populations is known to correct the pyrimidine synthesis deficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Blank et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Bonekamp et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Conrad et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Jensen, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Knöppel et al., 2018</xref>). However, pyrimidine synthesis might still be compromised in our evolving strains because levels of ornithine, the most important allosteric activator of CPS, are low due to the inefficiency of ProA*. To determine whether the growth defect of the AM187 strain with the ∆82 bp <italic>rph-pyrE</italic> mutation is due to limited synthesis of pyrimidines, arginine, or both, we tested the effect of adding uracil, arginine, or both on growth of the parental AM187 strain and AM327 (the AM187 strain with the ∆82 bp <italic>rph-pyrE</italic> mutation) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>). AM327 grows 60% faster than AM187, presumably due to improved pyrimidine synthesis. Adding uracil to the medium increased the growth rate of AM187, but did not affect the growth rate of AM327, suggesting that pyrimidine synthesis is no longer insufficient after acquisition of the ∆82 bp <italic>rph-pyrE</italic> mutation. In contrast, adding arginine restored growth of both strains to wild-type levels. These results suggest that at the time the <italic>carB</italic> mutations occurred, they improved arginine synthesis rather than pyrimidine synthesis.</p><p>Mutations that impact the elaborate allosteric regulation of CarB would be expected to be detrimental after arginine synthesis is restored. To test this hypothesis, we introduced four of the <italic>carB</italic> mutations into the genome of AM441, a wild-type strain into which the <italic>rph-pyrE</italic> mutation had been introduced, and measured their effects on fitness using a competitive fitness assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>). The two deletion mutations that abolished allosteric regulation (Δ12 bp at nt 2906 and Δ132 bp at nt 2986) significantly decreased growth rate. The K966E mutation, which increases k<sub>cat</sub>/K<sub>M,ATP</sub> by 64% but shifts the balance between the regulatory effects of UMP and ornithine by modestly increasing UMP inhibition and decreasing ornithine activation, also slightly decreases growth rate. The G369V mutation, which diminishes inhibition by UMP but substantially increases activation by ornithine, actually increased growth rate, suggesting that the balance between the regulatory effects of UMP and ornithine in the wild-type CarB may not be optimal after the <italic>rph-pyrE</italic> mutation improves pyrimidine synthesis. These results suggest that many of the <italic>carB</italic> mutations provide a fitness improvement when arginine synthesis is compromised, but will be detrimental once an efficient neo-ArgC has emerged.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Recruitment of promiscuous enzymes to serve new functions followed by mutations that improve the promiscuous activity has been a dominant force in the diversification of metabolic networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Copley, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Glasner et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Khersonsky and Tawfik, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">O'Brien and Herschlag, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Rauwerdink et al., 2016</xref>). New enzymes may be important for fitness or even survival when an organism is exposed to a novel toxin or source of carbon or energy, or when synthesis of a novel natural product enables manipulation of competing organisms or the environment. This process also contributes to non-orthologous gene replacement, which can occur when a gene is lost during a time in which it is not required, but its function later becomes important again and is replaced by recruitment of a non-orthologous promiscuous enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Albalat and Cañestro, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ferla et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Juárez-Vázquez et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Newton et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Olson, 1999</xref>).</p><p>We have modeled a situation in which a new enzyme is required by deleting <italic>argC</italic>, which is essential for synthesis of arginine in <italic>E. coli</italic>. Previous work showed that a promiscuous activity of ProA is the most readily available source of neo-ArgC activity that enables <italic>∆argC E. coli</italic> to grow on glucose as a sole carbon source. However, a point mutation that changes Glu383 to Ala is required to elevate the promiscuous activity to a physiologically useful level. This mutation substantially damages the native function of the enzyme, creating an inefficient bifunctional enzyme whose poor catalytic abilities limit growth rate on glucose. It is important to note that the decrease in the efficiency of the native reaction may be a critical factor in the recruitment of ProA because it will diminish inhibition of the newly important reaction by the native substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Khanal et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">McLoughlin and Copley, 2008</xref>).</p><p>We chose to carry out evolution of a <italic>∆argC proA*</italic> strain with a previously identified promoter mutation upstream of <italic>proA*</italic> in glucose in the presence of proline to specifically address the evolution of an efficient neo-ArgC. After 470–1000 generations of evolution, growth rate was increased by ~3 fold in all eight replicate cultures. We have focused on five types of genetic changes that clearly increase fitness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>): (1) mutations upstream of <italic>pyrE</italic>; (2) amplification of a variable region of the genome surrounding the <italic>proBA*</italic> operon; (3) a mutation in <italic>proA*</italic> that changes Phe372 to Leu; (4) mutations upstream of <italic>argB</italic>; and (5) mutations in <italic>carB</italic>. (Each of the final populations contains additional mutations that may also contribute to fitness, but these mutations were typically found in low abundance and/or in only one population.) The mutations upstream of <italic>pyrE</italic> occurred first (within 100 generations) and have previously been shown to be a general adaptation of <italic>E. coli</italic> BW25113 to growth in minimal medium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Blank et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Conrad et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Jensen, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Knöppel et al., 2018</xref>). The other four types of mutations are specific adaptations to the bottleneck in arginine synthesis caused by substitution of the weak-link enzyme ProA* for ArgC in this strain. Interestingly, only two of these—gene amplification and the mutation in <italic>proA*</italic>—directly involve the weak-link enzyme ProA*.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Adaptive mutations are predicted to increase flux through the arginine synthesis pathway.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The pathway bottleneck enzyme ProA* is shown in red.

In this population, <italic>proA</italic> copy number dropped from ~7 to ~3 within 100 generations. This pattern is consistent with the IAD model; copy number is expected to decrease as mutations increase the efficiency of the weak-link activity. However, the fact that copy number did not return to one implies that the neo-ArgC activity of ProA** is not sufficient to justify a single copy of the gene.</p><p>Because ~3 copies of <italic>proA**</italic> remained in the population and the progenitor <italic>proA*</italic> was not detectable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), all copies in the amplified array have clearly acquired the mutation that changes Phe372 to Leu – that is, the more beneficial <italic>proA**</italic> allele has ‘swept’ the amplified array. This observation has important implications for the IAD model. In the original conception of the IAD model, it was proposed that amplification of a gene increases the opportunity for different beneficial mutations to occur in different copies, and then for recombination to shuffle these mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bergthorsson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Francino, 2005</xref>). These phenomena would increase the rate at which sequence space can be searched and thereby the rate at which a new enzyme evolves. In order for this to occur, however, it would be necessary for individual alleles to acquire different beneficial mutations before recombination occurred. This scenario is inconsistent with the relative frequencies of point mutations and recombination between large homologous regions in an amplified array (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Anderson and Roth, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Reams et al., 2010</xref>). Point mutations occur at a frequency between 10<sup>−9</sup> and 10<sup>−10</sup> per nucleotide per cell division depending on the genomic location (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Jee et al., 2016</xref>), and thus between 10<sup>−6</sup> and 10<sup>−7</sup> per gene per cell division for a gene the size of <italic>proA</italic>. If 10 copies of an evolving gene were present, then the frequency of mutation in a single allele would be between 10<sup>−5</sup> and 10<sup>−6</sup> per cell division. Homologous recombination after an initial duplication event is orders of magnitude more frequent, occurring in ~1 of every 100 cell divisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Reams et al., 2010</xref>). Thus, homologous recombination between replicating chromosomes in a cell could result in a selective allelic sweep (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>) long before a second beneficial mutation occurs in a different allele in the amplified array. This is indeed the result that we observed; heterozygosity among <italic>proA*</italic> alleles was lost within 500 generations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). More recent papers depict selective amplification of beneficial alleles before acquisition of additional mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Andersson et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Näsvall et al., 2012</xref>); our results support this revision of the original IAD model. It is possible that alleles encoding enzymes that are diverging toward two specialists might recombine to explore combinations of mutations. However, such recombination might not accelerate evolution of a new enzyme, as mutations that lead toward one specialist enzyme would likely be incompatible with those that lead toward the other specialist enzyme.</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Homologous recombination of an amplified <italic>proA*</italic> array with one <italic>proA**</italic> allele can rapidly lead to a daughter cell with only <italic>proA**</italic> alleles.</title><p>Each arrow represents one homologous replication event.

We identified two primary mechanisms that apparently improve arginine synthesis without affecting the efficiency of the weak-link enzyme ProA* itself.</p><p>We identified eight mutations upstream of <italic>argB</italic>; the six we tested improved growth rate by 36–61% and increased the abundance of ArgB by 2.6–8.2-fold. Notably, ArgB levels were increased even though the levels of <italic>argB</italic> mRNA were unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). The increase in protein levels without a concomitant increase in mRNA levels suggests that these mutations impact the efficiency of translation. Secondary structure around the translation initiation site plays a key role because this region must be unfolded in order to bind to the small subunit of the ribosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hall et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Scharff et al., 2011</xref>). Indeed, a study of the predicted secondary structures of 5000 genes from bacteria, mitochondria and plastids, many of which lack canonical Shine-Dalgarno sequences (as does <italic>argB</italic>), showed that secondary structure around the start codon is markedly less stable than up- or down-stream regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bentele et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Espah Borujeni et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Goodman et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Scharff et al., 2011</xref>). Our computational studies of the effect of mutations on the predicted lowest free energy secondary structures of the region surrounding the start codon of <italic>argB</italic> suggest that the thermodynamic stability of this region plays a role in the beneficial effects of most of the observed mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). In addition, three of the mutations slow the predicted rate of mRNA folding around the start codon, which would increase the probability of ribosomal drafting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>). Both effects would lead to an increase in ArgB abundance, which should increase the concentration of the substrate for the weak-link ProA*, thereby pushing material through this bottleneck in the arginine synthesis pathway.</p><p>The adaptive mutations in <italic>carB</italic> increase catalytic turnover, decrease inhibition by UMP, or increase activation by ornithine of CPS. All of these effects should increase the level of CPS activity in the cell and consequently the level of carbamoyl phosphate. Why would this be advantageous? Ornithine transcarbamoylase catalyzes formation of citrulline from carbamoyl phosphate and ornithine, which will be in short supply due to the upstream ProA* bottleneck (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Legrain and Stalon, 1976</xref>). If ornithine transcarbamoylase is not saturated with respect to carbamoyl phosphate, then increasing carbamoyl phosphate levels should increase citrulline production and thereby increase flux into the lower part of the arginine synthesis pathway. Although we do not know the concentration of carbamoyl phosphate in vivo, and thus cannot determine whether ornithine transcarbamoylase is saturated (the <italic>K<sub>M</sub></italic> for carbamoyl phosphate is 360 µM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Baur et al., 1990</xref>), the occurrence of so many mutations that increase CPS activity and growth rate supports the notion that they lead to an increase in carbamoyl phosphate that potentiates flux through the arginine synthesis pathway.</p><p>The majority of adaptive mutations we observed in <italic>carB</italic> cause loss of the exquisite allosteric regulation that controls flux through this important step in pyrimidine and arginine synthesis. This tight regulation likely evolved due to the energetically costly reaction catalyzed by CPS, which consumes two ATP molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). While a constitutively active CPS is beneficial in the short term to improve arginine synthesis, it is detrimental once arginine production no longer limits growth. When we introduced four of the <italic>carB</italic> mutations into the genome of strain AM441 (wild-type <italic>E. coli</italic> containing the <italic>rph-pyrE</italic> mutation), three of the four mutations (K966E, ∆12 bp at nt 2906, and ∆132 bp at nt 2986) decreased fitness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>). Notably, the mutations that impaired growth rate in the wild-type background were the same mutations that increased fitness in AM187. We term mutations such as these ‘expedient’ mutations because they provide a quick fix when cells are under strong selective pressure, but at a cost to a previously well-evolved function. The damage caused by expedient mutations may be repairable later by reversion, compensatory mutations or horizontal gene transfer. Interestingly, the latter two repair processes may contribute to sequence divergence between organisms that has typically been attributed to neutral drift, but rather may be due to scars left from previous selective processes.</p><p>A particularly striking conclusion from this work is that most of the mutations that improved fitness under these selective conditions did not impact the gene encoding the weak-link enzyme, but rather compensated for the bottleneck in metabolism by other mechanisms. The prevalence of adaptive mutations outside of <italic>proA*</italic> is likely a result of both a limited number of adaptive routes for improving the neo-ArgC activity of ProA* and a larger target size for other beneficial mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ilhan et al., 2019</xref>). Although the single mutation that we observed in <italic>proA</italic>* is highly beneficial, the paucity of <italic>proA*</italic> mutations suggests that only a small number of mutations at specific positions may improve the enzyme’s activity. Directed evolution experiments often show a limited number of paths for improvement of enzymatic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aharoni et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Sunden et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Weinreich et al., 2006</xref>), which reflects the stringent requirements for optimal placement of substrate-binding and catalytic residues in active sites. In contrast, there are multiple ways in which allosteric inhibition of CarB by UMP can be lost, and multiple ways in which translation efficiency of <italic>argB</italic> mRNA can be improved.</p><p>Not surprisingly, the process of evolution of a new enzyme by gene duplication and divergence does not take place in isolation, but is inextricably intertwined with mutations in the rest of the genome. The ultimate winner in a microbial population exposed to a novel selective pressure that requires evolution of a new enzyme may be the clone that succeeds in evolving an efficient enzyme while accumulating the least damaging, or at least the most easily repaired, expedient mutations.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Materials</title><p>Common chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO) and Fisher Scientific (Fair Lawn, NJ).</p><p>NAGSA was synthesized enzymatically from <italic>N</italic>-acetylornithine using <italic>N</italic>-acetylornithine aminotransferase (ArgD) in a 25 mL reaction as described previously by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Khanal et al.

Ten µL of each sample (3–6 µg protein/µL) was digested using the SP3 method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hughes et al., 2014</xref>). Carboxylate-functionalized speedbeads (GE Life Sciences) were added to the lysates. Addition of acetonitrile to 80% (v/v) caused the proteins to bind to the beads. The beads were washed twice with 70% (v/v) ethanol and once with 100% acetonitrile. Protein was digested and eluted from the beads with 15 µL of 50 mM Tris buffer, pH 8.5, with 1 µg endoproteinase Lys-C (Wako) for 2 hr with shaking at 600 rpm at 37°C in a thermomixer (Eppendorf). One µg of trypsin (Pierce) was then added to the solution and incubated at 37°C overnight with shaking at 600 rpm. Beads were collected by centrifugation and then placed on a magnet to more reliably remove the elution buffer containing the digested peptides. The peptides were then desalted using an Oasis HLB cartridge (Waters) according to the manufacturer’s instructions and dried in a speedvac.</p><p>Samples were suspended in 12 µL of 3% (v/v) acetonitrile/0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid and 0.5–1 µg of peptides were directly injected onto a C18 1.7 µm, 130 Å, 75 µm X 250 mm M-class column (Waters), using a Waters M-class UPLC. Peptides were eluted at 300 nL/minute using a gradient from 3% to 20% acetonitrile over 100 min into an Orbitrap Fusion mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific). Precursor mass spectra (MS1) were acquired at a resolution of 120,000 from 380 to 1500 m/z with an AGC target of 2.0 × 10<sup>5</sup> and a maximum injection time of 50 ms. Dynamic exclusion was set for 20 s with a mass tolerance of + /– 10 ppm. Precursor peptide ion isolation width for MS2 fragment scans was 1.6 Da using the quadrupole, and the most intense ions were sequenced using Top Speed with a 3 s cycle time. All MS2 sequencing was performed using higher energy collision dissociation (HCD) at 35% collision energy and scanning in the linear ion trap. An AGC target of 1.0 × 10<sup>4</sup> and 35 s maximum injection time was used. Rawfiles were searched against the Uniprot <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> database using Maxquant version 1.6.1.0 with cysteine carbamidomethylation as a fixed modification. Methionine oxidation and protein N-terminal acetylation were searched as variable modifications.

new genes are of broad interest. One route involves amplification (under selection) of a gene that has secondary promiscuous function followed by subsequent divergence. The idea has received experimental attention with focus on mutations leading to specialisation in each copy. Here, using a bacterial model system, Morgenthaler et al. show that mutations underpinning improvement in promiscuous function often occur in targets other than the duplicated genes. This surprising finding draws attention to a complex interplay of mutational events underpinning gene duplication and divergence.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>[Editors’ note: a previous version of this study was rejected after peer review, but the authors submitted for reconsideration. The first decision letter after peer review is shown below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Mutations that improve efficiency of a weak-link enzyme are rare compared to adaptive mutations elsewhere in the genome&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Dan Andersson (Reviewer #2).</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>All three reviewers were enthusiastic about the study and agree that it adds usefully to an important topic. However all three felt that the work was not sufficiently complete to warrant publication at this time. Should you chose to follow suggestions of the reviewers and provide additional support for your hypotheses, then a fresh submission would be welcome.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>The paper is a nice addition to the work on the evolution of new gene function via mutations that take a promiscuous enzyme and make it better. The message is that while amplifications are a starting point, and may increase opportunity for additional mutations within the amplified region, mutations that improve fitness can also arise elsewhere in the genome. This comes as no real surprise and there are many studies showing the importance of compensatory mutation in many different contexts. Nonetheless, this is not to take from the importance of tracking down the mutations in this particular context and understanding their contributions to the refinement of promiscuous function.</p><p>The bulk of the paper attempts to shed light on a handful of mutations (out of a great many) in candidate genes. The approach is largely biochemical. The findings are used to support a particular explanation, but where I feel the paper falls short is its failure to consider alternate possibilities (and to test them). Or put another way, the model presented by the authors needs experimental validation. This is particularly relevant to the <italic>carB</italic> side of the story, where at the very least the work needs to be backed by reconstruction of mutants in the ancestral background. Without this it is impossible to know whether the mutations are responsible for fitness increase and whether these depend on other mutations. And thus whether the model provided by the authors is correct. And indeed, whether explanation focussing on the arginine pathways is correct.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>Overall, I think the manuscript is interesting and the work well executed. The authors utilize a number of different experiments to support their conclusions. They also put in a considerable amount of effort to address/explain any potential discrepancies or inconsistencies in their data. However, even though the study presents some interesting conclusions, in the current manner in which the manuscript is written I think the authors undersell their work (or don't articulate its significance well) and the focus of the manuscript gets lost in the Results section.</p><p>Another aspect is whether or not, given the experimental design, these were the expected results. The initial mutations (promoter mutations and amplifications) that increase the expression of <italic>proA</italic>* and were observed in the previous study would result in reduced selection for improving the enzyme's catalytic activity. Hence selection is more likely to proceed through other targets simply because of this reduced selective pressure, and a larger target size for alternate mutations. In other words, is the observation in this study an outcome of limited adaptive routes for improving catalytic activity, or an outcome of reduced selective pressure because of how the experiment was set-up. It would be nice if the authors could bring this up either in the Introduction or in the Discussion.</p><p>1) The Abstract could benefit from more elaboration on the key findings – the authors should briefly mention the three mechanisms of adaptive mutations they find and how everything relates back to proA and ultimately ties into arginine synthesis. They should better emphasize the significance and impact of their work. The same holds true for the second-to-last paragraph in the Introduction.</p><p>2) The main focus/purpose of the paper is lost in the Results section. It would help if the authors relate their findings back to proA/arginine pathway in each subsection, instead of doing so only in the Discussion.</p><p>3) Introduction, last paragraph: Should be rephrased. The mutations are still presumably affecting the same phenotype of arginine synthesis. Hence fitness is still increasing by the same mechanism.</p><p>4) It might be useful to include a schematic for the construction of the DELargC <italic>proA*-yfp</italic> strain in a main text or supplementary figure for added clarity in the Results section where strain construction is described (subsection “Growth rate of ∆<italic>argC proA* E. coli</italic> increased 3-fold within a few hundred generations of adaptation in M9/glucose/proline”) and/or in the corresponding Materials and methods section.</p><p>5) The &quot;Mutations outside of <italic>proA</italic>* improved fitness&quot; subsection in the Results should be renamed. The current title of this subsection is somewhat misleading, as this subsection only focuses on the media-adapted mutations that do not directly pertain to <italic>proA</italic>* and arginine synthesis. The mutations &quot;outside of <italic>proA</italic>*&quot; that are truly important for improved fitness already have their own dedicated subsections.</p><p>6) &quot;Mutations upstream of <italic>argB</italic> increase ArgB abundance&quot;: &quot;The thermodynamic stability of this region is clearly not the only factor responsible for the effects of the mutations upstream of <italic>argB</italic>.&quot; and</p><p>&quot;The effects of the -94 A➝G and -22 C➝A mutations, however, cannot be explained by either of these mechanisms.&quot; Can the authors suggest any other possible mechanisms to explain these observations?</p><p>7) &quot;Mutations in <italic>carB</italic> either increase activity or impact allosteric regulation&quot;:</p><p>As mentioned above, relating these enzyme kinetics and regulation data back to the proA/arginine synthesis pathway would improve the focus and flow of the paper.</p><p>8) &quot;Discussion&quot;: The lengthy description of the previously found <italic>proBA</italic> operon promoter mutations seems unnecessary. Maybe briefly mention the rationale behind using the M2 promoter mutation in the Results section where strain construction is described. Additionally, any explanation for why the M2 mutation was chosen over the M1 or M3 promoter mutations is currently missing in the manuscript.</p><p>9) There is a discord between the increase in fitness of the evolving populations (Figure 3) and the change in copy number of <italic>proA</italic>* (Figure 4). Essentially the authors observe an increase in fitness (2-3 fold) in the first 100 generations in all the populations, but there is no change in <italic>proA</italic>* copy number during this period. The authors should address this in the Discussion.</p><p>10) Subsection “Laboratory adaptation”, last paragraph: It would be good to report which cultures had to be restarted with this kind of a bottleneck, and whether that affected the adaptive mutations observed.</p><p>11) Subsection “Calculation of growth rate and generations during adaptation” and Equation 6: The terminologies used in the description and in the equation do not match.</p><p>12) For some of the experiments, growth rates are measured from growth curves using a plate reader, and different parameters are then calculated (subsection “Growth rate measurements”). However, it is not clear how these correspond to parameters under selection in a turbidostat, which was used for the evolution experiments. This comparison is important and should be made clear in the text and figures.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>The authors have developed a potentially very useful approach for testing the IAD model, where a promiscuous activity in a ProA mutant can complement an ArgC deletion. As expected based on previous experiments (Kershner et al., 2016) all eight populations increase the copy number of the weak-link enzyme, but in only one population a mutation in ProA is found. Instead mutations in a range of other genes are found, often repeatedly in the same genes.</p><p>The article is clearly written and methodologically sound and tests of the IAD model could be of interest for a wide audience. However I do not fully agree with the interpretation of some experiments and the not all of the authors' conclusions are supported by data:</p><p>The authors introduce a weak-link enzyme, but there are also other artificially introduced potential weak-links and these are what is targeted by mutation after the main fitness increase by the amplifications. For example the <italic>rph-pyrE</italic> mutations correct a known defect in pyrimidine biosynthesis in this particular strain.</p><p>The insertion of the kanamycin resistance cassette upstream in ArgC is likely to disrupt expression of ArgB and the mutations seen in the intergenic region might simply compensate for this. That they are relevant outside this artificial genetic context would have to be shown in for example an ArgC mutant with a smaller inactivating in-frame deletion of ArgC. Based on the genetic context in the wild type it is possible that there is some kind of translational link between ArgC and ArgB (just 7 bp intergenic in the wild type). This would be supported by the big deletion bringing the <italic>kan<sup>r</sup></italic> ORF and ArgB closer that results in the largest increase in growth rate.</p><p>The computational analysis of effects of the mutations on mRNA structure is not relevant for a native context but mainly looks at effects caused by the strong secondary structure introduced by the FRT site in the <italic>kan<sup>r</sup></italic> cassette inserted upstream of ArgB. By including selection to keep kanamycin resistance this will also constrain the types of possible mutations (for example deletion to regain its native promoter upstream of ArgC) thereby biasing mutations to the small artificial intergenic region.</p><p>The effect of the <italic>carB</italic> mutations are well characterized at the biochemical level, but the authors do not show how this increase fitness or even that the mutations increase growth rate when reconstructed in a wild type background. The hypothesis that this is due to an increase in carbamoyl phosphate synthase activity that potentiates flux through the arginine pathway is not supported by data. The authors might want to discuss alternative mechanisms such as that a decrease in ornithine concentration reduce the activation of CarB to such level that not enough carbamoyl phosphate is produced for pyrimidine synthesis (which is also crippled by the <italic>rph-pyrE</italic> mutation).</p><p>Abstract: &quot;We have identified the mechanisms by which three classes of adaptive mutations increase fitness&quot; No mechanisms are actually shown even though some reasonable interpretations are given.</p><p>There is no data supporting that the mutations would produce a cost in another context and therefore statements like &quot;These changes could be detrimental requiring reversion or compensation&quot; &quot;often at a cost to a previously well-evolved function&quot; should be avoided. The well-evolved functions seem to already be disrupted by the <italic>rph-pyrE</italic> mutation and the insertion of the kanamycin cassette.</p><p>Similarly: &quot;While a constitutively active CPS is beneficial in the short term to improve arginine synthesis, it will likely be detrimental once arginine production no longer limits growth.&quot; This could be tested relatively easy experimentally, without such data it is merely a (very reasonable) hypothesis.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.53535.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the first round of peer review follow.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>The paper is a nice addition to the work on the evolution of new gene function via mutations that take a promiscuous enzyme and make it better.

That they are relevant outside this artificial genetic context would have to be shown in for example an ArgC mutant with a smaller inactivating in-frame deletion of ArgC. Based on the genetic context in the wild type it is possible that there is some kind of translational link between ArgC and ArgB (just 7 bp intergenic in the wild type). This would be supported by the big deletion bringing the kan<sup>r</sup> ORF and ArgB closer that results in the largest increase in growth rate.</p></disp-quote><p>We have addressed this valid concern by measuring protein levels in AM187 and a comparable strain that lacks ArgC due to introduction of two stop codons by label-free proteomics. ArgB levels are indeed diminished by 2.3-fold in AM187 (Figure 6—figure supplement 1). However, growth rate of AM187 is increased by mutations that increase ArgB levels by up to 8-fold and by overexpression of ArgB up to 25-fold, demonstrating that the beneficial effect of the mutations we observed is not simply due to</p><p>compensation for the 2.3-fold decrease in ArgB caused by replacement of <italic>argC</italic> with <italic>kan<sup>r</sup></italic>. This new experiment is described in the fourth paragraph of the subsection “Mutations upstream of <italic>argB</italic> increase ArgB abundance” and the data are shown in Figure 6B.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The computational analysis of effects of the mutations on mRNA structure is not relevant for a native context but mainly looks at effects caused by the strong secondary structure introduced by the FRT site in the kan<sup>r</sup> cassette inserted upstream of ArgB. By including selection to keep kanamycin resistance this will also constrain the types of possible mutations (for example deletion to regain its native promoter upstream of ArgC) thereby biasing mutations to the small artificial intergenic region.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the effects of the mutations on mRNA structure are not relevant for a native context. However, they are relevant for the context in which the experimental evolution was carried out. A deletion to regain the native promoter upstream of <italic>argC</italic> would not be needed because insertion of <italic>kan<sup>r</sup></italic> does not prevent utilization of the native promoter. The native promoter is regulated by the repressor ArgR, and would be expected to be active unless arginine levels are adequate. Thus, insertion of <italic>kan<sup>r</sup></italic> does not interfere with transcription of the operon. Further, the secondary structure introduced by the FRT site (the large stem loop from nucleotide 25-61 in Figure 6—figure supplement 2) does not seem to be driving the mutations, as this region is affected in only two of the mutants (the Δ58 bp and Δ51 bp mutants). Most of the mutations do not disrupt the secondary structure caused by the FRT site.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The effect of the carB mutations are well characterized at the biochemical level, but the authors do not show how this increase fitness or even that the mutations increase growth rate when reconstructed in a wild type background. The hypothesis that this is due to an increase in carbamoyl phosphate synthase activity that potentiates flux through the arginine pathway is not supported by data. The authors might want to discuss alternative mechanisms such as that a decrease in ornithine concentration reduce the activation of CarB to such level that not enough carbamoyl phosphate is produced for pyrimidine synthesis (which is also crippled by the rph-pyrE mutation).</p></disp-quote><p>We are not entirely sure what the reviewer means by “even that the mutations increase growth rate when reconstructed in a wild-type background”. We suspect that the reviewer meant that we had not shown that the mutations increase growth rate in the parental background. We have added data showing that three of four of the <italic>carB</italic> mutations do indeed increase growth rate of the parental strain. A reasonable explanation for the lack of growth increase with the fourth is also included in the paper. (See subsection “Mutations in <italic>carB</italic> either increase activity or impact allosteric regulation”, seventh paragraph and Figure 7F.)</p><p>At the reviewer’s suggestion, we considered the possibility that the <italic>carB</italic> mutations might be beneficial because they improve pyrimidine synthesis rather than arginine synthesis. After acquisition of the <italic>rph-pyrE</italic> mutation, addition of uracil to the medium does not improve growth rate, although it does improve growth rate of the parental strain, which has a known defect in pyrimidine synthesis (see Figure 7—figure supplement 2). Thus, there is no longer selective pressure to improve pyrimidine synthesis after the acquisition of the <italic>rph-pyrE</italic> mutation. However, poor arginine synthesis still limits growth; addition of arginine restored growth to wild-type levels. Since the <italic>carB</italic> mutations occurred after the <italic>rph-pyrE</italic> mutations, we can conclude that these mutations are beneficial because they improve arginine synthesis. We have added this new experiment to the text in Figure 7—figure supplement 2 and the tenth paragraph of the subsection “Mutations in <italic>carB</italic> either increase activity or impact allosteric regulation”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Abstract: &quot;We have identified the mechanisms by which three classes of adaptive mutations increase fitness&quot; No mechanisms are actually shown even though some reasonable interpretations are given.</p></disp-quote><p>By mechanisms we meant the increase in ProA* concentration produced by gene amplification, the increased activity of CarAB, and the increased expression of ArgB.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There is no data supporting that the mutations would produce a cost in another context and therefore statements like &quot;These changes could be detrimental requiring reversion or compensation&quot; &quot;often at a cost to a previously well-evolved function&quot; should be avoided. The well-evolved functions seem to already be disrupted by the rph-pyrE mutation and the insertion of the kanamycin cassette.</p><p>Similarly: &quot;While a constitutively active CPS is beneficial in the short term to improve arginine synthesis, it will likely be detrimental once arginine production no longer limits growth.&quot; This could be tested relatively easy experimentally, without such data it is merely a (very reasonable) hypothesis.</p></disp-quote><p>We have addressed this concern by introducing four of the <italic>carB</italic> mutations into the genome of wild-type <italic>E. coli</italic> containing the <italic>rph-pyrE</italic> mutation to simulate the situation where arginine production no longer limits growth. Competitive fitness assays showed that three mutations that alter allosteric regulation of CarB did in fact decrease fitness. Interestingly, one mutation increased growth rate in this background. These results are shown in Figure 7G and discussed in the Discussion.</p></body></sub-article></article>
