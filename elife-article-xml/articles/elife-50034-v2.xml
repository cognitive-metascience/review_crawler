To identify novel autophagy regulators, we performed a whole-genome CRISPR/Cas9 knockout screen in H4 human neuroglioma cells expressing endogenous LC3B tagged with a tandem of GFP and mCherry. Using this methodology, we identified the ubiquitin-activating enzyme UBA6 and the hybrid ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme/ubiquitin ligase BIRC6 as autophagy regulators. We found that these enzymes cooperate to monoubiquitinate LC3B, targeting it for proteasomal degradation. Knockout of UBA6 or BIRC6 increased autophagic flux under conditions of nutrient deprivation or protein synthesis inhibition. Moreover, UBA6 or BIRC6 depletion decreased the formation of aggresome-like induced structures in H4 cells, and α-synuclein aggregates in rat hippocampal neurons. These findings demonstrate that UBA6 and BIRC6 negatively regulate autophagy by limiting the availability of LC3B. Inhibition of UBA6/BIRC6 could be used to enhance autophagic clearance of protein aggregates in neurodegenerative disorders.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>autophagy</kwd><kwd>BIRC6</kwd><kwd>UBA6</kwd><kwd>ubiquitination</kwd><kwd>LC3</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009633</institution-id><institution>NICHD</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ZIA HD001607</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bonifacino</surname><given-names>Juan S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>An ensemble of the ubiquitin-activating enzyme UBA6 and ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme/ubiquitin-ligase BIRC6 mediates ubiquitination of LC3, targeting the latter for proteasomal degradation and thus attenuating autophagic degradation of cellular substrates.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Macroautophagy (herein referred to as autophagy) is a catabolic process involving the engulfment of cytoplasmic materials into double-membraned autophagosomes that subsequently fuse with lysosomes to form autolysosomes, where the materials are degraded by acid hydrolases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bento et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dikic and Elazar, 2018</xref>). Autophagy substrates include abnormal particles such as protein aggregates, damaged organelles and intracellular pathogens. Autophagy is also involved in the degradation of normal cellular constituents for survival under conditions of nutrient restriction or other stresses. Through these functions, autophagy plays crucial roles in the maintenance of cellular homeostasis. Defective autophagy contributes to the pathogenesis of various disorders, including neurodegeneration, cancer, cardiomyopathies and infectious diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dikic and Elazar, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Levine and Kroemer, 2008</xref>).</p><p>The mechanism of autophagy consists of multiple steps, including induction by cellular signals, phagophore formation and expansion, substrate engulfment, autophagosome closure, and autophagosome-lysosome fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Braten et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dikic and Elazar, 2018</xref>). Key components of the autophagy machinery are members of the Atg8 family of ubiquitin (Ub)-like proteins (LC3A, LC3B, LC3C, GABARAP, GABARAPL1 and GABARAPL2 in mammals), which play roles in autophagosome formation and autophagosome-lysosome fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Wild et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Johansen and Lamark, 2019</xref>). The best studied member of this family is LC3B (product of the <italic>MAP1LC3B</italic> gene), which undergoes conversion from a soluble, cytosolic form (LC3B-I) to a phosphatidylethanolamine (PE)-conjugated, membrane-bound form (LC3B-II) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kabeya et al., 2004</xref>). LC3B-II subsequently interacts with LC3-interacting region (LIR) motifs of various cargo receptors to capture autophagic cargos into forming autophagosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Birgisdottir et al., 2013</xref>). Among these receptors are cytosolic proteins such as SQSTM1 (p62), NBR1, NDP52, OPTN and TAX1BP1, which bind polyubiquitinated cargos via their Ub-binding domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Birgisdottir et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Wild et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Johansen and Lamark, 2019</xref>). Other cargo receptors are anchored to the autophagic cargos via their transmembrane domains, as is the case for BNIP3, NIX and FUNDC1 in mitochondrial autophagy (mitophagy) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Birgisdottir et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Wild et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Johansen and Lamark, 2019</xref>), and RTN3, SEC62, CCPG1, FAM134B and TEX264 in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) autophagy (ER-phagy) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Khaminets et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fumagalli et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Grumati et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Smith et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chino et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Johansen and Lamark, 2019</xref>). After fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes, the autophagy cargos, together with the Atg8-family proteins and cargo receptors, are degraded in lysosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Tanida et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bjørkøy et al., 2005</xref>). In addition to participating in cargo recruitment to the forming autophagosome, LC3B interacts with the LIR motif of FYCO1 (FYVE and coiled-coil domain containing protein 1), which serves as an adaptor to the kinesin-1 motor, enabling anterograde transport of autophagosomes along microtubule tracks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Pankiv et al., 2010</xref>). Furthermore, LC3B interacts with the LIR motif of another adaptor protein, PLEKHM1 (pleckstrin homology domain containing protein family member 1), which functions as a tether in autophagosome-lysosome fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">McEwan et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>The autophagy machinery is regulated by post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and ubiquitination. Several kinases have been implicated in positive or negative regulation of autophagy. As an example of positive regulation, the unc-51-like autophagy-activating kinase 1 (ULK1) phosphorylates the VPS34 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Egan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Russell et al., 2013</xref>), BECN1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Russell et al., 2013</xref>) and ATG14L1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Park et al., 2016</xref>) components of the class III PI3K complex, which subsequently catalyzes the conversion of phosphatidylinositol (PI) to phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate [PI(3)P], thus triggering phagophore formation. ULK1 itself is activated by phosphorylation on Ser-317, Ser-555 and Ser-777 by AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Egan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kim et al., 2011</xref>). On the other hand, the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex-1 (mTORC1) kinase negatively regulates autophagy by phosphorylating ULK1 on Ser-757, and thus preventing the interaction of ULK1 with AMPK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kim et al., 2011</xref>). The mTORC1 kinase exerts an additional inhibitory effect on autophagy by phosphorylating the autophagy protein UVRAG, a modification that decreases autophagosome maturation and autophagosome-lysosome fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kim et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Ubiquitination also plays positive and negative roles in autophagy. In fact, some of the kinases or kinase complexes that regulate autophagy are themselves targets of ubiquitination. For instance, ULK1 and BECN1 are positively regulated by polyubiquitination mediated by the Ub-ligase (E3) TRAF6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Shi and Kehrl, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Nazio et al., 2013</xref>). Non-enzymatic components of the autophagy machinery can also be positively regulated by ubiquitination, as is the case for the polyubiquitination of OPTN by the E3 HACE1, which promotes assembly of OPTN with SQSTM1 and thus results in enhanced autophagic degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Liu et al., 2014</xref>). An example of the negative effects of ubiquitination on autophagy is the activation of mTORC1 by TRAF6-mediated polyubiquitination of the catalytic mTOR subunit, with consequent inhibition of autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Linares et al., 2013</xref>). Furthermore, ULK1 and components of the class III PI3K complex are targeted for polyubiquitination and degradation by the E3 Cul3-KLHL20 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Liu et al., 2016</xref>). Finally, BECN1 is polyubiquitinated by the RNF216 and NEDD4 E3s, causing destabilization of the class III PI3K complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Platta et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Xu et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Both phosphorylation and ubiquitination have been targeted for pharmacologic manipulation of autophagy. For example, inhibition of mTORC1 by the drugs rapamycin or torin1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Noda and Ohsumi, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Thoreen et al., 2009</xref>), or activation of AMPK by metformin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Shi et al., 2012</xref>), are widely used to stimulate autophagy. In contrast, inhibition of the class III PI3K complex by wortmannin, LY294002 or 3-methyladenine impairs autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blommaart et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Wu et al., 2010</xref>). Finally, inhibition of USP10/13-mediated deubiquitination of BECN1 by spautin-1 causes destabilization and degradation of the class III PI3K complex, decreasing autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Liu et al., 2011</xref>). Autophagy stimulation has been proposed as a possible therapy for neurodegenerative disorders caused by accumulation of intracellular protein aggregates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Liu et al., 2011</xref>). Autophagy inhibition, on the other hand, could be used to treat hyperproliferative disorders fueled by increased autophagy, as is the case for some cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jiang et al., 2015</xref>). However, the involvement of known regulators of autophagy in other cellular processes has hampered efforts to exploit their pharmacologic activation or inhibition for clinical uses. Therefore, there is a need to identify additional autophagy regulators that could be targeted for therapeutic applications.</p><p>To identify additional autophagy regulators, we conducted a genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 knockout (KO) screen using cells that were gene-edited to express endogenous LC3B tagged with tandem GFP and mCherry fluorescent proteins. This screen is based on the acid-induced quenching of GFP, but not mCherry, upon fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kimura et al., 2007</xref>). Mutant cells displaying higher GFP:mCherry fluorescence ratios were selected by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), and the mutated genes were identified by next-generation sequencing. The reliability of the screen was demonstrated by the identification of genes encoding virtually all core components of the autophagy machinery. In addition, we identified other candidates, among which were two ubiquitination-related proteins: the Ub-activating enzyme (E1) UBA6 and the hybrid Ub-conjugating enzyme/Ub-ligase (E2/E3) BIRC6. Further analyses showed that these enzymes cooperate to catalyze monoubiquitination of LC3B, marking it for degradation by the proteasome. KO of UBA6 or BIRC6 increased the levels of LC3B, and lessened the accumulation of aggresome-like induced structures (ALIS) in non-neuronal cells and α-synuclein aggregates in neurons. These findings thus identify UBA6 and BIRC6 as negative regulators of autophagy, whose inhibition could be used to enhance autophagy and thus prevent the accumulation of pathogenic protein aggregates.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Identification of autophagy genes by CRISPR/Cas9 KO screening in human cells</title><p>This project was aimed at identifying novel autophagy genes in mammalian cells by taking advantage of the development of pooled CRISPR/Cas9 KO libraries for whole-genome phenotypic screens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Joung et al., 2017</xref>). To this end, we developed an indicator cell line that enabled the selection of autophagy-defective cells by FACS. This cell line, named H4-tfLC3B (H4-tandem fluorescent LC3B), was made by gene-editing human neuroglioma H4 cells to express endogenous LC3B tagged at its N-terminus with tandem GFP and mCherry fluorescent proteins (designated GFP-mCherry-LC3B) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>). The quenching of GFP, and not mCherry, in the acidic pH of autolysosomes allows the use of the GFP:mCherry ratio to monitor the delivery of GFP-mCherry-LC3B from neutral autophagosomes to acidic autolysosomes (process referred to as ‘autophagy flux’) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kimura et al., 2007</xref>). Moreover, endogenous tagging avoids the overexpression artifacts caused by transfection of cells with plasmids encoding fluorescently tagged LC3B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kimura et al., 2007</xref>). Live-cell imaging of H4-tfLC3B cells revealed puncta displaying both GFP and mCherry fluorescence (<italic>i.e.</italic>, autophagosomes), or only mCherry fluorescence (<italic>i.e.</italic>, autolysosomes) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Treatment of these cells with the vacuolar ATPase (v-ATPase) inhibitor bafilomycin A<sub>1</sub> increased the number of puncta containing GFP in addition to mCherry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), as well as the GFP:mCherry ratio in FACS analyses (seen as a displacement to the right in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), consistent with the presence of quenched GFP in autolysosomes. Likewise, siRNA-mediated knock down (KD) of the autophagy protein ATG7 increased the GFP:mCherry ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C and D</xref>), in accordance with the requirement of ATG7 for conversion of LC3B-I to LC3B-II and subsequent delivery of LC3B-II to autolysosomes. In contrast, depletion of serum and amino acids from the medium (<italic>i.e.</italic>, nutrient deprivation) decreased the GFP:mCherry ratio detected by FACS (seen as a shift to the left in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>), as expected from the induction of autophagy under conditions of nutrient shortage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kuma et al., 2004</xref>). Thus, the H4-tfLC3B cell line exhibited the expected responses to the inhibition or stimulation of autophagy.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.50034.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 screen for the identification of autophagy genes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Live-cell imaging of H4 cells expressing GPF-mCherry-LC3B (H4-tfLC3B).

To investigate the involvement of UBA6 in autophagy, we initially used siRNAs to KD UBA6 in H4 and HeLa cervical carcinoma cells, and examined the levels of the cytosolic (LC3B-I) and membrane-bound (LC3B-II) forms of LC3B as indicators of autophagy status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kabeya et al., 2004</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref>).

This was in contrast to ATG7 KD, which increased the levels LC3B-I but decreased the levels of LC3B-II (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B and C</xref>). CRISPR/Cas9 KO of UBA6 also resulted in increased levels of LC3B-I and unchanged levels of LC3B-II, a phenotype that was partially reversed by transfection with plasmids encoding UBA6 tagged at either the N- or C-terminus with the MYC epitope (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E and F</xref>). UBA6 KO caused a similar increase in the levels of LC3A-I but not of other Atg8-family members such as GABARAP and GABARAPL1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>). UBA6 KO did not cause noticeable changes in the levels of other components of the autophagy machinery, including components of the LC3-conjugation system (ATG3, ATG5, ATG7, ATG12, ATG16L1), WIPI2, the PI3K complex (BECN1, p-BECN1 and ATG14), the ULK1 complex (ATG13, p-ATG13, ULK1, p-ULK1), and the mTOR signaling pathway (S6K, p-S6K, 4EBP, p-4EBP, TSC2, p-TSC2, AKT, p-AKT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bento et al., 2016</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Likewise, fluorescent staining for the autophagy machinery components SQSTM1, WIPI2 and ATG9A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A–C</xref>), and for markers of the ER (calnexin), Golgi complex (GM130), mitochondria (TOM20), early endosomes (RAB5, APPL1, EEA1), lysosomes (LAMP1, LAMTOR4) and the cytoskeleton (β-tubulin, F-actin) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2D–J</xref>), showed no differences in UBA6-KO cells relative to the parental H4 cells. In addition, we observed that UBA6-KO cells proliferated at the same rate as WT cells, with doubling times of ~27 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A</xref>).

Real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) showed that KO of UBA6 did not change the levels of LC3B mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3D</xref>). Since UBA6 is an E1 enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Groettrup et al., 2008</xref>), we then hypothesized that it could decrease the levels of LC3-I protein by mediating LC3B-I ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. Indeed, treatment with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 resulted in a ~3 fold increase in the level of LC3B-I in WT H4 cells, but did not change the already elevated level of LC3B-I in UBA6-KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>). In addition, an in vivo ubiquitination assay showed that transgenic FLAG-tagged LC3B became conjugated with a single copy of HA-tagged Ub (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). The level of monoubiquitinated FLAG-LC3B was increased by treatment with MG132 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>) and decreased by KO of UBA6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>).

This pathway exerts a negative regulatory effect on autophagy, particularly under stress conditions such as nutrient deprivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H and I</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1E and F</xref>), inhibition of protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A–C</xref>) and formation of protein aggregates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7D, E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8A–E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>). Depletion of UBA6 or BIRC6 increases the pool of cytosolic LC3B-I, promoting autophagic flux and clearance of protein aggregates in both non-neuronal and neuronal cells. By dampening LC3 levels, the UBA6-BIRC6 pathway may protect cells from excessive autophagy causing autophagy-dependent cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Liu and Levine, 2015</xref>). On the other hand, inhibition of UBA6 or BIRC6 could be used to enhance autophagy for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders caused by abnormal protein aggregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Ross and Poirier, 2004</xref>).</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Comparison to previous CRISPR/Cas9 KO screens</title><p>Several recent studies also used genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 screens to identify novel components and regulators of the autophagy machinery in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">DeJesus et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Moretti et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Morita et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Shoemaker et al., 2019</xref>). As in our study, these screens were performed using cells expressing fluorescently-tagged LC3 or autophagy receptors such as SQSTM1, NPD52, TAX1BP1 or NBR1. All of these screens resulted in the identification of novel candidates, most notably the ER protein TMEM41B, which was shown to participate in autophagosome biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Moretti et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Morita et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Shoemaker et al., 2019</xref>). Our screen differed from previous ones in that we used cells expressing endogenously-tagged LC3B, in order to avoid artifacts of overexpression. Furthermore, we used a more stringent selection procedure involving isolation of cells that were in the top 1% of GFP intensity in the initial screen, and that maintained that level of fluorescent intensity through three additional rounds of sorting and expansion. This stringency likely accounts for the identification of virtually all known components of the autophagy machinery as top hits in the screen. The relatively high scores of UBA6 and BIRC6 in the whole-genome and ubiquitination screens thus gave us great confidence that these proteins were indeed involved in the regulation of autophagy. It is noteworthy that neither UBA6 nor BIRC6 ranked high in previous screens by other groups. This could be due to the overexpression of LC3B from a CMV promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Shoemaker et al., 2019</xref>), which likely overwhelmed the ability of UBA6 and BIRC6 to target LC3B for degradation. Indeed, we observed that CMV-driven overexpression of FLAG-tagged LC3B resulted in smaller differences in the levels of this protein in WT, UBA6-KO and BIRC6-KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6A</xref>). Furthermore, UBA6 and BIRC6 could have been missed in previous screens using autophagy receptors as reporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">DeJesus et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Moretti et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Shoemaker et al., 2019</xref>) because the levels of these proteins were unaltered under regular culture conditions, as observed for SQSTM1 and NBR1 in BIRC6-KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Only when cells were treated with cycloheximide did differences in the turnover of these proteins become apparent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A–C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>BIRC6-KO does not affect autophagosome-lysosome fusion in our system</title><p>A previous shRNA screen of 710 ubiquitination- and autophagy-related genes identified BIRC6 as an autophagy regulator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ebner et al., 2018</xref>). In contrast to our findings, however, BIRC6 was reported to promote autophagosome-lysosome fusion through interactions with GABARAP/GABARAPL1 and the SNARE protein syntaxin 17. Moreover, a 1,648-amino-acid N-terminal fragment of BIRC6 was shown to be sufficient for interaction with GABARAP/GABARAPL1 and syntaxin 17, and for association of BIRC6 to lysosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ebner et al., 2018</xref>). In our study, we did not observe any defects in autophagosome-lysosome fusion in BIRC6-KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F and G</xref>), nor did we find localization of BIRC6 to lysosomes but rather to the cytosol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). Moreover, we found that the C-terminally located UBC domain was essential for the role of BIRC6 in LC3B ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). We speculate that differences in these studies could be due to the use of different cell types and experimental conditions. In any event, the mechanism involving LC3B ubiquitination and degradation revealed by our study is consistent with the activity of BIRC6 as an E2/E3 enzyme. While our manuscript was in preparation, another study showed that BIRC6 targeted LC3B-I for proteasomal degradation, and that BIRC6 itself was subject to proteasomal degradation promoted by the ubiquitin ligase RNF41/NRDP1 (neuregulin receptor degradation protein-1) and inhibited by CACYBP/SIP (calcyclin-binding protein/siah-1 interacting protein) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jiang et al., 2019</xref>). Taken together, these findings reveal the existence of a complex regulatory network for the control of LC3B levels.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Role of monoubiquitination in LC3B degradation</title><p>Our experiments showed that UBA6 and BIRC6 mediate monoubiquitination, rather than polyubiquitination, of LC3B on lysine-51 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). The fact that this modification targets LC3B-I for proteasomal degradation is remarkable in light of early notions that monoubiquitination played mainly regulatory, non-degradative roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Haglund et al., 2003</xref>), whereas polyubiquitination was the signal for degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Thrower et al., 2000</xref>). More recent evidence, however, suggests that monoubiquitination can also target proteins for proteasomal degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Boutet et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dimova et al., 2012</xref>), especially for small proteins of 20–150 residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Shabek et al., 2012</xref>). Moreover, a systematic analysis revealed that approximately half of all the proteins degraded by proteasomes in human cells are monoubiquitinated or multi-monoubiquitinated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Braten et al., 2016</xref>). These findings are consistent with our conclusion that monoubiquitination of the 125-amino-acid LC3B is the signal that targets it for degradation.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Insights into the role of UBA6 in ubiquitination</title><p>UBA6 is one of eight E1 enzymes involved in the conjugation of 17 Ub-like proteins encoded in the human genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Schulman and Harper, 2009</xref>). In particular, UBA6 has been reported to activate both Ub and the Ub-like protein FAT10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Pelzer et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chiu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jin et al., 2007</xref>). UBA6-mediated FAT10ylation has also been implicated in targeting proteins for proteasomal degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aichem et al., 2012</xref>) as well as in the intracellular defense against bacterial infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Spinnenhirn et al., 2014</xref>). Except for one study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lee et al., 2011</xref>), however, little has been shown about the role of UBA6-mediated ubiquitination. Herein we show that UBA6 uses BIRC6 as an E2/E3 to ubiquitinate LC3. Nevertheless, small amounts of monoubiquitinated LC3B can still be found in UBA6-KO and BIRC6-KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). This finding suggests that other ubiquitinating enzymes could partially compensate for the absence of UBA6 or BIRC6. These alternative enzymes, however, likely play minor roles in LC3B ubiquitination, because they were not identified in our screens.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Impact of increased LC3 levels on autophagy and aggregate clearance</title><p>Although most of our work dealt with LC3B, the homologous LC3A and LC3C were also ubiquitinated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>), and UBA6 KO increased LC3A-I in addition to LC3B-I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>). In the same assays, GABARAP, GABARAPL1 and GABARAPL2 were not ubiquitinated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>) and the levels of GABARAP and GABARAPL1 did not change in UBA6-KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Moreover, BIRC6 interacted with LC3A, LC3B and LC3C more strongly than with GABARAP, GABARAPL1 and GABARAPL2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>). UBA6-BIRC6–mediated ubiquitination and degradation thus appear to be restricted to the LC3 subgroup of the Atg8 family. Recent studies showed that both LC3 and GABARAP family members contribute to autophagic degradation of protein aggregates and mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Vaites et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Nguyen et al., 2016</xref>), although GABARAPs seemed more important (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Vaites et al., 2017</xref>). We find that increasing the levels of LC3B by BIRC6-KO in H4 neuroglioma cells reduces the half-life of SQSTM1 and NBR1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A–C</xref>). Moreover, depletion of BIRC6 or UBA6 decreases the formation of SQSTM1- and Ub-decorated protein aggregates in both H4 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D–G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A–G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2A–C</xref>) and rat hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A–E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2A–C</xref>). Therefore, at least in these brain-derived cells, decreasing the levels of LC3 enhances autophagic flux and decreases accumulation of protein aggregates. Our findings are in line with a previous report that overexpression of LC3B in a transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer disease inhibited amyloid-β-peptide-induced neuron degeneration by enhancing autophagy flux (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hung et al., 2015</xref>). In addition, another study showed that overexpression of a LC3B transgene attenuated lung injury in a mouse model of sepsis, probably by enhancement of autophagosome clearance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Lo et al., 2013</xref>). These findings not only support the notion that elevated LC3 levels promote autophagy flux, but also suggest that increasing LC3 levels could have therapeutic applications.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Potential use of UBA6 or BIRC6 inhibition to treat protein aggregation diseases</title><p>Intracellular accumulation of pathogenic protein aggregates is a common cause of various neurodegenerative disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Ross and Poirier, 2004</xref>). This accumulation usually results from overproduction of normal proteins or from synthesis of mutant proteins that overwhelm the capacity of the autophagy machinery to clear them. An example of such disorders is PD, a neurodegenerative disease characterized by the presence of Lewy bodies containing aggregated α-synuclein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Polymeropoulos et al., 1997</xref>). Since α-synuclein aggregates are mainly degraded by autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Webb et al., 2003</xref>), autophagy enhancement has been proposed as a possible therapy for PD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Williams et al., 2006</xref>). Indeed, autophagy enhancing agents targeting AMPK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Patil et al., 2014</xref>), mTORC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Crews et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bai et al., 2015</xref>), BECN1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Savolainen et al., 2014</xref>) and lysosomal glucocerebrosidase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Richter et al., 2014</xref>) have all been shown to increase α-synuclein clearance and to have a neuroprotective effect in animal models of PD. However, targeting AMPK and mTORC1 is problematic because, as central nodes of nutrient and energy signaling pathways, they regulate numerous of cellular processes, including cell growth, protein synthesis and metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Saxton and Sabatini, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Mihaylova and Shaw, 2011</xref>). The decreased accumulation of α-synuclein aggregates by depletion of UBA6 or BIRC6 shown here suggests that these proteins could also be targeted for pharmacologic treatment of PD and other protein aggregation disorders.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">LC3B (rabbit, monoclonal)</td><td valign="top">Cell Signaling Technology</td><td valign="top">3868</td><td valign="top">IB: 1:2000</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">UBA6 (rabbit <break/>polyclonal)</td><td valign="top">Cell Signaling Technology</td><td valign="top">13386</td><td valign="top">IB: 1:1000</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">β-tubulin (rabbit polyclonal)</td><td valign="top">Cell Signaling Technology</td><td valign="top">2146</td><td valign="top">IB: 1:1000</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">MYC epitope (rabbit polyclonal)</td><td valign="top">Santa Cruz Biotechnology</td><td valign="top">sc-789</td><td valign="top">IB: 1:5000</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Ub (mouse monoclonal)</td><td valign="top">Thermo Fisher <break/>Scientific</td><td valign="top">13–1600</td><td valign="top">IB: 1:1000</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Ub (mouse monoclonal)</td><td valign="top">Enzo Life Sciences</td><td valign="top">BML-PW8805-0500</td><td valign="top">IF: 1:500</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">HA epitope (mouse monoclonal)</td><td valign="top">BioLegend</td><td valign="top">901501</td><td valign="top">IB: 1:2000</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">FLAG epitope (mouse monoclonal)</td><td valign="top">Sigma-Aldrich</td><td valign="top">F1804</td><td valign="top">IB: 1:1000</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">SQSTM1 (mouse monoclonal)</td><td valign="top">BD Biosciences</td><td valign="top">610833</td><td valign="top">IB: 1:1000</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">SQSTM1 (rabbit polyclonal)</td><td valign="top">Enzo Life Sciences</td><td valign="top">BML-PW9860-0100</td><td valign="top">IF: 1:500</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">NBR1 (rabbit monoclonal)</td><td valign="top">Cell Signaling Technology</td><td valign="top">9891</td><td valign="top">IB: 1:1000</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">BIRC6 (rabbit monoclonal)</td><td valign="top">Cell Signaling Technology</td><td valign="top">8756</td><td valign="top">IB: 1:1000</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">GFP (rabbit polyclonal)</td><td valign="top">Thermo Fisher Scientific</td><td valign="top">A11122</td><td valign="top">IB: 1:1000</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Actin (mouse monoclonal)</td><td valign="top">Cell Signaling Technology</td><td valign="top">3700</td><td valign="top">IB: 1:1000</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">Bafilomycin A<sub>1</sub></td><td valign="top">Sigma-Aldrich</td><td valign="top">B1793</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">MG132</td><td valign="top">Sigma-Aldrich</td><td valign="top">M7449</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical <break/>compound, drug</td><td valign="top">Cycloheximide</td><td valign="top">Sigma-Aldrich</td><td valign="top">C4859</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">Puromycin</td><td valign="top">Sigma-Aldrich</td><td valign="top">P8833</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">Polybrene</td><td valign="top">Sigma-Aldrich</td><td valign="top">H9268</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">MgATP</td><td valign="top">Boston Biochem</td><td valign="top">B-20</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">Fibronectin</td><td valign="top">Sigma-Aldrich</td><td valign="top">F2006</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td>H4</td><td>ATCC</td><td>HTB-148</td><td/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td>HeLa</td><td>ATCC</td><td>CCL-2</td><td/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td>HEK293T</td><td>ATCC</td><td>CRL-11268</td><td/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Recombinant DNA</td><td>HA-Ub</td><td>Addgene;

HEK293T cells were co-transfected with the GeCKO v2 library, pMD2.G and psPAX. Supernatants were collected 48 hr after transfection, filtered on a 0.2 μm filter unit, and stored at −80°C. To test the viral titer, 0.5 million H4-tfLC3B cells were seeded on each well of a 6-well plate 24 hr prior to infection. The cells were incubated with lentiviral supernatants with 5 μg/ml polybrene for 4 hr, and one extra well of cells was incubated with regular medium without viral supernatants as control. Viral supernatants were then discarded, and fresh medium was added. The following day, cells were trypsinized and 10,000 cells were seeded into each well of a 24-well plate in duplicate. One day later, one well was supplemented with 1 μg/ml puromycin, while the other well was maintained in regular medium. When puromycin killed all the cells in the no-virus condition, the number of cells in each well was counted. The multiplicity of infection (MOI) was calculated by dividing the number of cells in puromycin-selected wells by that in the unselected wells.</p><p>For the large-scale screen, 200 million H4-tfLC3B cells were infected with the lentiviral pool at a MOI of 0.3. The transduced cells were selected by adding 1 μg/ml puromycin 24 hr after infection. After puromycin selection for 7 days, the initial screen was performed by collecting the top 1% cells with increased GFP signal by sorting on a FACS Aria II Flow Cytometer.

requests and the accompanying author responses.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Acceptance summary:</bold></p><p>This work provides interesting evidence that the ubiquitin conjugation machinery proteins UBA6 and BIRC6 facilitate monoubiquitination of LC3 family proteins (not GABARAP proteins), followed by their proteasomal degradation. Cells depleted of UBA6 or BIRC6 have higher levels of non-lipidated LC3 (LC3-I) than control cells and increased autophagic flux when subjected to starvation or proteotoxic stress. UBA6 and BIRC6 were identified in two independent CRISPR/Cas9 knockout screens, targeting the whole-genome or genes involved in ubiquitin conjugation (E1, E2, E3) or deubiquitination, respectively, using H4 human neuroglioma cells expressing endogenous LC3B tagged with a tandem GFP-mCherry tag. The screens were based on FACS sorting of cells with increased GFP:mCherry ratio under basal conditions, thus selecting for positive regulators of autophagy. The identification of UBA6 and BIRC6 as negative regulators of autophagy by mediating degradation of LC3B is potentially therapeutically relevant as inhibition of UBA6/BIRC6 could be used to enhance autophagy.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Negative regulation of autophagy by UBA6-BIRC6-mediated ubiquitination of LC3&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Ivan Dikic as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Cynthia Wolberger as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Christian Münch (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Presented data indicate a role for UBA6/BIRC6 in ubiquitination of LC3 is strong, but it is questioned whether accumulation of LC3-I in UBA6/BIRC6 KO is (only) due to a defect in proteasomal degradation of LC3.

Other possibilities would be: 1) accumulation of LC3 in the nucleus (as LC3 K51 acetylation regulates this), 2) accumulation of LC3 in protein aggregates, 3) increased LC3 mRNA levels, 4) increased binding to GABARAP proteins or even microtubules. These possibilities should be ruled out.</p></disp-quote><p>The extraction of LC3B for analysis by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting was done under denaturing conditions using lithium dodecyl sulfate (LDS) and heating at 95°C, so it is unlikely that the accumulation of LC3B-I in UBA6- and BIRC6-KO cells could be due to anything other than changes in protein levels. Moreover, the increased levels of LC3B-I upon incubation with MG132 support the conclusion that LC3B-I degradation is proteasomal. Nevertheless, we performed additional experiments to test the additional possibilities suggested by the reviewers.</p><p>1) A nuclear fractionation assay showed that ~50% of LC3B-I was in the nuclear fraction and ~50% was in the cytoplasmic fraction, as previously reported (Huang et al., 2015). KO of BIRC6 did not alter these percentages, although the overall levels of LC3B-I were higher than in WT cells in both fractions, as expected from the decreased degradation of LC3B-I in the KO cells. These results are shown in a new Figure 5—figure supplement 1C.</p><p>2) Fractionation into Triton-soluble and -insoluble fractions, similar to those performed in Figure 8D for α-synuclein in rat hippocampal neurons, showed that very little LC3B-I was present in aggregates in WT H4 cells. KO of BIRC6 increased this small amount proportionally to the increase in total LC3B-I levels. These results are shown in a new Figure 5—figure supplement 1B.</p><p>3) Real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) demonstrated that KO of UBA6 or BIRC6 did not significantly alter LC3B mRNA levels relative to WT cells, as shown in the new Figure 2—figure supplement 3D.</p><p>4) A microtubule co-sedimentation assay showed no association of LC3B with microtubules in WT or BIRC6-KO cells, as shown in the new Figure 5—figure supplement 1D.</p><p>All of these experiments support our original conclusion that increased levels of LC3B-I in UBA6- and BIRC6-KO cells detected in SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analyses reflect increases in total protein levels due to decreased proteasomal degradation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The clearance of protein aggregates (ALIS and α-synuclein) is increased in BIRC6 KO cells.

As shown in the new Figure 6—figure supplement 1C, BIRC6 interacts more strongly with LC3 than with GABARAP family proteins, explaining the selectivity of BIRC6 for LC3 ubiquitination. Although the K51 residue shared by LC3 and GABARAP family proteins contributes to some extent to interaction of LC3B with BIRC6 (new Figure 6—figure supplement 1D), other residues that differ between LC3 and GABARAP family proteins may contribute to the differential interactions. A structural explanation for these differences is beyond our possibilities at the present time.</p></body></sub-article></article>
