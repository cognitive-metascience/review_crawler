They often remain elusive because the first signs of genetic misregulation may initiate as subtle changes in gene expression, which are hard to detect and can be obscured later in development by secondary effects. Here, we develop a method to trace back the origins of phenotypic abnormalities by accurately quantifying the 3D spatial distribution of gene expression domains in developing organs. By applying Geometric Morphometrics to 3D gene expression data obtained by Optical Projection Tomography, we determined that our approach is sensitive enough to find regulatory abnormalities that have never been detected previously. We identified subtle but significant differences in the gene expression of a downstream target of a <italic>Fgfr2</italic> mutation associated with Apert syndrome, demonstrating that these mouse models can further our understanding of limb defects in the human condition. Our method can be applied to different organ systems and models to investigate the etiology of malformations.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36405.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Our development in the womb is complex. Genes need to switch on and off in a precise order, controlling the activity of millions of cells as they work together to form different tissues. For everything to happen smoothly, cells must use instructions provided by each gene exactly at the correct moment and in the correct place. In this biological assembly line, the slightest change can lead to a defect.</p><p>Certain genetic mutations can change when and where cells use particular genes, and this can cause errors in development. These kinds of mutations are a common cause of birth defects, but we cannot always pinpoint how they begin. For example, a single mutation in a gene called FGFR2 causes malformations in the head, the heart and the limbs in a rare disease called Apert syndrome.</p><p>The first signs that development has gone wrong can be subtle changes in the use of certain genes, impossible to detect with standard methods. As development continues, other processes can mask the impact of problems with certain genes. Ultimately, changes alter the shape of the developing embryo.</p><p>Genetically engineered mouse models can mimic the gene defects that cause disease in humans. But current methods are not sensitive enough to detect the very first signs of defects. Now, Martínez-Abadías et al. developed a new method to detect these subtle changes and reveal the precise moment when development starts to go wrong.</p><p>In mice, a specific mutation in the FGFR2 gene affects the activity of a series of other genes. To track the levels of one of these genes, Martínez-Abadías et al. marked mouse embryos using a chemical label. Scanning the embryos then revealed the pattern of the cells using the gene during the earliest stages of development. In mice carrying a mutation in the FGFR2 gene, subtle changes in gene expression began just a few hours after their limbs start to develop. But it took another half a day to see the effects of these changes on the shape and size of the growing limbs. This approach revealed changes in gene expression before any problems with development were visible by eye.</p><p>Tracking subtle changes in the way cells use genes could allow us to detect the origins of embryo malformations before they appear, pointing at the best moment to start a treatment. With further development, the model could extend to other genes, proteins, animal models and diseases.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Optical Projection Tomography (OPT)</kwd><kwd>whole‐mount‐in‐situ hybridization (WMISH)</kwd><kwd>Geometric Morphometrics (GM)</kwd><kwd>limb development</kwd><kwd>Apert syndrome</kwd><kwd>developmental defects</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000780</institution-id><institution>European Commission</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FP7‐PEOPLE‐2012‐ 597 IIF 327382</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Martínez-Abadías</surname><given-names>Neus</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NICHD P01HD078233</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Richtsmeier</surname><given-names>Joan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NIDCR R01DE02298</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Richtsmeier</surname><given-names>Joan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000861</institution-id><institution>Burroughs Wellcome Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2013 Collaborative Research Travel Grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Richtsmeier</surname><given-names>Joan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Quantitative analyses associating the morphology of developing organs with dynamic gene expression patterns can reveal biological phenomena that cause malformations and malfunction but remain elusive to traditional qualitative assessments.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Morphogenesis is guided by dynamic spatio-temporal regulation of gene expression patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Andrey and Mundlos, 2017</xref>), the zones within tissues where genes are expressed during specific periods in development. Critical changes in the space, time or intensity of gene expression patterns can result in organ malformation, with reduced or even loss of function. These errors of morphogenesis, which occur in approximately 3% of live births (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Toxicology NRC C on D, 2000</xref>), are induced by environmental and/or genetic insults that alter the normal process of development. The common approach to revealing the origin of these alterations is to look for phenotypic abnormalities in animal models and to visually assess the overall patterns of gene expression. This qualitative approach has not, however, been able to identify the earliest signs of dysmorphogenesis in many diseases because the first changes in the gene expression patterns may be subtle, limited in time, and later abnormalities may obscure the original genetic cause. To reveal the primary etiology of congenital malformations, more rigorous methods are needed to quantify the three-dimensional (3D) phenotypes of gene expression patterns. A useful tool for tracing back development should be able to perform a quantitative statistical comparison of normal and disease-altered embryogenesis and to detect the earliest signs of genetic misregulation leading to organ malformation.</p><p>The shape of developing organs is regulated by gene activity in space and time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Andrey and Mundlos, 2017</xref>). Cascades of gene regulatory networks provide the detailed instructions necessary to organize cell behavior and to orchestrate tissue growth and differentiation. Gene expression patterns can be readily mapped within tissues in a true 3D framework combining whole-mount-in-situ hybridization (WMISH) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rosen and Beddington, 1993</xref>) with Optical Projection tomography (OPT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sharpe et al., 2002</xref>). WMISH is a standard molecular technique for detecting the expression of a specific gene using a labeled complementary RNA probe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">de la Pompa et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Correia and Conlon, 2001</xref>), and OPT is a mesoscopic imaging procedure that can produce high-resolution 3D reconstructions of whole developing embryos processed by WMISH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sharpe, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boot et al., 2008</xref>). These technologies represented breakthroughs in developmental biology and have provided invaluable qualitative insights into gene function and development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sharpe, 2003</xref>). However, methods for quantifying the 3D distributions of gene expression in a systematic, objective manner are still lacking.</p><p>Expanding the potential of OPT from <italic>qualitative</italic> to <italic>quantitative</italic> analysis of gene expression patterns is challenging. Gene expression is characterized by highly dynamic patterns, with fast rates of change and fuzzy boundaries that usually do not correspond to well-defined anatomical structures but rather to tissue regions where cells have dynamically up- and downregulated genes. Gene expression patterns have rarely been quantified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jernvall et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Airey et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Salazar-Ciudad and Jernvall, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mayer et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Xu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Martínez-Abadías et al., 2016</xref>). We propose to quantify the shape of developing organs in association with their underlying gene expression patterns by applying Geometric Morphometrics (GM), a set of statistical tools for measuring and comparing shapes with increased precision and efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">James Rohlf and Marcus, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Klingenberg, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Klingenberg, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adams et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hallgrimsson et al., 2015</xref>). Previous attempts had analyzed the phenotypic and gene expression patterns of variation independently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jernvall et al., 2000</xref>), using different morphometric methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Xu et al., 2015</xref>) or were restricted to two-dimensional analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Martínez-Abadías et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, the current study is the first to combine OPT and GM to characterize the shape of gene expression patterns quantitatively in 3D and to associate these changes to phenotypic changes. Thus, this approach provides the ability to replace qualitative observations with the quantification of subtle yet significant biological differences that underlie the processes through which morphogenesis is altered by disease.</p><p>Here, we illustrate how our method can reveal the genetic origin of developmental defects by investigating limb malformations in Apert syndrome [OMIM 101200]. Apert syndrome is a rare congenital disease, with a disease prevalence of 15–16 per million live births, that is characterized by cranial, neural, limb, and visceral malformations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cohen and MacLean, 2000</xref>). Over 99% of Apert cases are associated with one of two missense mutations, S252W or P253R, in the Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor 2 (FGFR2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wilkie et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Park et al., 1995</xref>). The mutations occur on neighboring amino acids on the linker region between the second and third extracellular immunoglobulin domains of FGFR2, and alter the ligand-binding specificity of the receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yu et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yu and Ornitz, 2001</xref>). Thus, the FGF receptors are activated inappropriately, altering the entire FGF/FGFR signaling pathway and causing dysmorphologies of different organs and systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">McIntosh et al., 2000</xref>). Apert syndrome shares craniofacial dysmorphologies with other craniosynostosis syndromes but is differentiated on the basis of limb defects of the fore- and hindlimb digits. The craniofacial dysmorphology of Apert syndrome (i.e. premature closure of cranial sutures and patent anterior fontanelle associated with atypical head shape, midfacial retrusion and palatal defects) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cohen and MacLean, 2000</xref>) has been intensively investigated, especially because mouse models show cranial phenotypes that correspond with the human condition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Holmes et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Martínez-Abadías et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Holmes and Basilico, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hill et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Heuzé et al., 2014</xref>). The associated limb defects are less well studied, however, in part because mouse models for Apert syndrome present only subtle limb anomalies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wang et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wang et al., 2010</xref>), even in mice carrying the P253R mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wang et al., 2010</xref>) which is associated with the more severe limb malformations in Apert syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Slaney et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">von Gernet et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>Here, we present precise phenotyping of the limbs of newborn and embryonic specimens of the <italic>Fgfr2<sup>+/P253R</sup></italic> Apert syndrome mouse model, and reveal significant differences that can be traced to as early as one day after the initiation of limb development. To explore the molecular basis of these initial signs of limb dysmorphology, we applied our method combining OPT and GM to assess the expression pattern of a downstream target of Fgf signaling, <italic>Dusp6</italic>. We chose to assess <italic>Dusp6</italic> because it is well-documented as a direct target of Fgf signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kawakami et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Li et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ekerot et al., 2008</xref>), and because, in addition to being a relevant gene for limb morphogenesis, it is also important for facial, brain and heart development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kawakami et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Li et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Maillet et al., 2008</xref>). Therefore, <italic>Dusp6</italic> was an ideal candidate for our proof-of-concept study. Our quantitative analyses demonstrate that the Apert syndrome <italic>Fgfr2 P253R</italic> mutation induces changes in the expression pattern of <italic>Dusp6</italic> and that these genetic changes are associated with significant phenotypic alterations. These results provide insight into the origins of limb malformations in Apert syndrome.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Apert syndrome mice present limb malformations at birth</title><p>Previous studies have reported that most Apert syndrome mice do not show obvious abnormalities of the limbs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2003</xref>), and thus focused their molecular analyses on the skull (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wang et al., 2010</xref>). Histopathological analyses in Apert syndrome mice revealed overall limb shortening resulting from abnormal osteogenic differentiation, but no signs of limb disproportion or syndactyly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wang et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wang et al., 2010</xref>).

mutant and unaffected limbs. To find the earliest moment when differences arise, we traced limb development backwards in time using Geometric Morphometric methods, starting first with embryos from the oldest period (as the differences would be easier to find) and from there proceeding towards the earlier (younger) periods. In this way, we should be able to identify confidently the initiation of limb dysmorphogenesis associated with the <italic>Fgfr2 P253R</italic> mutation.</p><p>During the 'Late' period, we detected that <italic>Fgfr2<sup>+/P253R</sup></italic> limb buds were already clearly separated from those of their unaffected littermates in the morphospace defined by the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Relative to those of their unaffected littermates, the limbs of <italic>Fgfr2<sup>+/P253R</sup></italic> mice presented subtle phenotypic limb differences: limbs were shorter and thicker, with limited development of the wrist (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Quantitative comparison of limb size showed that the limbs of mutant mice were also significantly smaller than those of their unaffected littermates (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Interestingly, in this 'Late' period the limbs of mutant mice were smaller than unaffected littermates (although this was not the case in earlier periods). Overall, these results confirmed that the <italic>Fgfr2 P253R</italic> Apert syndrome mutation has an effect on limb development, altering both the size and shape of the limbs. These subtle but significant phenotypic differences would most probably have remained undetected by a qualitative approach. Our quantitative approach revealed their statistical significance and pointed to the origin of the Apert syndrome limb malformation prior to E11.5, before the 'Late' period.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36405.014</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Tracing of limb phenotypes (anatomical and molecular) back through developmental time to the earliest moment of appearance.</title><p>Principal Component Analysis based on the Procrustes-based semi-landmark analysis was used to assess the shape of the limbs and the corresponding <italic>Dusp6</italic> expression domains for each developmental period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>).

At this period, the limbs of <italic>Fgfr2<sup>+/P253R</sup></italic> mice lacked the antero-posterior asymmetry and the narrowing of the wrist region more typical of unaffected littermates. Instead, <italic>Fgfr2<sup>+/P253R</sup></italic> mice showed a limb phenotype that was elongated in the proximo-distal axis and thickened in the dorso-ventral axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), resembling the limb shape of younger unaffected embryos. This shape difference coincided with reduced growth in <italic>Fgfr2<sup>+/P253R</sup></italic> mice, as the limbs of <italic>Fgfr2<sup>+/P253R</sup></italic> mice tended to be smaller than unaffected limbs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Therefore, significant differences between unaffected and mutant limbs could still be detected during the 'Mid late' period of development and the origins of limb defects associated with Apert syndrome should be sought earlier in development.</p><p>The first period during which no significant differences could be detected between unaffected and <italic>Fgfr2<sup>+/P253R</sup></italic> Apert syndrome mice was at the 'Mid early' period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Despite internal variation in limb shape, with <italic>Fgfr2<sup>+/P253R</sup></italic> mice spreading throughout the morphospace and unaffected littermates concentrated on one region, mutant and unaffected littermates completely overlapped. Therefore, limb shape differences could no longer be detected between groups. Limb size differences were not significant either (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Therefore, our results suggest that the critical time point of limb dysmorphogenesis associated with Apert syndrome occurred between the 'Mid late' and 'Mid early' periods, corresponding to the transition period from E10.5 to E11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B–C</xref>).</p><p>Consistent with the above, no further sign of limb shape dysmorphology was detected during the 'Early' period of development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). During this period, there was a great range of developmental variation, with unaffected and <italic>Fgfr2<sup>+/P253R</sup></italic> mutant mice completely overlapping in the morphospace and with all limbs displaying similar incipient bud shapes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). The limbs of <italic>Fgfr2<sup>+/P253R</sup></italic> mice were significantly larger than the limbs of their unaffected littermates (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>), suggesting that at this early time point, there is a significant effect of the <italic>Fgfr2 P253R</italic> mutation on limb size but not on limb shape (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title><italic>Fgfr2</italic> Apert syndrome mutation leads to aberrant overexpression of <italic>Dusp6</italic> domains</title><p>We next sought to obtain direct evidence of altered genetic regulation that could explain the observed limb phenotype by analyzing the shape dynamics of the expression of <italic>Dusp6</italic>, a direct target gene of Fgf signaling. As in the limb shape analysis described above, we chose to work backwards in developmental time, first examining the gene expression of <italic>Dusp6</italic> in the embryos from the latest period. We found that in the 'Late' period, <italic>Dusp6</italic> expression was already different in <italic>Fgfr2<sup>+/P253R</sup></italic> mutant mice and unaffected littermates. The differences were significant both in shape (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>) and size (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). In the limbs of unaffected mice, the <italic>Dusp6</italic> expression domain appeared as a thin domain underlying the apical ectodermal ridge, whereas in <italic>Fgfr2<sup>+/P253R</sup></italic> mutant mice, the shape of the <italic>Dusp6</italic> domain was expanded in all directions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Accordingly, the volume of the <italic>Dusp6</italic> expression domain was significantly larger in Apert syndrome mice (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>), even when these mice had significantly smaller limbs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). The <italic>Dusp6</italic> expression domain thus grew disproportionately in the limbs of <italic>Fgfr2<sup>+/P253R</sup></italic> mutant mice in the latest period of development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>), which is consistent with reports of whole-body size reduction in <italic>Fgfr2<sup>+/P253R</sup></italic> Apert mice and of the over-activation of <italic>Fgfr2</italic> signaling by the Apert syndrome mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yu and Ornitz, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ibrahimi et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>During the 'Mid late' period, the shapes of expression patterns were still distinct — the expanded <italic>Dusp6</italic> expression domain persisted on the dorsal and ventral sides of mutant limbs, but was reduced on the anterior and posterior sides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). The overall volume of the <italic>Dusp6</italic> expression domains remained larger in <italic>Fgfr2<sup>+/P253R</sup></italic> mutant mice, but the difference was no longer statistically significant (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>).</p><p>During the 'Mid early' period, the separation between unaffected and <italic>Fgfr2<sup>+/P253R</sup></italic> mutant mice was maintained in the PCA analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). Unaffected mice showed a <italic>Dusp6</italic> expression domain that was expanded towards the anterior and posterior edges of the expression domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). By contrast, <italic>Fgfr2<sup>+/P253R</sup></italic> mutant mice did not show the extension and the posterior asymmetry of the <italic>Dusp6</italic> expression domain typical of normal limb development, suggesting a lack of differentiation in the <italic>Dusp6</italic> expression of mutant limbs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>).</p><p>The 'Early' period was the only time point when we did not detect a significant difference between unaffected and <italic>Fgfr2<sup>+/P253R</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>). The PCA showed variation in the expression domains of <italic>Dusp6,</italic> with similar gene expression patterns in terms of both shape (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>) and size (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>) across all mice. Therefore, the first observation of an alteration in the gene expression pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>) occurred earlier than the change in the limb shape (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Our analyses provide evidence that differences in the <italic>Dusp6</italic> gene expression pattern first occurred during the 'Mid early period', preceding the phenotypic limb differentiation, which occurred a few hours later during the 'Mid late period'. Overall, the time courses showing the dynamics of limb shape and gene expression pattern changes throughout development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) confirmed that the <italic>Fgfr2</italic> Apert syndrome mutation causes an aberrant overexpression of <italic>Dusp6</italic> early in development, which could later lead to significant limb malformations.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Altered <italic>Dusp6</italic> expression and limb dysmorphology are highly associated</title><p>Finally, we explored the patterns of correlation between the limb phenotype and gene expression to further explore how altered Fgf signaling relates to the limb malformations induced by the Apert syndrome <italic>Fgfr2 P253R</italic> mutation. First, we assessed the relationship between the size of the limbs and the volume of the <italic>Dusp6</italic> expression domain, pooling all the forelimbs and hindlimbs and assessing the correlation between these two traits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C,D</xref>). The trend line showed that for the same limb size, <italic>Fgfr2<sup>+/P253R</sup></italic> mutant mice showed larger <italic>Dusp6</italic> expression domains, both in forelimbs (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.4) and hindlimbs (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.6). If the extension of the <italic>Dusp6</italic> expression depended only on limb growth, and the gene domain passively became larger by just following limb tissue growth, a higher correlation between the size of the limb and the gene expression would be expected. However, the moderate correlation found here suggests that the size of the <italic>Dusp6</italic> gene expression zone is not solely dependent on limb growth but might be controlled by further genetic regulatory factors.</p><p>Second, we assessed the morphological integration between the shape of the limbs and the shape of the <italic>Dusp6</italic> expression domain. The statistical analysis of the covariance pattern between these shapes can reflect the interaction of the phenotype and the gene expression pattern during limb development. As shown by analysis of additional genes expressed during limb development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Martínez-Abadías et al., 2016</xref>), even when a gene is expressed within the limb, the shape of the limb and the shape of the gene expression domain are not correlated by definition, and the integration pattern can change from a strong association to no significant correlation within few hours as the limb develops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Martínez-Abadías et al., 2016</xref>). The dynamics of the integration pattern can identify the key periods during which the expression of a gene is relevant for determining the shape of the limb. If the morphological integration is low, the expression of the gene will not be as relevant for determining the shape of the limb as it would be when the integration is high and the impact of the altered gene expression on the phenotype is minimal. If the morphological integration is high, the impact of the genetic mutation will be maximized (i.e. changes in the gene expression pattern will produce changes in the limb shape). Our results showed that the shape of the limb and the shape of the <italic>Dusp6</italic> expression domain were indeed highly correlated (RV = 0.88 in forelimbs; RV = 0.91 in hindlimbs). This is evidence that altered Fgf signaling, induced by the <italic>Fgfr2 P253R</italic> Apert syndrome mutation, can be associated with limb dysmorphology.</p><p>By comparing the morphological integration patterns in mutant and unaffected littermates during different periods, we can test whether this interaction is maintained or disrupted by the disease during development. If the pattern or magnitude of morphological integration is different in mutant mice, it should reveal further mechanisms underlying the etiology of the disease. Our analyses showed that the pattern of morphological integration of the shape of the limbs and the shape of the <italic>Dusp6</italic> expression domains was similar in unaffected and <italic>Fgfr2<sup>+/P253R</sup></italic> mutant mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). Our results confirmed that the <italic>Fgfr2 P253R</italic> mutation does not disrupt the strong association between limb shape and the <italic>Dusp6</italic> expression domain. Therefore, the alteration of the <italic>Dusp6</italic> expression pattern between E10 and E11.5, caused by the <italic>Fgfr2</italic> mutation, will correlate with the limb dysmorphologies associated with Apert syndrome. Overall, the high correlation between the shape of the limb and the <italic>Dusp6</italic> expression domain provides further evidence that altered Fgf expression resulting from the <italic>Fgfr2</italic> mutation is strongly associated with limb defects in Apert syndrome.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>By definition, revealing the primary etiology of an abnormality requires going back in time to the earliest moment when abnormal development can be found. Typically, the earliest changes will be the most subtle, and so the most statistically sensitive techniques are necessary to reveal these changes. The methods that are currently used to assess gene expression patterns are mainly qualitative and focus only on shape and size differences that can be simply detected by eye. Therefore, slight changes in gene expression domains, even if they have large effects on the phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Honeycutt, 2008</xref>), can remain undetected. To reveal these subtle changes, we have developed a precise method combining OPT and GM to quantify embryo morphology and the underlying 3D gene expression patterns in a systematic, objective manner. This enables the visualization and quantification of how the genotype translates into the phenotype during embryonic development, the comparison of normal and disease-altered patterns of genetic and phenotypic variation and, eventually, the identification of the origins of abnormal morphogenesis. This approach can further our understanding of the etiology of genetic diseases in research using animal models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Spradling et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rosenthal and Brown, 2007</xref>), even in models that do not seem to recapitulate the human disease faithfully (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Guénet, 2011</xref>).</p><p>Our study of the <italic>Fgfr2 P253R</italic> mouse model for Apert syndrome is an exemplary case demonstrating how quantitative assessment can overcome the shortcomings of traditional qualitative morphological assessment and lead to new discoveries. To date, the molecular and developmental mechanisms underlying the limb defects associated with Apert syndrome have remained obscure, even when these limb abnormalities clinically differentiate Apert syndrome from other craniosynostosis syndromes (such as Pfeiffer, Crouzon and Saethre-Chotzen syndromes) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Park et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Holten et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cohen and MacLean, 2000</xref>). Most Apert syndrome research has focused on premature fusion of cranial sutures and craniofacial malformations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cohen and MacLean, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Holmes et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Martínez-Abadías et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Holmes and Basilico, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hill et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Heuzé et al., 2014</xref>), clinical traits that are consistently phenocopied in mouse models. However, little research has been carried out on the limb defects in Apert syndrome using the same animal models, mainly because most previous research reported that malformations of the limbs are subtle or absent in the different mouse models for Apert syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wang et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wang et al., 2010</xref>). Contrary to these previous results, our quantitative morphometric analyses demonstrate that the limbs of <italic>Fgfr2<sup>+/P253R</sup></italic> Apert syndrome mice have significant defects that are detectable in newborn mice and that can be traced back to early embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).</p><p>Our analyses provide insight into the genetic origins of these limb defects, showing that altered expression patterns of genes in the Fgf signaling pathway precede and contribute to limb dysmorphogenesis in <italic>Fgfr2<sup>+/P253R</sup></italic> Apert syndrome mice. In fact, we detected that <italic>Dusp6</italic> expression patterns were different in unaffected and mutant littermates a few hours before the first limb dysmorphologies appeared (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), and confirmed that limb shape and <italic>Dusp6</italic> expression patterns were highly correlated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). The altered Fgf signaling that was observed was due to the <italic>Fgfr2</italic> P253R Apert syndrome mutation, which causes loss of ligand specificity of the receptor and increased affinity of ligands for Fgfr2. As the Apert syndrome mutation is located in the linker region between the second and the third Ig-like domains of the receptor, and as alternative splicing of the protein occurs in the carboxy-terminal half of IgIII domain, the mutation affects both isoforms of the receptor, Fgfr2IIIb and Fgfr2IIIc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ibrahimi et al., 2001</xref>). Fgfr2IIIb is the isoform that is predominantly expressed in epithelial cells which normally binds to ligands produced in mesenchymal cells, whereas Fgfr2IIIc is expressed in mesenchymal cells and binds to ligands produced in epithelial cells. The available evidence indicates that Apert mutations alter this ligand specificity and thus raise the level of Fgfr2 signaling — either through the aberrant interaction of mutant receptors with inappropriate ligands or through the upregulation of Fgfr2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hajihosseini, 2008</xref>) and unpublished data). Our analyses showed that over-activation of the Fgf signaling pathway results in more expanded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E–G</xref>) and larger (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>) expression domains for <italic>Dusp6</italic>, a gene that acts as a negative-feedback control of Fgf signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ekerot et al., 2008</xref>). A delay in misregulation of the expression of <italic>Dusp6</italic> may explain the lack of antero-posterior asymmetry and the shape deficiencies observed in <italic>Fgfr2<sup>+/P253R</sup></italic> mutant mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). We found evidence that limb shape and <italic>Dusp6</italic> expression were highly associated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C–E</xref>), but it is likely that other downstream genes of the Fgf signaling pathway also contribute to the limb shape malformations associated with Apert syndrome.</p><p>Our analyses also demonstrated that the embryonic limb defects persisted until birth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) and thus did not disappear during development. For instance, we found that <italic>Fgfr2<sup>+/P253R</sup></italic> Apert syndrome mice presented postnatal limb malformations involving the shape, length and volume of many bones of the forelimb, including the scapula, humerus, ulna, radius, metacarpals and phalanges (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). It is not possible, however, to correlate early changes in limb bud shape directly to the defects in chondrogenesis and long bone length that appear later in development. The skeletal defects associated with Apert syndrome are the result of continuous altered Fgf signaling throughout growth and development. Overall, activated Fgf signaling may lead to decreased bone growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Li et al., 2007</xref>). Our results demonstrate that <italic>Dusp6</italic> participates in this process, beginning very early in development, as do many other downstream targets of Fgf signaling that have different functions and spatio-temporal patterns, all of which are involved in the complex process that regulates limb morphogenesis. Although subtle, the first malformations detected in this study suggest that further research into the origins and causes of limb dysmorphologies in Apert syndrome using these and other mouse models is warranted.</p><p>Our quantitative approach could be similarly applied to investigate other developmental defects and dysmorphologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Winter and Baraitser, 1987</xref>). This is relevant as major developmental defects represent a leading cause of infant mortality and affect a small but relevant percentage of the population, severely compromising their quality of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Toxicology NRC C on D, 2000</xref>). OPT and GM can potentially be used to analyze any organ and animal model that can be visualized during development using light microscopy, and any gene whose gene expression pattern can be detected by WMISH and shows a continuous expression domain over development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Martínez-Abadías et al., 2016</xref>). Our study is a proof of concept that demonstrates that this approach is feasible and develops a protocol that could be adjusted for the study of different genes and organs. With the current pipeline, the implementation of the approach should be straightforward and no more time- or resource-consuming than other cellular or molecular experiments. WMISH labeling is a standard technique in most molecular and developmental laboratories. OPT imaging is increasingly accessible and software for performing GM is freely available.</p><p>We exemplified the method by analyzing limb defects in mouse models, but it could be applied to malformations affecting the face, the brain, the tail, or any other organ that involves complex 3D shapes that are quantifiable with GM. Organs with morphologies that are devoid of reliable anatomical landmarks, such as the developing heart, should be analyzed with alternative non-landmark-based methods, such as spherical harmonics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Shen et al., 2009</xref>). Moreover, the OPT-GM approach could be applied to other vertebrate animal models, such as zebrafish, chicken and <italic>Xenopus</italic>. Finally, our approach could also be extended to analyze protein expression patterns. Immunostaining labeling with a secondary antibody coupled to a BAAB-resistant fluorophore, such as Alexa, will reveal the expression pattern of proteins and this information can be precisely captured and quantified in 3D using the OPT-GM approach.</p><p>The limitation of the approach is the requirement to generate large samples of wildtype and mutant mice per gene and time point, since several WMISH labeling and OPT scanning activities cannot be performed within the same embryos. For high-throughput analyses assessing the expression of multiple genes, such as transcriptomic and microarray assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yeh et al., 2013</xref>), our OPT-GM approach is a complementary technique that could confirm whether the differences in the level of gene expression of candidate genes are associated with changes in the patterns of this expression (i.e. the regions within a tissue where the genes are expressed) and further phenotypic malformations. This type of quantitative analyses will lead to a deeper understanding of how development translates genetic into phenotypic variation.</p><p>Through its increased quantitative sensitivity, our method has allowed us to reveal that the mouse model for Apert syndrome does indeed show very early abnormalities in limb development. We detected that dysregulation of an <italic>Fgfr2</italic> target gene precedes measurable changes in limb bud morphology, thus identifying a relevant component of its genetic etiology. Quantitative evaluation of size and shape should thus be performed before discarding any animal models as useful for investigating human congenital malformations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zuniga et al., 2012</xref>). Our method has the potential to become a useful tool for biomedical research, providing insight into the processes that cause malformations and lead to malfunction, which is essential for understanding diseases and discovering potential therapies.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Genetic <break/>reagent <break/>(<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>Fgfr2<sup>+/P253R</sup></italic></td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wang et al., 2010</xref>; <break/>doi: 10.1186/1471 <break/>-213X-10–22</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Laboratory of Dr. Richtsmeier (Pennsylvania State University); inbred mouse model on a C57BL/6J background</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical <break/>compound, <break/>drug</td><td valign="top">PBST</td><td valign="top">Sigma-Aldrich</td><td valign="top">P3563</td><td valign="top">Phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% tween 20</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical <break/>compound, <break/>drug</td><td valign="top">paraformaldehyde</td><td valign="top">Sigma-Aldrich</td><td valign="top">P6148</td><td valign="top">4% in PBS</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical <break/>compound, <break/>drug</td><td valign="top">methanol</td><td valign="top">Sigma-Aldrich</td><td valign="top">494437–2L-D</td><td valign="top">Methanol for protein sequencing, bioReagent,99.93%</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical <break/>compound, <break/>drug</td><td valign="top">digoxigenin-UTP</td><td valign="top">Sigma-Aldrich</td><td valign="top">11277073910</td><td valign="top">DIG RNA Labeling Mix (Roche)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Sequence <break/>-based <break/>reagent</td><td valign="top"><italic>Dusp6</italic></td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dickinson et al.

Landmarks at the proximal and distal tips of the phalanges, metacarpals, radius, ulna and clavicle were collected to represent the simple tubular shape of these bones. Additional landmarks were collected in anatomical structures of the humerus and scapula to better represent their complex 3D shapes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–F</xref>).

We analyzed the maximum number of samples that we could process simultaneously within the same WMISH batch, as explained next.</p><p><italic>Dusp6</italic> gene expression was assessed by whole-mount-in-situ hybridization (WMISH). Mouse embryos were dissected in cold phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% tween 20 (PBST), fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde (Sigma), dehydrated in a graded PBST/methanol series and stored at –20°C in methanol. The mouse embryos recovered their original size after rehydration in decreasing series of methanol/PBST.

As <italic>Dusp6</italic> is expressed in a fuzzy spatial gradient, as already shown by other genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Martínez-Abadías et al., 2016</xref>), we used 3D multiple thresholding to visualize the gene expression domain at different intensities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). To analyze the gene expression domains comparatively across the samples, we inspected the whole range of threshold values under which the gene expression could be visualized for each limb, from the threshold showing its first appearance to the threshold under which it disappeared and was no longer detectable. We analyzed the 3D reconstruction on the basis of a threshold computed as 1/3 that of the last grey value showing the <italic>Dusp6</italic> expression domain, which displayed a <italic>Dusp6</italic> domain at high gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, step 3).

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Quantification of gene expression patterns to reveal the origins of abnormal morphogenesis&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by Marianne Bronner as the Senior Editor, a Reviewing Editor, and three reviewers. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Nele A Haelterman (Reviewer #1); Karen Lyons (Reviewer #2); Susan Brooks (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The reviewers and editors were enthusiastic about the optical projection techniques coupled with gene expression that should provide new insights with other mutant strains, although there was some question about how frequently this methodology could be employed in other laboratories. The method was clearly able to identify morphological anomalies earlier in development than previously recognized in the context of the <italic>Fgfr2</italic> mutation and the relationship of those changes to <italic>Dusp6</italic> expression. There were however some concerns which need to be discussed in the revision. In particular these were related to <italic>Dusp6</italic> functional data and the correlation with limb size. Other comments are noted below and should be addressed.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>Summary:</p><p>Revealing the pathogenic mechanism that causes a developmental disorder typically requires phenotypic characterization of model organisms that are mutant for the homolog of the causative human gene. When such mutation induces a subtle phenotype, it is quite challenging to identify the changes, making it practically impossible to tease out the underlying pathogenic mechanisms.</p><p>In the current manuscript, Martinez-Abadias et al. combine multiple methods (whole mount in situ hybridization, optical projection tomography and geometric morphometrics) to quantify subtle changes in the morphology and gene expression of <italic>Fgfr2<sup>+/P253R</sup></italic> mutant limb buds. Whereas previous studies failed to identify significant changes in limb development in these mutants, the method developed by Martinez-Abadias et al. allowed for a more in-depth analysis, revealing subtle, but significant changes between the limbs of <italic>Fgfr2<sup>+/P253R</sup></italic> mutants and their wildtype littermates. The authors next describe similar subtle, but significant changes in the expression pattern of a downstream target of the <italic>FGFR2: Dusp6</italic>.</p><p>This is a well-written manuscript that presents a novel method to quantify gene expression patterns in 3D. In my opinion, it provides a significant advance to the field, as it is not simple to quantify expression patterns and pinpoint changes in 3D, even if these changes are large.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) This is an interesting new technology to identify modest changes in morphology of a developing organ or body part. However, I am not convinced it is feasible to perform these experiments at a higher throughput to analyze the expression pattern of multiple genes and be able to truly dissect out which genes have altered expression patterns in a mutant. The method appears to be quite labor intensive. Does one need to limit themselves to analyzing one or two candidate genes whose expression is already thought to be altered? Currently, the authors show a proof of concept of one gene. Could the authors comment on the time it took or would take to analyze the expression pattern of a novel gene, assuming the WISH is already optimized?</p><p>2) The authors reveal an expansion of the <italic>Dusp6</italic> expression domain in developing mutant limb buds and show a high correlation between the shape of the limb and the shape of the <italic>Dusp6</italic> domain. However, based on the presented data, the statement that &quot;This is evidence that altered <italic>Fgf</italic> signaling induced by the <italic>Fgfr2</italic> P253R Apert syndrome mutation will have a direct effect on the limb phenotype” (subsection “Altered <italic>Dusp6</italic> expression and limb dysmorphology are highly associated”) is an overstatement. The authors show a correlation, but to definitively show that altered <italic>Dusp6</italic> expression and/or <italic>Fgf</italic> signaling is causative, functional data is required. Does normalizing the <italic>Dusp6</italic> expression domain, or normalizing <italic>FGFR2</italic> function in these mutant mice rescue the observed phenotypes? If the authors have such data, it should be added to the manuscript. If not, this statement should be toned down in subsection “Altered <italic>Dusp6</italic> expression and limb dysmorphology are highly associated” and elsewhere in the manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>This manuscript describes the use of optical projection tomography (OPT) and geometric morphometrics (GM) to address one of the biggest challenges in relating genotype to phenotypic outcome. I am not an expert on OPT or GM, and cannot evaluate the technical details in this manuscript. However, this group has done foundational studies in this area, described the methodology in detail, and has provided all source data. This will enable other groups to replicate the analysis and compare it with other methods in the future.</p><p>There are other studies using both GM and OPT from this group and others. Experts in these techniques will need to weigh in on the technical novelty in this manuscript. The conceptual novelty here is to apply these methodologies to quantify and changes in gene expression and relate these to changes in form. The analysis assesses variation within a genotype and relates this to variation in stages of development. This is powerful. The analysis also firmly establishes differences in gene expression and form based on <italic>FGFR2</italic>genotype. Neither of these insights are possible using standard histological or morphological analysis, and from my limited knowledge, is a serious challenge even for experts in quantitative 3D analysis. Therefore, this report is an important demonstration. The results demonstrate that effects on <italic>Dusp6</italic> expression can be seen in limb buds of <italic>Fgfr2 P253R</italic> mice. This is an interesting and important finding. It is also highly plausible. It opens the door to finding how the expression domain of <italic>FGFR2</italic> in normal and mutant limb buds intersects with that of <italic>Dusp6</italic>. It is less clear how, or if, these early changes in limb bud shape relate to the defects in chondrogenesis and long bone length, since <italic>FGFR2</italic> is continuously expressed in skeletal tissues.</p><p>The data are extensive and clearly presented, even to this reviewer, who does not have expertise with the types of analysis that are employed. Some of the data in the figures are replicated in the supplemental figures, but this is helpful to follow the logic. While the typical laboratory would not be able to establish this methodology, the study could inspire very insightful collaborations, and should inform the larger publicly supported efforts to catalog both gene expression and mutant phenotypes.</p><p>In summary, the main value of the study lies in its promise as a methodology to quantify gene expression changes and relate these to subtle morphological outcomes.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>The manuscript describes an application of a new methodology correlating spatially mapped quantitative gene expression data with shape changes to examine the development of skeletal abnormalities. Specifically, mice possessing a mutation in the <italic>Fgfr2</italic> gene were analyzed for forelimb development and expression of <italic>Dusp6</italic>, a target of <italic>Fgf</italic> signaling. The method was able to identify morphological anomalies earlier in development than previously recognized in the context of the <italic>Fgfr2</italic> mutation and the relationship of those changes to <italic>Dusp6</italic> expression.</p><p>The paper is well-written and the data are clearly presented. Clarification of some methods and additional discussion of a few points would improve the manuscript.</p><p>How were the landmarks on the forelimb bones chosen? Are these defined elsewhere or did the authors choose them for this work specifically? In the latter case, what provided the rationale for the choices? Similarly, please describe how the markers for the limb and gene landmarking were determined.</p><p>Subsection “Altered <italic>Dusp6</italic> expression and limb dysmorphology are highly associated”. The authors characterize the correlations between <italic>Dusp6</italic> expression and limb size as moderate, but the R2 values indicate that ~50% of the variation in limb size is explained by <italic>Dusp6</italic> expression. This actually seems quite large for a single gene. In the same discussion, the authors describe <italic>Dusp6</italic> gene expression's dependency on limb size. Is the directionality of the relationship from size to <italic>Dusp6</italic> expression or is it changes in <italic>Dusp6</italic> expression that partially determine limb size?</p><p>Discussion section. The authors indicated that the approach could be similarly applied to other developmental defects in other organ systems. A discussion of which tissues or organs are particular amenable to this method or may be particularly problematic would be an interesting addition.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36405.032</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The reviewers and editors were enthusiastic about the optical projection techniques coupled with gene expression that should provide new insights with other mutant strains, although there was some question about how frequently this methodology could be employed in other laboratories.</p></disp-quote><p>We really appreciate all the positive feedback from the editors and reviewers and we are glad to share their enthusiasm.

We agree with the reviewer that once we have demonstrated the potential of the method, the next step would be to leverage the method to perform higher throughput analyses. The current method should be readily extended to other organs, genes and/or species provided that their shapes are well-defined with at least some reliably recognizable landmarks, and the genes can be labeled by WMISH (Martínez-Abadías et al., 2016).</p><p>The bottleneck is, however, the generation of so many mouse embryos to achieve large wildtype and mutant mouse samples per gene and time point. Unfortunately, it is technically not possible to perform several WMISH labeling and OPT scanning within the same embryos. Therefore, rather than using the OPT-GM method as an exploratory technique to analyze the expression pattern of myriad of genes, it is more plausible to use the OPT-GM as a method to confirm whether the expression patterns of candidate genes that have been identified using other molecular techniques, such as transcriptomics, are altered and can be associated with phenotypic malformations. This type of quantitative analyses is the only way that will lead to a deeper understanding of how development translates genetic into phenotypic variation. This knowledge will be essential in the future for understanding diseases and discovering potential therapies that can be introduced just before the first alterations appear. This issue is further discussed now in the main text of the manuscript.

Now that the experimentation, imaging, segmentation and landmark processing of the samples have all been optimized, and are explained in full detail in the paper, a similar sample as the one used in this study could be processed in several weeks. The number of genes to be assessed will depend on the intrinsic nature of the investigation and the available resources.</p><p>One of the main apparent difficulties to implement the OPT-GM method might be the lack of familiarity with Geometric Morphometrics (GM) within the Developmental Biology field. However, GM is currently used in many laboratories to analyze the patterns of morphological variation in all types of organisms (Klingenberg, 2010). Thanks to the growing interest in this technique, many resources are available to learn and perform GM studies (http://life.bio.sunysb.edu/morph/index.html). Actually, all the analyses in this study have been performed using freely available software and scripts that were rewritten to automatize the process, as for example <italic>Fiji</italic> (Fiji is just ImageJ) and R packages especially suited to GM, such as geomorph.</p><p>An extended discussion on these issues can be found at the following link:</p><p>https://prelights.biologists.com/highlights/quantification-gene-expression-patterns-reveal-origins-abnormal-morphogenesis/</p><p>This issue has been dealt with in the text in the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors reveal an expansion of the Dusp6 expression domain in developing mutant limb buds and show a high correlation between the shape of the limb and the shape of the Dusp6 domain.

Indeed, the skeletal defects associated with Apert syndrome are the result of continuous altered <italic>FGF/FGF</italic>R signaling throughout growth and development. However, this was not the goal of our study – our goal was to determine whether we could find subtle early changes in gene expression (and limb bud shape) before any phenotype could be detected by eye. Our results demonstrate that our method is able to identify the first moment in which limb malformation and altered <italic>Dusp6</italic> expression arises. However, our results do not imply that limb dysmorphologies are caused only by altered expression of <italic>Dusp6</italic> in E10.5. Besides <italic>Dusp6</italic>, many other downstream targets of <italic>Fgf</italic> signaling must be involved in this complex process regulating limb morphogenesis.

Are these defined elsewhere or did the authors choose them for this work specifically? In the latter case, what provided the rationale for the choices? Similarly, please describe how the markers for the limb and gene landmarking were determined.</p></disp-quote><p>The landmarks on the forelimb bones were chosen by us for this work specifically following anatomical criteria to best describe their size and shape in a reliable and reproducible manner. Indeed, one of the main advantages of GM is that each study is unique and can be personalized to meet the requirements of the analysis. The set of landmarks used to capture the shape of the object/organism under study is always chosen by the investigators. The definitions of many anatomical landmarks can be found in the literature, but additional new landmarks can be used by the researchers whenever a clear definition is provided to ensure the reproducibility of the study. Below we provide further explanation about how we chose our set of landmarks.</p><p>For the hand, clavicle and forearm bones (radius and ulna), as they present simple tubular shapes, we just collected the landmarks at the proximal and distal tips of the bones, as shown in Figure 1 and explained in the figure legend. From the 3D coordinates of these landmarks, we could estimate total bone length by applying the Pythagorean Theorem. In the case of the humerus, besides the landmarks at the proximal and distal tips, we also collected a landmark at the tip of the deltoid process, which is an additional readily recognizable feature of this bone. Finally, in the case of the scapula, which presents a more complex 3D shape, we captured its morphology by precisely registering the 3D coordinates of points defined by anatomical structures of the scapula, such as the spine, the acromion process and the glenoid cavity.</p><p>In GM, this type of homologous anatomical landmarks are the basis of a rigorous quantitative shape analysis. Anatomical landmarks can be combined with the so-called semilandmarks, which are points located along a curve or a surface that can be slid to corresponding equally spaced locations (Gunz, Mitteroecker, and Bookstein, 2005). This is an approach widely applied in structures presenting few homologous landmarks. As only five landmarks were discernable in the limb, and four in the <italic>Dusp6</italic> expression pattern, we defined several curves and surfaces over the limb and gene expression structures to precisely capture the subtle morphological changes associated with the Apert syndrome mutation. The number of semilandmarks is also chosen by the investigators, usually compromising between a good shape coverage and minimizing the high dimensionality of the data. Further details are provided in Figure 5—figure supplement 1. We have added some explanations regarding these topics in Materials and methods subsection “Morphometrics from E10 to E11.5”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Subsection “Altered Dusp6 expression and limb dysmorphology are highly associated”. The authors characterize the correlations between Dusp6 expression and limb size as moderate, but the R2 values indicate that ~50% of the variation in limb size is explained by Dusp6 expression. This actually seems quite large for a single gene. In the same discussion, the authors describe Dusp6 gene expression's dependency on limb size. Is the directionality of the relationship from size to Dusp6 expression or is it changes in Dusp6 expression that partially determine limb size?</p></disp-quote><p>Our results indicate that there is significant correlation between the limb morphology and the expression of <italic>Dusp6</italic>. However, we cannot conclude that the altered <italic>Dusp6</italic> expression causes the limb defects of Apert syndrome. The limb dysmorphology is likely the result of altered <italic>Fgf</italic> signaling that affects many downstream targets, including <italic>Dusp6</italic>, each with different functions and spatio-temporal patterns. With this method we can identify when phenotype and genetic alterations first appear and whether they are associated or independent from each other. However, we cannot quantify which percentage of the dysmorphology is due to an altered gene expression. We have added a sentence in the Discussion to more clearly explain this issue.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Discussion section. The authors indicated that the approach could be similarly applied to other developmental defects in other organ systems. A discussion of which tissues or organs are particular amenable to this method or may be particularly problematic would be an interesting addition.</p></disp-quote><p>The approach is indeed powerful and adaptable to other organs and model systems. The main limitation is the availability of gene probes to perform WMISH and the intrinsic shape of the organ and the gene expression domain to perform GM. Geometric Morphometrics is based on the location of at least a few points that can be reliably located in all the samples. Thus, GM is difficult to apply in structures such as the developing heart, which in its first stages is just a twisting tube. GM is particularly amenable to more complex 3D shapes, such as the facial prominences, the brain and the limbs. In addition, it could be applied in different animals’ models, such as zebra fish, chicken and<italic>Xenopus.</italic></p><p>We hope other investigators will apply our approach and discovering new processes and mechanisms that cannot simply by detected qualitatively by eye. Whole mount in situ hybridization (WMISH) is a technique that is already in use in most molecular labs around the world. Many groups may already have data on gene expression patterns ready to be quantified. Geometric morphometrics (GM) is also a discipline within everyone’s reach, with a long history, plenty of available resources, user-friendly free software and a big community of users (www.morphometrics.org).
