In this study, we demonstrate a new role for eEF1A: it participates in the entire process of the heat shock response (HSR) in mammalian cells from transcription through translation. Upon stress, isoform 1 of eEF1A rapidly activates transcription of HSP70 by recruiting the master regulator HSF1 to its promoter. eEF1A1 then associates with elongating RNA polymerase II and the 3′UTR of HSP70 mRNA, stabilizing it and facilitating its transport from the nucleus to active ribosomes. eEF1A1-depleted cells exhibit severely impaired HSR and compromised thermotolerance. In contrast, tissue-specific isoform 2 of eEF1A does not support HSR. By adjusting transcriptional yield to translational needs, eEF1A1 renders HSR rapid, robust, and highly selective; thus, representing an attractive therapeutic target for numerous conditions associated with disrupted protein homeostasis, ranging from neurodegeneration to cancer.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03164.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03164.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03164.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Living cells must be able to withstand changes in the environment. For example, if there is a sudden increase in temperature—which could damage proteins or other molecules—most cells can respond with the ‘heat shock response’. In humans and other mammals, a single protein called heat shock factor 1 triggers the production of numerous heat shock proteins that protect the cell from the detrimental effects of high temperatures. Most heat shock proteins protect cells by binding to, and stabilizing, other molecules in the cell; this prevents these molecules from being damaged or from aggregating and allows them to continue to function as normal.</p><p>A protein called eEF1A1 is involved in the final stages of protein production and also enhances the function of heat shock factor 1 during the heat shock response. To make a protein, an enzyme called RNA polymerase transcribes DNA in the nucleus of the cell into a messenger RNA molecule that then exits the nucleus and binds to a ribosome. This molecular machine then translates the messenger RNA sequence into a protein by joining together individual building blocks called amino acids in the correct order. Like other elongation factors, eEF1A1 helps to select the amino acids that match the sequence of the messenger RNA template. However, it was unclear how eEF1A1 helped to protect cells during the heat shock response.</p><p>Nudler et al. have now engineered cells—from humans and mice—that make less of the eEF1A1 protein than normal. These cells had enough of this protein to support their growth and development under normal conditions, but not enough to help during the heat shock response. When these cells are subjected to a sudden increase in temperature, they fail to produce a sufficient amount of major heat shock proteins. Heat shock factor 1 is needed to transcribe the genes that encode these heat shock proteins, and Nudler et al. found that eEF1A1 must bind to heat shock factor 1 and then to a moving RNA polymerase for these genes to be transcribed efficiently. Moreover, the eEF1A1 protein was shown to bind to and stabilize the heat shock proteins' messenger RNAs, and aid their export from the nucleus and their binding to the ribosome.</p><p>These newly discovered roles for eEF1A1 during the heat shock response highlight this elongation factor as a promising drug target for treating diseases where protein folding goes awry, for example in Alzheimer's or Parkinson's disease. In adults, neurons do not make enough eEF1A1, and Nudler et al. suggest that enabling these cells to make more of this protein could help to treat a range of neurodegenerative conditions.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03164.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03164.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>transcription factor</kwd><kwd>RNA stability</kwd><kwd>nuclear export</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nudler</surname><given-names>Evgeny</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vera</surname><given-names>Maria</given-names></name><name><surname>Pani</surname><given-names>Bibhusita</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1A1 controls the process of heat shock response, from transcriptional activation of the HSP70 gene, to HSP70 mRNA stabilization, nuclear export, and translation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>All organisms respond to environmental stress by activating genes that encode molecular chaperones and other cytoprotective heat shock proteins (HSPs) in a process known as the heat shock response (HSR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lindquist and Craig, 1988</xref>). In mammalian cells, HSR is regulated at the level of transcription by the heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Guertin and Lis, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anckar and Sistonen, 2011</xref>). In coordination with their augmented transcription, the stability, transport, and translation of HSP mRNAs (especially HSP70) are sharply increased during HSR, accounting for the robust production of HSPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Theodorakis and Morimoto, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zhao et al., 2002</xref>). HSP70 is the best-studied example, which is among the most inducible HSPs in terms of promptness and robustness of the response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Theodorakis and Morimoto, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lindquist and Craig, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cuesta et al., 2000</xref>). The mechanism of such a rapid and synchronized reaction to stress remains unknown, but is particularly remarkable considering that upon stress, the majority of other genes are inhibited at the level of transcription, RNA export, and translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Laroia et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gallouzi et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mariner et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Our previous in vitro studies demonstrated that translation elongation factor eEF1A enhances the binding of HSF1 to a DNA containing an artificial HSE sequence via a mechanism that requires a non-coding RNA (<italic>HSR1</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Shamovsky et al., 2006</xref>). eEF1A1 has a well-defined role in protein synthesis, it delivers aminoacylated tRNAs to the A site of ribosome during translation elongation in a GTP-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mateyak and Kinzy, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Li et al., 2013</xref>). While the majority of eEF1A1 associates with the cytoplasmic cytoskeleton and translational machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ejiri, 2002</xref>), eEF1A1 is able to enter the nucleus to mediate the export of tRNAs and SNAG-containing proteins under normal growth conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bohnsack et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Calado et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mingot et al., 2013</xref>). Also, eEF1A can directly bind mammalian mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Liu et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mickleburgh et al., 2006</xref>) and mediate stability of viral and cellular RNAs by binding to their 3′ regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yan et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Li et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>eEF1A expression in mammalian cells happens in one of two isoforms, eEF1A1 and eEF1A2. These two isoforms are 98% similar at the amino acid level and share the same canonical function. Each isoform is the product of expression of a specific locus and shows a distinct expression pattern except in transformed cells, which express both. While the majority of cells express eEF1A1 isoform, adult neuronal and muscle cells express eEF1A2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Newbery et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abbott et al., 2009</xref>). In this study, we report that eEF1A1 isoform, but not the tissue-specific variant eEF1A2 is required for the HSP70 induction during heat shock. It mediates transcription-activation of HSP70 mRNA, its stability, transport, and translation, thereby synchronizing HSP70 transcriptional output to translational needs.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Transcription of HSPs genes is impaired in cells knocked down for eEF1A1</title><p>To determine the role of eEF1A1 in HSR in vivo, we designed a strategy for its selective and efficient knockdown without compromising overall translation and cell viability. eEF1A is one of the most abundant cellular proteins, compromising 1–3% of total cytosolic proteins, and is present in large excess to its protein synthesis partners (molar ratios for eEF1A:eEF1B and eEF1A:ribosomes of 10:1 and 25:1 respectively) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Slobin, 1980</xref>). Therefore, a ∼70% knockdown of eEF1A1 did not compromise cell viability under non-stress conditions and overall translation under control or mild-heat shock conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). The levels of eEF1A1 and HSF1 (positive control), but not those of GAPDH, were greatly reduced after efficient transfection of human breast cancer cells (MDA-MB231), primary human fibroblasts (WI38), immortalized mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEFs), or mouse NSC34 motor spinal cord/neuroblastoma fusion cells, with specific and un-related sets of siRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> [siRNA pair A], <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref> [siRNA pair B], <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A,B</xref> [siRNA C]). After heat shock, knock down of eEF1A1 (∼30% of control remaining) or HSF1, (&lt;25% of control remaining), markedly reduced the induction of HSP70 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A,B</xref>) and HSP27 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure1—figure supplement 3C</xref>), and resulted in loss of thermo-tolerance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). To rule out the possibility that the loss of induction of HSPs in eEF1A1-deficient cells was potentially due to overall compromised translation, de novo protein synthesis was analyzed in a pulse-chase experiment with [35S]-methionine. We observed a general decrease in protein synthesis after HS, but no significant difference between mock-transfected cells and cells depleted of either HSF1 or eEF1A1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Consistently, HSP70 and HSP27 mRNA levels were significantly decreased in eEF1A1-knocked down heat-shocked cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3D,E</xref>). Impaired mRNA induction upon heat shock due to eEF1A1 deficiency was observed for several classes of HSP genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure1—figure supplement 3F</xref>). It is known that HSP70 mRNA induction occurs upon chemical inhibition of translation. To verify that the action of eEF1A1 is independent of its role in translation inhibition, we tested eEF1A1 knockdown conditions in combination with inhibitors of translation elongation. eEF1A1-depleted cells treated with the HSR-stimulating inhibitors of translation, cycloheximide (CHX) or doxycycline (DOX) failed to accumulate HSP70 mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3G</xref>). In contrast, knocking down eEF1A2 isoform had no effect on HSP70 mRNA induction or protein amount (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4A,B</xref>). These results demonstrate that isoform 1 of eEF1A specifically controls HSPs gene expression irrespective of its role in translation.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03164.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>eEF1A1 regulates HSP70 expression and thermotolerance.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Knock down of eEF1A1 decreases HSP70 protein expression upon heat shock.

To test this, we placed the luciferase ORF, with or without the HSP70 3′UTR, under regulation of the SV40 or HSP70 promoter. Upon heat shock, only the presence of both the HSP70 promoter and 3′UTR resulted in a steep decrease of luciferase activity in eEF1A1-knocked down cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). In contrast, when HSP70 containing its 3′UTR was expressed from an SV40 promoter, no decay was evident. This supports the model that eEF1A1-mediated mRNA stabilization resulted from the recruitment of eEF1A1 during transcription and its subsequent association with the 3′UTR.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>eEF1A1 facilitates HSP70 mRNA nuclear export</title><p>It is well established that export of non-HSP RNAs is inhibited during HS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Carmody et al., 2010</xref>).

We have found that although the expression of HSP70 during heat shock is synchronized, not all the cells respond with the same intensity at the same time. Indeed, induction of HSP70 transcription within the TSs of the same cell is stochastic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5B,C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). Nonetheless, most cells switched from almost undetectable levels of HSP70 mRNA under non-stress conditions to a massive induction of transcription from 30 to 60 min of heat shock, when mRNA can also be detected in the cytoplasm. Although the stimulus persisted, transcription ends at 2 hr of heat-shock. At this time point the majority of HSP70 mRNA is located in the cytoplasm. Our results suggest that eEF1A1 tags HSP70 mRNA during its transcription to ensure its rapid and efficient translation in contrast to non-HSP mRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).

Prior to stress, eEF1A1 resides mostly in the cytoplasm where it is an essential component of the translation machinery (top left quadrant). Upon heat shock (bottom left quadrant), a fraction of eEF1A1 is detected in the HSP70 locus where it recruits HSF1 to an HSP70 promoter, thus activating transcription. eEF1A1 interacts with elongating RNAP II and binds the 3′UTR of HSP70 mRNA to stabilize the transcript and to export it to cytoplasm for efficient translation. By synchronizing all the major steps of HSP70 gene expression, eEF1A1 renders the process of HSR exceptionally robust and coordinated. In cells knocked down for eEF1A1 HSP70 remain at low levels even when cells are stressed (right hand quadrants).</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03164.021">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03164.021</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-03164-fig6-v1.tif"/></fig></p><p>eEF1A1 delivers aminoacylated tRNAs to the A site of ribosome during translation elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Li et al., 2013</xref>).

Although it is possible that binding of eEF1A1 to HSP70 mRNA can be independent of transcription elongation, the association of eEF1A1 with RNAPII (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>) may facilitate relocation of eEF1A1 from the promoter to the 3′UTR of HSP mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4D</xref>) and thus may be crucial for the stability and transport of HSP mRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4 fig5">Figures 4 and 5</xref>).</p><p>The stability of HSP70 mRNA sharply increases upon stress via a highly conserved mechanism involving <italic>cis</italic>-acting AU rich elements (ARE) in the 3′UTR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Theodorakis and Morimoto, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zhao et al., 2002</xref>).

Also, PKR (double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase) plays a significant role in stabilizing HSP70 mRNA upon stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zhao et al., 2002</xref>). eEF1A1 binds directly to the 3′UTR of HSP70 mRNA during heat shock (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

The interaction of eEF1A1 with <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors, such as AUF1 and PABP1, as well as the phosphorylation and/or methylation status of eEF1A1 in response to different stimuli is likely to determine the stability of specific mRNAs and the interaction of eEF1A1 with HSP70 mRNA. It is also possible that PKR influences the stability of HSP70 mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zhao et al., 2002</xref>) via phosphorylation of eEF1A1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Xue et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Once HSP mRNAs have been properly processed they must be promptly exported from the nucleus to ribosomes in the cytoplasm.

After the center position of TS spots in each channel were identified in 3-dimensional space, colocalization events were assigned when the distances between the closest spot of different colors were within two pixels.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Values were expressed as standard error mean (SEM).

Your full submission has been evaluated by James Manley (Senior editor) and 2 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the decision was reached after discussions between the reviewers. As you will see in the reviews below, both reviewers raised a number of substantive issues that we feel precludes publication of the current version of your manuscript. Revisions for <italic>eLife</italic> papers are intended to be performed within 2-3 months and we believe that the amount of experimentation required to fully address the reviewers' comment will take more than that amount of time. However, <italic>eLife</italic> would be willing to consider a re-submitted manuscript that fully addresses the reviewers' comments.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript Vera et al. report a new role for the translation elongation factor eEF1A in the heat shock response. They find that eEF1A acts at multiple steps in expression of heat shock proteins. First, they show that eEF1A binds to heat shock genes, such as HSP70, and helps recruit the heat shock transcription factor HSF1 to the promoter. They further show that eEF1A is associated with RNA POL II and the 3' UTR of HSP70 mRNA, stabilizing and facilitating it for nuclear transport and ultimately to active ribosomes.</p><p>The following issues should be addressed prior to publication.</p><p>1) In RNAi experiments such as those performed in this manuscript, it is essential to show that similar results are obtained using two unrelated siRNAs (or shRNAs) against the same target gene to rule out off-target effects. Ideally, this should be done for all experiments in the manuscript, but minimally this needs to be done for the key experiments in the manuscript from which the main conclusions are drawn.</p><p>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>. It would be nice to see the results minus and plus heat shock.</p><p>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>. Have the authors performed these in vitro DNA binding experiments with purified HSF and eEF1A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> uses only purified eEF1A).</p><p>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>. Isn't the fold-increase following heat-shock expected to be larger? Is there a comparable experiment for HSF1?</p><p>5) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>.

It would be nice to see the eEF1A binding site in the 3' UTR further localized.</p><p>10) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>. It is not clear why the promoter is needed here. Doesn't the in vitro RNA binding data of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> show that eEF1A can recognize and bind directly to the 3' UTR?</p><p>11) For several of the panels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3 fig4 fig5">Figure 3D, 4A, 5E</xref>) statistics need to be provided.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The manuscript by Vera et al claims the translation factor eEF1A participates at multiple steps in the human and mouse heat shock response (HSR): recruiting the HSF1 regulator to the promoter, associating with elongating Pol II and the 3'UTR of HSp70 mRNA, stabilizing the mRNA, and facilitating its export from the nucleus and to active ribosomes. These extraordinary claims, which in effect state that, “eEF1A orchestrates the entire heat shock response”, require extraordinary evidence. The authors provide a lot of experimental results in their effort to support all of these eEF1A1 functions. Some experiments are well-controlled and show reasonably convincing effects. Others are much less convincing.</p><p>How can a single 50 kDa factor do all of this? I am concerned that other general mechanisms, which do not require a direct mechanistic role in each of these very specific steps, might account for the numerous effects seen. Could the depletion of such a super abundant protein (1-3% of total cytosolic proteins) lead to general pleiotropic effects that make general cellular mechanisms sluggish? eEF1A1 is also known to have chaperone function (see J. Biol. Chem. 2007, 282:4076), and its depletion might have a broad array of effects including those seen here. The previously documented role of eEF1A1 by this group as having a role in trimerization and activation of HSF1 could be consistent with such a chaperone role. These general concerns and the lack of a mapping of specific functions to distinct parts or mutations of the protein, lead me to the view that this grand view of eEF1A is too ambitious for a single paper and for the data in hand. This is already a bulky paper and it may be better suited being published as a couple of more focused papers in more specialized journals than <italic>eLife</italic>. However, publication either in <italic>eLife</italic> or elsewhere requires addressing these general concerns and specific concerns below:</p><p>Specific concerns:</p><p>1) The claim that translation is not affected by knockdown of eEF1A1 is not adequately supported by the data. The authors show that total translation is unaffected in cells where eEF1A1 was reduced to ∼35% of normal levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure1–figure supplement 1A</xref>). The heat shock for this experiment was done at 40C instead of 43C. All the other experiments were done at full heat shock temperatures 43C or 45C. The 40C appears not to be a typo, because, under their 40C heat shock, there is not the change in protein patterns expected for a normal heat shock. A broad effect on general translation in full heat shock conditions caused by.eEF1A1 could lead to reduced HSPs.</p><p>2) With no standard curve to show their Western assays are linear, it is inappropriate to ascribe the accuracy implied by a statement “knock down of eEF1A1 &lt;38%” and in other numbers in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and supplemental figures.

If there are bars in proportion to the measurement of eEF1A1, then are the differences as significant as the authors’ state?</p><p>5) With eEF1A1 being so abundant, can many of the interactions observed with other proteins and RNAs in the cell be non-specific or low affinity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C-F</xref>). Perhaps more quantification and use of other proteins as controls that are similarly abundant would help.</p><p>6) In the binding of eEF1A1 to Hsp70 RNA, a single high concentration of protein is used. A binding curve and estimate of the Kd should be provided, if this is claimed to be an RNA binder.</p><p>7) It was recently reported that inhibition of translation inactivates Hsf1 (Santagata et al. Science, 2013). If the translation is found to be compromised in eEF1A1 knockdown cells, then many observations reported in this manuscript can be explained by the possibility of unaccounted effect of eEF1A1 knockdown in inactivation of Hsf1 and hence, attenuation of Hsp70 and other heat shock proteins expression upon heat shock.</p><p>8) Finally, is the proposed role of eEF1A1 in recruitment and activation of Hsf1 limited to major Heat Shock Protein genes or is it much broader and applicable for all Hsf1 regulated genes? Evidence exists for Hsf1 regulating expression of genes other than HSPs (Trinklein et al., 2004 &amp; Mendilli et al., 2012) and I think it would be quite informative, if authors could include few of these genes and examine the role of eEF1A1 knockdown in their induction upon heat shock.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what now follows is the decision letter after the authors submitted for further consideration.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled “eEF1A1 couples HSP70 transcription to translation during heat shock response” for further consideration at <italic>eLife.</italic> Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by James Manley (Senior editor), a member of the Board of Reviewing Editors, and an outside expert. The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below.</p><p>The authors have addressed or clarified many of the concerns of the reviewers. The remaining concerns need to be addressed, but they can probably be dealt with by textual revisions.</p><p>1) The previous Impact Statement stated “eEF1A1 orchestrates the entire process of the heat shock response, from transcription activation of HSP70 gene, to HSP70 mRNA stabilization, nuclear export, and translation”. I apologize for abbreviating this to “eEF1A orchestrates the entire heat shock response”. The current Impact Statement now is “eEF1A1 orchestrates the process of heat shock response, from transcription activation of the HSP70 gene, to HSP70 mRNA stabilization, nuclear export, and translation”. The word “entire” is now deleted, which helps, but this is still an overstatement, especially considering the complexity of the heat shock response. First, the “process of the heat shock response” is too broad, as this study focuses on Hsp70. Second, the work “orchestrates” gives eEF1A1 a status of a major regulator like HSF1. While the paper provides data supporting an eEF1A1 contribution to the Hsp70 heat shock response at multiple stages, this factor has not acquired the regulatory support of an Hsf1, which has been demonstrated to have more than 10 times larger effects than those reported here on transcription (and protein production) of major heat shock genes.</p><p>2) The incomplete binding curve of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, which does not show saturation, is only able to provide an upper estimate of eEF1A1 affinity for Hsp70 promoter of &gt;300nM. So eEF1A1 is a very weak binder relative to a typical sequence specific DNA binding factor, which would be useful to emphasize for the reader. I agree that there seems to be some specificity from various controls, and the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4,S1B</xref> helps.</p><p>3) While the data support the conclusion that KD of eEF1A1 causes a ∼2-fold decrease in Hsp70 mRNA and a striking decrease in nuclear export, the case made for eEF1A1 having a role on loading Hsp70 mRNA on polysomes is considerably weaker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). The effect on Hsp70 mRNA in polysomes could be a consequence of lower cytoplasmic Hsp70 mRNA, and the difference between light and heavy is modest especially when considering error bars. Therefore, the authors should drop or tone down the conclusion that eEF1A1 affects Hsp70 translation.</p><p>4) It's interesting that, with eEF1A1 affecting significantly so many processes in Hsp70 expression, the overall reduction in Hsp70 protein is only about 70% of the si:NT control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1,S2A</xref>). The authors should discuss this quantitatively and evaluate what this may mean about mechanisms governing this multistep pathway.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03164.024</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the first round of peer review follow.]</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p><italic>[…] The following issues should be addressed prior to publication</italic>.</p><p><italic>1) In RNAi experiments such as those performed in this manuscript, it is essential to show that similar results are obtained using two unrelated siRNAs (or shRNAs) against the same target gene to rule out off-target effects.

The fold increase of HSF1 is greater than that of eEF1A1. One possible explanation is that the occupancy of HSF1 on the HSP70 locus is restricted to the promoter at the HSE element. In the case of eEF1A, the fold-increase is observed throughout the HSP70 locus rather than at a restricted, discrete region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3–figure supplement 4B</xref>).

These extraordinary claims, which in effect state that, “eEF1A orchestrates the entire heat shock response”, require extraordinary evidence. The authors provide a lot of experimental results in their effort to support all of these eEF1A1 functions. Some experiments are well-controlled and show reasonably convincing effects. Others are much less convincing</italic>.</p><p>In the current manuscript we focus on HSP70 (Title: eEF1A1 couples HSP70 transcription to translation during the heat shock response); we do not state anywhere that “eEF1A1 orchestrates the entire heat shock response” as quoted by the reviewer.

As we indicate in the Discussion (end of paragraph 1), only a few factors have been shown to determine the ultimate fate of mRNAs. They have been described only in yeast, are not related to HSR, and are also known to perform other cellular functions.</p><p><italic>I am concerned that other general mechanisms, which do not require a direct mechanistic role in each of these very specific steps, might account for the numerous effects seen. Could the depletion of such a super abundant protein (1-3% of total cytosolic proteins) lead to general pleiotropic effects that make general cellular mechanisms sluggish</italic>?</p><p>eEF1A1 is indeed highly abundant. However, the nuclear fraction of eEF1A1, which is responsible for the effects we reported in the manuscript, is small. We show that depletion of eEF1A1 only affects heat shock genes (transcription activation, mRNA stability, and transport), and not other unrelated genes or processes. We also show that depletion of the second isoform of eEF1A (which is 95% identical to eEF1A1 and can clearly fulfill, by itself, the translational requirements of a cell as it is the only eEF1A isoform expressed in muscle cells and neurons) does not have any effect on HSR. This second isoform is highly expressed in various cancer cell lines, including HeLa and NSC34 - cells, which we used in the current study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1–figure supplement 3</xref>) to demonstrate that knock down of EF1A2, which has the same general properties as eEF1A1 with respect to translation, both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>, does not alter the HSR.</p><p><italic>eEF1A1 is also known to have chaperone function (see J.

Biol. Chem. 2007, 282:4076). We don’t believe this is damaging to our conclusions, and, indeed, we agree that eEF1A does function as a chaperone in promoting HSF1 trimerization, as proposed in our earlier report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Shamovsky et al., 2006</xref>). However, the additional functions of eEF1A1 that we currently describe with respect to HSR cannot be explained by the same chaperone activity.</p><p><italic>These general concerns and the lack of a mapping of specific functions to distinct parts or mutations of the protein, lead me to the view that this grand view of eEF1A is too ambitious for a single paper and for the data in hand. This is already a bulky paper and it may be better suited being published as a couple of more focused papers in more specialized journals than eLife. However, publication either in eLife or elsewhere requires addressing these general concerns and specific concerns below</italic>.</p><p>Mapping specific functions to distinct regions of eEF1A is the next step in understanding the molecular mechanism of eEF1A1-mediated HSR. This work is currently underway and beyond the scope of the current manuscript, which is already “bulky”, as noted by the reviewer, and which elucidates how HSP70 expression is synchronized during heat shock by the multiple functions of eEF1A1.

Although this observation alone should suffice in resolving the reviewer’s concern, we address it below in more detail:</p><p>Santagata et al. show that there is a tight coordination of protein translation and HSF1 activation that specifically supports the anabolic malignant state. To reach this conclusion they used a translation initiation inhibitor RHT. This drug has a strong effect in a panel of human cancer cell lines but much less of an effect in non-tumorigenic cells. In our experiments we used human and mouse fibroblast that are non-tumorigenic (TIGs and MEFs). We used the MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell line (not used by Santagata et al.) and obtained similar results as with non-tumorigenic cell lines. We used the MDA-MB-231 cell line because under non-heat shock condition these cells show very little expression of HSP70 mRNA.</p><p>The experiments by Santagata et al. were performed under non-heat shock conditions, whereas most of our experiments were performed upon heat-shock. Without heat shock their tumorigenic cells continued to display a high level of HSP70 mRNA and efficient binding of HSF1 to the HSP70 promoter. This binding disappears when they add RHT. In contrast, we did not detect any strong HSF1 binding to the HSP70 promoter under control (non-HS) conditions. Moreover, this weak binding was not altered when we knocked down eEF1A1 (New <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure-2B</xref>). Interestingly, it is well established and demonstrated in the field that both translation initiation and elongation are already shut down during heat shock conditions when HSF1 shows its higher activity.</p><p>The only cell line the two groups used in common is HeLa. We used HeLa because they express high levels of both eEF1A isoforms, eEF1A1 and eEF1A2. Although both isoforms share the same role in translation elongation, only when we knocked down eEF1A1 did we observe a decrease in HSP70 mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1-figure supplement 3A and 3B</xref>). Therefore, the role of eEF1A1 during the heat shock response is independent of its role in translation.</p><p>For all the reasons indicated above we believe that there is not an unaccounted effect of eEF1A1 knockdown in the inactivation of HSF1 under the conditions we used for the experiments presented in our current manuscript.</p><p><italic>8) Finally, is the proposed role of eEF1A1 in recruitment and activation of Hsf1 limited to major Heat Shock Protein genes or is it much broader and applicable for all Hsf1 regulated genes? Evidence exists for Hsf1 regulating expression of genes other than HSPs (Trinklein et al., 2004 &amp; Mendilli et al., 2012) and I think it would be quite informative, if authors could include few of these genes and examine the role of eEF1A1 knockdown in their induction upon heat shock</italic>.</p><p>This is an important question, which we will address in a future report. In the current manuscript we focus primarily on HSP70 in order to characterize each step in its induction pathway: transcription, mRNA stability, transport and translation. To determine whether every gene regulated by HSF1 is also subject to regulation by eEF1A1 is beyond the limits of any single manuscript. We have added an mRNA profiler in Figure 1–table supplement 1 and discussed the likely possibility of the role of eEF1A1 in regulating the expression of heat shock genes other than HSP70. Finally, to address the reviewer’s question in full, different cell lines (from non-tumorigenic to highly malignant) would need to be analyzed, because HSF1 drives a transcriptional program distinct from heat shock to specifically support highly malignant human cancers (Mendillo et al. 2012).</p><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the re-review follow.]</p><p><italic>1) The previous Impact Statement stated “eEF1A1 orchestrates the entire process of the heat shock response, from transcription activation of HSP70 gene, to HSP70 mRNA stabilization, nuclear export, and translation”. I apologize for abbreviating this to “eEF1A orchestrates the entire heat shock response”. The current Impact statement now is “eEF1A1 orchestrates the process of heat shock response, from transcription activation of the HSP70 gene, to HSP70 mRNA stabilization, nuclear export, and translation”. The word “entire” is now deleted, which helps, but this is still an overstatement, especially considering the complexity of the heat shock response. First, the “process of the heat shock response” is too broad, as this study focuses on Hsp70. Second, the work “orchestrates” gives eEF1A1 a status of a major regulator like HSF1. While the paper provides data supporting an eEF1A1 contribution to the Hsp70 heat shock response at multiple stages, this factor has not acquired the regulatory support of an Hsf1, which has been demonstrated to have more than 10 times larger effects than those reported here on transcription (and protein production) of major heat shock genes</italic>.</p><p>As requested, we changed the word “orchestrate” in the Impact Statement to less prominent “modulate”. It now reads: <italic>“eEF1A1</italic> modulates the process of heat shock response, from transcription activation of the HSP70 gene, to HSP70 mRNA stabilization, nuclear export, and translation”.</p><p><italic>2) The incomplete binding curve of</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2E</italic></xref><italic>, which does not show saturation, is only able to provide an upper estimate of eEF1A1 affinity for Hsp70 promoter of &gt;300nM. So eEF1A1 is a very weak binder relative to a typical sequence specific DNA binding factor, which would be useful to emphasize for the reader. I agree that there seems to be some specificity from various controls, and the new</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1"><italic>Figure 4,S1B</italic></xref> <italic>helps</italic>.</p><p>As suggested we now emphasize a relatively weak DNA binding capability of eEF1A1: “Moreover, in vitro binding of recombinant eEF1A1 to a DNA fragment of HSP70 promoter suggests direct and specific, albeit a relatively weak, interaction of eEF1A1 to HSP70 promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). We further confirmed the presence of eEF1A1 at HSP70 locus by ChIP-QPCR… experiments ”</p><p><italic>3) While the data support the conclusion that KD of eEF1A1 causes a ∼2-fold decrease in Hsp70 mRNA and a striking decrease in nuclear export, the case made for eEF1A1 having a role on loading Hsp70 mRNA on polysomes is considerably weaker (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"><italic>Figure 5E</italic></xref><italic>). The effect on Hsp70 mRNA in polysomes could be a consequence of lower cytoplasmic Hsp70 mRNA, and the difference between light and heavy is modest especially when considering error bars. Therefore, the authors should drop or tone down the conclusion that eEF1A1 affects Hsp70 translation</italic>.</p><p>As suggested, we toned down the conclusion regarding eEF1A1 affecting HSP70 translation by doing the following changes in the text:</p><p>Abstract: “…facilitating its export from the nucleus to the active ribosomes” to “facilitating its nuclear export”.</p><p>also: “…eEF1A1 facilitates HSP70 mRNA nuclear export and translation” to “..eEF1A1 facilitates HSP70 mRNA nuclear export”</p><p>and: “… indicating that eEF1A1 helped the loading of HSP70 into polysomes” to “… suggesting that eEF1A1 helped the loading of HSP70 mRNA into polysomes.”</p><p><italic>4) It's interesting that, with eEF1A1 affecting significantly so many processes in Hsp70 expression, the overall reduction in Hsp70 protein is only about 70% of the si:NT control (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2"><italic>Fig. 1,S2A</italic></xref><italic>). The authors should discuss this quantitatively and evaluate what this may mean about mechanisms governing this multistep pathway</italic>.</p><p>As suggested, we now expand the Discussion to address this comment:</p><p>“…We observed that each of these steps gets impaired when eEF1A1 is partially depleted. It is the sum of the effects on HSP70 mRNA synthesis, stability and transport that accounts for a ∼70% reduction of the HSP70 protein level and decreased thermotolerance in cells partially knocked down for eEF1A1. It is likely that the remaining eEF1A1 supports the residual HSP70 expression.”</p><p>Clarification for the editor/reviewer: We would like to emphasize that 70% reduction of HSP70 is not a low value as implied by the reviewer’s term “only”: The western blot experiments were done from a pool of cells treated with eEF1A1 siRNA. The efficiency of transfection by siRNAs and eEF1A1 inhibition was less than 75%. Thus, in any given experiment there are some cells responding to heat shock normally by producing HSP70 protein. This should account at least for some of the remaining HSP70 produced under the eEF1A1 depletion conditions. Moreover, a 70% reduction in HSP70 protein levels is biologically significant since there is a decrease in cell thermotolerance comparable with that of HSF1 depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p></body></sub-article></article>
