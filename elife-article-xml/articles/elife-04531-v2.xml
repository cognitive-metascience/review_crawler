safe, attenuated virus vaccines. However, selection for disfavoured CPs leads to unintended increases in CpG and UpA dinucleotide frequencies that also attenuate replication. We designed and phenotypically characterised mutants of the picornavirus, echovirus 7, in which these parameters were independently varied to determine which most influenced virus replication. CpG and UpA dinucleotide frequencies primarily influenced virus replication ability while no fitness differences were observed between mutants with different CP usage where dinucleotide frequencies were kept constant. Contrastingly, translation efficiency was unaffected by either CP usage or dinucleotide frequencies. This mechanistic insight is critical for future rational design of live virus vaccines and their safety evaluation; attenuation is mediated through enhanced innate immune responses to viruses with elevated CpG/UpA dinucleotide frequencies rather the viruses themselves being intrinsically defective.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04531.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04531.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04531.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Viruses cause a number of diseases in humans, such as measles or polio, that can be prevented by vaccines. Some vaccines contain whole <italic>viruses</italic> that have been weakened or modified so that they do not cause illness. In response to infection with these weakened viruses, the immune system creates cells that can ‘recognise’, and protect against, the disease-causing forms of the virus if these are encountered later.</p><p>Directly altering the genetic material of viruses has been suggested as a safe way of weakening them for use in vaccines. Viruses store their genetic material in strands of either DNA or RNA, which are each made up of building blocks called nucleotides. Each nucleotide is commonly represented by a single letter—for RNA, these are A, C, G and U. These letters are read in blocks of three, called codons, when the RNA sequence is translated to make proteins.</p><p>Some codons perform the same tasks. However, in many organisms, a ‘codon bias’ exists, where one codon is used more often than the others that could perform the same role. Certain codons also tend to be found next to each other while some codon pair combinations are avoided; this is called ‘codon pair bias’. Separately, some individual nucleotides are more likely to occur in certain pairs than others. The nucleotide pairs CG and UA, for example, generally occur less often than expected in the RNA of viruses, as well as in the genomes of the animals and plants they infect.</p><p>Currently, much research is focusing on developing weakened viruses for vaccines by introducing unfavourable host codon pairs into viral RNA, as this has been suggested to reduce how efficiently virus RNA sequences are translated into proteins. However, Tulloch et al. noticed that introducing these unfavourable codon pairs also increases the number of CG or UA nucleotide pairs present in the RNA of the virus. It is therefore unclear whether increasing the number of unfavoured codon pairs or unfavoured nucleotide pairs produces the weakening effect.</p><p>Tulloch et al. took a virus that infects the human gut, called echovirus 7, and created two types of mutant virus. One set of viruses had altered codon pair frequencies but the overall number of CG or UA nucleotide pairs was kept constant. In the other set, codon pair frequencies were kept the same but CG and UA frequencies were changed. Tulloch et al. found that altering codon pair frequencies did not affect virus replication or fitness. In contrast, increasing CG or UA nucleotide frequencies weakened the virus. Other work by the researchers involved in this study has shown that this impaired replication arises through the viruses being more readily targeted by the immune response of the invaded cell; the viruses themselves are not replication-defective.</p><p>Engineering viruses with precisely tuned replication properties is a breakthrough in the quest for safer virus vaccines, and provides useful tools for investigating virus–host interactions. The dramatic effect on viral replication of altering nucleotide pair frequencies has revealed the existence of new pathways that defend cells against virus infections, knowledge that could be exploited to rationally design vaccines.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04531.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04531.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>picornavirus</kwd><kwd>echovirus 7</kwd><kwd>codon pair bias</kwd><kwd>dinucleotide</kwd><kwd>CpG</kwd><kwd>vaccine</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>A. thaliana</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Virus</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>WT087628MA</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Evans</surname><given-names>David J</given-names></name><name><surname>Simmonds</surname><given-names>Peter</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/K003801/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ryan</surname><given-names>Martin D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/L004526/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ryan</surname><given-names>Martin D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Attenuating candidate live virus vaccines by incorporating unfavoured codon pairs to reduce translation efficiency is actually mediated though changes in frequencies of CpG and UpA dinucleotides, which make viruses more visible to the innate immune system.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Protein encoding regions of all organisms, eukaryotic, bacterial and viral, are subject to a number of functional constraints in addition to coding capacity, many of which contribute to regulation of translation.

There are, in addition, consistent under- and over-representations of codon pairs (CPs) in all organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Yarus and Folley, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gutman and Hatfield, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boycheva et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Moura et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Tats et al., 2008</xref>) that have been proposed to influence gene expression through alterations in translation efficiency.</p><p>Because of its potential effect on gene expression, altering CP frequencies towards those that are disfavoured in their hosts has recently been advocated as a novel strategy to reduce RNA virus replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Coleman et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Wimmer et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Mueller et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Martrus et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Yang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Le Nouen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ni et al., 2014</xref>). This procedure potentially provides the means to produce a new generation of safer, non-reverting, live attenuated vaccines. Classically, virus genomes have been empirically attenuated by serial passage in tissue-culture leading to the accumulation of mutations. This lengthy, stochastic process produced attenuated virus vaccine strains which have produced major effects on human (eg., poliovirus—Sabin vaccines) and animal health (eg., eradication of Rinderpest using the Plowright vaccine). However, reversion to virulence by back-mutation of characteristically a small number of key, attenuating, mutations is a well-known problem. Novel strategies by which synonymous coding changes are introduced to modify codon usage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Mueller et al., 2010</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Martrus et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Yang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Le Nouen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ni et al., 2014</xref>) have the advantage that the resulting virus attenuation is dependent on a large number of mutations each of which only slightly reduce replicative fitness, but taken together produce significant attenuation with greatly enhanced genetic stability.</p><p>As one of the first examples, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Coleman et al. (2008)</xref> generated synthetic poliovirus capsid gene sequences containing codon pairs that were specifically disfavoured in human coding sequences. These CP de-optimised sequences were inserted into an infectious cDNA clone of poliovirus. Virus generated from these mutants showed a remarkably attenuated replication phenotype attributed by the authors to impaired translation efficiency. Codon pair de-optimisation (CPD) has since been developed as a strategy for the production of a wide range of other live attenuated virus vaccines including influenza A virus (IAV), porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and respiratory syncytial virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Mueller et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Martrus et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Yang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Le Nouen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ni et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>While altering translation efficiency through manipulation of codon or codon pair usage may attenuate virus replication, other virus compositional features may additionally contribute to replication phenotypes. One prominent compositional abnormality among RNA and small DNA viruses infecting mammals and plants is the marked suppression of the frequencies of CpG and UpA dinucleotides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Karlin et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Rima and McFerran, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Simmonds et al., 2013</xref>). The functional basis for this suppression was recently demonstrated by the marked attenuating effect of artificially increasing the numbers of CpG and UpA dinucleotides in the genome of echovirus 7 (E7; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Atkinson et al., 2014</xref>)). We and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Burns et al., 2009</xref>) have speculated that effects of CpG/UpA frequencies on virus replication may indeed account for, at least in part, the attenuating effect of selecting disfavoured codon pairs in CPD mutant of poliovirus and other candidate attenuated vaccines. Supporting this conjecture, regression analysis of the effects of numerous compositional variables in a range of codon- and codon pair deoptimised mutants on poliovirus replication demonstrated the primary effect of CpG and UpA frequencies on replication ability rather than alterations in codon or codon pair usage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Burns et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>In the current study, we have used a variety of bioinformatic analyses to investigate the relationship between dinucleotide frequencies and codon pair usage. We have subsequently designed and assessed the replication phenotypes and fitness of mutants of E7 constructed in such a way that allows effects of codon pair and dinucleotide frequency alterations to be separately altered. The findings demonstrate the primary influence of CpG and UpA frequencies on virus replication that was independent of codon pair usage and translation efficiency.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Virus attenuation, CP and dinucleotide frequencies</title><p>Coding regions of poliovirus, IAV, PRRSV and HIV-1 have all been subjected to CP de-optimisation and effects on virus replication quantified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Coleman et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Mueller et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Martrus et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Yang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ni et al., 2014</xref>).

On the one hand, it could be hypothesised that the suppression of CpG and UpA at position 3–1 in mammalian codon pairs was a simple consequence of avoiding disfavoured codon pairs. Conversely, it could be conceptualised that codon pair choice is driven in part through avoidance of specific dinucleotides. To resolve this functionally, we compared replication dynamics and relative fitness of native E7 with a series of novel mutants of E7 in which dinucleotide frequencies and CP usage were independently manipulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>).

In the literature, studies have documented effects of CP de-optimisation on virus attenuation without reference to effects of this procedure on dinucleotide frequencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Coleman et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Mueller et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Martrus et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Yang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Le Nouen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ni et al., 2014</xref>). While frequencies of both of these dinucleotides are suppressed in most classes of mammalian RNA viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Rima and McFerran, 1997</xref>), all sequences modified to select disfavoured CPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Coleman et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Mueller et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Martrus et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Yang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ni et al., 2014</xref>) consistently elevated frequencies of CpG and UpA dinucleotides to levels to 2.5–threefold higher levels than the original native sequences (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). As documented in other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Burns et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Atkinson et al., 2014</xref>), these dinucleotide frequencies may contribute additionally to the observed attenuation of virus replication.</p><p>Through construction of mutants of E7 in which CP frequencies was altered while keeping dinucleotide frequencies constant (WT/Min-E) and conversely, generating viruses with the same or similar CP biases but different dinucleotide frequencies (eg., Min-E/Min-U/Min-U and cu|cu/WT/Max-U), we were able to separate potential influences of these compositional variables on replication phenotype and fitness. The fitness ranking derived from competition assays (cu|cu &gt; Max &gt; (WT = P|P = Min-E) &gt; Min-U &gt; Min-H) demonstrated that it was dinucleotide frequencies that significantly influenced fitness while differences in CP usage showed no detectable phenotypic effect. Moreover, if CPD were to influence virus replication then its effect would be manifested through changes in translation rate; however, no measurable differences in translation efficiency were detected between WT and CP-optimised (Max) or de-optimised (Min) template RNA sequences. These findings are broadly consistent with results of previous translation assays of poliovirus mutants differing in CP choice in which relatively small differences in translation of PV-Min, WT and PV-Max mutants were clearly incompatible with the marked differences in their replicative ability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Coleman et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>In a broader context, the finding that alterations in codon pair frequencies has no independent effect on virus replication are consistent with current understanding of the nature and driving forces behind codon pair usage in other organisms. Most importantly, there is no evidence that disfavoured CPs in eukaryotes, archaea or prokaryotes are those that specifically retard translation rates. Indeed, where specifically investigated, the opposite was observed. mRNA templates containing disfavoured codon pairs in <italic>E. coli</italic> were translated faster than those containing over-represented CPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Irwin et al., 1995</xref>). The 16 codon pairs identified as most retarding translation of the <italic>E. coli</italic> his operon leader peptide gene has codon pair scores ranging from −0.94 to +0.54 and distributed around the centre of the distribution of codon pair scores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—Figure Supplement 3</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chevance et al., 2014</xref>). The current consensus view is that CP usage in prokaryotes is governed functionally as a means to regulate gene expression rather to maximise translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Folley and Yarus, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Irwin et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boycheva et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Buchan et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>In eukaryotic genomes, other factors underlie codon pair representation since coding regions in mRNA sequences and in non-transcribed genomic DNA showed similar biases in codon pair frequencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Moura et al., 2007</xref>). CP frequencies must therefore be substantially determined by mutational events operating on DNA such as methylation and specific context-dependent errors during genome replication instead of any kind of optimisation or regulation of translation. The consistent under-representation of codon pairs with CpG in the 3–1 position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Buchan et al., 2006</xref>) in mammalian genomes indeed likely originates from DNA methylation-induced mutations in the nucleus. Our data showing similar rates of translation of Min-H and Max-U that show major differences in frequencies of CpG-containing CPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) are consistent with this interpretation.</p><p>Finally, there is no theoretical basis for the assumption that CPs are disfavoured because of their negative effects on translation efficiency and this concept runs counter to our growing understanding of the intricate mechanisms that govern gene expression. In all organisms, coding sequences differ in codon usage, match to tRNA abundances, mRNA stability and initiation sites to regulate rates and fidelity of protein expression (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gingold and Pilpel, 2011</xref>). Some of the variability in CP usage observed in the three domains of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Moura et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Sharp et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Tats et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Wang and Li, 2009</xref>) likely represents aspects of that control, rather than as a means to simply maximise translation.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Mechanism of attenuation</title><p>Understanding what limits the replication of viruses with altered CP and dinucleotide frequencies is critical in the evaluation of their broader safety as attenuated virus vaccines. The proposed mechanism in which alterations in CP bias alter translation efficiency and it is this that inhibits virus replication introduces a conceptual model in which it is the virus that is intrinsically defective. With the large number of mutations required for reversion, such viruses should be stably attenuated in whatever context they are used. However, as we have now shown, the replication defect of CPD viruses is actually mediated through alterations in dinucleotide frequencies in the genome that influence their recognition by the cell. In this alternative paradigm, viruses with elevated frequencies of CpG and UpA are not intrinsically defective but they are more readily recognised by the cell and prevented from initiating replication. Their attenuation is therefore dependent on the efficacy of the host innate immune response.</p><p>The cellular mechanisms responsible for differential recognition and response to RNA sequences with different dinucleotide composition are currently unknown. In our previous study, we obtained evidence that replication inhibition of high CpG/UpA mutants of E7 occurred shortly after cell entry and was not mediated though conventional pattern recognition receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Atkinson et al., 2014</xref>). In that study, we additionally demonstrated that it was additionally not the result of differences between high and low CpG/UpA viruses in their sensitivity to the cellular interferon response. We did observe, however, that the attenuated phenotype of high mutants could be entirely reversed by the kinase inhibitor, C16, a finding that suggests that recognition may occur through an as yet uncharacterised PKR-related component of the stress response pathway in the cell.</p><p>Both the adaptive and innate arms of the human immune system are highly polymorphic with remarkable variability in function and expression of many key components of recognition or effector proteins mediating antiviral responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Thomas et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Everitt et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hambleton et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Pothlichet and Quintana-Murci, 2013</xref>). Although uncharacterised mechanistically, there is clearly a potential danger that pathways that restrict the replication of high CpG/UpA RNA viruses may be similarly variable in the efficacy in humans and in veterinary species with different genetic backgrounds. The attenuation of live vaccines and safety margins established for their large scale use may be similarly variable; investigation of population differences in innate cellular responses to viruses of different dinucleotide compositions is essential in the evaluation of the safety of this new generation of high CpG/UpA live attenuated vaccines.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture and cell lines</title><p>RNA transcripts of the pT7:E7 infectious cDNA clone of the isolate Wallace (accession number AF465516) were used to generate E7 viral stocks.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Richard Losick (Senior editor), a Reviewing editor, and 3 reviewers, one of whom, Raul Andino, has agreed to reveal his identity.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission. The comments in full from the three reviewers are attached below.</p><p>Our reviewers were in close agreement that the paper makes important points and is topical and appropriate for <italic>eLife</italic>. There was also a consensus that there were some failings in reviewing the history of this topic, and I agree that an improved review is needed (apparently key citations are missing). This should be easily fixed. There were some good suggestions to improve clarity. There were also requests for more experimentation from one (the third) reviewer, which I think sound reasonable, but I cannot evaluate how much work is involved. I would encourage the authors to consider doing what is easy. It seems to this reviewer that the quantitation might be improved without huge effort. We are willing to leave it to the authors to decide how much more wet work is desired.</p><p>All told, we are supportive of publication.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1</italic></p><p>This manuscript presents a careful and interesting work, and even more thoroughly documents on the attenuating effect of dinucleotides CpG and UpA in the genomes of RNA viruses than previous papers have. They argue, convincingly, that attenuating effects previously ascribed to 'codon pair bias' in attenuating viruses can be completely explained by the resulting increases in CpG and UpA dinucleotides. They do this via a systematic analysis of the attenuating effects of altering 'codon-pair bias' in previous papers and by carefully design experiments of their own, which include documentation that the attenuation does not occur by reducing translational efficiency, but by reducing the infectivity of the resulting virions.</p><p>With respect to the possible attenuation mechanism of CpG and UpA dinucleotides, the authors discuss the possibility that it is a mechanism of the innate immune response that is not PKR- or pattern receptor-dependent. Data relevant to this are published separately (Atkinson et al., 2014).</p><p>The curious thing about this field, and this manuscript, is that the 'straw man' of codon-pair bias was already destroyed by Burns et al., in 2009. These authors were pursuing their own hypothesis, that the substitution of rare codons would attenuate viruses. They found that this was the case, but careful mutagenesis revealed that it was, in fact, the increase in CpG and UpA nucleotides in the RNA that accounted for the attenuation. They showed that this effect was not due to translational efficiency and was manifested as the increased particle-to-PFU ratio of the resulting viruses. They reflected that bias against CpG and UpA codons might be the reason, in fact, that codons that contain them, and codon pairs that create them, are rare to begin with.</p><p>They noted, quite politely, that this also accounted for the effect of the highly publicized “codon-pair bias” published by Coleman et al., 2008. They stated: “A prominent feature of the most disfavored codon pairs is the presence of CpG or UpA across codons. Thus, the observed CPB in poliovirus and in humans and higher eukaryotes may be driven primarily by CpG and UpA dinucleotide suppression. In this context, it is notable that in cassette C of the construct with the lowest fitness, ABc<sub>12</sub>, within-codon CpG and UpA frequencies were maximized but the CPB score was similar to those of higher-fitness constructs, including ABC.” Thus, like the current manuscript, they re-analyzed the data of Coleman et al., and found it to be completely explicable in terms of CpG and UpA dinucleotides.</p><p>This conclusion, and the published data, were clearly insufficient to prevent the design and interpretation of several more manuscripts using 'codon pair bias' to design attenuated viruses for vaccine and basic science purposes (Mueller et al., 2010; Martrus, 2013; Yang, 2013; Ni, 2014).</p><p>In short, this is a well-executed, important study that extends the very clear conclusions of the also excellent, but completely ignored, 2009 paper of Burns et al. Therefore its publication would bring an important discussion into the limelight. Here are my suggestions, mostly having to do with writing and scholarship:</p><p>1) That CpG and UpA dinucleotide frequency correlates with attenuation of viruses, rather than 'codon pair bias' or 'codon de-optimization', is a feature of these approaches rather than an artifact, in this reviewer's opinion. The combative nature of the title is not necessary to bring this fact to light.</p><p>2) It does not detract from the quality of the present work to acknowledge more explicitly the contributions of Burns et al. It may, however, detract from its novelty.</p><p>3) The readers understanding of the data is compromised by the poor description of the experiments and analysis in the figure legends. These should be rewritten in such a way that the figures can be independently understood. For example, nowhere in the manuscript can the metric for “CPB score” be discovered.</p><p>4) Similarly, the quantitative findings in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> are difficult to dissect. With so many changes in the genomes being analyzed, qRT-PCR of viral competitions would be helpful. As it is, the actual data from the competition experiments should be presented, rather than a cartoon depicting which viruses 'won' and 'lost'.</p><p>5) The last paragraph of the Discussion uses 'data not shown' to make its point. These data should be shown or the sentences deleted.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2</italic></p><p>There has been interesting discussions on why the nucleotide composition of many human viruses present distinct nucleotide, di-nucleotide and codon preferences. In the last years synthetic viruses have been generated with alternative codon distributions that show attenuated replication. However these constructs change other variables (nucleotide or dinucleotide composition) in addition to the codon distribution and it is unclear what of those changes affects replication. The authors address this issue by generating mutants of the echovirus 7 in which CpG and UpA dinucleotides were varied independent of the codon distribution. The results clearly showed that the main factor dominating replication was dinucleotide content, and that translation efficiency was unaffected by the two variables. The authors then argue that attenuation is mediated through innate immune response to viruses with high CpG/UpA content.</p><p>The paper is very interesting and results are compelling. The main critiques are:</p><p>1) The topic of dinucleotide biases in RNA viruses has been explored extensively and most references are absent.</p><p>2) The discussion on the mechanisms of attenuation and the association to the innate immune response is not well elaborated. They mention the lack of association to interferon response and the effect of C16. However, the results are not presented in detail. I suggest the authors to strengthen their conclusions.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3</italic></p><p>This study examines the role of nucleotide composition in RNA virus genomes. The authors introduced a number of synonymous mutations into the EV71 genome to modify the frequency of CpG and UpA dinucleotide (DN) or codon pair (CP). Their results support the idea that DN frequencies determine virus replication, while neither DN nor CP affected translation efficiency. They concluded that DN affect virus replication because the nucleotide composition of the virus genome influences the host-cell innate response to the virus.</p><p>The most interesting contributions of this study are: 1) they are able to identify mutations that will affect CP without affecting CpG/UpA dinucleotide composition and vice versa; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bennetzen and Hall, 1982</xref>) based on this bioinformatics information they constructed mutants that change CP or DN composition and experimentally evaluated the effect of synonymous mutation on virus replication. Their conclusions are supported by the available results, and I think this study represents an important contribution to the field because it seems to address a molecular mechanism for virus genome nucleotide composition bias. However, I believe that a more quantitative analysis of the competition experiment may be required to determine the degree of correlation between DN composition and virus replication fitness.</p><p>The authors choose competition assays to precisely analyze fitness between different virus and with respect to WT. This is the correct experiment in my opinion, however I believe the analysis of the experiment is somewhat casual and not very quantitative, and therefore limits the value of this data. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> presents the results using a differential restriction enzyme pattern to distinguish between the two competing viruses, but they can only determine when one virus is lost (no longer detected by the assay). I think that it will be a lot more powerful to use digital PCR to precisely quantify the ratio between virus genomes in the given competition assay. This will provide parameters that can then be fit in a simple mathematical model to determine with more accuracy the correlation between DN or CP and fitness, which at this point seems a bit circumstantial.</p><p>Similarly, it would be desirable to improve the quality of the in vitro translation assay and quantify protein production to determine that, in this case, there is little correlation between translation efficiency and fitness, as this is one of the central claims of the study.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04531.021</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>Reviewer #1</p><p><italic>1) That CpG and UpA dinucleotide frequency correlates with attenuation of viruses, rather than 'codon pair bias' or 'codon de-optimization', is a feature of these approaches rather than an artifact, in this reviewer's opinion. The combative nature of the title is not necessary to bring this fact to light</italic>.</p><p>As co-authors, we did spend some time discussing the title of the paper. The final choice was in fact motivated for reasons alluded to by the reviewer: that those involved in the codon pair programme have simply ignored the published evidence, by Burns et al. and more recently from our lab (Atkinson et al.), that the attenuating effect was mediated through inadvertently increasing CpG ad UpA dinucleotide frequencies rather any effect on translation. A clear, declarative title of the paper seems required to counter mistaken views on this. If we changed the title as the reviewer suggests, it would imply that codon pair de-optimisation has been used deliberately as a way to increase CpG and UpA dinucleotide frequencies. This is absolutely not the case.</p><p>That said, we would have liked to qualify that statement by stating why we make this assertion, but the low character limit imposed on <italic>eLife</italic> papers titles prevents us from doing this.</p><p><italic>2) It does not detract from the quality of the present work to acknowledge more explicitly the contributions of Burns et al. It may, however, detract from its novelty</italic>.</p><p>We have cited that study in the original manuscript. In the Introduction of the revised manuscript, we have described the observation made by Burns and colleagues in more detail as requested by the reviewer.</p><p><italic>3) The readers understanding of the data is compromised by the poor description of the experiments and analysis in the figure legends. These should be rewritten in such a way that the figures can be independently understood. For example, nowhere in the manuscript can the metric for “CPB score” be discovered</italic>.</p><p>We apologise for these omissions and have endeavoured to make the figure legends clearer (more explanatory) and describe the various abbreviations more fully. We have dropped the abbreviations CPB as it can be expressed more clearly by other wordings (e.g<italic>.</italic> biased codon pair usage).</p><p><italic>4) Similarly, the quantitative findings in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><italic>Figure 4</italic></xref> <italic>are difficult to dissect. With so many changes in the genomes being analyzed, qRT-PCR of viral competitions would be helpful. As it is, the actual data from the competition experiments should be presented, rather than a cartoon depicting which viruses 'won' and 'lost'</italic>.</p><p>We fully agree that the results presentation in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> was unduly diagrammatic and lacked primary data (with the exception of the two example gel images in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). This point was also made by Reviewer #3. To address this, we have made use of the possibility to include figure supplements by now including gel images of the other competition assays so that relative fitness can be directly evaluated. We have, however, retained the original <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> as a summary of the experimental data.</p><p>The use of restriction enzymes to differentiate E7 mutants is a widely used method and its results can be made fully quantitative using appropriately calibrated controls. Had the phenotypes been more subtle we agree that quantitative qRT-PCR would likely have been necessary to discriminate between the fitness of viruses with modified dinucleotide ratios. However, in the current study, outcomes were either elimination of one or other of the competing viruses or a draw. These results are readily visualised as presented, and we believe the investigation does not need more precise quantitation as suggested by the reviewer.</p><p><italic>5) The last paragraph of the discussion uses 'data not shown' to make its point. These data should be shown or the sentences deleted</italic>.</p><p>We agree, and that part of the discussion has entirely been removed.
