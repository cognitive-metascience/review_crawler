source of neuromodulators and has been implicated in a wide variety of behavioral and neurological disorders. The DRN is subdivided into distinct anatomical subregions comprised of multiple cell types, and its complex cellular organization has impeded efforts to investigate the distinct circuit and behavioral functions of its subdomains. Here we used single-cell RNA sequencing, in situ hybridization, anatomical tracing, and spatial correlation analysis to map the transcriptional and spatial profiles of cells from the mouse DRN. Our analysis of 39,411 single-cell transcriptomes revealed at least 18 distinct neuron subtypes and 5 serotonergic neuron subtypes with distinct molecular and anatomical properties, including a serotonergic neuron subtype that preferentially innervates the basal ganglia. Our study lays out the molecular organization of distinct serotonergic and non-serotonergic subsystems, and will facilitate the design of strategies for further dissection of the DRN and its diverse functions.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>dorsal raphe nucleus</kwd><kwd>single cell RNAseq</kwd><kwd>serotonin</kwd><kwd>neuromodulation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS103226</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sabatini</surname><given-names>Bernardo L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sabatini</surname><given-names>Bernardo L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MH100568</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sabatini</surname><given-names>Bernardo L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Harvard Brain Initiative</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Bipolar Disorder Seed Grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sabatini</surname><given-names>Bernardo L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004358</institution-id><institution>Samsung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Samsung Scholarship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hyun</surname><given-names>Minsuk</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006691</institution-id><institution>Harvard Medical School</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Lefler Center for the Study of Neurodegenerative Disorder</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hyun</surname><given-names>Minsuk</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Department of Neurobiology, Harvard Medical School</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Graduate Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Huang</surname><given-names>Kee Wui</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009345</institution-id><institution>Department of Neurobiology, Harvard Medical School</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Stuart HQ and Victoria Quan Fellowship in Neurobiology</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Huang</surname><given-names>Kee Wui</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The dorsal raphe nucleus contains transcriptionally diverse cell classes that include subtypes of serotonergic neurons with distinct molecular and anatomical signatures.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) is a major source of neuromodulators in the central nervous system, and is the largest of the serotonergic nuclei, containing approximately a third of all serotonergic neurons (5-HT neurons) in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hornung, 2010</xref>). DRN 5-HT neurons send highly divergent projections that target many functionally distinct brain regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Azmitia and Segal, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Muzerelle et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Vertes, 1991</xref>). Concordantly, diverse and at times conflicting functions have been proposed for DRN 5-HT neurons, including arousal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Monti, 2010</xref>), motor facilitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Jacobs and Fornal, 1997</xref>), behavioral inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Miyazaki et al., 2012</xref>), cognitive flexibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Matias et al., 2017</xref>), value representation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bromberg-Martin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cohen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hayashi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Li et al., 2016</xref>), motor learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kawashima et al., 2016</xref>), mood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cools et al., 2008</xref>), and regulation of social interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">DÃ¶len et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Niederkofler et al., 2016</xref>). Changes in DRN 5-HT neuron function have been implicated in various neuropsychiatric diseases, including major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and obsessive-compulsive disorder, as well as movement disorders such as Parkinsonâs Disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Huot et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mahmood and Silverstone, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Politis and Niccolini, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Vaswani et al., 2003</xref>). Serotonergic signaling pathways are also targets of widely-used therapeutic drugs, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and atypical antipsychotics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Meltzer and Massey, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Vaswani et al., 2003</xref>). However many of these drugs can acutely induce adverse side effects including anxiety and increased risk of suicidal behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ferguson, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gartlehner et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Vaswani et al., 2003</xref>). This suggests these drugs affect multiple 5-HT pathways with distinct and contrasting effects on behavior and highlights the need for new approaches to target specific 5-HT neurons and their outputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Marcinkiewcz et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Urban et al., 2016</xref>). Understanding of the organization of the DRN and 5-HT neurons in functionally distinct subsystems may help explain conflicting conclusions for the role of serotonin in the etiology of mental disorders.</p><p>Neurons in the DRN are neurochemically and anatomically diverse â only 30% to 50% are serotonergic, and many release other neurotransmitters including GABA, glutamate, dopamine (DA), nitric oxide, and a variety of peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fu et al., 2010</xref>). Some DRN neurons co-express genes that are traditionally used as markers for different neuronal cell types based on their neurotransmitter usage (e.g. <italic>Gad1</italic>, <italic>Gad2</italic>, <italic>Slc17a6</italic>, and <italic>Slc17a8</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Okaty et al., 2015</xref>). This presents a major challenge to attempts at separating cell types in the DRN using many genetic driver lines, which will label mixed populations in the DRN that have overlapping expression of these âcanonicalâ marker genes. Furthermore, these distinct neuronal cell types are spatially intermingled within the DRN and are difficult to separate anatomically.</p><p>Even bona fide DRN 5-HT neurons are molecularly, anatomically, and physiologically heterogeneous. Cytoarchitecturally, the DRN contains the 5-HT neuron clusters B6 and B7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">DahlstrÃ¶m and Fuxe, 1964</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hornung, 2010</xref>), and is further divided into subregions along all three major anatomical axes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hale and Lowry, 2011</xref>). While these subregions can be roughly defined by the spatial clustering of 5-HT neurons, the density of 5-HT neurons varies gradually between the subregions preventing the delineation of clear boundaries. Although DRN 5-HT neurons share a common developmental lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Deneris and Gaspar, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Jensen et al., 2008</xref>), DRN 5-HT neurons in different subregions express different G protein-coupled receptors and vesicular transporters, suggesting spatial clustering of functionally specialized neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Calizo et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fernandez et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lowry et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Templin et al., 2012</xref>). Nevertheless, these anatomical subregions fail to capture many features of 5-HT neurons, as most of the variation does not show subregional specificity. Additionally, DRN 5-HT neurons vary in their axonal projection patterns, and the spatial distributions of these projection-defined subpopulations are broad and do not map cleanly to DRN subregions. This likely arises, in part, from the extensive collateralization of axons from individual 5-HT neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gagnon and Parent, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Waselus et al., 2011</xref>) â different 5-HT neurons are therefore likely to have overlapping axonal projection fields, even if they target distinct sets of regions to serve separate functions.</p><p>The heterogeneity of 5-HT neurons suggests that they may be organized into distinct subsystems. However, there is no consensus on the definition of these subsystems and only an incomplete understanding of correspondences between anatomically, molecularly, and functionally defined 5-HT neuron subtypes. Functional differences exist between projection-defined subpopulations of DRN 5-HT neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Ren et al., 2018</xref>), but it is unknown if these subpopulations map onto molecularly defined subtypes. Furthermore an unbiased census of DRN cell types and subtypes of 5-HT neurons is lacking, and presents a major obstacle in achieving a unified understanding of the diverse functions performed by these neurons.</p><p>Here we dissect the cellular composition of the DRN and relate molecular profiles of cell types to anatomical features. We used high-throughput single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to survey the cell types in and around the DRN and identified at least 5 distinct subtypes of 5-HT neurons, in addition to uncovering organizational principles for both neuronal and non-neuronal cell types based on gene expression profiles. Spatial information from in situ hybridization imaging datasets allowed us to infer the anatomical distribution of these DRN 5-HT neuron subtypes within the DRN. Molecularly defined subtypes of DRN 5-HT neurons are found in overlapping but different sets of anatomical subregions that do not match the spatial distribution of projection-defined subpopulations. Using viral retrograde tracing and multiplexed in situ hybridization, we characterized the expression of subtype-enriched genes in projection-defined neuronal subpopulations and found that the striatal-projecting 5-HT neuron subpopulation is a heterogeneous group comprised of at least 2 distinct molecular subtypes. Additionally, we defined a DRN 5-HT neuron subtype that is well-positioned to modulate basal ganglia circuits, based on its molecular and anatomical features. Our findings validate the feasibility of intersectional approaches to achieve the molecular and spatial specificity required to access distinct 5-HT neuron subsystems in vivo, and provide a resource to aid in the design of experimental strategies for the functional dissection of diverse DRN cell types and circuits.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Cell type composition of the DRN by transcriptomic profiling</title><p>To survey the cell type composition of the DRN, we used the droplet-based inDrop platform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Klein et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Zilionis et al., 2017</xref>) to perform transcriptomic profiling with single-cell resolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The DRN and surrounding areas were dissected from acute coronal brain sections spanning the rostro-caudal extent of the DRN, and dissociated cell suspensions were prepared by digesting the dissected tissue in a protease cocktail containing inhibitors of neural activity, transcription, and translation to reduce the effects of the dissociation procedure on gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hrvatin et al., 2018</xref>). Cells were sequenced to an average read depth of 48,805 reads per cell (medianÂ =Â 31,286 reads), and low-quality cells were removed prior to clustering (see MaterialsÂ andÂ methods). Aligned reads were filtered using unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) and quantified as UMI filtered mapped read (UMIFM) counts. Clustering using a graph-based algorithm and a shared-nearest-neighbors distance metric grouped yielded 17 major clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). These major clusters were identified and assigned to cell classes based their expression of previously-described marker gene combinations that were extensive cross-referenced with published datasets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Marques et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Okaty et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Poulin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Saunders et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Vanlandewijck et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Zeisel et al., 2018</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).

To predict the 5-HT neuron subtypes present in different projection-defined neuron subpopulations, we compared the distributions of projection-defined subpopulations with the inferred 5-HT neuron subtype distributions.</p><p>It has been reported that cortical-projecting subpopulations of DRN 5-HT neurons express <italic>Slc17a8</italic>, in agreement with the extensive overlap between the spatial distribution of cortical-projecting neurons and <italic>Slc17a8</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Ren et al., 2018</xref>).

Additionally, we would predict that the Str-projecting subpopulation corresponds to the subtype 5-HT-III, since their distributions overlap extensively in the dorsomedial DRN. Consistent with our hypothesis that 5-HT neuron subtypes innervate different brain regions, we found that the inferred distributions of each 5-HT neuron subtype coincides with a different set of projection-defined subpopulations â the distribution of subtype 5-HT-III was most similar to the distribution of Str-projecting neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>), whereas the distribution of subtype 5-HT-IV was more similar to that of M1-projecting neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>).

By overlaying transcriptional and anatomical features onto a common reference atlas, we describe the molecular basis for the organization of DRN 5-HT neurons into distinct subsystems. We uncovered 5 subtypes of DRN 5-HT neurons based on their gene expression profiles and showed that these are organized into distinct spatial domains within the DRN that are segregated along all three major anatomical axes. However, the spatial organization of molecularly defined 5-HT neurons does not conform to anatomical subdivisions as defined by cytoarchitecture of the DRN or the projection targets of 5-HT axons. The overlapping spatial distributions of 5-HT subtypes demonstrate the need for precise molecular and genetic approaches to dissect the function of each subtype. We also define a <italic>Pdyn</italic>-enriched 5-HT neuron subtype that is well-positioned to broadly but specifically alter the input and output of basal ganglia circuits, potentially mediating the modulation of motor control, decision making, and reinforcement learning by internal state.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Anatomical organization of DRN 5-HT neuron subtypes</title><p>We present a physical map combining both transcriptional and anatomical features and show that molecularly distinct DRN 5-HT neuron subtypes are spatially segregated into distinct anatomical subdomains and innervate different but overlapping targets. We reconstructed the spatial distribution of each 5-HT subtype using spatial correlation analysis of gene differentially expressed between subtypes and showed that each cytoarchitecturally-defined DRN subregion contains different molecularly-defined 5-HT subtypes. The subregional distribution of 5-HT subtypes relates well to past studies reporting subregion-specific anatomical and molecular differences that are consistent with our integrative map of 5-HT subtype features.</p><p>Of the five subtypes, the 5-HT-V was the most transcriptionally distinct and spatially restricted, and was found in a tight dorsomedial cluster in the posterior B6 tail of the DRN. Previous reports have suggested that the B6 5-HT neuron cluster is transcriptionally more similar to 5-HT neurons in the median raphe nucleus, despite being a part of the cytoarchitecturally-defined DRN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Commons, 2015</xref>). This has led to the proposal that the posterior DRN is an extension of the median raphe nucleus (MRN), although this remains to be validated using single cell transcriptomic profiling of both DRN and MRN 5-HT neurons. At the molecular level, 5-HT-V subtype neurons express a distinct set of receptors compared to the other four DRN 5-HT neuron subtypes. The localization of this subtype to the dorsomedial posterior B6 tail of the DRN also suggests that this subtype may innervate ventricular and subventriclar regions and the choroid plexus and primarily target non-neuronal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Muzerelle et al., 2016</xref>). The transcriptomic profile of this subtype we present here will aid in the development of molecular and genetic approaches for targeting this subtype, and may facilitate studies on serotonergic modulation of adult neurogenesis in the subventricular zone, as well as production and regulation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) by cells in the choroid plexus and ependymal lining of the ventricles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Banasr et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fisone et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Moskowitz et al., 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Young et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>The ventral DRN, comprised of the ventromedial subregion (or DRV) and interfascicular subregion (or DRI), contains mostly <italic>Slc17a8</italic>-enriched 5-HT-IV subtype neurons that innervate cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Ren et al., 2018</xref>). We noted that 5-HT-IV neurons were distributed throughout most of the anterior-posterior extent of the ventral DRN, although it is suggested that there is a topographical organization of cortical projecting 5-HT neurons along this axis. We speculate that this may reflect the broad and divergent cortical projections of individual 5-HT-IV neurons that collectively span most of the cerebral cortex. Alternatively, additional heterogeneity within the 5-HT-IV subtype may explain variation along the anterior-posterior axis that may be revealed with deeper sequencing.</p><p>In comparison, the dorsolateral DRN, also called the lateral wings of the DRN (lwDRN) and ventrolateral DRN (DRVL), showed strongly negative correlations with the 5-HT-IV subtype, particularly in the posterior half of the DRN where there is clearer spatial separation of <italic>Tph2</italic><sup>+</sup> neurons into medial and lateral compartments. Subtypes 5-HT-I and 5-HT-II were intermingled in this region, which is enriched in <italic>Trh</italic>, a 5-HT-I enriched gene. The dorsolateral subregion innervates many subcortical sensory and hypothalamic nuclei, in addition to motor nuclei in the brainstem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lee et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Muzerelle et al., 2016</xref>). We speculate that 5-HT-I and 5-HT-II form the cellular bases for the separation of DRN 5-HT projections to motor/limbic regions versus sensory regions respectively, given the expression of the TRH receptor gene (<italic>Trhr</italic>) in limbic regions, such as the NAc shell, the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, and hypothalamus, as well as several brainstem motor nuclei innervated by the DRN, such as the facial motor nucleus (Allen Brain Atlas). Further experiments using retrograde tracing and molecular profiling of DRN 5-HT neurons innervating these structures can be performed to evaluate these hypotheses. Additionally, the close spatial proximity of these two subtypes also presents a plausible mechanism for competitive inhibition between these separate subsystems via 5-HT1A receptors and local 5-HT release, which may be relevant to selective sensory modulation by movement or changes in behavioral state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hall et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Yokogawa et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Although we show that 5-HT subtypes have distinct spatial locations, we also found considerable overlaps in their distributions, particularly within the dorosmedial subregion in the anterior DRN that contains many basal ganglia-projecting 5-HT neurons. While the <italic>Pdyn</italic>-expressing 5-HT-III subtype was localized to the dorsomedial subregion, subtypes 5-HT-I and 5-HT-II were also found in this subregion in the anterior third of the DRN despite being distributed to dorsolateral subregions in more posterior sections. Furthermore, a detailed comparison of the 5-HT subtype distributions with cytoarchitecturally-defined subregion boundaries showed that subtype distributions are not confined within these subregion boundaries, especially in the anterior half of the DRN. The poor correspondence between molecularly-inferred and cytoarchitecturally-defined spatial domains cautions against the use of anatomical subregions for targeting 5-HT subsystems.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Molecular organization of DRN 5-HT subsystems</title><p>5-HT neurons are organized into discrete subsystems that (i) have distinct and dissociable behavioral functions, and (ii) are comprised of 5-HT neurons possessing unique molecular, physiological, and anatomical properties. However, the complex architecture of the DRN has impeded efforts to understand the interrelationship of these three aspects of 5-HT diversity, as necessary to study the differential properties and functions of each subsystem and its distinct subtype of 5-HT neuron. Given the extensive overlaps in the distribution of different 5-HT neuron subsets at the anatomical level, we were motivated by the hypothesis that a transcriptome-based molecular definition of 5-HT neuron subtypes was required to both understand the organization of heterogeneous 5-HT neuron subtypes as well as to enable their precise targeting for functional analyses. Consistent with this hypothesis, our results suggest that many of the physiological and anatomical differences between 5-HT neuron subtypes are a result of molecular differences specified by expression of overlapping but distinct transcriptional networks.</p><p>Some key technical limitations of scRNA-seq, particularly for droplet-based methods such as the inDrop platform used in this study, are the relatively low transcript capture efficiency and low number of reads per cell. The higher occurrence of drop-out events, which are failures in detecting expressed transcripts in a cell, also makes it more difficult to detect low copy transcripts that may be important for distinguishing between highly similar subtypes, such as the 5-HT-I and 5-HT-II subtypes in our study. Thus our study does not seek to present a definitive catalogue of all neuron subtypes present in the DRN, since the techniques used are limited in their ability to resolve finer levels of heterogeneity and differential expression of low copy transcripts. In spite of these limitations, our study still successfully captures a substantial amount of transcriptional heterogeneity to resolve differences between neuron subtypes that are informative of their diverse morphological and functional features. Furthermore, we find differential expression of transcription factors across subtypes that may underlie many of these molecular differences that are specified during the development of each subtype. The dynamics of these gene expression programs can be further elucidated by future studies that sample multiple time points along the developmental trajectory of the DRN. Further studies incurring a trade-off on cell count and the number of cell types captured for higher sequencing depth may also resolve additional transcriptional heterogeneity between subtypes within specific populations. Eventually these molecular approaches will be well complemented by whole-brain reconstructions of axons of single neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Economo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gong et al., 2016</xref>) as well as spatial transcriptomics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wang et al., 2018</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Local interactions between DRN cell types</title><p>Our scRNA-seq dataset yields predictions about local interactions involving DRN cells, including those with non-neuronal cells, based the expression patterns of known receptor-ligand pairs. For example, the expression of <italic>Hdc</italic> in ependymal cells suggests that ependymal cells may signal to nearby neurons via non-synaptic release of histamine. Histaminergic paracrine signaling from ependymal cells can exert differential effects on various neuronal subtypes based on proximity to the cerebral aqueduct and differential expression of histaminergic receptors. Notably, the histamine receptors <italic>Hrh1</italic> and <italic>Hrh3</italic> are expressed in 5-HT subtypes 5-HT-I, 5-HT-II, and 5-HT-III, which are all located in dorsal DRN subregions in close proximity to the cerebral aqueduct. In contrast, 5-HT-IV subtype neurons, which are in ventral subregions further from the aqueduct, do not express detectable levels of <italic>Hrh1</italic> and express <italic>Hrh3</italic> at very low levels. Enrichment of the G<sub>i</sub>-coupled <italic>Hrh3</italic> receptor in 5-HT-III further suggests that histamine may inhibit this subtype while increasing the excitability of 5-HT-I and 5-HT-II neurons. Release of peptides such as <italic>Pdyn</italic> from a subset of ependymal cells can also have differential effects dependent on the expression pattern of the Îº-opioid receptor. Additionally, ependymal cells may communicate via secretion of these transmitters and peptides into the CSF. Transmitters and peptides released into the ventricular system can have long range effects facilitated by the flow of CSF and signal to neuronal cells extending processes to the ventricular walls, including some 5-HT neurons, as well as non-neuronal cells including ventricular immune cells and choroid plexus cells.</p><p>We also found that pvMÎ¦s within or in close proximity to the DRN express the G<sub>i</sub>-coupled <italic>Htr1b</italic> receptor, unlike pvMÎ¦s in brain regions that do not contain 5-HT neurons. This suggests that pvMÎ¦s in different brain regions may be specialized via differential expression of neurotransmitter receptors to be specifically tuned to monitor their local environment and respond to changes in neuronal activity. Activation of G<sub>i</sub>-coupled pathways on pvMÎ¦s via 5-HT1B receptors is also a potential mechanism for the regulation of macrophage polarization and inflammatory responses by tonic 5-HT release within the DRN, which may be relevant to the increasing importance of neuroinflammatory pathways in the etiology of psychiatric disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brisch et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Howerton et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Watkins et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>The diversity of neuronal subtypes in and around the DRN also highlights the importance of elucidating local circuitry with knowledge of the molecular identity of both pre- and post-synaptic neurons. For direct signaling between 5-HT neurons, somatodendritic release of 5-HT and activation of inhibitory 5-HT1A receptors on adjacent 5-HT neurons is likely to mediate lateral inhibition between the 5-HT neurons of the same subtype, due to the spatial clustering of the subtypes. However, GABAergic and/or glutamatergic neurons may be excited by adjacent 5-HT neurons via activation of their 5-HT2C and 5-HT7 receptors to mediate indirect interactions between 5-HT neuron subtypes. These interactions may be either synergistic if mediated by glutamatergic neurons innervating other 5-HT subtypes, or antagonistic in a form of lateral inhibition via GABAergic interneurons. Subtype-specific connections between 5-HT neurons and local GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons can mediate interactions between different subsystems and may contribute to the contrasting and opposing functions ascribed to the DRN as a whole. Although 5-HT neurons have been reported to form local connections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Weissbourd et al., 2014</xref>), it is currently unknown how the 18 neuronal subtypes we have described are organized into local circuits. To generate models of these local circuits, the connectivity between DRN and ventrolateral PAG neurons will need to be mapped with subtype-level molecular resolution. This will likely require the use of retrograde tracing techniques with improved specificity for targeting neuronal subtypes in combination with spatial transcriptomic methods that are compatible with the large volume of the DRN. These methods can also be extended to examine the interactions between larger networks of 5-HT subsystems distributed across the raphe nuclei, which have been shown to be interconnected based on conditional anterograde tracing using intersectional targeting of 5-HT neurons originating from different embryonic rhombomeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bang et al., 2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>A 5-HT subsystem targeting basal ganglia circuits</title><p>The transcriptomic information we obtained on DRN 5-HT neuron subtypes allowed us to access a specific 5-HT subsystem that innervates circuits of the basal ganglia. We showed that the subsystem comprised of the <italic>Pdyn</italic>-enriched subtype 5-HT-III sends broad projections to both input and output nuclei of the basal ganglia, while avoiding other sensory and limbic structures, which have distinct functions from the basal ganglia and are likely to receive inputs from other DRN 5-HT neuron subtypes. Although we also showed that the basal ganglia receives inputs from multiple 5-HT neuron subtypes, particularly in the case of the Str-projecting subpopulation, the dense innervation of basal ganglia output nuclei by 5-HT-III neurons suggests that this 5-HT subsystem has a prominent role in the regulation of motor output and action selection through its effects on the activity of basal ganglia output nuclei. We also speculate that 5-HT release from this subsystem may have different effects on distinct output channels of the basal ganglia, given the differential expression of 5-HT receptors on distinct subpopulations of SNr and EP projection neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Saunders et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wallace et al., 2017</xref>). The targeting of distinct channels or subcircuits within the basal ganglia may also be consistent with the innervation of the striatum by multiple 5-HT neuron subtypes given the topographical arrangement of convergent cortical inputs into distinct domains within the striatum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hintiryan et al., 2016</xref>), since it is plausible that distinct striatal domains are each innervated by a different but functionally related 5-HT neuron subtype. Subcircuit-specific effects of 5-HT within the basal ganglia would also have implications on models for the function of 5-HT in decision-making and motor control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Miguelez et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Reed et al., 2013</xref>), although further work is needed to elucidate the structural and functional organization of these subcircuits in the basal ganglia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Calabresi et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Our results provide a resource for the design of intersectional strategies for the functional dissection of DRN cell types. The <italic>LSL-FSF-ReaChR:mCitrine</italic> intersectional reporter line that we used for conditional anterograde tracing will also be suitable for optogenetic perturbation experiments in vivo to investigate the circuit and behavioral functions of these distinct 5-HT subsystems. Greater spatial specificity can be achieved through the use of tapered optic fibers for site-specific light delivery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Pisanello et al., 2014</xref>), intersectional viral constructs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fenno et al., 2014</xref>) optimized for expression in cell types of interest, and the development of additional Cre and Flp recombinase driver lines with improved specificity to increase the number of subtypes and subsystems that can be accessed through genetic and molecular approaches. The functional studies facilitated by the development of these additional tools will provide further mechanistic insights into the coordinated action of distinct cell types and subsystems of the DRN

Virions were amplified from existing stocks in several rounds of low-MOI passaging through BHK-B19G cells by transferring filtered supernatant, with 3 to 4 days between passages a maximum of 3 passages. Cells were grown at 35Â°C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> in DMEM with GlutaMAX (Thermo Scientific, #10569010) supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated FBS (Thermo Scientific #10082147) and antibiotic-antimycotic (Thermo Scientific #15240â062). Media containing virions were collected at the end of the last passaging round and incubated with benzonase nuclease (1:1000, Millipore #70664) at 37Â°C for 30 min, followed by filtration through a 0.22 Âµm PES filter. Filtered supernatant was transferred to ultracentrifuge tubes (Beckman Coulter #344058) with 2 ml of a 20% sucrose in dPBS cushion and ultracentrifugated at 20,000 RPM (Beckman Coulter SW 32 Ti rotor) at 4Â°C for 2 hr.

The scalp was cleaned and sterilized before an incision was made to expose the skull, and sterile ophthalmic ointment was applied to the eyes. For leveling the horizontal plane, a stereotaxic alignment tool (David Kopf Instruments, Model 1905) was used to zero the relative dorsoventral displacement of Bregma and Lambda, as defined in the Paxinos and Franklin Mouse Brain Altas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Paxinos and Franklin, 2001</xref>), for adjusting tilt of the anterior-posterior axis, and of two points equidistant to the left and right of Bregma for adjusting the tilt of the medial-lateral axis. Craniotomies were prepared using a mounted drill (David Kopf Instruments, Model 1911) with careful removal of the bone flap and overlying dura using forceps and a fine needle tip, and were covered with sterile 0.9% saline before and during the injection to prevent desiccation. Viruses were front-filled into a pulled glass pipette (Drummond Scientific, #5-000-2005) filled with mineral oil (Millipore Sigma, M3516) and connected to a 5 Âµl Hamilton syringe (Hamilton #84850) via polyethylene tubing filled with mineral oil. Glass pipettes were pulled to obtain a tip size of approximately 40â60 Âµm on a pipette puller (Sutter Instrument Co., P-97). Viruses were infused into target regions at approximately 100 nl/min using a syringe pump (Harvard Apparatus, #883015), and pipettes were slowly withdrawn (&lt;10 Âµm/s) at least 10 min after the end of the infusion. Following wound closure, mice were placed in a cage with a heating pad until their activity was recovered before returning to their home cage. Mice were given pre- and post-operative oral carprofen (MediGel CPF, 5 mg/kg/day) as an analgesic, and monitored daily for at least 4 days post-surgery.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Stereotaxic injection coordinates and volumes</title><p>All coordinates are relative to Bregma along the anterior-posterior axis and medial-lateral axis, and relative to the pial surface along the dorsoventral axis. âBLâ denotes the distance between Bregma and Lambda (as defined in the Paxinos mouse brain atlas).

Mice were transcardially perfused with an ice-cold choline cutting solution containing neuronal activity blockers (110 mM choline chloride, 25 mM sodium bicarbonate, 12 mM D-glucose, 11.6 mM sodium L-ascorbate, 10 mM HEPES, 7.5 mM magnesium chloride, 3.1 mM sodium pyruvate, 2.5 mM potassium chloride, 1.25 mM sodium phosphate monobasic, 10 ÂµM (R)-CPP, 1 ÂµM tetrodotoxin, saturated with bubbling 95% oxygen/5% carbon dioxide, pH adjusted to 7.4 using sodium hydroxide). Brains were rapidly dissected out and sliced into 250 Âµm thick coronal sections on a vibratome (Leica Biosystems, VT1000) in a chilled cutting chamber filled with choline cutting solution. Coronal slices containing the DRN were then transferred to a chilled dissection dish containing a choline-based cutting solution for microdissection. Fiber tracts were used for guiding the microdissection but were excluded from the collected tissue chunk. Dissected tissue chunks were transferred to cold HBSS-based dissociation media (Thermo Fisher Scientific Cat. # 14170112, supplemented to final content concentrations: 138 mM sodium chloride, 11 mM D-glucose, 10 mM HEPES, 5.33 mM potassium chloride, 4.17 mM sodium bicarbonate, 2.12 mM magnesium chloride, 0.9 mM kynurenic acid, 0.441 mM potassium phosphate monobasic, 0.338 mM sodium phosphate monobasic, 10 ÂµM (R)-CPP, 1 ÂµM tetrodotoxin, saturated with bubbling 95% oxygen/5% carbon dioxide, pH adjusted to 7.35 using sodium hydroxide) supplemented with an additional inhibitor cocktail (10 ÂµM triptolide, 5 Âµg/ml actinomycin D, 30 Âµg/ml anisomycin) and kept on ice until dissections were completed. Dissected tissue chunks for each sample were pooled into a single tube for the subsequent dissociation steps. Tissue chunks were first mixed with a digestion cocktail (dissociation media, supplemented to working concentrations: 20 U/ml papain, 1 mg/ml pronase, 0.05 mg/mL DNAse I, 10 ÂµM triptolide, 5 Âµg/ml actinomycin D, 30 Âµg/ml anisomycin) and incubated at 34Â°C for 90 min with gentle rocking. The digestion was quenched by adding dissociation media supplemented with 0.2% BSA and 10 mg/ml ovomucoid inhibitor (Worthington Cat. # LK003128), and samples were kept chilled for the rest of the dissociation procedure. Digested tissue was collected by brief centrifugation (5 min, 300 <italic>g</italic>), re-suspended in dissociation media supplemented with 0.2% BSA, 1 mg/ml ovomucoid inhibitor, and 0.05 mg/mL DNAse I. Tissue chunks were then mechanically triturated using fine-tip plastic micropipette tips of progressively decreasing size. The triturated cell suspension was filtered in two stages using a 70 Âµm cell strainer (Miltenyi Biotec Cat # 130-098-462) and 40 Âµm pipette tip filter (Bel-Art Cat. # H136800040) and washed in two repeated centrifugation (5 min, 300 <italic>g</italic>) and re-suspension steps to remove debris before a final re-suspension in dissociation media containing 0.04% BSA and 15% OptiPrep (Sigma D1556). Cell density was calculated based on hemocytometer counts and adjusted to approximately 100,000 cells/ml. Single-cell encapsulation and RNA capture on the InDrop platform was performed at the Harvard Medical School ICCB Single Cell Core using v3 chemistry hydrogels based on previously described protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Zilionis et al., 2017</xref>). Suspensions were kept chilled until the cells were flowed into the microfluidic device. Libraries were prepared and indexed following the protocols referenced above, and sequencing-ready libraries were stored at â80Â°C. Libraries from different samples were pooled and sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq 500 (High Output v2 kits).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Sequencing data processing</title><p>NGS data were processed using aÂ previously published pipeline in Python available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/indrops/indrops">https://github.com/indrops/indrops</ext-link> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Klein et al., 2015</xref>). Briefly, reads were filtered by expected structure and sorted by the corresponding library index. Valid reads were then demultiplexed and sorted by cell barcodes. Cell barcodes containing fewer than 250 total reads were discarded, and remaining reads were aligned to a reference mouse transcriptome (Ensembl GRCm38 release 87) using Bowtie 1.2.2 (mÂ =Â 200, nÂ =Â 1, lÂ =Â 15, eÂ =Â 100). For alignment, the mouse transcriptome was modified with the addition of genes from the SAD B19 rabies viruses and transgenes (<italic>B19N, B19P, B19M, B19L, EGFP, tdTomato, AmCyan1</italic>). Aligned reads were then quantified as UMI-filtered mapped read (UMIFM) counts.

A custom R script was used to combine the expression data and metadata from all libraries corresponding to a single batch, and cells with fewer than 500 UMIFM counts were removed. The expression data matrix (Genes x Cells) was filtered to retain genes withÂ &gt;5 UMIFM counts, and then loaded into a <italic>Seurat</italic> object along with the library metadata for downstream processing. The percentage of mitochondrial transcripts for each cell (<italic>percent.mito</italic>) was calculated and added as metadata to the <italic>Seurat</italic> object. Cells in the object were further filtered using the following parameters: <italic>Reads â min. 20000, max.

Clustering was performed at varying resolution values, and we chose a final value of 2 for the resolution parameter for this stage of clustering. Clusters were assigned preliminary identities based on expression of combinations of known marker genes for major cell classes and types. A list genes used for identifying major cell classes and types is provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>. Low quality cells were identified based on a combination of low gene/UMIFM counts and high levels of mitochondrial and nuclear transcripts (e.g. <italic>Malat1</italic>, <italic>Meg3</italic>, <italic>Kcnq1ot1</italic>) typically clustered together and were removed. Following assignment of preliminary identities, cells were divided into data subsets as separate Seurat objects (neurons, astrocytes, ependymal cells, vascular cells, immune cells, oligodendrocytes and polydendrocytes) for further subclustering. The expression matrix for each data subset was further filtered to include only genes expressed by the cells in the subset (minimum cell threshold of 0.5% of cells in the subset).</p><p>Subclustering was performed iteratively on each data subset to resolve additional cell types and subtypes. Briefly, clustering was run at high resolution, and the resulting clusters were ordered in a cluster dendrogram built using the <italic>Ward2</italic> method in <italic>hclust</italic> using cluster-averaged gene expression for calculating the Eucliean distance matrix. Putative doublets/multiplets were identified based on co-expression of known marker genes for different cell types (e.g. neuronal and glial markers, or endothelial cell and pericyte markers). Putative doublets tended to separate from other cells and cluster together, and these clusters were removed from the dataset. Cluster separation was evaluated using the <italic>AssessNodes</italic> function and inspection of differentially expressed genes at each node. Clusters with poor separation, based on high OOBE scores and differential expression of mostly housekeeping genes, were merged to avoid over-separation of the data. The dendrogram was reconstructed after merging or removal of clusters, and the process of inspecting and merging or removing clusters was repeated until all resulting clusters could be distinguished based on a set of differentially expressed genes that we could validate separately. For small clusters that were previously identified in preliminary analysis of the separate batches, such as the <italic>Met</italic>-expressing 5-HT neuron subtype, or expected clusters based on existing literature, such as the <italic>Slc17a8</italic><sup>+</sup><italic>;Fev</italic><sup>-</sup> neurons, manual identification and clustering was performed if these cells were not separated by the clustering algorithm.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Differential expression tests</title><p>Tests for differential gene expression were performed using <italic>MAST</italic> version 1.4.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Finak et al., 2015</xref>) through the <italic><monospace>FindMarkersNode</monospace></italic> function in <italic>Seurat</italic> (<italic><monospace>logfc.thresholdÂ =Â 0.25</monospace>, <monospace>min.pctÂ =Â 0.1</monospace></italic>).

A spatial expression matrix for the differentially expressed (DE) genes was constructed using in situ hybridization images from the Allen Brain Atlas. Only DE genes with coronal imaging data were included in the matrix to achieve sufficient resolution along the dorsal-ventral and medial-lateral axes. For each gene, <italic>ISH</italic> images spanning the DRN were downsampled by a factor of 2 before registration and expression quantification using a custom MATLAB script. The midline of each slice was vertically aligned and centered, and images were and cropped to retain a region spanning approximately 1 mm across the midline containing the DRN. Cropped images were each assigned to a position along the anterior-posterior axis corresponding to a coronal section from the Allen Brain Atlas averaged coronal template (100 Âµm intervals). Expression was binarized by thresholding the image, and positive cells were detected using a Laplacian-of-Gaussian spot detection algorithm. Spatial expression patterns were obtained from two-dimensional histograms (bin sizeÂ =Â 50 Âµm x 50 Âµm) of positive cells counts in each slice. Fine alignment of each 2D histogram along the dorsal-ventral axis was adjusted manually using <italic>Tph2 ISH</italic> images as the reference. Anatomical landmarks visible in the Nissl or background stain, such as the cerebral aqueduct and fiber tracts, were used for the fine adjustment. Aligned histograms were cropped to retain a square region (36 bins x 36 bins) containing the DRN. Cropped 2D histograms were averaged with the left-right reflection, and the <italic>ISH</italic> count data for each experiment (36 bins x 36 bins x 12 sections) was unrolled into a row vector. Row vectors for the same gene were averaged, ignoring NaN values from missing <italic>ISH</italic> data, to obtain a single row vector for each gene. Row vectors for each gene were concatenated to generate the spatial expression matrix. The spatial expression matrix (Genes x Bins) was further filtered in two stages: bins with no <italic>Tph2</italic> expression were removed, and genes were filtered based on total expression and mean-normalized variance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated between the averaged gene expression of each 5-HT neuron subtype cluster from the scRNA-seq dataset and each spatial bin in the filtered spatial expression matrix.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Histology for anatomical tracing</title><p>Mice were deeply anesthetized with isoflurane and transcardially perfused with 5â10 ml chilled 0.1 M PBS, followed by 10â15 ml chilled 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M PBS.

Brains then were rapidly removed, frozen on dry ice, and embedded in tissue freezing media (Tissue-Tek O.C.T. compound). 20 Âµm coronal sections were prepared on a cryostat (Leica Biosystems, CM1950) and mounted onto SuperFrost Plus glass slides (VWR) at 100 Âµm intervals between slices in a set. Slices were rapidly refrozen once mounted, and stored at â80Â°C before staining. Multiplexed fluorescent in situ hybridization was performed using the ACDBio RNAscope V1 reagents and protocols. Briefly, slices were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4Â°C for 15 min and dehydrated through washing steps in ethanol at increasing concentrations (50%, 70%, 100%) before protease digestion (Protease III, 10 min at room temperature). Probes and amplification/detection reagents were applied to the tissue sections and incubated under conditions stated in the V1 detection protocol provided by ACDBio. Sections were counterstained using DAPI provided in the V1 detection reagent kits and mounted in ProLong Gold mounting media (ThermoFisher Scientific P36934). Single-plane tiled images covering the DRN were scanned using a confocal microscope (Leica SP8X, 1.40 NA 63X magnification oil immersion objective). Tile merging was performing in the Leica LAS X software, with a 10% tile overlap and statistical blending.</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title><italic>FISH</italic> image analysis</title><p>Confocal images were first processed in Fiji. A custom macro was written to convert Leica image files (.lif format) into TIFF format for downstream analysis steps. Channels in the merged tile images were processed separately. For each channel, a median filter (one pixel radius) was applied before images were cropped and downsampled by a factor of 2 with bicubic interpolation. A rolling ball background subtraction (50 pixel radius) was then applied before images for each channel was saved as a separate 8-bit TIFF file. A pixel classifier run in Ilastik (version 1.2.2) was applied on the output TIFF files to generate probability maps of <italic>B19N</italic>-expressing cell bodies for automated segmentation of rabies-infected cells. Cell segmentation and RNAscope puncta quantification was performed using a custom pipeline in CellProfiler (version 3.1.5). Puncta counts were exported as TSV files for further analysis and data visualization using custom scripts written in R and MATLAB.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank the Dymecki (HMS) and Lowell (BIDMC) Labs for generously providing transgenic mouse lines; the HMS ICCB Single Cell Core for assistance with scRNA-seq experiments on the InDrop platform; S Hrvatin and A Nagy (Greenberg Lab, HMS) for advice and help with scRNA-seq protocols and analysis pipelines; BK Lim (UCSD) and IR Wickersham (MIT) for advice and reagents for rabies virus production; the Bauer Core Facility at Harvard University for sequencing support; the HMS Neurobiology Imaging Facility for confocal microscopy support (P30 NS072030); and members of the Sabatini Lab for helpful discussions.

The raphe nuclei are implicated in many neuropsychiatric and neurological disorders and they hold one third of all serotonergic neurons of the brain. However, the structure and function of the region has been difficult to study given its extraordinary heterogeneity in neurochemical composition and anatomical organization. We are in need, therefore, of single cell datasets and studies like this one. In their manuscript &quot;Molecular and anatomical organization of the dorsal raphe nucleus&quot;, Huang and colleagues shed light on the complex anatomy and organization of the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) in the adult mouse. By performing single cell RNA-seq in dissected DRN region they produced an interesting dataset which encompasses neural and non-neural cell types present in and around DRN. Based on this transcriptomic data they identify 5 subtypes of 5-HT neurons and comprehensively study their anatomical and molecular characteristics. By analyzing the distribution of genes identified as differentially expressed on each of the putative subtypes they develop a map of their anatomical localization within the DRN. Then, they perform a series of experiments to explore whether 5-HT raphe neurons projecting to known targets (basal ganglia, cortex or thalamus) correspond to any of the subtypes identified. They show that the DR is composed of at least 5 distinct 5-HT neuronal types. In addition, the authors demonstrate that at least 2 distinct 5-HT neuronal types project to the striatum. Finally, they validate that a <italic>Pdyn</italic>-expressing 5-HT neurons (likely belonging to subtype III) strongly and specifically innervate various basal ganglia structures.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers have very positive comments about the study, but especially because this paper will be relied upon as a critical reference in the field, more validation is required for the existence of the 5 subtypes, particularly given the relatively low percentage of genes identified per cell with the single-cell RNA-seq. To achieve this, two approaches are indicated.</p><p>1) Additional <italic>FISH</italic> will be required to prove that the 5 claimed subtypes are correct and separate (in particular, the two very similar cell types 5-HT-I and II). Adding a reasonable quantitative would be adequate (e.g. 5-HT-IV x% out of all serotonergic neurons in a particular DRN subregion), and would be a good fit to Figure 4B. Preferably the authors will use at least one or two more specific markers for each cell subtype, showing similar anatomical distribution throughout the DRN and/or co-localization if possible.</p><p>2) Sten Linnarsson has recently published a scRNA-seq paper in Cell (Zeisel et al., 2018) in which they find TPH2<sup>+</sup> neurons. Those data were produced with deeper sequencing. It would elevate the importance of the findings in this manuscript considerably if the authors could use a bioinformatic comparison of their own cells with this publicly available database. First, they should mix together their own cells and those from the Linnarsson database and see if iterative machine learning splits them into the two original clusters; if so, this may then require further sequencing. If not, they then might go deeper with a larger number of cells to justify the existence of the 5 subgroups. The above pipeline could also be informative in retaining the &quot;peptidergic&quot; cluster. There is concern that the authors may be losing low-level expressed neurotransmitter synthesis genes.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Molecular and anatomical organization of the dorsal raphe nucleus&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

The work is expected to be widely used as a reference for this important brain region.</p><p>The reviewers are generally enthusiastic about this paper, and the substantial revisions to the original manuscript. They do, however, have some remaining concerns that we feel can be easily addressed.</p><p>We suggest a change in the Figure 4âfigure supplement 2. The Z-Score has the disadvantage that it only shows relative expression levels (colour code). In respect to expression differences this can be misleading. Thus, if you compare several different cell types (Figure 3B) the expression (here <italic>Tph2</italic> and <italic>Slc22a3</italic>) are quite uniform among the serotonergic neurons. If, however, the observed number of clusters is smaller (focus on serotonergic cells; Figure 4A), than the small expression differences suddenly appear huge for these two genes. Moreover, the authors state in the figure legend for Figure 4âfigure supplement 2 that &quot;â¦<italic>Prkcq<sup>+</sup>;Trh<sup>-</sup></italic> 5-HT neurons are putative 5-HT-II neurons.&quot;. This might be correct but has to be shown in another mean beside Z-score as both genes are shown to be expressed also in Cluster 2 (slightly lower compared to Cluster 1) in Figure 3B and even in 4A.</p><p>The reviewers agree that the paper would be stronger if the authors would add staining for <italic>Nfix</italic> or <italic>Slc6a1</italic> (Cluster 1; Figure 4) and <italic>Mkl2</italic> (Cluster 2 enriched), although we will leave this up to the authors. If no new stainings are added, however, the presentation of Z-scores should be changed to dotblot (or maybe barblot) format, as seen in other publications (e.g. Kupari et al., 2019, Cell Rep.). Dotblots allow the visualization of the percentage of cells expressing the gene in the separate clusters in addition to relative expression levels (colour code), while the bar blot approach shows the expression level of a gene for each single cell directly.</p><p>This presentation will allow the reader to determine whether expression differences are due to generally lower levels in the two clusters or to higher percentage of cells lacking the gene in Cluster 2. The Z-score does not allow this, and the TPH2 and <italic>Slc22a3</italic> results are examples of how the Z-Score can be misleading (Figure 3B and 4A).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46464.032</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers have very positive comments about the study, but especially because this paper will be relied upon as a critical reference in the field, more validation is required for the existence of the 5 subtypes, particularly given the relatively low percentage of genes identified per cell with the single-cell RNA-seq.

Preferably the authors will use at least one or two more specific markers for each cell subtype, showing similar anatomical distribution throughout the DRN and/or co-localization if possible.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for their positive comments and thoughtful feedback on our manuscript.</p><p>To address the concerns raised in Essential Revision #1, we have included additional data from <italic>FISH</italic> experiments to validate the differential expression of several subtype enriched genes and the results of our spatial correlation analysis. These results have been added to Figure 4G-I and an additional supplementary figure (Figure 4âfigure supplement 2 in our revised manuscript). For the quantitation of the proportion of 5-HT neurons expressing subtype-enriched genes in each DRN subregion, we have instead chosen to present this data as probability distributions of 5-HT neurons with detectable levels of the transcripts of interest (Figure 4I, Figure 4âfigure supplement 2E-F). We have refrained from performing this analysis since the boundaries between DRN subregions are poorly defined. This is further supported by our findings that 5-HT neurons expressing subtype enriched transcripts are not confined to well-defined DRN subregions, and are often found to be spatially intermingled despite having different peak density locations. This is consistent with the results of our spatial correlation analysis (Figure 5).</p><p>With regard to the validation of the 5-HT neuron subtypes by <italic>FISH</italic> experiments staining for subtype-specific marker genes, we wish to clarify the distinction between subtype enriched genes and subtype marker genes. Subtype marker genes are a subset of subtype enriched genes that are exclusively expressed in a given subtype, whereas subtype enriched genes may be expressed in other subtypes but at different levels that are still informative for discriminating between the two groups. While marker genes are indeed useful for validating a given cluster/subtype, given the strong expectation of a binary expression pattern, an inability to detect marker genes despite finding subtype enriched genes may result from technical limitations of high-throughput scRNA-seq methods (e.g. detection threshold, transient expression). Given the trade-off between sequencing depth and the number of cells sampled when using droplet-based scRNA-seq techniques, we have refrained from suggesting a list of marker genes for all subtypes and instead report the enriched genes that we have sufficient confidence in.</p><p>With regard to the validation of the separation of cells in the 5-HT-I and 5-HT-II clusters, we have provided additional <italic>FISH</italic> data in Figure 4âfigure supplement 2D in which we found that <italic>Trh<sup>+</sup></italic> cells are a subset <italic>Prkcq</italic><sup>+</sup> cells, as predicted from our sequencing data. We also found enriched genes for both clusters despite their similarities, and that cells in both clusters had comparable read depth and gene detection rates (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>). Therefore, the separation of 5-HT-I and 5-HT-II is unlikely to be due to insufficient sequencing of cells in either cluster, although methods that can achieve deeper sequencing will likely resolve further separation of the two.</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>UMI count and gene detection rate for 5-HT neuron clusters.</title><p>Violin plots for UMI counts (nUMI, left) and gene detection rate (nGene, right) for each of the 5 5-HT neuron clusters in our scRNA-seq dataset.

Those data were produced with quite deeper sequencing. It would elevate the importance of the findings in this manuscript considerably if the authors could use a bioinformatic comparison of their own cells with this publicly available database. First, they should mix together their own cells and those from the Linnarsson database and see if iterative machine learning splits them into the two original clusters; if so, this may then require further sequencing. If not, they then might go deeper with a larger number of cells to justify the existence of the 5 subgroups. The above pipeline could also be informative in retaining the &quot;peptidergic&quot; cluster. There is concern that the authors may be losing low-level expressed neurotransmitter synthesis genes.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that a comparison of our dataset with the dataset from Zeisel et al. (2018), which is one of the largest scRNA-seq datasets that contains DRN 5-HT neurons, will be very valuable. As such, we have performed additional analyses incorporating the 5-HT neurons in the Zeisel 2018 dataset and present our results and findings below. The R notebooks documenting the analyses are available on GitHub (Sabatini, 2019; copy archived at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/elifesciences-publications/DRN_scRNAseq_Huang2019">https://github.com/elifesciences-publications/DRN_scRNAseq_Huang2019</ext-link>).</p><p>The Zeisel et al. (2018) dataset contains 5-HT neurons from many other raphe nuclei besides the DRN. The level of clustering that we have performed on the 5-HT neurons in our dataset also goes further than described in the Zeisel et al., 2018, which did not subdivide the HBSER1 cluster into additional subclusters/subtypes. Zeisel et al. noted in their data portal that there is additional heterogeneity in expression of <italic>Nos1</italic>, which is enriched in 5-HT-III in our dataset, within the HBSER1 cluster. Furthermore, the HBSER1 cluster in the Zeisel 2018 dataset, which their spatial correlation analysis had predicted to localize to the DRN and/or MRN, contains fewer cells than our dataset (118 vs. 704 cells).</p><p>Additionally, we note that neurons in the Zeisel 2018 dataset that were assigned to the MEGLU14 cluster, which are likely to correspond to the peptidergic neurons in our dataset, showed near-zero expression of <italic>Slc17a8</italic> close to the noise floor. As such, we suspect that there was a potential error in the neurotransmitter calling for this cluster, rather than an inability to detect transcripts of <italic>Slc17a8</italic> or other neurotransmitter synthesis genes in our peptidergic neuron cluster.</p><p>To compare the DRN 5-HT neurons across both datasets, we first analyzed the 5-HT neurons in the Zeisel 2018 dataset to isolate DRN 5-HT neurons in their dataset. Clustering cells from the HBSER1-HBSER5 clusters independent of their pre-existing cluster identity assignments resulted in 6 clusters that differed from the assignment of 5 clusters by Zeisel et al. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2</xref>). We identified these clusters by examining the cluster-enriched genes and found that these 6 clusters correspond to the different subsets of 5-HT neurons from different embryonic rhombomeres as described by Okaty et al. (2015). Clusters in the Zeisel 2018 dataset included most of the 5-HT neuron groups described in Okaty et al. (2015) with the exception of R3-derived 5-HT neurons. We speculate that this is due to the relatively low sampling of 5-HT neurons in the Zeisel 2018 dataset relative to the number of 5-HT neurons in the CNS, and the low abundance of R3 neurons in the MRN.</p><fig id="respfig2"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>DRN 5-HT neurons are a subset of 5-HT neurons in the dataset from Zeisel et al.

All cells in our dataset were combined into one simulated pool since our dataset consisted of only R1-derived DRN neurons. The MDS plot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig3">Author response image 3</xref>) showed that the pooled RNA-seq samples from Okaty et al.

One approach that is similar to the method used by Tasic et al. (2018) is the removal of principal components that correspond to or correlate with quality control metrics, which would be PCs 1-3 in the merged dataset that we have analyzed here. Exclusion of PCs 1-3 from the calculation of the 2-dimensional UMAP embedding abolished the separation of cells by dataset and batch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig8">Author response image 8</xref>). Similar results were obtained when using CCA-based dataset alignment techniques that are available in the Seurat package (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig9">Author response image 9</xref>). Cells from the Zeisel 2018 dataset were found to co-cluster with the corresponding 5-HT neuron subtype clusters from our dataset (R1DR_lateral with 5-HT-I/II, and R1DR_medial with 5-HT-III/IV) using either method. These results suggest that the DRN 5-HT neurons in the Zeisel 2018 dataset exhibit additional heterogeneity in agreement with the subtypes that we have described in our study. However, inclusion of the small number of additional cells did not provide any significant improvements in resolving additional clusters beyond what we have already described.</p><fig id="respfig8"><label>Author response image 8.</label><caption><title>Cells from different datasets co-cluster after exclusion of PCs related to batch effects.</title><p>Exclusion of PCs 1-3 when generating a UMAP plot of the merged dataset removes the separation of cells by dataset and batch.

They do however, have some remaining concerns that we feel can be easily addressed.</p><p>We suggest a change in the Figure 4âfigure supplement 2. The Z-Score has the disadvantage that it only shows relative expression levels (colour code). In respect to expression differences this can be misleading. Thus, if you compare several different cell types (Figure 3B) the expression (here Tph2 and Slc22a3) are quite uniform among the serotonergic neurons. If, however, the observed number of clusters is smaller (focus on serotonergic cells; Figure 4A), than the small expression differences suddenly appear huge for these two genes. Moreover, the authors state in the figure legend for Figure 4âfigure supplement 2 that &quot;â¦Prkcq<sup>+</sup>;Trh<sup>-</sup> 5-HT neurons are putative 5-HT-II neurons.&quot;. This might be correct but has to be shown in another mean beside Z-score as both genes are shown to be expressed also in Cluster 2 (slightly lower compared to Cluster 1) in Figure 3B and even in 4A.</p><p>The reviewers agree that the paper would be stronger if the authors would add staining for Nfix or Slc6a1 (Cluster 1; Figure 4) and Mkl2 (Cluster 2 enriched), although we will leave this up to the authors. If no new stainings are added, however, the presentation of Z-scores should be changed to dotblot (or maybe barblot) format, as seen in other publications (e.g. Kupari et al., 2019, Cell Rep.). Dotblots allow the visualization of the percentage of cells expressing the gene in the separate clusters in addition to relative expression levels (colour code), while the bar blot approach shows the expression level of a gene for each single cell directly.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included dot plots showing expression of the genes in Figure 4A as log-transformed scaled UMI counts instead of Z-scored expression. These plots have been included in new supplements to both Figure 3 (Figure 3âfigure supplement 1) and Figure 4 (now Figure 4âfigure supplement 1). However, we note that these plots emphasize highly expressed genes over differentially expressed genes that may have fewer transcripts and which are more apparent in the heatmaps showing Z-scored relative expression.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>This presentation will allow the reader to determine whether expression differences are due to generally lower levels in the two clusters or to higher percentage of cells lacking the gene in Cluster 2. The Z-score does not allow this, and the TPH2 and Slc22a3 results are examples of how the Z-Score can be misleading (Figure 3B and 4A).</p></disp-quote><p>We respectfully disagree with our reviewers regarding their concern that relative expression levels presented as Z-scores are âmisleadingâ. Relative differences in expression across multiple genes are important for distinguishing cell types, and are collectively more informative than single âmarkerâ genes that exhibit strongly bimodal or binarized patterns of expression. The use of Z-scores in Figure 4, which takes into account the variance of expression of each gene, is intended to report these differences without biasing the reader towards genes with either âbinaryâ expression patterns or high expression, which are emphasized by the dot plot and suffer less from the effects of drop-outs characteristic of many scRNA-seq methods. Drop-outs cause these low copy number transcripts to appear has having a much lower fraction of cells expressing in the dot plot. The relative differences in the expression of highly expressed genes that the reviewers pointed to from Figure 3 are seen more easily with the centered Z-scored expression when making comparisons <italic>within</italic> the 5-HT neuron group (Figure 4), rather than across the full neuronal population (Figure 3). We also point out that we have observed with <italic>FISH</italic> the high but relatively lower expression of <italic>Slc6a4</italic> in 5-HT-V compared to the other four subtypes (see images in Figure 4âfigure supplement 3C of the revised manuscript). This observation from our <italic>FISH</italic> experiments supports the biological rather than purely technical nature of these differences that are highlighted by the Z-scores.</p></body></sub-article></article>
