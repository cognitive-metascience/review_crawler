It remains unclear whether the LC acts functionally as a single global effector or as discrete modules. Specifically, while spinal-projections from LC neurons can exert analgesic actions, it is not known whether they can act independently of ascending LC projections. Using viral vectors taken up at axon terminals, we expressed chemogenetic actuators selectively in LC neurons with spinal (<bold>LC<sup>:SC</sup></bold>) or prefrontal cortex (<bold>LC<sup>:PFC</sup></bold>) projections. Activation of the <bold>LC<sup>:SC</sup></bold> module produced robust, lateralised anti-nociception while activation of <bold>LC<sup>:PFC</sup></bold> produced aversion. In a neuropathic pain model, <bold>LC<sup>:SC</sup></bold> activation reduced hind-limb sensitisation and induced conditioned place preference. By contrast, activation of <bold>LC<sup>:PFC</sup></bold> exacerbated spontaneous pain, produced aversion and increased anxiety-like behaviour. This independent, contrasting modulation of pain-related behaviours mediated by distinct noradrenergic neuronal populations provides evidence for a modular functional organisation of the LC.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>noradrenaline</kwd><kwd>locus coeruleus</kwd><kwd>pain</kwd><kwd>endogenous analgesia</kwd><kwd>chemogenetics</kwd><kwd>attention</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010269</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>gr088373</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pickering</surname><given-names>Anthony E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000883</institution-id><institution>University of Bristol</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hirschberg</surname><given-names>Stefan</given-names></name><name><surname>Randall</surname><given-names>Andrew</given-names></name><name><surname>Pickering</surname><given-names>Anthony E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004410</institution-id><institution>European Molecular Biology Organization</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hirschberg</surname><given-names>Stefan</given-names></name><name><surname>Kremer</surname><given-names>Eric J</given-names></name><name><surname>Pickering</surname><given-names>Anthony E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The locus coeruleus is organised into functional modules with subsets of noradrenergic neurones independently projecting to the spinal cord and prefrontal cortex to exert discrete, antithetical modulatory actions on a range of pain-related behaviours.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Neuropathic pain has a population prevalence of 7–8% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bouhassira et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Torrance et al., 2006</xref>) and remains difficult to treat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Finnerup et al., 2015</xref>) mandating research to improve therapies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">von Hehn et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Skolnick and Volkow, 2016</xref>). Many of the frontline treatments for neuropathic pain modulate spinal noradrenaline, either directly such as noradrenaline re-uptake inhibitors or as part of a common effector pathway such as gabapentinoids and opioids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nakajima et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hayashida et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jasmin et al., 2003</xref>). A functional deficit of noradrenergic control is associated with the development of sensitisation in neuropathic pain models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hughes et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hughes et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">De Felice et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Xu et al., 1999</xref>). However, current systemic pharmacological interventions to correct this imbalance commonly produce CNS side-effects such as anxiety, sleep disturbance, mood shifts and confusion, limiting their therapeutic utility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Finnerup et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>The locus coeruleus (LC) is the principal noradrenergic nucleus in the CNS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dahlstroem and Fuxe, 1965</xref>) and is the main source of noradrenergic innervation to the spinal dorsal horn, forming part of a well-described analgesic circuit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Millan, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pertovaara, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Howorth et al., 2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bruinstroop et al., 2012</xref>). The LC also projects throughout almost the entire neuraxis and plays a pivotal role in diverse behaviours such as learning and memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Takeuchi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Martins and Froemke, 2015</xref>), strategic behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tervo et al., 2014</xref>), motivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Varazzani et al., 2015</xref>), and arousal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sara and Bouret, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carter et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Vazey and Aston-Jones, 2014</xref>). Furthermore, LC-derived noradrenaline is also causally linked to aversive states like stress, anxiety and depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">McCall et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alba-Delgado et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, drug treatments for chronic pain that globally enhance noradrenaline levels or mimic its action are likely to cause adverse effects by acting on LC neuronal circuits that are not directly involved in pain control.</p><p>The LC has been characterised as a homogeneous cluster of neurons that provide a uniform global signal as part of a central arousal system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fuxe et al., 2010</xref>). There is, however, accumulating evidence for specialisation of the LC neurons into subsets on the basis of: (1) anatomical projections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Loughlin et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kebschull et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chandler et al., 2014</xref>); (2) electrical properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chandler et al., 2014</xref>); and (3) co-transmitter content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Simpson and Lin, 2007</xref>). In accord with this organisational principle, we have demonstrated that distinct populations of LC noradrenergic neurons innervate the spinal cord (<bold>LC<sup>:SC</sup></bold>) and prefrontal cortex (<bold>LC<sup>:PFC</sup></bold>) based on anatomy and electrophysiology <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Li et al., 2016</xref>). Here, we selectively target LC neurons from their projections to the spinal cord or prefrontal cortex using the axon terminal uptake and retrograde transport of canine adenovirus type 2 (CAV-2) vectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Junyent and Kremer, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Li et al., 2016</xref>). This CAV-2 vector expresses a chemogenetic actuator in noradrenergic neurons specifically, to allow activation of <bold>LC<sup>:SC</sup></bold> or <bold>LC<sup>:PFC</sup></bold> neurons to test whether the beneficial noradrenergic analgesia and stress-like adverse effects seen in pain states are mediated by distinct subpopulations of LC neurons and are therefore dissociable.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Targeting and activation of noradrenergic LC neurons with PSAM</title><p>To enable selective activation of LC neurons, the excitatory chemogenetic receptor PSAM (<italic>Pharmaco- Selective Actuator Module, PSAM<sup>L141F,Y115F:5HT3HC</sup></italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Magnus et al., 2011</xref>]) was expressed in noradrenergic neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–B</xref>) using viral vectors with the cell-type-specific synthetic promotor PRSx8 (PRS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hwang et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lonergan et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Howorth et al., 2009a</xref>).

Selective activation of the <bold>LC<sup>:SC</sup></bold> or <bold>LC<sup>:PFC</sup></bold> modules produced distinct changes in behaviour that were functionally antithetical in the context of pain states. The activation of the <bold>LC<sup>:SC</sup></bold> neurons evokes an <italic>a</italic>2-adrenoceptor-mediated anti-nociceptive action that is analgesic in a model of chronic neuropathic pain. This amelioration of the pain phenotype by <bold>LC<sup>:SC</sup></bold> activation is seen for both evoked and spontaneous behaviour and was accompanied by reduced negative pain affect. In contrast, activation of the <bold>LC<sup>:PFC</sup></bold> produces an anxiety-like pattern of behaviour with negative affective valency and does not alter nociceptive sensitivity but instead increases expression of the signs of spontaneous pain after nerve injury.</p><p>Within the pain field, there has been a long interest in descending noradrenergic control which has been well characterised pharmacologically in vitro and in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Millan, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yoshimura and Furue, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pertovaara, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jones, 1991</xref>). However, it has been difficult to selectively engage this system either clinically or in animal models because of its anatomical location, nuclear organisation, and lack of pharmacological targets to enable differentiated control with drugs. Here, we use a chemogenetic engineering approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Magnus et al., 2011</xref>) to manipulate and investigate the system with systemic drug administration. In targeting the <bold>LC<sup>:SC</sup></bold> neurons, we see an anatomical organisation that is similar to that previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bruinstroop et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Howorth et al., 2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Li et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Westlund et al., 1983</xref>) with labelling in a cluster of around 15% of the LC neurons located in the ventral pole of the nucleus. <bold>LC<sup>:SC</sup></bold> activation in vivo was anti-nociceptive in a heat withdrawal assay that was lateralised to the side of CAV2<sup>PRS-EGFP-2A-PSAM</sup> vector injection in the spinal cord. This lateralised anti-nociceptive effect was in line with a clear ipsilateral spinal predominance (three-fold) in the anterogradely filled noradrenergic fibres. Given that LC neurons were transduced bilaterally in the pons after this unilateral injection (as previously noted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Howorth et al., 2009a</xref>]), this indicates that there is a novel lateralised functional organisation for the control of nociception.</p><p>In a neuropathic pain model, activation of the <bold>LC<sup>:SC</sup></bold> attenuated the degree of allodynia and hyperalgesia. This was seen for all sensory modalities tested and also applied to spontaneous measures of sensitisation i.e. foot-lifts. This beneficial effect of engaging the <bold>LC<sup>:SC</sup></bold> extends the findings from previous chronic intrathecal dosing studies with noradrenaline re-uptake inhibitors that also suppressed the neuropathic phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hughes et al., 2015</xref>). Given that we had documented a depletion of LC fibres in the spinal cord at the level of the nerve afferent input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hughes et al., 2013</xref>) then it was not known whether there would be the potential to restore noradrenergic inhibition with the retrograde chemogenetic strategy. The demonstration of preserved actions indicates that both release of noradrenaline and the <italic>a</italic>2-adrenoceptor mechanism required are still functional. Furthermore, by transducing the <bold>LC<sup>:SC</sup></bold> neurons with CAV2 after nerve injury we could still produce potent chemogenetic suppression of sensitisation. This provides proof of concept that such a retrograde targeting approach may be viable as a therapeutic strategy after neuropathic pain has developed.</p><p>Pain is an emotive experience and relief of pain is a strong learning signal with positive affective valence whereby animals display a preference for conditions where their pain is alleviated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">King et al., 2009</xref>). Therefore, the preference of nerve-injured animals for <bold>LC<sup>:SC</sup></bold> activation indicates that this was analgesic rather than simply suppressing a reflex motor withdrawal – this parallels previous studies with intrathecal clonidine/noradrenaline re-uptake inhibitors that have shown a conditioned place preference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hughes et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wei et al., 2013</xref>) or drive for self-administration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Martin et al., 2006</xref>). Additionally, no preference for <bold>LC<sup>:SC</sup></bold> activation was seen in naive rats, indicating that it is the analgesic action in the neuropathic model that has a positive valence rather than intrinsic rewarding effect of <bold>LC<sup>:SC</sup></bold> stimulation. This is consistent with the sparse forebrain innervation (particularly of reward-related sites) for these <bold>LC<sup>:SC</sup></bold> neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Howorth et al., 2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Li et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Engagement of the forebrain projecting <bold>LC<sup>:PFC</sup></bold> produced a contrasting profile without any action on evoked-nociception and evidence of a facilitation of spontaneous pain behaviours in the neuropathic pain model. Additionally, activation of the <bold>LC<sup>:PFC</sup></bold> was aversive and anxiogenic in both naive and neuropathic animals. This aversive action agrees with previous studies of the LC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">McCall et al., 2015</xref>) and may reflect high tonic levels of discharge produced by the chemogenetic activation approach. Such aversion and anxiety is a common component of chronic pain syndromes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Giamberardino and Jensen, 2015</xref>), which likely contributes to the hypervigilance and catastrophizing. An increase in noradrenaline in the PFC has been shown in neuropathic pain models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Suto et al., 2014</xref>) and has been associated with an impairment of attention. Similarly, lesion studies of the <bold>LC<sup>:PFC</sup></bold> have shown a reduction in pain associated anxiety and negative affect without any change in nociception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bravo et al., 2016</xref>) which supports our finding that activation of <bold>LC<sup>:PFC</sup></bold> produces negative affect and identifies this projection from the LC as a key player in the negative cognitive consequences of chronic pain.</p><p>These two opposing actions of the <bold>LC<sup>:SC</sup></bold> and <bold>LC<sup>:PFC</sup></bold> neurons to either suppress nociceptive input or to produce negative affective responses reflects the fact that they are distinct functional modules. This mirrors their anatomical segregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Li et al., 2016</xref>) and implies that the modules could be capable of independent action, with recruitment in different behavioural contexts. We speculate that it may be the balance between recruitment of the <italic>‘restorative’</italic> <bold>LC<sup>:SC</sup></bold> limb versus the <italic>‘alarmist’</italic> <bold>LC<sup>:PFC</sup></bold> projection that determines whether pain following an injury resolves or persists into chronic pain (see also [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arora et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brightwell and Taylor, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Taylor and Westlund, 2017</xref>]). Further the recruitment of either module may actually reciprocally inhibit the other given the <italic>a</italic>2-adrenoceptor-mediated feedback inhibition within the locus coeruleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aghajanian et al., 1977</xref>). This would also require each module to have different afferent drives that were independently regulated. At present, there is little evidence for such an organisation but this is an emerging territory for which the necessary neurobiological toolboxes are only now being developed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Schwarz et al., 2015</xref>). Their TRIO approach using CAV2 in combination with rabies vectors suggested that there was a distinction in the afferent innervation of the <italic>‘medullary projecting’</italic> LC neurons that we think likely represents collaterals from the <bold>LC<sup>:SC</sup></bold>. This provides preliminary evidence that such an input – output specialisation may be present within the LC.</p><p>Previous studies have employed subtractive methods to study the role of the LC in pain regulation in animal models. These methods using toxins, knock outs or lesions to inhibit the noradrenergic system typically show subtle and sometimes contradictory effects on nociception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Martin et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jasmin et al., 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tsuruoka and Willis, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Howorth et al., 2009b</xref>). This may be in part ascribed to the long-term adaptation to the loss of a population of neurons. However, our findings of antithetical LC actions reported herein (and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hickey et al., 2014</xref>) provide an alternative explanation; namely that the LC is not a single functional entity with respect to pain regulation. Rather there are counterbalancing actions of individual modules and consequently the net effect of subtractive interventions will be difficult to predict/interpret. This consideration also applies to attempts to obtain therapeutic benefit from systemic dosing of noradrenaline re-uptake inhibitors in patients – while some benefit, a majority either obtain no benefit or suffer side effects that are often related to anxiety, changes in affect and sleep disturbances that are likely due to actions on ascending LC projections. Our findings indicate that targeting just the spinal projection could separate analgesia from many of the side effects.</p><p>In demonstrating this functional and anatomical dichotomy within the LC modules, we have provided behavioural evidence that indicates that the LC has levels of sub-specialisation according to modalities. This builds upon prior work indicating anatomical and cellular specialisation within the LC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Loughlin et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kebschull et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chandler et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Howorth et al., 2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Li et al., 2016</xref>). The LC has been implicated in diverse neuronal behaviours such as learning and memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Takeuchi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Martins and Froemke, 2015</xref>), strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tervo et al., 2014</xref>), arousal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carter et al., 2010</xref>) and anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">McCall et al., 2015</xref>). For each example, the role of the LC in that behaviour has been considered as acting on a specific CNS substrate (i.e. hippocampus, auditory cortex, prefrontal cortex and amygdala) by inference somewhat in isolation. We speculate that the organisation of the LC outputs into modules allows these influences in different behavioural contexts to be independently selected and regulated. Given this organisational structure, it may be that that the <italic>Locus Coeruleus</italic> would be more appropriately named <italic>Loci Coeruleus</italic> reflecting the fact that it appears to be a collection of noradrenergic modules each with distinctive paths and roles in regulating brain function.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resource table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent or Resource</th><th valign="top">Source</th><th valign="top">Identifier</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td colspan="3" valign="top">Antibodies</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><bold>Chicken polyclonal anti-EGFP</bold></td><td valign="top">Abcam</td><td valign="top">#AB13970</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><bold>Mouse monoclonal anti</bold> <break/> <bold>Dopamine-β-hydroxylase (DBH)</bold></td><td valign="top">Chemicon</td><td valign="top">#MAB308 RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2245740">AB_2245740</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><bold>Rabbit monoclonal anti-HA tag</bold></td><td valign="top">Cell Signalling</td><td valign="top">#C29F4 RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_10693385">AB_10693385</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3" valign="top"> Chemicals, Peptides and Recombinant Proteins</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><bold>(Z)−4-Hydroxytamoxifen</bold></td><td valign="top">Sigma</td><td valign="top">H7904</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><bold>urethane (ethyl carbamate)</bold></td><td valign="top">Sigma</td><td valign="top">#U2500</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><bold>PSEM308/89S</bold></td><td valign="top">Initially: Peter Lee from Sternson group Subsequently: <break/>Custom synthesis by Apex Scientific Inc</td><td valign="top">N/A</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><bold>Yohimbine hydrochloride</bold></td><td valign="top">Tocris</td><td valign="top"># 1127</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><bold>Reboxetine mesylate</bold></td><td valign="top">Tocris</td><td valign="top"># 1982</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><bold>Atipamezole hydrochloride</bold></td><td valign="top">Pfizer, Antisedan</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td colspan="3" valign="top"> Recombinant DNA</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><bold>rAAV-syn::FLEX- rev::PSAML141F,</bold> <break/><bold>Y115F:5HT3HC- IRES-GFP</bold></td><td valign="top">Addgene</td><td valign="top">32477</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><bold>pCAVΔE3Sce</bold></td><td valign="top">Kremer lab</td><td valign="top">N/A</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><bold>pCMV-EGFP-2A-PSAM HA</bold></td><td valign="top">GeneArt AG</td><td valign="top">N/A</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3" valign="top"> Cell lines</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><bold>Lenti-X293T cells</bold></td><td valign="top">Clonetech</td><td valign="top"># 632180, identity confirmed by manufacturer <break/>and certified as mycoplasma free</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><bold>BJ5183 cells</bold></td><td valign="top">Agilent Technologies</td><td valign="top"># 50-125-019, # 632180, identity confirmed by <break/>manufacturer and certified as mycoplasma free</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><bold>DK-SceI</bold></td><td valign="top">Kremer lab</td><td valign="top">Mycoplasma free.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3" valign="top"> Software and Algorithms</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><bold>Ethovision ET</bold></td><td valign="top">Noldus</td><td valign="top">N/A</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><bold>Photoshop CS5</bold></td><td valign="top">Adobe</td><td valign="top">N/A</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><bold>Illustrator CS5</bold></td><td valign="top">Adobe</td><td valign="top">N/A</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><bold>Prism7</bold></td><td valign="top">GraphPad</td><td valign="top">N/A</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><bold>Excel</bold></td><td valign="top">Microsoft</td><td valign="top">N/A</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><bold>A plasmid Editor (ApE v2.0.51)</bold></td><td valign="top">M.

All behavioural experiments were performed under red light conditions during the active dark phase of the cycle. Male Wistar rats from the University of Bristol colony were used for slice electrophysiology with vector injection at postnatal day 21 and subsequent use in experiments 10–14 days later. For behavioural assays and in vivo electrophysiology, male Wistar rats (120–200 g, Charles River), randomly assigned to experimental groups, and injected with the appropriate vector. The observer was blind to both the experimental groups and injected solution for all behavioural experiments. All surgical procedures were carried out under aseptic conditions and animals were maintained at 37°C on a homeothermic pad. All animals in nerve injury experiments were single housed. Brainstem tissue from all vector injected animals was histologically analysed post hoc to confirm transduction of LC neurons (EGFP expression). Out of 85 animals, 4 were excluded from the analysis because of low transduction (&lt;10 EGFP labelled neurons) (See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplemental file 1</xref> for details of animal group allocations).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Method details</title><sec id="s4-2-1"><title>Generation of LV<sup>PRS-EGFP-2A-PSAM</sup></title><p>The chemogenetic excitatory ionophore PSAM<sup>L141F,Y115F:5HT3HC</sup> (PSAM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Magnus et al., 2011</xref>) was obtained in inverted orientation from Addgene (#32477). This sequence information was used to (1) generate a CMV promotor driven expression plasmid by excising the PSAM-IRES-EGFP cassette with BsrGI/NheI and subsequent ligation into the pre-cut expression plasmid (BsrGI/NheI) which caused the flip in sense orientation and (2) to design (using ApE) a HA tagged (8 C-terminal amino acids) version of PSAM in the EGFP-2A-PSAM<sub>HA</sub> expression cassette with the objective of producing stronger EGFP fluorescence whilst PSAM receptor function is no different to the original cassette (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

The virus containing supernatant was collected on 3 consecutive days post transfection, pooled and concentrated by ultracentrifugation. The titre, measured in transducing units (TU/ml), was assayed by establishing the infection rate of an LV produced in parallel and harbouring the expression cassette for placental alkaline phosphatase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hewinson et al., 2013</xref>).

Rats were deeply anesthetized with isoflurane 5%, decapitated and the brain quickly removed and immediately chilled in ice-cold cutting solution (similar to the recording solution but NaCl was reduced from 126 mM to 85 mM and substituted with sucrose 58.4 mM) and the brainstem blocked. Horizontal slices (300–350 μm thick) of the pons were cut from dorsal to ventral using a vibratome (Linearslicer Pro 7; DSK) in cold (4°C) cutting solution. After cutting, slices were kept at room temperature in carbogenated recording solution (NaCl 126 mM, KCl 2.5 mM, NaHCO<sub>3</sub> 26 mM, NaH<sub>2</sub> PO<sub>4</sub> 1.25 mM, MgCl<sub>2</sub> 2 mM, CaCl<sub>2</sub> 2 mM, and D-glucose 10 mM saturated with 95%O<sub>2</sub> /5%CO<sub>2</sub> , pH7.3, osmolality 290 mOsm/L) for at least 1 hr to recover before recording. Pontine slices were transferred into the recording chamber of an upright fluorescence microscope (DMLFSA; Leica Microsystems), superfused with artificial CSF at a rate of 4–8 ml/min heated to 35°C. Borosilicate glass patch pipettes (Harvard Apparatus GC120F-10, resistances of 4–6 MΩ) were filled with internal solution (K-gluconate 130 mM, KCl 10 mM, Na-HEPES 10 mM, MgATP 4 mM, EGTA 0.2 mM, and Na<sub>2</sub>GTP 0.3 mM). Cells were identified under gradient contrast illumination and examined for transduction by epifluorescence illumination. Whole cell voltage and current clamp recordings were obtained with a Multiclamp 700 A amplifier (Axon instruments). All membrane potentials were corrected for a junction potential of 13 mV. Drugs were infused in the bath solution. Spike2 software (CED, Cambridge Electronic Design) was used to acquire and store data.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-2"><title>In vivo extracellular recordings from the locus coeruleus and local application of PSEM308</title><p>Anaesthesia was induced with 1.2–2 g/kg urethane (Sigma) i.p to achieve loss of paw withdrawal reflex. Once induced, urethane anaesthesia typically remained stable for 5–7 hr. The animal was placed in a stereotaxic frame, the skull exposed and the screw above the viral injection site removed to gain access to the CNS. In vivo single units were recorded with preloaded quadruple-barrelled microelectrodes (Kation Scientific, Carbostar-4 recording/iontophoresis microelectrode, E1041 standard) connected to a drug injector (Parker, Picospritzer II). Recordings were referenced against a silver chloride electrode pellet that was inserted between muscles and skin near the recording site. Neuronal activity was recorded via a Multiclamp 700A amplifier (with #CV-7b headstage, Axon instruments) filtered at 3 kHz and digitized at 10 kHz using a 1401micro and Spike2 software (CED, Cambridge Electronic Design) was used to store data and to control the drug delivery. Locus coeruleus cells were identified by their wide (~1 ms), large amplitude action potentials, the slow spontaneous firing frequency (0.5–5 Hz) and a characteristic burst of action potentials in response to contralateral hind-paw pinch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hickey et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cedarbaum and Aghajanian, 1976</xref>).

The animal was placed in a stereotaxic frame and the spinal cord stabilised with two spinal clamps at T1 and L5 and a bath was formed by skin elevation. Warmed (36˚C), Krebs solution was used to continually superfuse the spinal cord (NaCl 117 mM, KCl 3.6 mM, NaHCO<sub>3</sub> 25 mM, NaH<sub>2</sub> PO<sub>4</sub> 1.2 mM, MgCl<sub>2</sub> 1.2 mM, CaCl<sub>2</sub> 2.5 mM and D-glucose 11 mM saturated with 95%O<sub>2</sub> /5%CO<sub>2</sub> , pH7.3, osmolality 290 mOsm/L). The dura mater was removed under binocular vision (Leica MZ6). A reference electrode (World Precision Instruments, Ag/AgCl Electrode pellets, EP2) was inserted into the muscle layer near the recording area and spinal units were recorded with a stainless-steel microelectrode (FHC, UESSEGSEFNNM, 8–8.8 MΩ) that was positioned ~500 µm from the midline. Neuronal activity was amplified and low-pass filtered at 3 kHz using a Multiclamp 700A amplifier (Axon instruments with #CV-7b headstage). The data were digitized at 10 kHz (CED Power1401) and stored using Spike2 software (CED, Cambridge Electronic Design). Pinch was applied from custom calibrated forceps with tip pads of area 3.5 mm<sup>2</sup>. These forceps were used to ensure that the pinch stimulus was standardised between applications and across animals. The forceps were equipped with strain gauges and a pinch pressure of 70 g mm<sup>-2</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Drake et al., 2014</xref>) was used throughout all experiments to compare pinch-evoked neuronal activity (NB this pressure was above the threshold for pain when applied to the experimenter’s index finger).</p><p>Wide dynamic range (WDR) neurons were identified in the deep dorsal horn by graded responses to both non-noxious touch and noxious pinch. Their discharge frequency was measured in response to light touch with a brush or to sustained pinch pressure over five second time bins immediately after stimulus application. Extracellular recording data from four spinal cord neurons were excluded from analysis because the recording was interrupted before completion of the experimental protocol.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Tibial nerve transection model</title><p>Rats were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of ketamine (5 mg/100 g, Vetalar; Pharmacia, Sweden) and medetomidine (30 μg/100 g, Domitor; Pfizer) until loss of paw withdrawal reflex. A 1.5–2 cm long skin incision was made in the right hind leg in line with the femur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pertin et al., 2012</xref>). The fascial plane between the gluteus superficialis and the biceps femoris was located and blunt dissected to expose the three branches of the sciatic nerve (i.e. common peroneal, sural and tibial nerves). The tibial nerve was carefully exposed. Subsequently, two tight ligations (5–0 silk) were made approximately 2 mm apart and the neve segment in between transected and removed. The nerve and muscle were placed back into the correct position and the skin sutured. For sham surgery, the same procedure without ligation and transection of the tibial nerve was performed.</p><sec id="s4-4-1"><title>Intrathecal injection after nerve injury</title><p>The injection procedure was similar to a previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">De la Calle and Paíno, 2002</xref>) Rats, 6 weeks post-TNT (400–500 g), were briefly induced with isoflurane in medical oxygen before transferring into a face mask with 1.5–2% isoflurane. The rat was placed in prone position on a 5 cm tall plastic board so that the hind legs hang over the board to arch the lower back and to open the intervertebral space between L4-L5 spinal segments. Subsequently, a 25G needle was inserted transcutaneously to the vertebral canal (typically producing a tail twitch) and 10–20 µl of vehicle or yohimbine (3 µg/µl in sterile saline with 20% DMSO) injected. PSEM308 was injected i.p immediately after recovery from anaesthesia and sensory testing began 30 min thereafter.</p><p>As previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hughes et al., 2013</xref>), we observed that the mechanical withdrawal thresholds fell in the contralateral paw after intrathecal injection of yohimbine in nerve injured animals.

The radiant heat source (Ugo Basile Plantar test) was focused onto the plantar surface of the hind paw and the time to withdrawal recorded from 40 min before and up to 60 min after intraperitoneal injection of the selective agonist PSEM308 or saline. Each withdrawal value was the mean of two tests and tests were repeated every 15 min. A 24 s cut-off value was used to avoid tissue damage.

Animals were habituated to the Plexiglas chamber with their hind paws on two force transducers in four sessions (each lasting 3 min) on 2 consecutive days. Measures were taken 45 min after injection of PSEM308 or saline. The percentage of weight borne on the injured leg was averaged over these four measures.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-8"><title>Conditioned place preference/aversion</title><p>All rats were habituated to an unbiased three-compartment box, which contained a central neutral chamber with different association chambers either side. Note, two designs of box were employed the first for naive animals had a central chamber between the two conditioning chambers however in the course of these experiments two animals learnt how to escape the arena (and were excluded). Therefore, we modified this arrangement with higher walls and an offset connecting corridor between the two otherwise similar conditioning chambers for the nerve injured animals which adequately contained the animals and reduced the amount of time spent in the neutral chamber.</p><p>The conditioning compartments have visual and tactile cues e.g. ‘bars’ or perforated ‘holes’ as flooring and differently patterned (but equal luminosity) wallpapers to maximise differentiation between the compartments. On the first day of the experiment animals were allowed to roam freely through all three compartments and a Basler camera (acA1300-60 gm) with a varifocal lens (Computar H3Z4512CS-IR) connected to EthovisionXT (Noldus) was used to record the time rats spent in either of the outer compartments as a baseline value. Subsequently, rats underwent four conditioning sessions in which the outside compartments were paired with PSEM308 injection or saline injection. Two pairing sessions per day at least 4 hr apart on two consecutive days were conducted in a counterbalanced design. For each conditioning session the animals were placed into the locked conditioning compartment 5 min after the i.p injection and left for 30 min. On the test day, the doors between the compartments were opened and the time spent in the conditioning compartments measured once more. It is expected that the choice of the animal’s preferred environment in the post-test is influenced according to the valence of the chemogenetic stimulation. Noldus EthoVision XT was used to analyse recorded videos and to quantify the time animals spent in the paired chambers.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-9"><title>Open-field test</title><p>On the first day of testing animals were randomly assigned into two groups and received PSEM308 or saline 20–25 min before placing the subjects into the open-field arena (56.5 × 56.5 cm with an inner zone of 30 × 30 cm) for 6 min. Exploration behaviour (distance travelled, location in central/perimeter areas and immobility (velocity &lt; 1.75 cm/s)) was tracked for 5 min starting 60 s after entering the arena using EthoVisionXT.

and accompanying author responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Engagement of spinal- vs prefrontal-projecting locus coeruleus neurons parses analgesia from aversion &amp; anxiety in rats&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors and the evaluation has been overseen by Gary Westbrook as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous. The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript is a comprehensive and interesting manuscript that examines the functional organization of different regions of the locus coeruleus. The authors assessed the consequences of selective chemogenetic activation of the nor-adrenergic LC projections to the spinal cord or to the prefrontal cortex on modulation of pain and in eliciting either positive or negative affective states. The viral approach to localizing virus to descending vs PFC projections is impressive and convincing. The authors evaluated the animals in a neuropathic pain model produced by tibial nerve transection, which results in a mechanical and cold hypersensitivity.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>In the course of your revision, we ask that additional experimental information be provided.</p><p>1) There is a discrepancy, albeit an interesting one, between the effect of LC stimulation in the CPA test, indicative of an effect on ongoing pain, and the lack of effect of LC stimulation on spontaneous activity of dorsal horn neurons. In a revised submission we ask that you examine the effect of LC stimulation on spontaneous and evoked dorsal horn activity in the nerve injury model, which will significantly supplement the findings in the absence of injury.</p><p>2) In addition, in order to ensure that this is a noradrenergic action, we ask the behavioral effects of atipamezole be tested in the injury condition.</p><p>3) Lastly, you note that there was no difference in total distance traveled in the open field test, but that doesn't really measure subtle changes in motor activity. Subtle motor dysfunction could incorrectly leave an impression of anti-nociception. A more appropriate assay for subtle changes in motor function would entail the rotorod. This experiment is essential in any pain tests where reflex withdrawal endpoints are used, and likely also when counting spontaneous lifts.</p><p>4) Although the reporting requirements of ARRIVE are largely addressed, there is no explanation for widely different sample sizes in simple, two-group experiments. Whether and how many animals were used in multiple studies is not mentioned. The reporting would be significantly improved by inclusion of CONSORT diagrams for animals in the study overall and within individual experiments in Supplementary Data. Please explicitly state that experiment-wide error, even with outcomes which would be expected to co-vary, was not considered in this study. Although you need not present this, one could calculate the likelihood that exact replication of the conditions by yourself in your own lab of all these experiments would have a &lt;10% chance of finding all the results which are currently statistically significant to still be significant.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29808.027</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions</p><p>1) There is a discrepancy, albeit an interesting one, between the effect of LC stimulation in the CPA test, indicative of an effect on ongoing pain, and the lack of effect of LC stimulation on spontaneous activity of dorsal horn neurons.</p></disp-quote><p>We don’t see this as being a discrepancy. In the naïve animal (without nerve injury) there is no noxious stimulation under resting conditions so the ongoing activity in the WDR neurons in the anaesthetised state does not represent input from nociceptors. Therefore, there is no ongoing activity from nociceptors for activation of the LC to block (only the evoked responses to noxious stimuli). In the behavioural tests in naïve animals, activation of the LC neurons projecting to the spinal cord (LC<sup>:SC</sup>) shows no effect in the conditioned place aversion assay again because there is no spontaneous pain to block – so no positive affective consequence. We believe that these findings therefore are entirely consistent.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In a revised submission we ask that you examine the effect of LC stimulation on spontaneous and evoked dorsal horn activity in the nerve injury model, which will significantly supplement the findings in the absence of injury.</p></disp-quote><p>Notwithstanding the points made above we have undertaken this additional investigation and have added the cell recording data and an additional figure to the manuscript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). We show in nerve injured animals that WDR neurons in the dorsal horn (n=21) respond to brush, pinch, cold and von Frey hairs with increases in activity (as would be expected given the allodynic sensitisation). These evoked responses are all reversibly diminished by activation of the LC<sup>:SC</sup> projection. This attenuation is blocked by atipamezole. This data is now included in the results (subsection “Engagement of LC<sup>:SC</sup> module attenuates neuropathic sensitisation via α2-adrenoceptors”) and significantly supplements our findings. Note we did not find any effect on spontaneous discharge suggesting that the LC<sup>:SC</sup> is acting to suppress afferent inputs to the WDR but is not causing direct inhibition of the WDR neurons themselves.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In addition, in order to ensure that this is a noradrenergic action, we ask the behavioral effects of atipamezole be tested in the injury condition.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now added tests of the effect of atipamezole (50µg) on the behavioural responses. We had already tested the α2-antagonist Yohimbine in this paradigm and have now shown that Atipamezole, a more selective, but shorter acting, α2–antagonist has an identical effect on behaviour in blocking the effects of LC<sup>:SC</sup> activation on evoked responses in nerve injured animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). This is in agreement with the new data that we have also provided from the cell recordings in TNT animals where the effect of LC<sup>:SC</sup> activation is blocked by atipamezole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). This provides robust evidence that these effects are mediated by α2 adrenoceptors and is consistent it being a noradrenergic action.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Lastly, you note that there was no difference in total distance traveled in the open field test, but that doesn't really measure subtle changes in motor activity.

This experiment is essential in any pain tests where reflex withdrawal endpoints are used, and likely also when counting spontaneous lifts.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now undertaken rotarod testing. The tibial nerve injured animals have an impaired ability to perform the rotarod test – as we would expect. The activation of the LC<sup>:SC</sup> neurons has no significant effect on their ability to perform the test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). We do not therefore find any evidence for a motor impairment that could account for the change in behaviour with LC<sup>:SC</sup> activation, strengthening the case that it is indeed an analgesic action.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Although the reporting requirements of ARRIVE are largely addressed, there is no explanation for widely different sample sizes in simple, two-group experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>Unfortunately, these are not simple experiments given the need for vector injections +/- nerve injury with the repeated administration of drugs and behavioural tests over a period of 4–7 weeks. The main reason for the differences in group sizes is that some animals failed to complete a part of the planned protocol or were found on post-hoc histology to have not been successfully transduced. Also, the power to resolve differences varied across the scales of investigation from single cells to whole animal behaviour which meant that different group sizes were required.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Whether and how many animals were used in multiple studies is not mentioned. The reporting would be significantly improved by inclusion of CONSORT diagrams for animals in the study overall and within individual experiments in Supplementary Data.</p></disp-quote><p>CONSORT diagrams would not work especially well for our study design but we have included this data in a set of animal usage tables that transparently indicates how many animals entered each study protocol and which ones were excluded with reasons (N=4 in total for poor or absent transduction and N=2 from one test protocol).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Please explicitly state that experiment-wide error, even with outcomes which would be expected to co-vary, was not considered in this study. Although you need not present this, one could calculate the likelihood that exact replication of the conditions by yourself in your own lab of all these experiments would have a &lt;10% chance of finding all the results which are currently statistically significant to still be significant.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s point regarding reproducibility which is an important topic for biomedical researchers across all disciplines. However, we note that we are not testing multiple different null hypotheses in this study. In essence, we have a single null hypothesis which is that there is no difference in the action of the LC neurons projecting to the PFC and spinal cord on pain related behaviour. We then perform multiple experiments to assess whether we can reject this null hypothesis. Therefore, most of the tests are far from independent and are closely interrelated. Indeed, one could flip this train of thought around ask ‘would our findings be undermined if one or two or even three of our statistically significant results were to breach the 5% threshold and therefore be lost?’ We would argue that even in this worst case they would likely would not change our basic conclusions that the null hypothesis is to be rejected based on the multiple other lines of evidence indication orthogonal differences between the subsets of LC neurons, but it would make us slightly more cautious in our interpretation. We believe that this is the value of the combination of methods within the study rather than a weakness as the reviewer’s comment seems to imply. Furthermore, this study is a continuation of a line of experiments in our group (and those of several other labs) since 2009 in our case that have provided multiple lines of experimental evidence that have been building towards this study – we have indeed, in the course of this study, been able to replicate and extend several of our key previous findings. Note also that many of our analyses have used ANOVA and post-hoc testing which takes account of the multiple testing issue. On this basis, even though our findings reveal a remarkable influence of noradrenergic neurons on nociception and negative affect we have confidence that these results are robust and will be replicable both by ourselves, as we endeavour to take these ideas towards translation, and by others.</p></body></sub-article></article>
