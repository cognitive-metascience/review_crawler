TETs stably associate with and are post-translationally modified by the nutrient-sensing enzyme OGT, suggesting a connection between metabolism and the epigenome. Here, we show for the first time that modification by OGT enhances TET1 activity in vitro. We identify a TET1 domain that is necessary and sufficient for binding to OGT and report a point mutation that disrupts the TET1-OGT interaction. We show that this interaction is necessary for TET1 to rescue hematopoetic stem cell production in tet mutant zebrafish embryos, suggesting that OGT promotes TET1â€™s function during development. Finally, we show that disrupting the TET1-OGT interaction in mouse embryonic stem cells changes the abundance of TET2 and 5-methylcytosine, which is accompanied by alterations in gene expression. These results link metabolism and epigenetic control, which may be relevant to the developmental and disease processes regulated by these two enzymes.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>TET</kwd><kwd>OGT</kwd><kwd>epigenetics</kwd><kwd>chromatin</kwd><kwd>stem cells</kwd><kwd>development</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P30 CA008748</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Cheng</given-names></name><name><surname>Goll</surname><given-names>Mary</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000900</institution-id><institution>California Institute for Regenerative Medicine</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>TG2-01153</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hrit</surname><given-names>Joel</given-names></name><name><surname>Panning</surname><given-names>Barbara</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 GM088506</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Cheng</given-names></name><name><surname>Goll</surname><given-names>Mary</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Geoffrey Beene Cancer Research Center of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Goll</surname><given-names>Mary</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The epigenetic regulator TET1 is regulated by the nutrient-sensing enzyme OGT in vitro and in cells.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Methylation at the 5â€™ position of cytosine in DNA is a widespread epigenetic regulator of gene expression.

Two studies in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) have suggested that TET1 and OGT may be intimately linked in regulation of gene expression, as depleting either enzyme reduced the chromatin association of the other and affected expression of its target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Vella et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shi et al., 2013</xref>). However, it is unclear to what extent these genome-wide changes are direct effects of perturbing the TET1-OGT interaction. Further work is necessary to uncover the biological importance of the partnership between TET1 and OGT.</p><p>In this work, we map the interaction between TET1 and OGT to a small C-terminal region of TET1, which is both necessary and sufficient to bind OGT. We show for the first time that OGT modifies the catalytic domain of TET1 in vitro and enhances its catalytic activity. We also use mutant TET1 to show that the TET1-OGT interaction promotes TET1 function in the developing zebrafish embryo. Finally, we show that in mESCs a mutation in TET1 that impairs its interaction with OGT results in alterations in gene expression and in abundance of 5mC and TET2. Together these results suggest that OGT regulates TET1 activity, indicating that the TET1-OGT interaction may be two-fold in function â€“ allowing TET1 to recruit OGT to specific genomic loci and allowing OGT to modulate TET1 activity.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A short C-terminal region of TET1 is necessary for binding to OGT</title><p>TET1 and OGT interact with each other and are mutually dependent for their localization to chromatin(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Vella et al., 2013</xref>). To understand the role of this association, it is necessary to specifically disrupt the TET1-OGT interaction. All three TETs interact with OGT via their catalytic domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Deplus et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ito et al., 2014</xref>). We sought to identify the region within the TET1 catalytic domain (TET1 CD) responsible for binding to OGT. The TET1 CD consists of a cysteine-rich N-terminal region necessary for co-factor and substrate binding, a catalytic fold consisting of two lobes separated by a spacer of unknown function, and a short C-terminal region also of unknown function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We transiently transfected HEK293T cells with FLAG-tagged mouse TET1 CD constructs bearing deletions of each of these regions, some of which failed to express (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Because HEK293T cells have low levels of endogenous OGT, we also co-expressed His-tagged human OGT (identical to mouse at 1042 of 1046 residues). TET1 constructs were immunoprecipitated (IPed) using a FLAG antibody and analyzed for interaction with OGT. We found that deletion of only the 45 residue C-terminus of TET1 (hereafter C45) prevented detectable interaction with OGT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, TET1 CD del. 4). To exclude the possibility that this result is an artifact of OGT overexpression, we repeated the experiment overexpressing only TET1. TET1 CD, but not TET1 CD lacking C45, interacted with endogenous OGT, confirming that the C45 is necessary for this interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1â€”figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34870.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The short TET1 C-terminus is required for interaction with OGT.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Domain architecture of TET1.

To our knowledge, this is the first time that a small protein domain has been identified that confers stable binding to OGT. The vast majority of OGT targets do not bind to OGT tightly enough to be detected in co-IP experiments, suggesting that OGTâ€™s interaction with TET proteins is unusually strong. For determination of the crystal structure of the human TET2 catalytic domain in complex with DNA, the corresponding C-terminal region was deleted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hu et al., 2013</xref>), suggesting that it may be unstructured. When bound to OGT this domain may become structured, and structural studies of OGT bound to C45 could shed light on what features make this domain uniquely able to interact stably with OGT and how OGT may stimulate TET1 activity.</p><p>An alternative or additional role for the stable TET-OGT interaction may be recruitment of OGT to chromatin by TET proteins. Loss of TET1 causes loss of OGT from chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Vella et al., 2013</xref>) and induces similar changes in transcription in both wild-type mESCs and mESCs lacking DNA methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Williams et al., 2011</xref>). This raises the possibility that TET proteins may recruit OGT to chromatin to regulate gene expression independent of 5mC oxidation. Consistent with this possibility, OGT modifies many transcription factors and chromatin regulators in mESCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Myers et al., 2011</xref>)(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Thus it may be that the stable TET1-OGT interaction promotes both regulation of TET1 activity by <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAcylation as well as recruitment of OGT to chromatin. Notably, our results show that TET1 D2018A does not rescue 5hmC levels in <italic>tet2/3</italic> DM zebrafish embryos to the same extent as the wild type protein, suggesting that at least part of the role of the TET1-OGT interaction in vivo is regulation of TET1 activity.</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34870.022</object-id><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Model Model showing two roles of the TET1-OGT interaction in regulation of gene expression.</title><p>OGTâ€™s activity is regulated by the abundance of its cofactor UDP-GlcNAc, whose synthesis has inputs from nucleotide, glucose, amino acid, and fatty acid metabolism.

OGT also directly interacts with TET2 and TET3, suggesting that it may regulate all three TET proteins. Notably, although all three TETs catalyze the same reaction, they show a number of differences that are likely to determine their biological role. Different TET proteins are expressed in different cell types and at different stages of development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Koh et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dawlaty et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zhao et al., 2015</xref>).

Together with mass spectrometry showing no change in total 5hmC levels, our data are consistent with a redistribution of 5hmC at a small number of genes without significantly affecting total 5hmC. The D2018A mutation is predicted to decrease TET1 activity, and the increased expression of TET2 in the D2018A cells could explain why total 5hmC levels are unchanged.</p><p>Bisulfite sequencing showed a genome-wide reduction in 5mCÂ +Â 5 hmC in D2018A cells, while 5hmC-Seal revealed only a small number of DhMRs. Together these results suggest that the bisulfite sequencing largely reflects changes in 5mC. The very small correlation between promoter CpG modification and gene expression suggests that most gene expression changes cannot be explained by CpG modification differences at promoters.</p><p>The enrichment of both DMRs and DhMRs in genic regions and the correlation between gene body DMRs and DEGs suggests that changes to genic CpG modifications may underlie some of the gene expression changes. The result that OGT stimulates TET1 catalytic activity in vitro suggests that in cells the TET1 D2018A mutation should decrease TET enzyme activity, resulting in more 5mC and less 5hmC. Instead, we observed decreased 5mC and no change in 5hmC. This result is consistent with the increased expression of TET2 in D2018A mESCs compared to WT, since gene bodies are targets of TET2 rather than TET1(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Huang et al., 2014</xref>). Higher levels of TET2 could increase 5mC oxidation at gene bodies, resulting in widespread genic demethylation and an increase in 5hmC at a small subset of genes. This result would explain the loss of 5mC in D2018A cells compared to WT and the enrichment of DMRs in genic regions.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>A connection between metabolism and the epigenome</title><p>OGT has been proposed to act as a metabolic sensor because its cofactor, UDP-GlcNAc, is synthesized via the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP), which is fed by pathways metabolizing glucose, amino acids, fatty acids, and nucleotides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hart et al., 2011</xref>).

For data processing, the raw reads were first trimmed to remove Illumina adapters and PCR duplicates and then mapped to mm10 mouse reference genome using Bismark (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/bismark/">https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/bismark/</ext-link>). The alignment files (BAM file) generated were analyzed by MethylPy (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/yupenghe/methylpy">https://github.com/yupenghe/methylpy</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lister et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">He, 2018</xref>) to get the methylation level at individual cytosines. Generally, the methylation level is defined as the ratio of the sum of methylated basecall counts over the total basecall counts at each individual pairwise cytosine on both strands. The significantly methylated cytosine sites (DMSs) were identified using a binomial test for each CpG context with FDRÂ &lt;Â 0.01 as described previously(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ma et al., 2014</xref>). Differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were defined by the DMRfind function in MethylPy by joining at least two DMSs within 250 bp.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>5hmC-Seal</title><p>5hmC profiling was performed as described(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Han et al., 2016</xref>). Briefly, 100 ng genomic DNA were fragmented in Tagmentation buffer at 55Â°C. Fragmented DNA was purified by Zymo DNA Clean and Concentration Kit. Then, the selective 5hmC chemical labeling was performed in glucosylation buffer (50 mM HEPES buffer pH 8.0, 25 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>) containing above fragmented DNA, Î²GT, N<sub>3</sub>-UDP-Glc, and incubated at 37Â°C for 2 hr. After DNA purification in ddH<sub>2</sub>O, DBCO-PEG4-Biotin (Click Chemistry Tools) was added and incubated at 37Â°C for 2 hr. The biotin labeled DNA was pulled down by C1 Streptavidin beads (Life Technologies) for 15 min at room temperature. Next, the captured DNA fragments were subjected to PCR amplification using Nextera DNA sample preparation kit. The resulting amplified product was purified by 1.0X AMPure XP beads. Input library was made by direct PCR from fragmented DNA directly without labeling and pull-down. The libraries were quantified by a Qubit fluorometer (Life Technologies) and sequenced on NextSeq 500 PE42.</p><p>Adaptors and low quality nucleotides were trimmed from raw sequencing reads by Trim_Galore, and bowtie was used to align clean reads to mm9 reference genome. Peak calling was performed by MACS1.4. DESeq2 was further used to calculate differentially hydroxymethylated genes and regions.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>RT-qPCR</title><p>Total RNA was isolated from mESCs using Direct-zol RNA miniprep kit from Zymo. 1 Âµg of RNA was used for cDNA synthesis using the iScript Reverse Transcription kit from BioRad. cDNA was used for qPCR using the SensiFAST SYBR Lo-Rox kit from Bioline. Relative gene expression levels were calculated using the Î”Î”C<sub>t</sub> method.

For mRNA rescue experiments, mTET1D2018A and mTET1wt plasmids were linearized by NotI digestion. Capped RNA was synthesized using mMessage mMachine (Ambion) with T7 RNA polymerase. RNA was injected into one-cell-stage embryos derived from tet2<sup>mk17/mk17</sup>, tet3<sup>mk18/+</sup> intercrosses at the concentration of 100 pg/embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Li et al., 2015</xref>). Injected embryos were raised under standard conditions at 28.5Â°C until 30 hr post-fertilization (hpf) at which point they were fixed for in situ hybridization using an antisense probe for <italic>runx1.</italic> The <italic>runx1</italic> probe is described in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kalev-Zylinska et al., 2002</xref>); in situ hybridization was performed using standard methods, and runx1 levels were scored across samples without knowledge of the associated experimental conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Thisse and Thisse, 2008</xref>). Examples of larvae categorized as runx1 high and runx1 low are provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>. <italic>tet2/3</italic> double mutants were identified based on morphological criteria and mutants were confirmed by PCR genotyping after in situ hybridization using previously described primers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Li et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>For sample size estimation for rescue experiments, we assume a background mean of 20% positive animals in control groups. We anticipate a significant change would result in at least a 30% difference between the experimental and control means with a standard deviation of no more than 10. Using the 1-Sample Z-test method, for a specified power of 95% the minimum sample size is 4. Typically, zebrafish crosses generate far more embryos than required. Experiments are conducted using all available embryos. The experiment is discarded if numbers for any sample are below this minimum threshold when embryos are genotyped at the end of the experimental period. Injections were separately performed on clutches from five independent crosses; p values are based on these replicates and were derived from the unpaired two-tailed <italic>t</italic> test. Embryo numbers for all five biological replicates are included in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>.</p><p>For the dot blot, genomic DNA was isolated from larvae at 30hpf by phenol-chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. Following RNase treatment and denaturation, 2-fold serially diluted DNA was spotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. Cross-linked membranes were incubated with 0.02% methylene blue to validate uniform DNA loading. Membranes were blocked with 5% BSA and incubated with anti-5hmC antibody (1:10,000; Active Motif) followed by a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody (1:15,000; Active Motif). Signal was detected using the ECL Prime Detection Kit (GE). The results of three independent experiments were quantified using ImageJ at the lowest dilution and exposure where signal was observed in Tet1 injected embryos. To normalize across blots, all values are presented as the ratio of 5hmC signal in experimental animals divided by wildtype control signal from the same blot.</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>Reproducibility and Rigor</title><p>All IP-Westerns are representative of at least three independent biological replicates (experiments carried out on different days with a different batch of HEK293T cells or mESCs). For targeted mESC lines, three independently derived lines for each genotype were assayed in at least two biological replicates. For in vitro activity and binding assays using recombinant proteins (representing multiple protein preparations), data represent at least three technical replicates (carried out on multiple days). The zebrafish rescue experiment was performed five times (biological replicates), with dot blots carried out three times. We define an outlier as a result in which all the controls gave the expected outcome but the experimental sample yielded an outcome different from other biological or technical replicates. There were no outliers or exclusions.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We thank Miguel Ramalho-Santos for the FLAG-TET1 CD plasmid and Suzanne Walker for the His-OGT plasmid.

The authors show that a TET1 mutation (D2018A) that disrupts interaction with OGT prevents TET1 from rescuing hematopoietic stem cell production and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) levels in <italic>tet</italic> mutant zebrafish embryos, suggesting that OGT stimulates TET1 activity in vivo. The authors also found that the D2018A mutation alters the abundance and composition of TET-containing molecular complexes in mouse embryonic stem cells, and that this mutation alters gene expression and the distribution of 5-methylcytosine (5mC).</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers and editors feel that the biological function of the interaction between OGT and TET1 in ESCs requires further investigation, as the presented phenotypes are complex and somewhat confusing. Specifically:</p><p>1) ES cells with homozygous TET1 D2018A mutation have significantly elevated levels of TET2, as well as a higher proportion of TET2 that co-fractionates with OGT and HCF1 within high molecular weight complexes (Figure 6). The elevated levels of TET2 in TET1 D2018A mutant cells may reflect increased stability through formation of large complexes with OGT, HCF1, and potentially other proteins. Although TET2 function is not the primary focus of the study, the phenotype of TET1 D2018A mutant cells, in which 5mC is redistributed and seemingly reduced while 5hmC levels are unchanged, merits further examination. The authors should test whether the stability or expression of TET2 is increased in D2018A mutant cells.</p><p>2) The images in Figure 7D suggest that ES cells with the TET1 D2018A mutation have reduced 5mC levels, but the immunofluorescence staining only gives limited information on how TET1-OGT interaction affects the distribution of 5mC and 5hmC. The authors conclude that the distribution of 5mC is altered, but the overall levels are not directly measured, and the interpretation that 5hmC is similar between mutant and WT, but that 5mC (the substrate) is redistributed and potentially reduced is confusing. Changes in bulk 5mC levels should be measured in these cells. The authors should also conduct genome-wide profiling of 5mC and 5hmC, and potentially of TET1, TET2, TET3 and OGT chromatin binding.</p><p>3) Although reduction of TET1 activity would not be predicted to cause reduction of 5mC levels on DNA, the authors suggest increased TET2 activity may compensate for reduced TET1 activity in D2018A ES cells. Direct measurement of the 5mC oxidation activities of TET1 and TET2 complexes in wild type and D2018A cells would be difficult, but the authors may be able to restore normal levels and distribution of 5mC in D2018A cells by overexpression of the GFP-C45 fusion, which binds OGT in vitro (Figure 3). This would provide evidence that the OGT interaction domain of TET1 has two important functions, activation of TET1 activity and titration of OGT to limit activation of TET2. Knockdowns of TET2 and/or TET3 in the WT and mutant cells could also isolate the effects of the TET1 mutation.</p><p>4) The authors should add more analysis to the RNA-seq data. For example, how does the set of differentially expressed genes overlap with OGT ChIP-seq targets in published studies?</p><p>[Editorsâ€™ note: a previous version of this study was rejected after peer review, but the authors submitted for reconsideration.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work in its current form will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>The reviewers and editors found regulation of TET1 activity by OGT-catalyzed <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAc modification to be potentially very interesting, but a number of serious concerns were raised about the validity of the conclusions in this study. Perhaps the most significant finding is that <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAc modification of TET1 by OGT strongly stimulates its activity, however the enzymatic activity of the D2018 mutant is similar to that of wild type TET1 in 293T cells, which contain endogenous OGT. The in vivo results therefore are apparently inconsistent with the in vitro results. The data in the paper also do not clearly establish whether <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAc modification, rather than OGT binding, affects TET1 activity. The finding that all the TPR motifs of OGT are important for the interaction with TET1 raised concerns because different TPR motifs usually interact with different OGT substrates. The interpretations â€“ and interpretability â€“ of several key experiments were also questioned by the reviewers.</p><p>Overall, given the published link between OGT and TET enzymes, we would expect a manuscript to present a major advance on the biological significance and/or mechanism of this interaction. If the activation of TET1 by OGT-catalyzed <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAc modification can be unambiguously established in vitro and in vivo, and the biological function and/or mechanism substantively explored, we would be happy to consider a revised manuscript as a new submission.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>TET enzymes oxidize 5mC towards cytosine demethylation. In this manuscript, the authors characterized the interaction between TET1 and OGT. They showed that C-terminus of TET1 directly interacted with OGT. This interaction might be required for activity of TET1 in vivo. Overall, the authors proposed and tested a novel hypothesis on the interaction between OGT and TET1. However, it is very confusing to see that the D2018A mutant of TET1 lost the interaction with OGT but still retained enzymatic activity in 293T cells. A careful and through study is needed to justify the major conclusions in this manuscript.</p><p>1) It is unclear if OGT is required for the enzymatic activity of TET1 in mammalian cells. The authors showed that the D2018A mutant was still able to convert 5mC to 5hmC in 293T cells. The enzymatic activity of the D2018 mutant was similar to that of wild type TET1 (Figure 5B and C). As the expression of OGT is very high in 293T cells, it indicates that without the interaction with OGT, TET1 is still able to oxidize 5mC, which contradicts with the major conclusions of the manuscript.</p><p>2) The authors stated &quot;we mutated these residues individually and found that D2018A eliminated detectable interaction between FLAG-tagged TET1 CD and myc-OGT&quot;. However, in the Figure 3D, only D2018A had been examined. It is unclear if other mutations abolish the interaction between TET1 and OGT. In particular, D2018 is not mutated in TET1 CD mt2. But TET1 CDmt2 still lost the interaction with OGT, indicating that other residues such as V2021 and T2022 may play more important roles for the interaction.</p><p>3) The authors have not demonstrated if the enzymatic activity of OGT is required for TET1-dependent functions. The authors need to show if the enzymatic dead OGT is able to activate TET1 both in vitro and in vivo.</p><p>4) The study on the TET1 mutant is incomplete. It is unclear if OGT is able to promote the enzymatic activity of the mutant TET1 in vitro.</p><p>5) The authors showed a conserved interacting motif existed in both TET2 and TET3. Does TET2 or TET3 interact with OGT via the same motif? Does OGT promote TET2 and TET3 as well?</p><p>6) It is very strange to see that all the TPR motifs of OGT are important for the interaction. Usually, different TPR motifs interact with different OGT substrates. If all the TPR repeats are required for the interaction with TET1, will other OGT substrates, such as HIF-1, affect the interaction between OGT and TET1? Especially HIF-1 is in the same complex with TET1 and OGT. Is the catalytic domain of OGT also required for the interaction with TET1?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>Hrit et al. follow up on work from several groups showing <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) binds to TET proteins, and find that <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAc modification of TET1 stimulates its methylcytosine oxidation activity in vitro. In addition, the authors perform extensive mapping of the domain of TET1 that binds OGT, and find a 45 amino acid region of the TET1 catalytic domain that is necessary and sufficient for this interaction. Finally, the authors demonstrate that mRNA corresponding to wild type TET1, but not D2018A mutant TET1, can partially rescue HSC development in zebrafish lacking <italic>tet2</italic> and <italic>tet3</italic>, as well as overall hmC levels. These findings contrast with reports that <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAc modification of TET1 increases Tet1 stability (PMID: 23729667), but have no effect on its catalytic activity (PMID: 24394411).</p><p>Several studies have established that TET proteins and OGT broadly regulate each other's functions. However, there are conflicting data in the literature regarding the mechanisms by which this occurs. Consequently, the question is important and these findings contribute a new potential mechanism by which OGT regulates TET1. However, the extent to which the D2018A mutant prevents <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAc modification and stimulation of TET1 activity by OGT is not thoroughly tested. In addition, the study would be strengthened by a deeper analysis of how TET1's activity is regulated by <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAc modification (see below).</p><p>1) Although there is a non-quantitative hmC blot that shows reduced hmC in fish rescued with mutant TET1 mRNA (Figure 6C), it is not clear whether reduction of meC oxidation is due to reduced <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAc modification, reduced TET1/OGT physical interaction, or both. The relative contributions of TET1/OGT interaction and <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAc modification on TET1 activity could be measured in the authors' in vitro system.</p><p>2) Perhaps the most interesting new finding is the demonstration that <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAc modification of TET1 by OGT strongly stimulated its activity (Figure 1B and C). This observation would be strengthened by examination of how <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAc modification leads to enhanced catalytic activity. Does this modification increase the affinity of TET1 for meC? Does <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAc affect the Km or Vmax of the enzyme? These questions should be testable with existing reagents used in Figure 1.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>Hrit et al. map and characterize the binding site of OGT in Tet1. They identified a 45 amino-acid sequence which is sufficient to mediate TET1-OGT interaction, as well as a single point mutation which abrogates the TET1-OGT interaction. They did this mostly using in vitro biochemical methods, along with some in vivo work to support it.</p><p>The mapping of the site is an interesting finding and the point mutant is a fine tool for further dissection of the contribution of the TET1-OGT interaction to regulating TET1 activity as well as genome maintenance. This paper hints at potentially interesting functions of the TET1-OGT interaction, with some data derived from mESCs and developing zebrafish embryos. However, the function of this interaction in regulating TET proteins, hmC levels, or downstream transcriptional dynamics at specific genomic loci or in different chromatin environments remains somewhat speculative, and further experiments are required in order to build a model of how the TET1-OGT may actually influence transcriptional dynamics.</p><p>Also basic questions remain unanswered, e.g. does the interaction per se activate TET1 or is it the post-translational modification of TET1 and which sites are affected?</p><p>Why do the authors jump from human HEK to mouse ESCs and do the functional assay in fish rescuing a Tet2/3 KO with TET1?</p><p>Throughout, rigorous controls, careful quantification and statistical analyses are missing.</p><p>Figure 1A-C:</p><p>The co-factor UDP-GlcNAc is certainly required for in vitro O-GlyNAcylation. However, it is unclear if OGT can bind to TET1 without this co-factor. In other words, is active o-GlyNAcylation required for this interaction?</p><p>Figure 1E-F:</p><p>The authors suggest a decrease in mC and hmC levels when OGT is overexpressed in mESCs. and attribute this is to stimulation of TET1 activity by OGT. However, overexpression of OGT (or many other nuclear proteins) often comes with pleiotropic effects. To rule out these possible side-effects, the authors should repeat these immunostainings and slot blots on cells where TDG is depleted, and look for an increase in accumulation of TET1 oxidation products hmC, caC and fC when OGT is overexpressed.</p><p>The immunofluorescence images are difficult to interpret â€“ the images suggest massive changes in mC and hmC levels in cells, whereas the slot blots suggest very slight changes in levels of these modifications (these should be quantified: the AP stained slot blot for mC shows what appears to be less DNA loaded on the membrane for the OGT++ cells). mC staining in WT cells shows strong cytosolic background/unspecific staining, whereas this background is absent in OGT++ cells, which suggests problems with the experiment itself, or unusually altered display contrast settings.</p><p>Co-staining with DAPI would help identify nuclei and evaluate the changes in mC/hmC intensity in single cells and would help with basic quantification of the signal. Additionally, it is somewhat unlikely that all cells would show such a change in mC/hmC from transient overexpression of OGT â€“ this would suggest 100% transfection efficiency, and 100% penetrance of the overexpression phenotype. These efficiencies might be possible, but needs to be shown in detail, possibly by co-expressing cytosolic GFP under the same overexpression promoter, or by tagging OGT itself with a fluorophore.</p><p>These issues, along with the fact that transfection efficiency in Figure 5 appears to be around 25%, point to problems with the IF experiments, and should be entirely repeated, with adequate controls and some degree of quantification.</p><p>Finally, no information is given on how these images were acquired, whether identical acquisition settings were used for control and OGT+ conditions, and how the contrast/offset was adjusted for visualization of these images. Additional images, perhaps with lower magnification showing more cells should be supplied in supplemental data.</p><p>Figure 3:</p><p>Here the authors identify a residue necessary for TET1-OGT interaction. Since this residue seems to be conserved in all three TET proteins, it would important to show whether this residue is minimally required for OGT interaction of each TET protein.</p><p>If that residue is required for OGT interacting with TET2 and TET3, then these would make far more interesting candidates for the rescue experiment described in Figure 6.</p><p>In Figure 3E, the D2018A mutant pulled-down OGT, which the authors suggest are high-molecular weight complexes, possibly involving TET2 and HCFC. It would be helpful to show that this is the case by probing for TET2 and HCFC. This would help with further dissection of OGT's direct interaction with TET vs. indirect interaction via TET-containing complexes.</p><p>Figure 5:</p><p>Here the authors show that TET1-D2018A is catalytically active when overexpressed in HEK cells. However, the difference in hmC levels is more visible here than in other slot blots, but the authors suggest that hmC levels are comparable, and that the mutation doesn't notably affect hmC generation, which seems misleading.</p><p>More importantly, however, the overexpression itself may mask subtle changes is the rate of hmC production. Therefore, given the availability of Cas9-engineered mESCs expressing the D2018A mutant, it would be more relevant to look at hmC levels in mESCs, and see how hmC levels change/are maintained when TET1-D2018A is expressed at more physiologically relevant levels.</p><p>To further characterize this interaction, a chromatin binding assay comparing soluble vs. chromatin-bound fractions of TET1 and OGT may give further insight into how TET1 recruits OGT to chromatin. Ideally, genome-wide methods such as RNA-seq and/or ChIP-seq would provide definitive evidence of localization and transcriptional regulation mediated by the TET1-OGT interaction, and would shed light on the chromatin/genomic environment where these interactions are active. These data would allow to build a more robust model of how TET1-OGT influences transcriptional dynamics, and where this interaction takes place.</p><p>It should be noted that the imaging data here in Figure 5 is much better interpretable than in Figure 1 â€“ the images here display the transfection efficiency and how expression levels vary with transient transfection.</p><p>Figure 6:</p><p>Here the authors partially rescue the low-runx phenotype found in <italic>tet2/3</italic> double-mutant zebrafish larvae by overexpressing mouse TET1 and TET1-D2018A. Given the overlapping requirements of TET2 and TET3 as described in Li et al., 2015, it would be more relevant to rescue with TET2 or TET3 proteins in which OGT interaction was abrogated (as suggested above).</p><p>It is unclear how the embryos were sorted into &quot;high&quot; or &quot;low&quot; runx categories, and whether this was performed in a blind/randomized way. Additionally, for each experiment, the number of embryos and number of clutches should be shown.</p><p>In Figure 6C, the slot blot is not quantified and changes in hmC levels are quite difficult to perceive, thus the claim that hmC levels are affected with TET1 injection is a bit tenuous.</p><p>The claim that TET1-OGT promotes TET1 activity is a bit strong based on this experiment. While the point mutant may well affect TET1-OGT interaction, D2018A may also disrupt the binding of other proteins to TET1, as well as the stability of the protein itself.</p><p>Furthermore, the rescue of the high runx phenotype may be a distant downstream effect. Do the authors speculate that TET1-OGT directly modulates runx transcription? Or is this a downstream result from TET1-OGT somehow affecting Notch signalling?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34870.035</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers and editors feel that the biological function of the interaction between OGT and TET1 in ESCs requires further investigation, as the presented phenotypes are complex and somewhat confusing.

To examine stability of TET2 protein we performed cycloheximide block experiments, which show no notable difference in half-life between WT and D2018A mESCs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The images in Figure 7D suggest that ES cells with the TET1 D2018A mutation have reduced 5mC levels, but the immunofluorescence staining only gives limited information on how TET1-OGT interaction affects the distribution of 5mC and 5hmC. The authors conclude that the distribution of 5mC is altered, but the overall levels are not directly measured, and the interpretation that 5hmC is similar between mutant and WT, but that 5mC (the substrate) is redistributed and potentially reduced is confusing.

The authors should also conduct genome-wide profiling of 5mC and 5hmC, and potentially of TET1, TET2, TET3 and OGT chromatin binding.</p></disp-quote><p>a) We assayed bulk levels of 5mC and 5hmC in WT and TET1 D2018A cells by mass spectrometry. These new data showed reduced 5mC levels in D2018A cells compared to WT and comparable levels of 5hmC in both cell types, consistent with the data in the previous submission.</p><p>b) We collaborated with Joe Eckerâ€™s lab for bisulfite-seq and Chuan Heâ€™s lab for hmC-Seal analyses in WT and TET1 D2018A cells. These results support the conclusions from bulk studies of 5mC and 5hmC levels and suggest that 1) 5mC levels are lower in D2018A cells but 5mC distribution is largely unaltered in unique sequences, and 2) 5hmC levels are similar in the two cell types but 5hmC undergoes a redistribution at a small subset of gene bodies. These higher-resolution, genome-wide analyses replace the immunofluorescence data in the previous submission (old Figure 7D), which predominantly queried repetitive regions and showed 5mC is also decreased in these regions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Although reduction of TET1 activity would not be predicted to cause reduction of 5mC levels on DNA, the authors suggest increased TET2 activity may compensate for reduced TET1 activity in D2018A ES cells. Direct measurement of the 5mC oxidation activities of TET1 and TET2 complexes in wild type and D2018A cells would be difficult, but the authors may be able to restore normal levels and distribution of 5mC in D2018A cells by overexpression of the GFP-C45 fusion, which binds OGT in vitro (Figure 3). This would provide evidence that the OGT interaction domain of TET1 has two important functions, activation of TET1 activity and titration of OGT to limit activation of TET2. Knockdowns of TET2 and/or TET3 in the WT and mutant cells could also isolate the effects of the TET1 mutation.</p></disp-quote><p>This question is a very interesting and important one and we thank the reviewers for raising it. However, rigorous analyses are beyond the scope of the current submission. Overexpression the GFP-C45 construct is problematic because it may affect multiple non-TET OGT targets by sequestering OGT. The second approach suggested was to knock down TET2 and/or TET3. Analyses suggest that the D2018A mutation changed abundance and/or composition of TET containing nuclear complexes. Therefore to meaningfully address the contribution of TET2/3 to the TET1 D2018A phenotype will require amounts in excess of what can be obtained with knockdown, since the effects of this perturbation on high molecular weight complexes will have to be queried. To obtain sufficient material for informative analyses, we initially focused on TET2, the increase in abundance or activity of which could underlie the reduced 5mC in D2018A mESCs. We attempted to knock out <italic>Tet2</italic> in the D2018A cell lines multiple times using multiple strategies, all without success. As a result, we believe that this genotype is lethal, and plan to employ the auxin-inducible degron system to turn over TET2 (and 3). Once appropriate cell lines are generated it will be possible to meaningfully assess the effects of perturbing other TETs in the D2018A background. The outcomes of these experiments will inform the complexity of the interaction between all three TETs and OGT in ESCs, but will not alter the conclusions of this manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors should add more analysis to the RNA-seq data. For example, how does the set of differentially expressed genes overlap with OGT ChIP-seq targets in published studies?</p></disp-quote><p>To facilitate comparison between RNA-seq, bisulfite-seq, and hmC-Seal we performed all three analyses on the same batches of cells. We compared the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) with differentially methylated regions (DMRs) and differentially hydroxymethylated regions (DhMRs). There is a correlation between genes containing DMRs and differentially expressed genes, suggesting that changes in CpG modifications may underlie some of the gene expression changes. We did not identify enough DhMRs by 5hmC-Seal to make statistically meaningful comparisons between DEGs and DhMRs. There was no significant overlap between DEGs and OGT occupancy. One caveat when comparing our â€“seq data to published data sets is that we use XX mESCs and published studies use XY mESCs. OGT is X-linked and more highly expressed in XX mESCs than XY mESCs because X-inactivation has not yet occurred in mESCs. The greater expression of OGT (and other X-linked genes) greatly complicates comparisons of XX and XY â€“seq based data sets.</p><p>[Editorsâ€™ note: the author responses to the first round of peer review follow.]</p><p>The manuscript has changed significantly since the first submission. We have made revisions and added new data in response to the reviewer comments, and we include a point-by-point response to the reviewers with this submission. The new data extends our analysis of the interaction between the epigenetic regulator TET1 and the nutrient sensor OGT both in vitroand ex vivo. We demonstrate that stimulation of TET1â€™s catalytic activity by OGT in vitro requires TET1 <italic>O-</italic>GlcNAcylation. We show that in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) a point mutation that disrupts the direct OGT-TET1 protein-protein interaction alters the composition of TET-containing high-molecular-weight protein complexes, changes the genome-wide distribution of 5mC, and causes significant changes in gene expression. Since OGT mediates the post-translational modification of over 1,000 proteins in response to the cellâ€™s nutrient status and TETs regulate gene expression, our work connects metabolism to epigenetics and suggests new avenues of investigation for both fields.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>[...] Overall, the authors proposed and tested a novel hypothesis on the interaction between OGT and TET1.

The purpose of expressing the D2018A TET1 mutant in HEK293T cells was to query whether the mutation eliminated TET1 activity in the context of the entire protein, not to assess whether the OGT-TET1 interaction affected TET1 activity in cells. OGT levels are very low in our HEK293T cells, so to address whether OGT is affecting TET1 activity it would be necessary to co-transfect in OGT with TET1. We did not attempt this experiment because of the difficulty in quantitating the expression of OGT, TET1, and 5hmC in individual cells in a transient transfection assay.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors stated &quot;we mutated these residues individually and found that D2018A eliminated detectable interaction between FLAG-tagged TET1 CD and myc-OGT&quot;. However, in the Figure 3D, only D2018A had been examined. It is unclear if other mutations abolish the interaction between TET1 and OGT. In particular, D2018 is not mutated in TET1 CD mt2. But TET1 CDmt2 still lost the interaction with OGT, indicating that other residues such as V2021 and T2022 may play more important roles for the interaction.</p></disp-quote><p>Reviewer 1 is absolutely correct in that residues in addition to D2018 may be necessary for TET1 to interact with OGT, and we have included this point in the revised submission. Regardless of whether additional point mutations alter the interaction, the D2018A mutation gives us the tools to query the biological role of the OGT-TET1 interaction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors have not demonstrated if the enzymatic activity of OGT is required for TET1-dependent functions. The authors need to show if the enzymatic dead OGT is able to activate TET1 both in vitro and in vivo.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added new data showing that <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAcylation of the TET1 catalytic domain by OGT is necessary for stimulation of TET1 activity in vitro. Given these in vitro results, we did not pursue the effect of expressing catalytically dead OGT on TET1 activity in cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The study on the TET1 mutant is incomplete. It is unclear if OGT is able to promote the enzymatic activity of the mutant TET1 in vitro.</p></disp-quote><p>Our new data (Figure 4) show that OGT does not promote enzymatic activity of mutant TET1 catalytic domain in vitro.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The authors showed a conserved interacting motif existed in both TET2 and TET3. Does TET2 or TET3 interact with OGT via the same motif? Does OGT promote TET2 and TET3 as well?</p></disp-quote><p>It would certainly be interesting to determine whether the conserved interacting motif is also necessary and sufficient for interaction of TET2 and TET3 with OGT and whether OGT stimulates other TETs. These experiments are underway and are beyond the scope of this manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) It is very strange to see that all the TPR motifs of OGT are important for the interaction. Usually, different TPR motifs interact with different OGT substrates. If all the TPR repeats are required for the interaction with TET1, will other OGT substrates, such as HIF-1, affect the interaction between OGT and TET1? Especially HIF-1 is in the same complex with TET1 and OGT. Is the catalytic domain of OGT also required for the interaction with TET1?</p></disp-quote><p>TETs are unusual among OGT targets in that they stably interact with OGT. For most other targets the interactions are transient and not detectable by co-IP. We could suggest that the interaction with multiple TPRs may be one of the reasons that underlie this unusually strong interaction between OGT and one of its targets. In addition, as this reviewer correctly points out, additional interaction interfaces mediated by other proteins that co-IP with OGT and TET1, such as HCF-1, may be affecting the stability of the OGT-TET1 interaction in ESCs. As a result we elected not to speculate on the significance of the requirement for multiple TPRs for the OGT-TET1 interaction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>Hrit et al. follow up on work from several groups showing O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) binds to TET proteins, and find that O-GlcNAc modification of TET1 stimulates its methylcytosine oxidation activity in vitro. [â€¦] However, the extent to which the D2018A mutant prevents O-GlcNAc modification and stimulation of TET1 activity by OGT is not thoroughly tested. In addition, the study would be strengthened by a deeper analysis of how TET1's activity is regulated by O-GlcNAc modification (see below).</p><p>1) Although there is a non-quantitative hmC blot that shows reduced hmC in fish rescued with mutant TET1 mRNA (Figure 6C), it is not clear whether reduction of meC oxidation is due to reduced O-GlcNAc modification, reduced TET1/OGT physical interaction, or both. The relative contributions of TET1/OGT interaction and O-GlcNAc modification on TET1 activity could be measured in the authors' in vitro system.</p></disp-quote><p>As requested, we queried the roles of the <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAc modification and of the protein-protein interaction in TET1 stimulation, using the TET1 D2018A mutant catalytic domain.

This observation would be strengthened by examination of how O-GlcNAc modification leads to enhanced catalytic activity. Does this modification increase the affinity of TET1 for meC? Does O-GlcNAc affect the Km or Vmax of the enzyme? These questions should be testable with existing reagents used in Figure 1.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that gaining more mechanistic insight into how <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAcylation stimulates TET1 activity will be very interesting. These experiments are complex because there are at least 8 <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAcylation sites on the TET1 catalytic domain. We are currently developing the reagents (<italic>O</italic>-GlcNAc site mutants) to meaningfully query the mechanisms (which may be multiple) by which OGT stimulates TET1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>[â€¦] This paper hints at potentially interesting functions of the TET1-OGT interaction, with some data derived from mESCs and developing zebrafish embryos.

For example, to query the role of the OGT-TET1 interaction in vivo, we employed zebrafish. The HEK239T cells express very little TET1 (or any TET) and very little OGT, which combined with the efficiency of transfection into these cells, facilitated rapid analysis of interaction domains ex vivo. Mouse ESCs express abundant TET1 and OGT, and introduction of the D2018A mutation in these cells allows analysis of the effects of the mutation on cytosine modifications and gene expression.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Throughout, rigorous controls, careful quantification and statistical analyses are missing.</p><p>Figure 1A-C:</p></disp-quote><p><italic>The co-factor UDP-GlcNAc is certainly required for</italic> in vitro <italic>O-GlyNAcylation.

However, overexpression of OGT (or many other nuclear proteins) often comes with pleiotropic effects.

Rather than perform the suggested TDG depletion experiments, we have removed the data. Instead, we present analysis of cytosine modifications in ESCs bearing the D2018A mutation perturbing the OGT-TET1 interaction (Figure 6-7). Because this manipulation doesnâ€™t affect OGT levels, it is less likely to have pleiotropic effects and is therefore more informative.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The immunofluorescence images are difficult to interpret â€“ the images suggest massive changes in mC and hmC levels in cells, whereas the slot blots suggest very slight changes in levels of these modifications (these should be quantified: the AP stained slot blot for mC shows what appears to be less DNA loaded on the membrane for the OGT++ cells). mC staining in WT cells shows strong cytosolic background/unspecific staining, whereas this background is absent in OGT++ cells, which suggests problems with the experiment itself, or unusually altered display contrast settings.</p></disp-quote><p>While the slot blots and immunostaining images in Figure 1 have been removed, we have additional blots and immunostaining images in the revised submission. For more quantitative analysis, relevant slot blots are reproduced 3+ times, results normalized to input, and expressed graphically with a representative slot blot shown. Immunostaining can sometimes give background, but this background does not invariably mean that contrast settings have been altered.

Additionally, it is somewhat unlikely that all cells would show such a change in mC/hmC from transient overexpression of OGT â€“ this would suggest 100% transfection efficiency, and 100% penetrance of the overexpression phenotype. These efficiencies might be possible, but needs to be shown in detail, possibly by co-expressing cytosolic GFP under the same overexpression promoter, or by tagging OGT itself with a fluorophore.</p></disp-quote><p>A stable cell line over expressing OGT, not transient transfection, was employed in Figure 1 of the first submission, so it is possible that all cells showed a change in 5mc/5hmC.
