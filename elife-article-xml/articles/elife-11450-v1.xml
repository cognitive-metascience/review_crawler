Here we evaluate the participation of parvalbumin-expressing (PV+) GABAergic neurons in two forms of experience-dependent modification of primary visual cortex (V1) in adult mice: ocular dominance (OD) plasticity resulting from monocular deprivation and stimulus-selective response potentiation (SRP) resulting from enriched visual experience. These two forms of plasticity are triggered by different events but lead to a similar increase in visual cortical response. Both also require the NMDA class of glutamate receptor (NMDAR). However, we find that PV+ inhibitory neurons in V1 play a critical role in the expression of SRP and its behavioral correlate of familiarity recognition, but not in the expression of OD plasticity. Furthermore, NMDARs expressed within PV+ cells, reversibly inhibited by the psychotomimetic drug ketamine, play a critical role in SRP, but not in the induction or expression of adult OD plasticity.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.11450.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.11450.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11450.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>What we see or fail to see through our eyes leaves a lasting impression by changing the strength of connections between neurons in a part of the brain called the visual cortex. These changes are referred to as synaptic plasticity.</p><p>One example of synaptic plasticity results in the visual cortex becoming more responsive to the stimulation of one eye when the other eye is patched for about a week. This phenomenon is known as “ocular dominance plasticity”. Another example is the increase in responsiveness that occurs in the visual cortex when animals repeatedly view stripes of a single orientation. This phenomenon is known as “stimulus-selective response potentiation”. Some previous studies had suggested that both kinds of plasticity might be induced in the same way. However, both forms of plasticity can happen at the same time, suggesting that distinct mechanisms may be involved.</p><p>To tease out how these two kinds of plasticity work, Kaplan, Cooke et al. inactivated one particular type of neuron that is thought to be involved in triggering ocular dominance plasticity and is found in the visual cortex. These inhibitory neurons produce a molecular marker called parvalbumin and are therefore referred to as “parvalbumin-expressing neurons”.</p><p>The experiments showed that ocular dominance plasticity could still be seen in adult mice when these parvalbumin-expressing neurons were inactivated. However, when these same neurons were inactivated, the visual cortex no longer responded differently to lines with familiar or new orientations. This was the case even when the mice had seen lines in a given orientation for long periods of time. Similarly, observations of the behavior of the mice also showed that their ability to distinguish new from familiar stimuli was lost when the parvalbumin-expressing neurons were inactivated locally within part of the visual cortex.</p><p>The connections between neurons that bring information from the eyes to the visual cortex release a chemical neurotransmitter called glutamate. One important protein that detects glutamate, called an NMDA receptor, is required for ocular dominance plasticity. Further experiments showed that NMDA receptors within the parvalbumin-expressing neurons are needed for stimulus-selective response potentiation, but not for ocular dominance plasticity. This indicates that although the two forms of plasticity may share molecular requirements, different connections and cells types are likely involved.</p><p>Changes in parvalbumin-expressing neurons and NMDA receptors have been implicated in disorders such as autism and schizophrenia. To improve treatments for these disorders, it is crucially important to better understand the links between these neurons and the retrieval of memories.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.11450.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.11450.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>ocular dominance plasticity</kwd><kwd>recognition memory</kwd><kwd>ketamine</kwd><kwd>schizophrenia</kwd><kwd>stimulus-selective response potentiation</kwd><kwd>orientation-selective habituation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000053</institution-id><institution>National Eye Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5R01EYO23037</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kaplan</surname><given-names>Eitan S</given-names></name><name><surname>Cooke</surname><given-names>Sam F</given-names></name><name><surname>Komorowski</surname><given-names>Robert W</given-names></name><name><surname>Chubykin</surname><given-names>Alexander A</given-names></name><name><surname>Khibnik</surname><given-names>Lena A</given-names></name><name><surname>Bear</surname><given-names>Mark F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1T32MH074249</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kaplan</surname><given-names>Eitan S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kaplan</surname><given-names>Eitan S</given-names></name><name><surname>Cooke</surname><given-names>Sam F</given-names></name><name><surname>Komorowski</surname><given-names>Robert W</given-names></name><name><surname>Chubykin</surname><given-names>Alexander A</given-names></name><name><surname>Khibnik</surname><given-names>Lena A</given-names></name><name><surname>Bear</surname><given-names>Mark F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Parvalbumin-containing inhibitory neurons are crucial for expression of plasticity in adult visual cortex that supports visual recognition memory, but not for expression of ocular dominance plasticity that results from monocular deprivation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Understanding how brain synapses, cells, and circuits are persistently modified by experience to store information represents one of the great challenges in neuroscience. Mouse visual cortex has proven to be an excellent model system in which to examine experience-dependent neural response modification. One robust type of visual response plasticity is reliably elicited in adult (&gt; P60) mice by simply closing one eyelid. Over the course of 5–7 days of monocular deprivation (MD), the responses in visual cortex evoked by stimulation of the non-deprived eye progressively increase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sawtell et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sato and Stryker, 2008</xref>). This deprivation-enabled response potentiation is driven by visual experience through the non-deprived eye, as only the responses through one eye are potentiated (<italic>i.e.</italic>, it is input specific) and it fails to occur if both eyelids are closed or if the animals are kept in a dark room (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Blais et al., 2008</xref>). There is evidence that the response potentiation is mediated in part by “Hebbian” strengthening of excitatory synaptic transmission in visual cortex, as induction requires cortical NMDA receptor (NMDAR) activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sawtell et al., 2003</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sato and Stryker, 2008</xref>) and α-calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (αCAMKII) expression in principal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ranson et al., 2012</xref>). This form of ocular dominance (OD) plasticity is likely responsible for the increase in visual acuity that occurs through the non-deprived eye following adult monocular deprivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Iny et al., 2006</xref>), and is of particular interest in the context of recovery of brain function after deprivation, disease, or damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cho and Bear, 2010</xref>).</p><p>Another robust form of visual response plasticity is induced by exposure of awake mice to oriented visual grating stimuli. Brief daily presentation of a phase-reversing grating of a single orientation causes a large and persistent increase in the peak cortical response to this orientation, as measured by visual evoked potentials (VEPs) or unit recordings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Frenkel et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cooke et al., 2015</xref>). This phenomenon is termed stimulus-selective response potentiation (SRP) because only responses to the experienced orientation are increased. Abundant evidence suggests that SRP is also mediated by “Hebbian” mechanisms, particularly those revealed by the study of long-term synaptic potentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cooke and Bear, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">2014</xref>). The mechanisms utilized for SRP within V1 have also been shown to mediate a fundamental form of long-term visual recognition memory, manifested behaviorally as orientation-selective habituation (OSH) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cooke and Bear, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cooke et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Both monocular deprivation and selective visual experience trigger input-specific increases in the short latency VEP measured in layer 4 of mouse visual cortex and, as reviewed above, both OD plasticity and SRP share some molecular requirements (<italic>e.g.,</italic> NMDAR activation). Thus, it came as a surprise that response potentiation after monocular deprivation and SRP do not occlude one another (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Frenkel and Bear, 2004</xref>), suggesting that they employ different mechanisms or are expressed by different synapses. We became interested in the possibility of differential involvement of cortical inhibition mediated by the parvalbumin-expressing (PV+) fast spiking neurons. PV+ fast-spiking inhibitory neurons comprise the most numerous sub-class of GABAergic cortical neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Xu et al., 2010</xref>) and receive substantial feed-forward glutamatergic input from the thalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cruikshank et al., 2007</xref>). These interneurons synapse preferentially on the somata and initial axon segments of principal cells, and therefore are in a position to strongly and precisely modulate even short latency visually evoked responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cristo et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Markram et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kepecs and Fishell, 2014</xref>). Moreover, previous studies have suggested that fast-spiking interneurons participate in the expression of cortical eye dominance and OD plasticity in juvenile mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yazaki-Sugiyama et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Smith and Bear, 2010</xref>). The contribution of this class of neuron to cortical plasticity is also of particular interest given the evidence for cortical PV+ neuron dysfunction in various psychiatric disorders characterized by impaired cognitive function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gogolla et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>In the current study we used a variety of approaches to understand the contribution of PV+ neurons to adult OD plasticity and SRP. We find that neither the pharmacogenetic silencing of PV+ cells nor the specific deletion of NMDARs within them affect the relative eye dominance or the expression of deprivation-enabled potentiation of VEPs in adult mice. In contrast, and quite unexpectedly, we discovered that the expression of SRP is dependent on PV+ cell activity, and that perturbations of PV+ neuron function, most notably cell-type specific ablation of NMDARs, disrupt the expression of both SRP and its behavioral correlate, familiarity recognition.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Ocular dominance is maintained in the absence of PV+ neuron activity</title><p>In order to understand the role of PV+ neurons in the expression of experience-dependent visual cortical plasticity, we selectively inactivated these cells using a Dreadd (Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs) pharmacogenetic system: Specifically, we expressed a re-engineered G-protein coupled receptor, hM4D(Gi), which is activated exclusively by an otherwise inert small molecule, clozapine-N-oxide (CNO) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nichols and Roth, 2009</xref>). The binding of CNO to the hM4D(Gi) receptor activates intracellular G<sub>i</sub>-mediated signaling and subsequent hyperpolarization of the cell in which the receptors are expressed. We locally expressed hM4D(Gi) receptors in PV+ cells of binocular V1 using an adeno-associated viral vector containing a construct for Cre-selective expression (AAV9-hSyn-DIO-HA-hM4D(Gi)-IRES-mCitrine) in mice that express Cre recombinase only in PV+ cells (B6;129P2-<italic>Pvalb<sup>tm1(cre)Arbr</sup></italic>/J, PV-Cre). We confirmed the selective expression of hM4D(Gi) receptors in PV+ neurons in binocular V1 using immunohistochemistry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–E</xref>). In order to ensure that PV+ neurons could be inactivated by this method, we took slices of V1 for ex vivo intracellular recordings. Bath application of CNO drastically inhibited current evoked action potential firing of PV+ neurons in Layer 4 (2-way repeated measures ANOVA, interaction of CNO x current injection, F<sub>(8,72)</sub> = 6.227, P &lt; 0.001, n = 10 cells, significant at data points above 100pA: q(8) = 3.716, P = 0.014) but had no effect on neighboring non-expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F–G</xref>). Layer 4 recordings in vivo demonstrated that systemic administration of CNO resulted in the elevation of visually-evoked potential (VEP) magnitude, and an increase in the firing rate of excitatory single units (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H–I</xref>), which are expected consequences of inactivating PV+ inhibitory neurons in binocular V1.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11450.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The hM4D(Gi) DREADD system locally inactivates parvalbumin+ neurons in binocular primary visual cortex (V1).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) An example of V1 expression of hM4D(Gi) in a parvalbumin (PV)-Cre recombinase (Cre) mouse infected locally in binocular V1 with AAV9-hSyn-DIO-hM4D(Gi)-mCitrine.

We probed the involvement of PV+ neuron activity in maintaining baseline OD. PV-Cre mice were infected with AAV virus to deliver hM4D(Gi) Dreadd receptors to PV+ neurons in binocular V1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Electrodes were simultaneously implanted into layer 4 of V1 for VEP recordings. VEPs elicited through just contralateral or ipsilateral eyes were acquired consecutively before and after CNO administration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–B</xref>). After CNO injection, VEPs driven through each eye increased significantly in magnitude (2-way repeated measures ANOVA, effect of CNO, F<sub>(7)</sub> = 75.986, P &lt; 0.001; contralateral eye: 222.18 ± 14.79 µV baseline vs. 679.81 ± 64.12 µV CNO, Student-Newman-Keuls (SNK) post hoc test, q<sub>(7)</sub> = 13.925, n = 8 mice, P &lt; 0.001; ipsilateral eye: 105.56 ± 6.78 µV baseline vs. 358.63 ± 35.79 µV CNO, SNK post hoc test, q<sub>(7)</sub> = 7.711, n = 8 mice, P &lt; 0.001, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), consistent with the occurrence of cortical disinhibition. However, the OD of visual responses in V1 (contra/ipsi ratio) was not significantly altered by CNO injection (2.13 ± 0.12 baseline vs. 1.96 ± 0.18 CNO, student’s paired two-tailed t-test, t<sub>(7)</sub> = 0.859, n = 8 mice, P = 0.42, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).

During the same surgical implantation procedure VEP recording electrodes were also positioned in layer 4 and chronically fixed. (<bold>B</bold>) Mice (P45-60) were infected and implanted with electrodes and then left for 3 weeks for the AAV9 viral vector to reach maximal expression, after which they underwent habituation to head-fixation and a gray screen for two consecutive days. Following this, on experimental day 0, mice were presented with an X<sup>o</sup> phase-reversing sinusoidal grating stimulus separately to the left and right eye. VEPs were recorded from each hemisphere in order to determine ocular dominance in binocular V1. Mice were then removed from the recording apparatus and, CNO was delivered systemically half an hour prior to undertaking the same recording procedure, this time using an orthogonal X + 90° visual stimulus. (<bold>C</bold>) As is well documented, responses in V1 to stimuli viewed through the contralateral eye (blue) were greater in magnitude than those elicited through the ipsilateral eye (yellow), as measured here by VEP magnitude. After application of CNO (red outlines), VEP magnitude dramatically increased.

(<bold>E</bold>) In a second group of mice, a similar experimental protocol was observed prior to measuring ocular dominance by recording VEPs in each hemisphere elicited by an X<sup>o</sup> stimulus through each eye. One hemisphere was then selected and the contralateral eye was sutured closed. After 7 days of monocular deprivation, the eye was opened and VEPs driven through either eye were again recorded, this time elicited by an X + 60° stimulus. Mice were then systemically injected with CNO and, half an hour later, VEPs driven through either eye were recorded, this time elicited by an X - 60° stimulus. (<bold>F</bold>) After the adult mice underwent 7 days of MD, there was a significant potentiation of the V1 response to visual input through the ipsilateral eye (yellow). After application of CNO (red outlines), VEPs driven through each eye were elevated in magnitude, but again the increase in VEP magnitude was scaled. (<bold>G</bold>) As a result of open eye potentiation after MD, the OD ratio shifted dramatically from the contralateral bias of pre MD (white) to an almost equal cortical response through contralateral and ipsilateral eyes (black). This shifted ratio was unaffected by hM4Di-mediated inactivation of putative fast-spiking inhibitory neurons during CNO application (red), indicating that the expression of OD and its shift as a result of MD in adult mice do not require fast-spiking inhibition.

If orientation selectivity were completely abolished by inactivation of PV+ neurons then the loss of SRP expression could be attributed to a failure of orientation discrimination rather than familiarity. A previous experiment has indicated that activation of PV+ neurons in V1 actually mildly enhances orientation-selectivity and visual discrimination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lee et al., 2012</xref>). Therefore, we used optogenetics to activate PV+ neurons while mice were presented with familiar and novel stimuli to test whether SRP expression would be enhanced, unaffected or disrupted. PV+ neurons in binocular V1 of PV-Cre mice expressed Channel-rhodopsin 2 (ChR2) as a result of infection with AAV5-EF1α-DIO-hChR2(H134R)-eYFP. During the same surgery VEP recording electrodes were implanted and optic fibers chronically implanted to deliver light to the recording site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). After stable expression 4 weeks after infection, mice were habituated to head-fixation on each of 2 days before undergoing a standard SRP experiment over 6 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B,C</xref>). Mice showed a significant increase in the magnitude of the average VEP evoked by the familiar oriented grating stimulus over days (Friedman repeated measures ANOVA on ranks, n = 11 mice, X<sup>2</sup><sub>(5)</sub>= 24.818, P &lt; 0.001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). This potentiation was evident by day 2 (237.55 ± 29.01 µV) in comparison with day 1 (182.59 ± 21.97 µV, SNK post hoc test, q<sub>(10)</sub> = 7.675, P &lt; 0.05). On day 7, mice were presented with interleaved blocks of familiar and novel stimuli. Also interleaved were blocks of familiar and novel stimuli in which blue light (473 nm) was continuously delivered via the optic fiber to the recording site in binocular V1. VEPs elicited by the novel X + 90° stimulus were significantly lower in magnitude (221.34 ± 33.55 µV) than those elicited by the familiar stimulus prior to optogenetic activation of PV+ neurons (310.70 ± 36.70 µV, 2-way repeated measures ANOVA, n = 11 mice, SNK post hoc test, q<sub>(10)</sub> = 11.799, P &lt; 0.001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Optogenetic activation of PV+ neurons significantly diminished the selectivity of SRP, as VEPs elicited by the familiar stimulus (181.23 ± 26.43 µV) and novel stimulus (157.80 ± 21.05 µV) were more similar in magnitude (interaction of stimulus x laser, F<sub>(1,10)</sub> = 46.606, P &lt; 0.001; familiar vs. novel SNK post hoc test, q<sub>(10)</sub> = 3.094, P = 0.045, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>).

A separate group of mice (n = 11) then underwent a standard 7 day MD protocol. VEPs elicited by an X<sup>o</sup> oriented stimulus were recorded at baseline, followed by the deprivation period. After eye opening VEP magnitudes were re-tested with a novel X + 60°stimulus (the standard protocol to avoid contamination of the OD shift by SRP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Frenkel and Bear, 2004</xref>]). These mice were then tested again with a second novel X - 60°stimulus after 1 hr rest and an additional 15 min after systemic 50 mg/kg ketamine administration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7J</xref>). As expected, VEPs elicited through the open ipsilateral eye (93.73 ± 12.85 µV) were significantly potentiated by 7 days of MD in the adult mouse (155.73 ± 15.86 µV, 2-way repeated measures ANOVA, SNK post hoc test, n = 11 mice, q<sub>(10)</sub> = 7.102, P &lt; 0.001), reflecting the well-documented OD shift. These same ipsilateral VEPs were then further potentiated by ketamine administration (232.03 ± 22.19 µV, SNK post hoc test, q<sub>(10)</sub> = 8.741, P &lt; 0.001). However, ketamine had a similar significant potentiating effect on the contralateral VEP (279.07 ± 14.53 µV), relative to pre-ketamine (180.14 ± 11.22 µV, SNK post hoc test, q<sub>(10)</sub> = 11.333, P &lt; 0.001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7K</xref>), suggesting a uniform scaling of response through the two eyes.

Head-restrained mice viewing a phase reversing visual grating stimulus are known to exhibit a stereotyped motor response called a visually-induced fidget, or vidget (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cooke et al., 2015</xref>). Vidgets can be measured via a piezoelectric sensor located beneath the forepaws of the mouse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). Importantly, it has been shown that the magnitude of the vidget response is inversely correlated to the familiarity of the visual stimulus. That is, a visual stimulus that is very familiar to the animal will on average evoke a relatively weak vidget behavioral response. In contrast, the presentation of a novel stimulus will on average evoke a vidget of significantly greater magnitude. Therefore, this behavioral response reflects the ability of the animal to discriminate and respond to a novel visual stimulus in its environment. Importantly, genetic and pharmacological manipulations local to V1 that inhibit SRP also disrupt the behavioral discrimination of familiar and novel stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cooke et al., 2015</xref>), demonstrating that this differential vidget response to familiar and novel stimuli is dependent on the plasticity in visual cortex.

On the 7th day mice viewed blocks of the now familiar visual stimulus interleaved with blocks of a novel oriented stimulus (X + 60°). On day 7, vidget behavioral responses were acquired via a piezoelectric device situated underneath the forepaws of the mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>), in order to measure the animal’s discrimination of familiar and novel stimuli. On day 8, PV+ cells in V1 were then inactivated by systemic delivery of CNO (i.p.) and vidget responses were acquired to the familiar X<sup>o</sup> stimulus and a second X - 60° novel stimulus. Inactivation of PV+ neurons in V1 significantly affected stimulus discrimination (2-way repeated measures ANOVA, interaction of treatment x stimulus, F<sub>(1,18)</sub> = 13.644, P = 0.002, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>): Prior to CNO, mice exhibited significantly larger vidget responses to the novel visual stimulus (3.64 ± 0.32 a.u.) than the familiar stimulus (1.95 ± 0.26 a.u., SNK post-hoc test, q<sub>(18)</sub> = 9.237, P &lt; 0.001).

The deleterious effect of PV+ cell inactivation in V1 on the animal’s ability to discriminate familiar and novel stimuli is most obvious when a ratio of response to familiar/novel visual stimuli is calculated. Prior to CNO delivery this ratio was significantly lower (0.54 ± 0.04) than during CNO treatment (1.00 ± 0.15, Wilcoxon signed rank test, W = 138.000, Z = 2.777, P = 0.004, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>).

However, the difference was not significant (SNK post hoc test, q<sub>(16)</sub> = 2.570, P = 0.079).

These include modulation of the sensitivity of visual cortex to the effects of MD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fagiolini et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hanover et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Huang et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chattopadhyaya et al., 2004</xref>) and the functional expression of the OD shift (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Maffei et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yazaki-Sugiyama et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Smith and Bear, 2010</xref>). Our findings indicate that expression of OD plasticity in adult mice does not require participation of the PV+ neurons. In interpreting the current findings, it is important to recognize how juvenile and adult OD plasticity differ. In juvenile mice (&lt; ~P35), a rapid and reliable consequence of MD is depression in cortex of responses mediated by the deprived eye. This is followed by a progressive compensatory increase in responses through the non-deprived eye (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Frenkel and Bear, 2004</xref>). In adult mice maintained under standard laboratory conditions, depression of deprived-eye responses can be a weak and variable consequence of MD, but potentiation of the non-deprived eye still occurs reliably (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sawtell et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sato and Stryker, 2008</xref>). This deprivation-enabled response potentiation is not mediated by homeostatic synaptic scaling because it requires visual experience through the non-deprived eye (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Blais et al., 2008</xref>), activation of cortical NMDA receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sawtell et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sato and Stryker, 2008</xref>), and is unaffected (in adults) by genetic deletion of TNFα that abolishes scaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ranson et al., 2012</xref>). These features are consistent with an alternative hypothesis that the adult OD shift occurs because deprivation of the dominant contralateral eye causes a metaplastic shift in the LTP threshold, enabling visual experience through the weaker ipsilateral eye to drive “Hebbian” synaptic strengthening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cooper and Bear, 2012</xref>). This interpretation is supported by evidence that light deprivation promotes LTP in visual cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kirkwood et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Philpot et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">2003</xref>) and that αCaMKII mutants that lack LTP also lack adult OD plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ranson et al., 2012</xref>), and it is compatible with our finding that expression of the adult OD shift is not dependent on the activity of PV+ inhibitory neurons.</p><p>Saiepour and colleagues also recently observed that ocular dominance index (ODI) values of V1 neurons are not altered by PV+ interneuron suppression in monocularly deprived adult mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Saiepour et al., 2015</xref>). Using single unit recordings they first showed that monocular deprivation caused a shift in ODI values towards the non-deprived eye, as expected. They then tested the dependence of this shift on PV+ cell activity by measuring ODI values of V1 neurons during optogenetic suppression of PV+ cells. This optogenetic-suppression did not alter the deprivation-induced shift in ODI values. Our results using VEP recordings and PV+ suppression via hM4Di Dreadd receptors are in agreement with these results from Saiepour and colleagues, demonstrating that suppression of PV+ cell activity after deprivation does not interfere with the expression of the adult OD shift. Although the findings that PV+ neurons are not necessary for expression of OD plasticity do not rule out a modulatory role in the induction mechanisms, we note that the adult OD shift still occurred in mutant mice in which PV+ neurons lack NMDARs.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>PV+ interneurons and SRP in V1</title><p>In contrast to the adult OD shift, we found that the expression of SRP relies on PV+ neuron circuitry. This finding came as a surprise, as SRP reflects the potentiation of short-latency synaptic currents and increased spiking activity in layer 4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cooke et al., 2015</xref>), and previous experiments had strongly indicated that SRP might be considered a naturally occurring form of LTP. For example, induction of SRP is input-specific, dependent upon NMDA receptor activation and α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor (AMPAR) insertion in principal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Frenkel et al., 2006</xref>), and reversed by infusion of the zeta-inhibitory peptide (ZIP) that also erases LTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cooke and Bear, 2010</xref>). Furthermore, LTP elicited by theta-burst stimulation of the thalamus occludes and is occluded by SRP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cooke and Bear, 2010</xref>). Altogether, these findings suggest a modification of feed-forward excitatory synaptic transmission.</p><p>Before assigning a specific role to inhibition in the expression of SRP, two relatively trivial explanations must be addressed. The first is that the loss of discrimination of familiar and novel orientations could be accounted for simply by a failure of orientation selectivity and not by a failure of memory. Throughout the experiments presented here we have used orientations that are at least 60° and often 90° different, meaning that orientation discrimination should be as unchallenging as possible. Given the modest impact on orientation tuning of suppressing PV+ interneuron activity in V1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Runyan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adesnik et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wilson et al., 2012</xref>) we believe that this explanation is improbable. However, we took a direct approach to testing this possibility by stimulating activity in PV+ cells using channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) while mice are viewing familiar and novel oriented stimuli. Stimulation of PV+ inhibition has been shown to actually mildly enhance orientation-selectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lee et al., 2012</xref>) and yet our experiments reveal that the difference between visual cortical response to familiar and novel orientations is significantly diminished by activation PV+ neurons. This result casts PV+ neurons in a very specific role in the recognition of familiar stimuli in addition to modest participation in orientation-selectivity.</p><p>A second concern is that, after the suppression of PV+ inhibition, V1 may be operating outside the dynamic range where discrimination is possible. However, we show that the cortex responds to input from the contralateral eye with a response of approximately double the magnitude of that elicited by input through the ipsilateral eye even after silencing the PV+ cells, suggesting that the response of the cortex is not saturated. We also find that PV+ neuron silencing affects SRP even when it is induced using lower contrast stimuli that evoke submaximal responses. Moreover, it is also worth noting that less specific pharmacological approaches to suppressing inhibition in V1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Khibnik et al., 2010</xref>) result in much greater magnitude of response to visual input than we observe here for PV+ neuron inactivation, PV-GluN1 KO or ketamine application, indicating that our manipulations do not encroach on a physiological ceiling.</p><p>One relatively simple explanation for the current findings is that SRP results from lasting homosynaptic (<italic>i.e.</italic> input-specific) long-term depression (LTD) of glutamatergic input to PV+ inhibitory neurons. Thereafter, presentation of a familiar stimulus evokes a greater response in V1 due to selective disinhibition of cortical circuitry. This hypothesis is consistent with our observation that SRP is deficient if NMDARs are no longer expressed on PV+ cells. However, because we used a non-reversible genetic modification in our initial PV-GluN1 KO experiment, we were initially unable to show if these receptors were important for the storage of information or the retrieval of information already stored. Ketamine, which among other actions serves as a non-competitive NMDAR antagonist, has been shown to preferentially antagonize NMDARs on PV+ cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Homayoun and Moghaddam, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Seamans, 2008</xref>). By using ketamine to induce a temporary blockade of these receptors, which we confirmed by showing that there was no impact of ketamine on V1 responses in the PV-GluN1 KO mice, we were able to demonstrate that interference with NMDARs on PV+ cells disrupts <italic>expression</italic> of SRP even after it has been induced and saturated. Importantly, acute application of ketamine did not affect the maintenance or stability of stored information, because a strong bias for the familiar stimulus returned after ketamine washout. If SRP is indeed accounted for by homosynaptic depression of excitatory synapses carrying information about the familiar stimulus orientation, this LTD would need to be expressed by a synapse-specific reduction in NMDAR-mediated responses in order to account for these findings.</p><p>However, this simple model is difficult to reconcile with the findings reviewed above that SRP depends on LTP-like mechanisms, <italic>e.g.</italic>, NMDAR-dependent AMPAR delivery in principal cells. Considered together, the findings to date indicate that induction and maintenance of SRP occur by modification of excitatory synapses onto excitatory neurons, but that expression of SRP is mediated by stimulus-selective modulation of PV-cell activity in V1. Obviously a polysynaptic circuit is required to yield these properties, and dissecting this essential cortical circuitry will require much more work. However, it is interesting to note a recent study by Makino and Komiyama who showed, in addition to a stimulus-selective reduction in PV+ neuron activity in V1 as mice were repeatedly exposed to a specific visual stimulus, an experience-dependent increase in the responsiveness of somatostatin-positive interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Makino and Komiyama, 2015</xref>). This result is particularly interesting as it is known that many interneuron types innervate one another and, therefore, that the activity of these cell types are interdependent. It is not difficult to sketch circuits in which stimulus-selective, feed-forward polysynaptic inhibition of PV+ cells accounts for SRP expression. Clearly, experiments aimed at teasing apart the involvement of other interneuron types in SRP should now be a high priority.</p><p>We note that other studies have suggested that PV+ neurons may be important for plasticity following repeated exposure to sensory stimuli. For instance, Meyer and colleagues, studying infero-temporal cortex (IT) in monkeys, showed that familiarity resulted in a sharpening of cortical responses to dynamic visual stimuli, which was likely orchestrated by local fast-spiking putative PV+ cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Meyer et al., 2014</xref>). Additionally, mice constitutively lacking neuronal activity-regulated pentraxin (NARP), a synaptic protein specifically enriched at excitatory synapses on PV+ cells, displayed a reduction in excitatory synapses onto PV+ cells and impairment in SRP-like effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gu et al., 2013</xref>). Intriguingly, however, the NARP KO mice also failed to exhibit both juvenile and adult OD plasticity. In juvenile animals, it is well established that reducing inhibition can impair induction of OD plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ramoa et al., 1988</xref>) and delay the developmental decline in the mechanism of deprived-eye depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hanover et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Huang et al., 1999</xref>). We speculate that the loss of OD plasticity in the adult NARP KO may be related to disruption of the developmental switch from juvenile to adult-type OD plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Heimel et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Our findings indicate that although open-eye potentiation as a result of MD in the adult and SRP are superficially similar, the expression mechanisms of these two forms of plasticity are quite distinct. Based on evidence provided here as well as by others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sawtell et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ranson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Saiepour et al., 2015</xref>), the deprivation enabled potentiation of the open eye is consistent with a potentiation of synapses between excitatory cells and is independent of PV+ cell inhibition. However, further work will be necessary to confirm that open eye potentiation in the adult animal is expressed by synaptic alterations between excitatory cells, and to determine whether these processes are present at the level of thalamocortical synapses or intracortical synapses.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>PV+ interneurons and familiarity recognition</title><p>SRP correlates with OSH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cooke et al., 2015</xref>), a form of visual learning which is dependent upon NMDARs in V1, and which enables the animal to make the critically important discrimination between familiarity and novelty. We have shown here that modulation of PV+ neuron activity in V1 is required for this selective recognition of familiarity and consequent novelty detection. Loss of NMDAR function in these same cells also impairs familiarity recognition.

This notably includes observations of the profound psychotomimetic effect in humans of non-competitive NMDAR antagonists such as ketamine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Krystal et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Krystal, 2015</xref>), a substance that, as we show here, prevents SRP expression. We suggest that understanding the cortical physiology underlying the processes of familiarity recognition and novelty detection may yield great insight into dysfunction underlying some symptoms of these disorders and that, because these processes are as important to mice as they are to humans, they are likely to be experimentally tractable.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p>All procedures adhered to the guidelines of the National Institutes of Health and were approved by the Committee on Animal Care at MIT, Cambridge, MA, USA. For all experiments mice were male, aged between P60-90 and on a C57BL/6 background (Charles River laboratory international, Wilmington, MA). They were housed in groups of 2–5 with food and water available <italic>ad libitum</italic> and maintained on a 12 hr light-dark cycle. For hM4D(Gi) experiments, mice were Parvalbumin-Cre recombinase knock-in mice (B6;129P2-<italic>Pvalb<sup>tm1(cre)Arbr</sup></italic>/J, PV-Cre) on a C57BL/6 background. For GluN1 knockdown experiments, these PV-Cre mice were bred with homozygous mice in which the Grin1 gene, which encodes the GluN1 sub-unit was flanked by LoxP sites (B6.129S4-<italic>Grin1<sup>tm2Stl</sup></italic>/J, GluN1 fl/fl), enabling Cre-dependent ablation of this mandatory subunit of the NMDA receptor. Multiple generations were required to set up crosses yielding offspring that were homozygous GluN1 fl/fl and Cre-expressing. Of these approximately 50% expressed Cre and 50% served as wild-type littermates on the GluN1 fl/fl background. All experiments were conducted blind to genotype and treatment.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Surgery</title><p>Mice were first injected with 0.1 mg/kg Buprenex sub-cutaneously (s.c.) to provide analgesia. They were then anesthetized with an intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of 50 mg/kg ketamine and 10 mg/kg xylazine. Prior to surgical incision, 1% lidocaine hydrochloride anesthetic was injected under the mouse’s scalp. The skull was then cleaned with iodine and 70% ethanol. A steel head post was affixed to the skull anterior to bregma using cyanoacrylate glue. Burr holes (&lt; 0.5 mm) were then drilled in the skull over binocular V1 (3.1 mm lateral of lambda). Tapered tungsten recording electrodes (FHC, Bowdoinham, ME, US), 75 μm in diameter at their widest point, were implanted in each hemisphere, 450 μm below cortical surface. Silver wire (A-M systems, Sequim, WA, US) reference electrodes were placed over prefrontal cortex. Mice were allowed to recover for at least 24 hr prior to head-fixation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Viral infections</title><p>For hM4D(Gi) experiments, we infected V1 of P30-60 PV-Cre mice or wild-type littermates with an AAV9-hSyn-DIO-HA-hM4D(Gi)-IRES-mCitrine virus (UNC viral core – generated by Dr. Brian Roth’s laboratory) and for optogenetic experiments we infected mice from the same line with AAV5-EF1α-DIO-hChR2(H134R)-eYFP (UNC viral core – generated by Dr. Karl Deisseroth’s laboratory). Using a glass pipette and nanoject system (Drummond scientific, Broomall, PA, US), we delivered 81 nl of virus at each of 3 cortical depths: 600, 450, and 300 µm from the cortical surface, and allowed 5 min between re-positioning for depth. Mice were allowed 3–4 weeks recovery for virus expression to peak before experiments were initiated.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Drug delivery</title><p>Clozapine-N-oxide (CNO, Enzo Life Sciences) was diluted in saline and injected i.p. at a dosage of 5 mg/kg 30 min prior to stimulus delivery.

Visual stimuli were generated using custom software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bearlab-s1.mit.edu/supp6/PlxStimOne_Opto.zip">http://bearlab-s1.mit.edu/supp6/PlxStimOne_Opto.zip</ext-link>) written in either C++ for interaction with a VSG2/2 card (Cambridge Research systems, Kent, U.K.) or Matlab (MathWorks, Natick, MA, U.S.) using the PsychToolbox extension (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://psychtoolbox.org">http://psychtoolbox.org</ext-link>) to control stimulus drawing and timing. The display was positioned 20 cm in front of the mouse and centered, thereby occupying 92° × 66° of the visual field. Visual stimuli consisted of full-field sinusoidal grating stimuli phase reversing at a frequency of 2 Hz. Mean stimulus luminance was 27 cd/m<sup>2</sup>. Grating stimuli spanned the full range of monitor display values between black and white, with gamma-correction to ensure constant total luminance in both gray-screen and patterned stimulus conditions. For data described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>, experiments were fully automated and each stimulus block consisted of 200 phase reversals with 30-s intervals between each stimulus presentation, during which the screen was gray but of equivalent luminance. For experiments described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref> stimulus blocks were also 200 phase reversals in length but each was triggered directly by the experimenter, meaning that the interval was approximately 30-s. Throughout, stimulus orientation varied such that a novel orientation was always a minimum of 25° different from any experienced previously by the individual mouse and was never within 20° of horizontal because these orientations are known to elicit VEPs of greater magnitude than vertical or oblique stimuli. If more than 1 orientation was shown within a session, stimuli were pseudo-randomly interleaved such that 3 consecutive presentations of the same stimulus never occurred. For monocular presentation an occluding paddle was positioned in front of one eye to limit stimulus presentation to the opposite eye.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>In vivo electrophysiology</title><p>VEP recordings were conducted in awake, head-restrained mice. Prior to recording, mice were habituated to the restraint apparatus by sitting in situ in front of a gray screen for a 30-minute session on each of two consecutive days. For experiments in which monocular VEPs were subsequently acquired, mice were also habituated to the occluding paddle positioned in front of each eye. On stimulus presentation days, mice were presented with 5 blocks of 200 phase reversals of each oriented stimulus separated by gray screen presentation for ~30 s. For monocular presentations, recordings were conducted in sequence for each eye. VEP magnitude was then quantified by measuring trough-peak response magnitude averaged over all phase reversals.</p><p>Recordings presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref> were amplified and digitized using the Recorder-64 system (Plexon Inc., Dallas, TX). Two recording channels were dedicated to recording EEG/VEPs from V1 in each implanted hemisphere and a third recording channel was reserved for the Piezo-electrical input carrying the behavioral information. Recordings presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref> were amplified using DAM80 amplifiers (World Precision Instruments, Florida, U.S.) and digitized using a custom National Instruments system (National Instruments, Texas, U.S.)). Local field potential was recorded from V1 with 1 kHz sampling and a 500 Hz low-pass filter. Data was extracted from the binary storage files and analyzed using custom software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bearlab-s1.mit.edu/supp6/VEP_Analysis.zip">http://bearlab-s1.mit.edu/supp6/VEP_Analysis.zip</ext-link>) written in C++, Matlab and Labview. VEPs were averaged across all phase reversals within a block and trough-peak difference measured during a 200-millisecond period from phase reversal.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Ex vivo electrophysiology</title><p>For experiments concerning Dreadd receptor expression in PV+ cells presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>: Three weeks after infection with AAV9-hSyn-DIO- HA-hM4D(Gi)-IRES-mCitrine virus, visual cortical slices were prepared from the injected mice as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Philpot et al., 2001</xref>). After dissection 350-µm-thick coronal slices recovered for 30 min at 32°C and then for an additional 2 hr at room temperature, in a holding chamber filled with warmed artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF), which contained: 124 mM NaCl, 3.5 mM KCl, 1.25 mM Na<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 26 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 1.2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, and 10 mM dextrose, saturated with 95% O<sub>2</sub>, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Whole cell patch clamp recordings were performed at 30°C from the parvalbumin-positive interneurons in the layer 4, identified by the ECFP fluorescence. Pipette tip resistances were 3–5 MΩ. Internal solution contained: 20 mM KCl, 100 mM Na-gluconate, 10 Hepes, 4 mM MgATP, 0.3 mM Na2GTP, 7 mM phosphocreatine-Tris, 0.2% biocytin with pH adjusted to 7.2 and osmolarity adjusted to 300 mOsm. All recordings were made using Axopatch 200B (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) at 10 kHz sampling rate. Cells with the series resistance &lt;30 MΩ were included for analysis. Data analysis was done using pClamp (Molecular Devices) and custom-written python scripts. For experiments concerning NMDAR EPSCs and AMPAR EPSCs in PV-GluN1 KO mice as presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>: 4 PV-GluN1 KO mice were infected with AAV5-EF1α-DIO-hChR2(H134R)-eYFP, to allow for fluorescence-guided intracellular recordings of PV+ cells. Four weeks after infection, visual cortical slices were prepared as describe above. For fluorescently labeled PV+ cells and unlabeled neighboring excitatory cells: EPSCs were recorded at -70 mV and +40 mV with pipettes filled with balanced intracellular solutions (in mM): 115 cesium methane-sulfonate (CsMeSO3), 2.8 NaCl, 0.4 EGTA, 4 ATP-Mg<sup>2+</sup>, 10 Na<sup>+</sup>-phosphocreatine, 0.5 Na<sup>+</sup>-GTP, 5 TEA-Cl<sup>-</sup>, 5 QX-314 Br<sup>-</sup> buffered with 20 HEPES, pH 7.25, osmolarity 290 mOsm. Synaptic events were evoked by stimulation of the white mater (150 μs, 0.1 Hz, glass electrode, and stimulator A365 from WPI). AMPA component was measured from EPSCs at -70 mV in the presence of PTX (100 μM) and glycine (1 μM) and NMDA component was measured from EPSCs at +40 mV in the presence of DNQX (20 μM).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Behavior</title><p>All behavioral experiments were performed during the mouse subject’s light cycle. A piezo-electrical recording device (C.B. Gitty, Barrington, NH, USA) was placed under the forepaws of head-restrained mice during all sessions. Mice became accustomed to the apparatus by sitting in situ in front of a gray screen for a 30-min session on each of 2 days. Before stimulus presentation on each day mice also underwent 5 min of gray screen presentation after the experimenter had left the room. A continuous voltage signal was recorded from the piezo device for the entire session. Movements were detected as a shift in the voltage signal. The recording system was automated so that no one was ever present in the closed room for any of the recording period and white noise was played at 67 dB in order to mask outside noise.</p><p>For vidget scoring, the continuous voltage signal was down-sampled to 100 Hz. The period of interest in the experiments described here lasted from 2 s prior to stimulus onset until 5 s after stimulus onset (which was the first 10 phase reversals in a block). Quantification of movement driven by the onset of the stimulus (the vidget) was calculated by taking the Root Mean Square (SQRT(X<sup>2</sup>)) of the voltage signal. Post-stimulus signal was then normalized to the average magnitude during the 2-s period prior to stimulus onset. The average normalized magnitude across the 5-s period subsequent to stimulus presentation was then used to quantify the degree of stimulus-driven movement and this is described throughout in arbitrary units (a.u.).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Optogenetics</title><p>After viral infection mice were also bilaterally implanted with VEP recording electrodes positioned in layer 4. Ready-made optic fibres (200 µm girth) mounted in stainless steel ferrules (1.25 mm diameter, 2 mm fibre projection, Thor labs, Newton, NJ, US) were then implanted positioned lateral (3.5 mm lateral to lambda) to the recording site and at a 45° angle to the recording electrode, 0.1 mm below surface in each hemisphere. 1 month later, after peak of viral expression, mice were habituated to the head-fixation apparatus over 2 days before conducting optogenetic experiments. We delivered 31-s long continuous pulses of blue light (473 nm, 150 mW) into V1 using a laser (Optoengine LLC, Midvale, UT, US). These light pulses were delivered simultaneous to 50% of the 30-s long visual stimulus presentations, commencing 30 ms prior to visual stimulus onset and ending 30 ms after offset. Animals were sacrificed and perfused within a week after this experiment for histological analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Immunohistochemistry</title><p>Mice were deeply anaesthetized with fatal plus (pentobarbital) and perfused with saline followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer. The brain was removed and post-fixed for 24 hr at room temperature. After fixation, the brain was sectioned into 60 µm coronal slices using a vibratome. Slices were incubated with blocking solution (10% fetal bovine serum in PBS with 0.2% Triton X-100) for 1 hr at room temperature and then with anti-Parvalbumin mouse primary antibody (MAB1572, Millipore, Billerica, MA; 1:1000) and anti-GFP antibody (Ab290, Abcam, Cambridge, United Kingdom; 1:7000) details diluted in blocking solution overnight at 4 degrees Celsius. Slices were then washed three times with PBS and incubated with the secondary antibody for 1 hr at room temperature (Alexa488-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA; 1:500, Alexa594-conjugated anti-mouse IgG, Invitrogen; 1:500). Slices were washed three times with PBS and mounted with 49,6-diamidino-2 phenylindole (DAPI)-containing Vectashield (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Fluorescence images were taken with a confocal fluorescence microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan).</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Statistics</title><p>In the results section, all data is expressed as a mean ± standard error of the mean (S.E.M). Sigmaplot was used for statistical analysis. Normality of distribution and homogeneity of variation was tested and parametric ANOVAs (for multiple groups) or t-tests (for 2 groups) were performed when data passed these tests. Otherwise, non-parametric ANOVAs or t-tests on ranks were used. If ANOVAs yielded significance, Student-Newman-Keuls post-hoc tests with adjustment for multiple comparisons were applied for individual comparisons. Repeated measures ANOVAs or paired t-tests were applied for all within subject comparisons. For other comparisons unpaired ANOVAs or t-tests were used. Individual tests used are described in the results. P &lt; 0.05 is used as a threshold for significance throughout but exact P values are given for all comparisons for which the P value is above 0.001. Post-hoc power analyses were used to determine that comparisons reached a power of &gt; 0.8 for an alpha value of 0.05. Technical replicates were only used as N for the ex vivo electrophysiological test of hM4D(Gi) efficacy, when 10 cells were recorded from 7 mice, and the test of NMDAR functional loss in PV-GluN1 KO mice, when 8 cells were recorded from 5 mice. Throughout the remainder of the study we report the N is an individual animal (biological replicate). Technical replicates (secondary samples within each animal) were not undertaken for in vivo electrophysiology. Although both hemispheres were implanted initially, a decision was made as to the best hemisphere, based on response magnitude, morphology and binocularity after the very first recording (prior to any measure of plasticity). Technical replicates were undertaken for the behavior, with 10, 6 (for PV-HM4D(Gi) experiments) or 5 stimulus onsets (for PV-GluN1 KO experiment) being delivered per day, although we only report the daily average (biological replicate). There variations in protocol were due experiments being conducted by different experimenters at different times. However, protocols were completely consistent across treatments/genotypes. The individual technical replicates are available in the uploaded source data files.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This research was supported by the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, the National Eye Institute (5R01EYO23037) and The Picower Institute Innovation Fund.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Thomas Mrsic-Flogel, who is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and overseen by Gary Westbrook as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript provides evidence that PV-expressing interneurons do not contribute to the expression of an ocular dominance shift in adult V1, but are involved in the expression of selective response potentiation in V1 as shown with visual evoked responses in V1 and at the behavioral level. The authors also show that ketamine interferes with the expression of SRP, but not with the expression of an adult OD shift. Finally the authors provide evidence for the contribution of NMDA-receptors on PV interneurons to SRP and its prevention by ketamine. The experiments provide novel insights into how PV-expressing interneurons contribute to different forms of plasticity in adult V1. The study will appeal to scientists working on cortical plasticity and provides information relevant for understanding psychiatric disorders (especially schizophrenia).</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Here is the summary of the main suggestions for revision, which we think you will be able to address in your revision.</p><p>1) The suggestion that ketamine acts mostly on the NMDAR receptors of PV interneurons is interesting (and potentially relevant to schizophrenia research). However, the claim that NMDAR in PV cells are solely responsible for the ketamine effect on SRP is not convincing, as it is possible that ketamine also affects SRP through NMDA receptors on excitatory neurons or by acting through sites other than the NMDA receptor. The reviewers therefore think it would be pertinent to investigate whether GluN1 was knocked out in all PV interneurons. If not, it would explain the leftover SRP in the PV GluN1 KO mice (and possibly the leftover effect of ketamine on SRP). One way (but not the only way) to test the completeness of KO in the floxed line is to use GluN2A immunocytochemistry. The logic here is that GluN2A remains cytoplasmic in NMDAR1 deficient cells. One could then in principle detect whether there is a fraction of PV cells that do not have GluN2A in the cytoplasm. This control (or some other control experiment addressing the cell-type specificity of ketamine dependence of SRF) might be sufficient to explain your results and strengthen your claims.</p><p>2) All reviewers found that the discussion about mechanisms underlying SRP was not sufficiently specific or detailed. For example, it is not clear where in the circuit the changes are occurring, and whether SRP relates to spiking or is only apparent at the synaptic level. In particular, do stimulus-selective changes in VEPs reflect enhanced spiking of principal neurons, of inhibitory neurons, changes of feed-forward thalamocortical synaptic drive onto which neuron class, changes of top-down modulation (e.g. Makino and Komiyama 2015)? It is also not clear whether PV cells are required for the induction of SRP, which would be predicted by some models of cortical plasticity. Finally, it is not sufficiently discussed how PV neuron activity could modulate VEPs in a stimulus-specific manner while accounting for the fact that the Bear lab has previously shown that LTP-like phenomena (AMPAR insertion, NMDAR-dependence, occlusion by thalamocortical LTP) are critical for SRP and OSH expression (Frenkel et al. 2006, Cooke and Bear 2010). We therefore strongly encourage you to propose a coherent, defendable and detailed mechanistic view about SRP, and how this is different from OD plasticity, in the Discussion.</p><p>3) Can the (variability of) behavior of the animal influence the measurement and quantification of SRP results? The reviewers request additional quantification to ensure that behavioral differences cannot explain neural response differences (i.e. does the VEP response precede any behavioral response?).</p><p>4) We encourage you to acknowledge the findings by Saiepour 2015 (expression of OD plasticity not strongly affected by PV manipulations). Although this work reduces some of the novelty of the results about OD plasticity, the reviewers still found it an important dataset in this manuscript.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11450.026</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>This manuscript provides evidence that PV-expressing interneurons do not contribute to the expression of an ocular dominance shift in adult V1, but are involved in the expression of selective response potentiation in V1 as shown with visual evoked responses in V1 and at the behavioral level.

We thank the reviewers for highlighting our lack of clarity on this issue. The purpose of our application of ketamine in the PV-GluN1 knockout was to demonstrate that, in specific regard to increases in the magnitude of the VEP, the selective loss of NMDAR function in PV+ cells was sufficient to completely abolish the impact of ketamine, which is the result that we show in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7E</xref> and F. A range of other physiological consequences of ketamine may well be unimpaired by loss of NMDAR function selectively in PV+ cells but are not the focus of investigation in this particular study. We note that the effect of ketamine to significantly increase VEP magnitude in wild-type mice is paradoxical because a glutamate receptor blocker might be expected to reduce excitatory transmission in the brain. This finding is, however, consistent with other observations that the drug reduces cortical inhibition and therefore increases cortical excitation by acting preferentially (but by no means exclusively) on GABAergic fast-spiking cells in the cortex through NMDAR (Houmayoun 2007; and reviewed by Seamans 2008).</p><p>The reviewers suggest that there may be some residual SRP in the PV-GluN1 KO mice due to incomplete genetic deletion of the receptors in those cells. In order to address this question directly, we conducted fluorescence-guided intracellular recordings from ex vivo slices if V1 to confirm the loss of NMDAR-mediated currents in PV+ cells from the PV-GluN1 KO mice. As expected, recordings from PV+ interneurons in V1 revealed a lack of any significant NMDAR-mediated excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs), while showing normal AMPAR-mediated EPSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>). Conversely, neighboring principal cells displayed both NMDAR and AMPAR-mediated EPSCs. The selective loss of NMDAR EPSCs in PV+ neurons in the PV-GluN1 KO mice is reflected by plotting the NMDAR/AMPAR EPSC ratio in PV+ cells as well as neighboring principal cells. Thus, PV+ neurons sampled from V1 in the PV-GluN1 knockout mice failed to express NMDA receptors. This data has been added to the manuscript as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>.</p><p>Unfortunately, immunohistochemistry for any of the NMDAR subunits proved extremely challenging (largely due to the quality of commercially available antibodies) and we were unable to convince ourselves that this method could be used to confirm that every single PV+ neuron in V1 lacked NMDAR function. However, given the consensus within the literature on ketamine’s actions through NMDAR expressed within PV+ neurons, we believe that the fact that we observed no effect whatsoever of ketamine on VEP magnitude in the PV-GluN1 KO mice, in contrast to their wild-type littermates, indicates that the genetic deletion of GluN1 within PV+ cells must be close to complete across all PV+ neurons within V1 of these knockout animals.</p><p>We agree that it is an important issue to understand more deeply what mechanism has accounted for the remaining SRP that exists in the PV-GluN1 knockout mouse, which is not observed with acute ketamine blockade. As a result of our confirmation that NMDAR-mediated currents are completely absent from at least all sampled PV+ cells in the PV-GluN1 KO mice, we hypothesize that the residual potentiation in the PV-GluN1 may derive from some form of developmental compensation that could occur through another subclass of neuron or another receptor type. Acute manipulation of NMDARs via ketamine would not allow for such compensation to occur, and therefore could explain the complete abolishment of SRP expression in the ketamine experiment that was not apparent in the PV-GluN1 knockout. It is possible that in SRP, NMDARs may be involved not only on PV+ cells but also on principal cells (Frenkel 2006). In this case, the effect of ketamine on NMDARs expressed on principal cells may also contribute to the complete lack of SRP expression in these experiments (even if it cannot account for the action of ketamine on VEP magnitude), in comparison to the PV-GluN1 KO mouse experiments. In order to test this hypothesis, future studies will probe the involvement of NMDARs on principal cells in various cortical layers in SRP. The alternative explanation, that another class of receptor compensates for the loss of NMDAR in the PV-GluN1 KO is also worthy of further investigation.</p><p><italic>2) All reviewers found that the discussion about mechanisms underlying SRP was not sufficiently specific or detailed. For example, it is not clear where in the circuit the changes are occurring, and whether SRP relates to spiking or is only apparent at the synaptic level. In particular, do stimulus-selective changes in VEPs reflect enhanced spiking of principal neurons, of inhibitory neurons, changes of feed-forward thalamocortical synaptic drive onto which neuron class, changes of top-down modulation (e.g. Makino and Komiyama 2015)? It is also not clear whether PV cells are required for the induction of SRP, which would be predicted by some models of cortical plasticity. Finally, it is not sufficiently discussed how PV neuron activity could modulate VEPs in a stimulus-specific manner while accounting for the fact that the Bear lab has previously shown that LTP-like phenomena (AMPAR insertion, NMDAR-dependence, occlusion by thalamocortical LTP) are critical for SRP and OSH expression (Frenkel et al. 2006, Cooke and Bear 2010). We therefore strongly encourage you to propose a coherent, defendable and detailed mechanistic view about SRP, and how this is different from OD plasticity, in the Discussion.</italic> </p><p>We appreciate the need for clear overall insight and have modified the Discussion section to accommodate those possible interpretations of the underlying mechanisms of SRP that we can currently envisage. It is becoming increasingly clear that this is a far more complex phenomenon than we had previously realized and may, therefore, be more interesting in many ways.</p><p>Previously published data has provided evidence that SRP is apparent at the synaptic level as well as being expressed as changes in neural spiking. Multi-unit recordings from Layer 4 of wild-type animals showed that peak firing rate in response to a familiar stimulus was significantly elevated compared to those evoked by a novel stimulus (Cooke et al., 2015). In response to a phase reversing visual stimulus, the negative-going component of the VEP occurs simultaneously with a short latency spiking response to the visual stimulus. Familiar stimuli drive larger VEPs and increased neural spiking in Layer 4 in comparison to novel stimuli. By using laminar probes that span the cortical layers, we have also explored how familiarity changes the laminar flow of current sinks and sources and using current source density analysis (Cooke et al., 2015). From this we have observed alterations across multiple V1 layers resulting from experience, but the most striking effects are apparent in the short-latency layer 4 current sink, where familiar stimuli drive a larger current sink and increase the spiking of L4 neurons. Our current findings indicate that this increased spiking in L4 in part derives from removal of inhibition mediated by PV+ neurons.</p><p>Although it is known that experience drives changes in synaptic and spiking activity, we do not yet know how changes in spiking relate directly to individual cell types, which is an area of active investigation. Previously published data has also revealed that although there is evidence for thalamocortical (TC) LTP-like phenomena as a mechanism underlying SRP (Frenkel et al., 2006, Cooke and Bear 2010), selectivity for familiar and novel stimuli cannot be fully explained by changes occurring at the TC synapse in Layer 4. Isolation of the TC synaptic response by silencing intra-cortical spiking revealed a loss of SRP expression, suggesting that although changes may be occurring at the level of the TC synapse, downstream intra-cortical network alterations are involved (Cooke and Bear, 2014). We propose that these LTP-like changes previously reported are critical in the induction and maintenance of the stored information related to the familiar stimulus. Alterations in PV+ cell activity are necessary, however, for the retrieval/expression of this information. Since the major focus of this paper was on the expression mechanisms of SRP, the role of PV+ cells in the induction process remains unknown but we plan to pursue this further. A discussion of this hypothesis and how it differs from adult OD plasticity is presented in the revised Discussion section of the manuscript.</p><p><italic>3) Can the (variability of) behavior of the animal influence the measurement and quantification of SRP results? The reviewers request additional quantification to ensure that behavioral differences cannot explain neural response differences (i.e. does the VEP response precede any behavioral response?).</italic> </p><p>The reviewers certainly raise an understandable concern, that differences in cortical physiology could be reflective of behavioral events rather than the other way round. In our previous paper (Cooke et al. 2015, Nature Neuroscience) we have discussed this issue at length and presented data showing that the visually induced behavioral response (vidget) commences ~150 ms after stimulus onset, a good 100 ms after the peak negativity of the first VEPs that we record. More importantly, we have reported that behavioral responses do not occur on all stimulus presentations and for the 5 stimulus onsets (gray to phase reversing grating) that occur on each recording day, only a subset will produce a behavioral response. However, the VEPs evoked during each of these stimulus blocks are similar in magnitude, regardless of whether a behavioral response has occurred or not and the difference in cortical response between familiar and novel stimuli is maintained even for all of those stimulus blocks where no behavior occurred. Thus, the behavior itself does not account in any way for VEP magnitude or the phenomenon of SRP.</p><p><italic>4) We encourage you to acknowledge the findings by Saiepour 2015 (expression of OD plasticity not strongly affected by PV manipulations). Although this work reduces some of the novelty of the results about OD plasticity, the reviewers still found it an important dataset in this manuscript.</italic> </p><p>We agree that the findings of Saiepour 2015 are of great importance and that our results confirm their earlier study. Using optogenetics and Dreadds to inactivate PV+ cells in V1 they have revealed that the activity of these cells is not necessary for the expression of the adult OD shift. It is heart-warming to us that these two studies, using different recording methods, have arrived at the same conclusion in regards to the expression mechanisms involved in adult OD plasticity, which only adds to the striking contrast with SRP expression mechanisms that we describe in our manuscript. We now devote a considerably larger portion of our Discussion section to this important study and its implications.</p></body></sub-article></article>
