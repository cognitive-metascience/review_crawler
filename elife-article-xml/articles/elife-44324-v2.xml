While dynamics can be reshaped by gradually modifying connectivity, less is known about mechanisms operating on faster timescales. A compelling entrypoint to this problem is the observation that exploratory behaviors can rapidly cause selective hippocampal sequences to ‘replay’ during rest. Using a spiking network model, we asked whether simplified replay could arise from three biological components: fixed recurrent connectivity; stochastic ‘gating’ inputs; and rapid gating input scaling via long-term potentiation of intrinsic excitability (LTP-IE). Indeed, these enabled both forward and reverse replay of recent sensorimotor-evoked sequences, despite unchanged recurrent weights. LTP-IE ‘tags’ specific neurons with increased spiking probability under gating input, and ordering is reconstructed from recurrent connectivity. We further show how LTP-IE can implement temporary stimulus-response mappings. This elucidates a novel combination of mechanisms that might play a role in rapid cognitive flexibility.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>sequence</kwd><kwd>neural network</kwd><kwd>excitability</kwd><kwd>neurocentric</kwd><kwd>short-term memory</kwd><kwd>cognitive flexibility</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000893</institution-id><institution>Simons Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Collaboration for the Global Brain</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fairhall</surname><given-names>Adrienne L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007812</institution-id><institution>University of Washington</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Computational Neuroscience Training Grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pang</surname><given-names>Rich</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001906</institution-id><institution>Washington Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>UW Institute for Neuroengineering</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fairhall</surname><given-names>Adrienne L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01NS104925</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fairhall</surname><given-names>Adrienne L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Biologically plausible changes in the excitabilities of single neurons may suffice to selectively modulate sequential network dynamics, without modifying of recurrent connectivity.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>We can rapidly and flexibly adapt how we process incoming information from the environment, a mental faculty known as cognitive flexibility. For example, after being instructed to raise our left hand when one word is heard and our right hand when another is heard, we perform the task with little error. How brain networks quickly induce novel stimulus-response mappings such as this into their underlying neural dynamics, however, remains mysterious. In particular, while extensive prior work has elucidated how stimulus-response mappings might be implemented biologically, the mechanisms for inducing these mappings typically require slow, gradual modifications to network structure, for example by incrementally training connection weights to minimize errors between correct and predicted responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Williams and Zipser, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Sussillo and Abbott, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Laje and Buonomano, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Rajan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Nicola and Clopath, 2017</xref>) or by allowing local plasticity to reshape network dynamics in response to internal activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Song and Abbott, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fiete et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gilson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lee and Buonomano, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Klampfl and Maass, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Rezende et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Diehl and Cook, 2015</xref>). Biologically observed spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) mechanisms, however, typically increase post-synaptic potentials (PSPs) by at most a few percent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Markram et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bi and Poo, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Sjöström et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Wang et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Caporale and Dan, 2008</xref>). Furthermore, due to the precise timing requirements of canonical plasticity mechanisms (e.g. in STDP spike pairs must occur in the correct order within tens of milliseconds) and low firing rates of cortex and hippocampus (typically less than a few tens of Hz [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Griffith and Horn, 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Koulakov et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Mizuseki and Buzsáki, 2013</xref>]), STDP-triggering spike patterns may occur relatively rarely, especially given the asynchronous nature of cortical firing patterns in awake animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Renart et al., 2010</xref>). As a result, computational models for shaping dynamics that modify network structures via synaptic plasticity typically rely on at least dozens of learning trials over extended time periods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Song and Abbott, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Masquelier et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Klampfl and Maass, 2013</xref>), challenging their suitability for rapid reconfiguration of network dynamics. Computationally, modifying connections to change network function might also interfere with long-term memories or computations already stored in the network’s existing connectivity patterns, leading, for instance, to catastrophic forgetting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">McCloskey and Cohen, 1989</xref>). Consequently, it is unclear (1) how biologically observed plasticity mechanisms could reshape network function over the timescales of seconds required for rapid cognitive flexibility, and (2) how such restructuring of synaptic connectivity could occur over the short term without degrading existing long-term memories.</p><p>One feature of neural dynamics potentially reflecting processes of cognitive flexibility is stereotyped sequential firing patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hahnloser et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ikegaya et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Luczak et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Pastalkova et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Davidson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Crowe et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Harvey et al., 2012</xref>). Functionally, firing sequences are thought to be involved in various cognitive processes, from short-term memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Davidson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Crowe et al., 2010</xref>) to decision-making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Harvey et al., 2012</xref>). More generally, one can imagine sequential activity as reflecting information propagating from one subnetwork to another, for example stimulus S evoking a cascade of activity that eventually triggers motor output M. A compelling empirical example of memory-related firing sequences that arise in a neural network almost immediately after a sensorimotor event, apparently without requiring repeated experience or long-term learning, occurs in awake hippocampal ‘replay’. Here, sequences of spikes in hippocampal regions CA1 and CA3 originally evoked by a rodent traversing its environment along a specific trajectory subsequently replay when the rodent pauses to rest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Foster and Wilson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Davidson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Gupta et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Carr et al., 2011</xref>). Such replay events occur at compressed timescales relative to the original trajectory and often in reverse order. Replay has also been observed in primate cortical area V4, where firing sequences evoked by a short movie were immediately reactivated by a cue indicating the movie was about to start again, but without showing the movie (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Eagleman and Dragoi, 2012</xref>). The functional role of replay has been implicated in memory, planning, and learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ego-Stengel and Wilson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Carr et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Eagleman and Dragoi, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Jadhav et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Ólafsdóttir et al., 2018</xref>), but little is known about the mechanisms enabling the underlying sequential activity to be induced in the network dynamics in the first place. Elucidating biological mechanisms for rapidly inducing sequential firing patterns in network dynamics may not only illuminate the processes enabling replay but may also shed light on principles for fast and flexible reconfiguration of computations and information flow in neural networks more generally.</p><p>An intriguing fast-acting cellular mechanism whose role in shaping network dynamics has not been investigated is the rapid, outsize, and activity-dependent modulation of cortical inputs onto pyramidal cells (PCs) in hippocampal region CA3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hyun et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hyun et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Rebola et al., 2017</xref>). Specifically, following a 1–2 s train of 20 action potentials in a given CA3 PC, excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) from medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) more than doubled in magnitude within eight seconds (the first time point in the experiment). Thought to arise through inactivation of K<sup>+</sup>-channels colocalized with MEC projections onto CA3 PC dendrites and deemed ‘long-term potentiation of intrinsic excitability’ (LTP-IE), potentiation occurred regardless of whether the CA3 PC spikes were evoked via current injection or by upstream physiological inputs, indicating its heterosynaptic nature, since only MEC EPSPs, and not others, exhibited potentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hyun et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hyun et al., 2015</xref>). Notably, the 10–20 Hz spike rate required for potentiation matches the range of in vivo spike rates in hippocampal ‘place cells’ when rodents pass through specific locations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Moser et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Mizuseki et al., 2012</xref>), suggesting LTP-IE may occur in natural contexts. Furthermore, EPSP potentiation persisted throughout the multi-minute course of the experiment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hyun et al., 2015</xref>), suggesting that in addition to fast onset, the modulation could extend significantly into the future. Although inducing sequential activation patterns in neural networks is typically associated with <italic>homosynaptic</italic> plasticity (e.g. in STDP a postsynaptic following a presynaptic spike strengthens the activated synapse, thereby incrementally increasing the probability of subsequent presynaptic spikes triggering postsynaptic spikes), the rapidity, strength, and duration of this heterosynaptic potentiation mechanism suggest it might significantly modulate network dynamics in natural conditions, warranting further investigation within the context of neural sequences. Moreover, while this mechanism has so far been observed in hippocampus only, an intriguing possibility is that functionally similar mechanisms exist in cortex also, enabling rapid effective changes in excitability of recently active cells, with potentially similar computational consequences (see Discussion).</p><p>To explore this idea we first develop a computational model for the effect of LTP-IE on EPSPs from upstream inputs as a function of their spiking responses to physiological inputs. Next, we demonstrate how LTP-IE combined with recurrent PC connectivity in a spiking network can yield spike sequences reflecting recent sensorimotor sequences that replay in both forward and reverse and which are gated by an upstream gating signal. We subsequently identify parameter regimes allowing and prohibiting LTP-IE-based sequence propagation and examine the effect of specific parameters on replay frequency and propagation speed. We next show how LTP-IE-based sequences can be used to induce temporary stimulus-response mappings in an otherwise untrained recurrent network. Finally, using a reduced model we give proof-of-concept demonstrations of how LTP-IE might support more general computations. We discuss implications for cognitive flexibility and rapid memory storage that does not require modification of recurrent network weights.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>To investigate its consequences on neuronal spiking dynamics we implemented LTP-IE in a network of leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gerstner, 2014</xref>). Neurons received three types of inputs: sensorimotor inputs S, carrying tuned ‘external’ information; recurrent input R from other cells in the network, comprising excitation and inhibition (developed further, Figure 2); and ‘gating’ inputs G, assumed to be random, with a homogeneous rate across the network but independent to each cell. We provide an overview and intuition of the model before elaborating our results.</p><p>First, we demonstrate our implementation of LTP-IE in spiking neurons. We apply LTP-IE to a neuron, potentiating its G inputs, if the neuron fires within a physiological range (~10–20 Hz in our model) for 1 s in response to input S. Thus, recently active cells get ‘tagged’ by LTP-IE, so that they exhibit augmented EPSPs in response to G inputs. In the presence of inputs G, recently active cells will therefore show larger positive membrane voltage deflections, on average, because their EPSPs from G are larger, and they will sit closer to spiking threshold. Unless otherwise specified, in all simulations that follow we assume the continuous presence of inputs G, as LTP-IE would not affect membrane voltages without them.</p><p>Second, in analogy to hippocampal ‘place cells’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Moser et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Mizuseki et al., 2012</xref>) we consider the case where different excitatory pyramidal cells (PCs) maximally fire (up 20 Hz) when a simulated animal is in different positions in the environment. When the simulated animal moves along a trajectory, LTP-IE thus tags the cells with place fields along the trajectory, storing the trajectory memory as a set of LTP-IE-tagged neurons with specific position tunings; order and timing information, however, are not stored by LTP-IE. When G inputs are turned on post-navigation (representing an awake resting state), cells activated by the original trajectory thus sit closer to spiking threshold than cells not activated by the trajectory.</p><p>Third, inspired by excitatory recurrence in CA3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Lisman, 1999</xref>) we assume recurrent excitatory connections in the network, which allows activity to propagate through the network. We assume that cell pairs with more similar tuning (i.e. with nearby place fields) have stronger connections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Lisman, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Káli and Dayan (2000)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Giusti et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, activity from cell A is more likely to propagate to cell B if (1) cell B has been LTP-IE-tagged after being activated by the trajectory, and (2) cell B has a nearby place field to cell A. Consequently, given the right model parameters, activity that begins at one point in the network (e.g. in cells tuned to the animal’s resting position) should propagate among LTP-IE-tagged cells, in an order reflective of the original trajectory.</p><p>Finally, we include a population of inhibitory cells (INH) one-tenth the size of the excitatory PC population and randomly recurrently connected with them. Inhibition limits the number of active PCs and prevents activity from propagating in more than one direction along the LTP-IE-defined trajectory. We discuss additional model components such as LTP-IE extinction and higher-order structure in G inputs in the Discussion.</p><p>Note that our model accords two meanings of ‘excitability’ to the LTP-IE acronym. As coined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hyun et al. (2013)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hyun et al. (2015)</xref>, LTP-IE’s ‘excitability’ originally refers to the augmented EPSPs of G inputs (MEC inputs, in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hyun et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hyun et al., 2015</xref>) arriving to distal dendrites. Here, however, ‘excitability’ also refers to the increased membrane potential of LTP-IE-tagged cells (in the presence of G inputs), which makes them more likely to spike in response to recurrent inputs.</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>LTP-IE increases membrane voltages and spike rates under random gating inputs</title><p>We first simulate the expected effects of LTP-IE on neuronal membrane voltages and spike rates. To model LTP-IE, when a cell spikes sufficiently fast (~10–20 Hz) over 1 s, we scale that cell’s G inputs by a factor σ(<italic>r</italic>) that depends on the rate <italic>r</italic> at which it fired during that 1 s. For such cells, future G inputs will thus yield augmented EPSPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). Consequently, cells that have recently emitted several spikes in quick succession end up with high LTP-IE levels, which causes them to sit at higher average voltages given a steady random stream of G inputs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–E</xref>); additionally, cells with higher LTP-IE exhibit increased variability in their membrane voltages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,E</xref>). (Note: we chose to model the LTP-IE activation function [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>] as a sigmoid based on the saturation-like relationship between PC spike count and the membrane conductance change measured in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hyun et al. (2015)</xref> [Figure 3H], but evidence also exists for an optimal firing rate between 10 and 20 Hz [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hyun et al., 2013</xref>]; modeling LTP-IE activation with such an optimum should not affect our results, however, as our goal was simply to apply LTP-IE to PCs firing at physiological rates.)</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.44324.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Mechanism and consequences of LTP-IE.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Demonstration using leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neuron model of fast activity-driven LTP-IE, which doubles membrane voltage responses to gate inputs as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hyun et al.

(For overly weak <italic>w<sup>PC,G</sup></italic>, LTP-IE does not facilitate spiking since the membrane voltage remains subthreshold; for overly strong <italic>w<sup>PC,G</sup></italic>, spontaneous spike rates are already high, and increased spiking leads to more frequent voltage resetting [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>] so total spike rate does not substantially increase.) Thus, given moderate <italic>w<sup>PC,G</sup></italic>, when a cell undergoes LTP-IE its chance of spiking in response to future inputs (i.e. its excitability) increases, although variability remains.

Intuitively, since LTP-IE increases spiking probability within recently active neurons, we expect recently active neurons to be preferentially recruited during sequence propagation through the network. Inspired by hippocampal place cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">O'Keefe, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Moser et al., 2008</xref>), we allowed excitatory PCs in our network to be tuned to specific positions (‘place fields’) within the environment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–C</xref>).

How does the neural activity evoked during the trajectory shape the spontaneous activity in the awake, quiescent state? Since our goal was to understand sequential reactivation during this awake, quiescent period, we only used the trajectory geometry to predict the LTP-IE levels one would expect following the trajectory’s termination (i.e. the termination of S inputs). To do so, we computed each neuron’s maximum expected spike rate during the trajectory as a function of the distance from its place field to the nearest point on the trajectory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). We then passed the result through a soft-thresholding LTP-IE activation function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) to compute the final expected LTP-IE level σ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) for each PC. This allowed us to model the expected LTP-IE profile over the network of neurons as a function of the recent trajectory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). As per our design, the LTP-IE profile stores which locations were covered by the original trajectory but bears no explicit information about its speed or direction.</p><p>Can replay-like sequences that recapitulate the original trajectory structure emerge from the LTP-IE profile stored in the network? When we let our network run in the presence of random G inputs independent to each PC, replay-like events lasting on the order of 100–200 ms spontaneously arose in the network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F–I</xref>). Spontaneous replay events propagated in both directions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, left and middle), recapitulating the forward and reverse replay observed experimentally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Foster and Wilson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Davidson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Carr et al., 2011</xref>). Due to the PC refractory period of ~8 ms in our model (see Materials and methods), activity propagated in one direction without reversing. Partial replay also occurred, in which replay began in the middle of the trajectory and propagated in one direction to the end (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, right). When an alternative trajectory was used to induce the LTP-IE profile, triggered replay recapitulated that trajectory instead (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A–E</xref>), indicating that replay of a specific trajectory was not due <italic>a priori</italic> to the recurrent connectivity; indeed, this should be avoided by the spatial uniformity of the recurrence. The virtual trajectory encoded by the replay event could be decoded by computing the median place field of the PCs spiking across short time windows during the event (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1F</xref>). We additionally note that the replay sequence was able to turn corners, suggesting robustness to nonlinear trajectories. Finally, plotting population firing rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>) reveals a potential connection between the replay events in our model and ‘sharp-wave ripples’, rapid oscillatory field potentials experimentally observed to co-occur with hippocampal sequence replay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Carr et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, despite sizable variability in membrane voltages arising from the random gating inputs G (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D,F</xref>), LTP-IE was able to induce spontaneously arising activity sequences into the network that recapitulated recent sensorimotor experiences.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Dependence of LTP-IE-based sequence propagation on network parameters</title><p>What conditions must hold for LTP-IE to induce successful sequences in the network? To address this we explored how the frequency of spontaneous replay events changed as we varied different network parameters.

In particular, while replay confined to LTP-IE-tagged PCs can occur in the absence of inhibitory feedback (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>-right), in this case one observes an increase in spontaneous ‘bidirectional’ events, in which replay activity begins in the middle of the trajectory and propagates outward in both directions (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>-left to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>-right).</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.44324.006</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Parameter dependence of LTP-IE-based sequences.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Spontaneous replay event frequency as a function of recurrent excitation (w<sup>PC,PC</sup>) and inhibitory feedback (w<sup>PC,INH</sup>) strengths.

Inspired by the resemblance of the population firing rates accompanying LTP-IE-induced replay in our network model to experimentally observed sharp-wave ripples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Csicsvari et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Carr et al., 2011</xref>), we computed the power spectral density (PSD) of the population PC firing rates accompanying replay events for networks constructed with two different parameter sets that differed in their level of inhibitory feedback (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>). The resulting PSDs showed salient peaks at tens of Hz, suggesting replay in our network is accompanied by oscillatory SWR-like events. While empirical SWRs in CA3 occur near higher frequencies of 100–130 Hz (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Csicsvari et al., 1999</xref>), the two networks we investigated also exhibited different PSD peaks, with the more strongly inhibited PC population displaying a higher peak frequency. This suggests the SWR oscillation frequencies in our model may be determined by the balance of excitatory and inhibitory feedback strengths and that parameter regimes may exist where SWRs alongside replay occur at biological frequencies.</p><p>Since realistic locomotor trajectories often intersect with one another, we also investigated how our model behaved when the trajectory reflected in the LTP-IE profile contained multiple pathways branching out from a central intersection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>). In this scenario we observed that spontaneous replay events in our model could travel through the intersection, selecting a single path along which to continue propagating (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J</xref>, left and middle). When inhibition was removed from the model, LTP-IE-induced spike sequences propagated along all branches after the intersection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J</xref>, right), suggesting inhibition likely imposes a winner-take-all-like interaction among competing sequences so that only one sequence continues propagating.</p><p>These results show that experience-dependent LTP-IE at biological levels can rapidly and selectively modulate sequence propagation through a network of realistic spiking neurons across a range of parameter regimes.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>LTP-IE-based sequences can encode temporary stimulus-response mappings</title><p>A popular hypothesis in cognitive neuroscience is the multiplexing and interaction of mnemonic and spatial representations, contributing, for example, to the formation of ‘memory maps’.

The potential neural mechanisms underlying this phenomena, however, remain poorly understood. To demonstrate how LTP-IE could shape temporary memory storage and computation more generally, beyond simply replaying recent locomotor trajectories, we considered the simple task of requiring a network to represent one of two possible stimulus-response mappings, and then asked how LTP-IE could induce these mappings in the network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>).

To demonstrate this we first assumed that specific regions in the network corresponded to different stimuli or responses. In other words, we imagined that stimulus regions S1 and S2 might receive inputs containing sensory information from the environment, whereas the response regions M1 and M2 might send outputs controlling different motor commands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). To record activity in S1, S2, M1, or M2 we included a unique readout unit for each region representing the region’s average activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). We then introduced non-intersecting LTP-IE paths into the network connecting each stimulus region to its associated motor output region, and recorded the ability of an input current trigger into each stimulus region to subsequently activate the correct motor output (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C–F</xref>). We first verified our idea with the mapping (S1→M1, S2→M2) in which each stimulus was connected via a one-dimensional LTP-IE profile to its appropriate motor output (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, left). Indeed, triggering each stimulus region with a depolarizing current input led to subsequent activation of its corresponding motor output after a short delay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, middle and right). We next explored the mapping (S1→M2, S2→M1), which in our setup required at least one LTP-IE path to take a roundabout course through the network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, left). As before, triggering each stimulus region led to activation of its corresponding motor output, with the longer LTP-IE path reflected in a longer stimulus-response delay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, middle and right). Notably, the same stimulus-response mapping could be implemented via LTP-IE in several different ways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D–F</xref>), with the different LTP-IE paths reflected in the different stimulus-response delays. This contrasts with alternative models of temporarily binding together distinct components of a neural network, which typically suppose a unique structure of the mapping/binding representation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Raffone and Wolters, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Botvinick and Watanabe, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Swan and Wyble, 2014</xref>). Thus, LTP-IE combined with recurrent connectivity might serve as a biophysically plausible and highly flexible substrate for inducing temporary stimulus-response mappings in a recurrent spiking network. This may be a potential key property enabling rapid and flexible induction of temporary information-processing patterns in brain networks underlying cognitive flexibility.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Encoding complex sequences and non-spatial mappings with LTP-IE</title><p>What are the algorithmic limitations of LTP-IE-based sequence induction? For instance, while we have discussed the storage and reactivation of sequences corresponding to simple (non-intersecting) trajectories through space, it is natural to ask whether more arbitrary sequences and mappings can be stored by LTP-IE. To this end we developed a reduced network model capturing the core property of LTP-IE-based reshaping of network dynamics. This allowed us to separate the generic algorithmic properties of LTP-IE- and excitability-based computation from those tied to its specific biophysical implementation.</p><p>Our reduced network obeys the following rules. First, it operates in discrete time, with upstream inputs to a neuron persisting for one timestep, and in which a neuron spikes if those inputs surpass a spike threshold. When a neuron spikes, this spike is converted to inputs to downstream neurons, weighted by the connectivity strengths to those neurons (only excitatory connections were used in our reduced network model), and the spiking neuron enters a refractory period that prevents it from spiking again for the next several timesteps. To model gating inputs G and LTP-IE in our reduced model, we provided all neurons with a constant background input representing G, with LTP-IE-tagged neurons receiving up to twice this background input, thus situating them closer to spike threshold. To mimic inhibitory effects we imposed a maximum number of simultaneously spiking cells, chosen to be those receiving the largest inputs.</p><p>Using our reduced model we first demonstrate how LTP-IE could support the storage of <italic>complex</italic> trajectories, in which one of the replayed locations is repeated, that is trajectories that intersect themselves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, inset). Importantly, here we desire replay without random branching at the intersection point, as one would expect given <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J</xref>. To overcome this we introduced an additional tuning dimension to our network. Beyond an (x, y) position, we allowed each cell to be Gaussian-tuned to head-direction θ as well, in line with experimentally observed head-direction cells in the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Leutgeb et al., 2000</xref>), and we only tagged PCs with LTP-IE if they both (1) lay along the trajectory and (2) had a preferred θ aligned to the animal’s presumed travel direction during the original locomotor trajectory. Our assumption is that all three tuning conditions would have to be met during the original trajectory in order for these cells to activate at the physiological levels required for LTP-IE. Accordingly, we modified the recurrent connectivity by only preferentially connecting cells if they both encoded nearby regions of space and had a similar preferred θ.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.44324.008</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Complex sequences and non-spatial mappings via LTP-IE in our reduced network model.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) LTP-IE profile for self-intersecting trajectory in a network with cells tuned to both position and head direction.

This trajectory begins eastbound at (−1,. 25) m, loops around through the lower right quadrant of the environment, crosses itself at (−0.25,. 25) m, and ends northbound at (−0.25, 1) m. Importantly, at the intersection point, only east- and north-tuned cells exhibit strong LTP-IE, and since these cells are not strongly connected, activity propagating through the east-tuned cells should not spread to north-tuned cells, and vice versa. Spike sequence propagation through the network triggered by a brief current injection into cells at the beginning or end of the trajectory is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B,C</xref>, respectively. Activity recapitulating the original trajectory propagated in either the forward or reverse direction, depending on the trigger location, and activity passed through the intersection point in the correct order, without random branching. Note that one would expect random branching probability to increase as the intersection became less orthogonal. This demonstrates how LTP-IE combined with multi-dimensional tuning and corresponding recurrent connectivity can support trajectory sequences containing repeated locations, indicating that LTP-IE-based replay need not be confined to simple sequences.</p><p>Finally, we use our reduced model to show how LTP-IE can encode transient stimulus-response mappings without requiring a spatially organized network.

To this end we again considered the problem of rapidly inducing one of two sensorimotor mappings (S1→M1, S2→M2) vs (S1→M2, S2→M1) in a network through LTP-IE. Here we represented S1, S2, M1, and M2 as four separate neural ensembles, with the M ensembles containing strong intra-ensemble recurrent excitation but with no recurrence between ensembles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D,E</xref>). Instead, each sensory ensemble sent random projections to a ‘switchboard’ ensemble of neurons, and the switchboard ensemble sent random connections to the motor ensembles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D,E</xref>). For the purposes of this simulation we did not include recurrence within the S or switchboard ensembles.</p><p>Given this network architecture, we encoded each sensorimotor mapping by applying LTP-IE to different sets of switchboard neurons. For (S1→M1, S2→M2) we applied LTP-IE to all switchboard neurons that either (1) received inputs from S1 <italic>and</italic> sent outputs to M1 or (2) received inputs from S2 <italic>and</italic> sent outputs to M2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Intuitively, activating S1 should activate the first set of LTP-IE-tagged neurons, causing M1 to activate, whereas activating S2 should activate the second set of LTP-IE-tagged neurons, causing M2 to activate. This is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref> (<bold><italic>middle and right</italic></bold>), where activating each stimulus indeed activates a subset of LTP-IE-tagged switchboard neurons, causing the appropriate motor ensemble to subsequently activate. Notably, the alternate mapping (S1→M2, S2→M1), in which LTP-IE is applied to switchboard neurons that either (1) receive inputs from S1 <italic>and</italic> send outputs to M2 or (2) receive inputs from S2 <italic>and</italic> send outputs to M1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>), yields an LTP-IE profile distinct from the one encoding (S1→M1, S2→M2); instead, this LTP-IE profile allows signal propagation from S1 to M2 and from S2 to M1. We note that the fundamental idea of opening selective communication channels between pairs of ensembles by changing the spiking properties of an intermediary set of switchboard neurons has been explored in substantial detail in the quite similar ‘binding pool’ model of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Swan and Wyble (2014)</xref>. Here we show how the idea also fits naturally into the theory of excitability-based computation. We do not explore how the specific LTP-IE profiles above could be induced in the first place, assuming instead that they could arise via upstream transformations of sensorimotor information. Thus, even in a randomly connected network with no spatial structure, LTP-IE can yield selective stimulus-response mappings, demonstrating the potential of excitability changes as a substrate for cognitive flexibility more generally.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Sequential spiking activity is a key feature of recurrent neural network dynamics, potentially reflecting information flow and computations within the network. One noteworthy empirical example of internally generated sequences is the replay of spike sequences representing an animal’s recent sensorimotor sequence, such as a locomotor trajectory or sequence of viewed images. Sequence replay has been observed in vivo in both hippocampus and cortex during awake quiescent periods in both rodents and primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Foster and Wilson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Davidson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Karlsson and Frank, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Gupta et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Carr et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Eagleman and Dragoi, 2012</xref>) and is thought to be involved in memory consolidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Carr et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Jadhav et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Ólafsdóttir et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Zielinski et al., 2017</xref>) and navigational planning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Foster and Knierim, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Pfeiffer and Foster, 2013</xref>). Since replay appears to be strongly modulated by recent experience, it serves as a compelling entrypoint for uncovering the biophysical mechanisms that support rapid and flexible modulation of sequential dynamics and information processing in neural networks.</p><p>While substantial work has shown how gradual modifications to a network’s recurrent connections can induce sequences into its dynamics repertoire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Sussillo and Abbott, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Klampfl and Maass, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Laje and Buonomano, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Rajan et al., 2016</xref>), less is known about mechanisms that could act on faster timescales. Here we have demonstrated the sufficiency of an empirical, strong, and fast-acting heterosynaptic plasticity mechanism known as long-term potentiation of intrinsic excitability (LTP-IE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hyun et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hyun et al., 2015</xref>), applied to a spiking network, to coerce the network into generating selective sequences. Briefly, LTP-IE biases recently active cells towards recruitment during replay, with their reactivation order determined by pre-existing but fixed recurrent connectivity. In particular, in our spatially organized spiking network LTP-IE acted to select pathways through the network that guided activity propagation during replay. Similar to ‘synfire chains’, feedforward neural networks supporting stable activity propagation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abeles, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Abeles et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Herrmann et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Schrader et al., 2008</xref>), the potentiated pathways in our network supported stable and self-sustaining spike sequences, which despite symmetric connectivity propagated without reversing direction due to the moderate refractory period we included (8 ms). One can therefore conceptualize our spatial network as akin to a reservoir of trajectories through space that can be selected for replay in an experience-dependent manner through LTP-IE.</p><p>Our spiking network model exhibited several interesting features. First, despite substantial variability in the membrane voltages of LTP-IE-tagged cells and overlap with non-LTP-IE-tagged cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), replay events exhibited stable propagation along LTP-IE-defined network paths, due to averaging effects of populations of LTP-IE-tagged cells. Second, sequences replayed at timescales determined by the network rather than the original trajectory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>), and did so in both forward and reverse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F,G</xref>), capturing these two key empirical features of hippocampal replay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Foster and Wilson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Davidson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Karlsson and Frank, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Gupta et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Carr et al., 2011</xref>). Additionally, inhibition played an important role in our model, promoting replay in one direction only (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>) and inducing competition among multiple sequences in branched trajectories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D,I,J</xref>), even though inhibition bore no spatial organization itself. Inhibition also appeared to shape the power spectra of the sharp-wave-ripple (SWR) events in our model arising in the PC population average alongside replayed sequences; moreover, these events were consistent with the observation that hippocampal SWRs likely arise spontaneously in CA3 and propagate to CA1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Buzsáki, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Csicsvari et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Carr et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Ramirez-Villegas et al., 2018</xref>), since our model’s excitatory recurrence was inspired by that found in CA3 but not CA1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Lisman, 1999</xref>).</p><p>Finally, while our biophysical model used a 2-D spatial network and hippocampal LTP-IE mechanism, excitability changes might support more general modulation in dynamics and computation in networks with fixed recurrence. To explore this we used a reduced network and LTP-IE model attempting to capture the core algorithmic features of excitability-modulated dynamics independently from a specific biophysical implementation. For instance, LTP-IE might also occur purely intrinsically, without an explicit correlation with EPSP sizes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Ohtsuki and Hansel, 2018</xref>). Using the reduced model we showed how trajectories that intersect themselves in 2-D could be successfully replayed given an additional tuning dimension like head direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–C</xref>), and further how LTP-IE could store and recall sensorimotor mappings in a randomly connected network with no spatial structure at all (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D–E</xref>), similar to the ‘binding pool’ model of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Swan and Wyble (2014)</xref>. This latter example may be relevant to excitability-based computations in cortex, where LTP-IE-like phenomena have been observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Sourdet et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Paz, 2009</xref>), but whose internal network structures do not necessarily exhibit clear spatial organization. We note, however, that preferential connectivity among similarly tuned cells has been observed in mouse visual cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ko et al., 2011</xref>), suggesting a mechanism similar to the one we have explored might support spontaneous sequence propagation among neurons encoding visual space. Such spontaneous sequences might in turn modulate neural responses to incoming visual stimuli, potentially supporting expectation-modulated sensory processing.</p><p>History-dependent excitability changes might also occur not just at the rapid timescales that have motivated our work but over slower timescales as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Zhang and Linden, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Titley et al., 2017</xref>). For example, it was recently found that small neuronal ensembles could be ‘imprinted’ into a mouse cortical network and subsequently reactivated in vivo via repeated optogenetic stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Carrillo-Reid et al., 2016</xref>). While this result was suggested to provide evidence of Hebbian (homosynaptic) plasticity, our work suggests that the same result could arise via increasing neural excitabilities instead. Untangling these mechanisms and understanding how they interact presents an exciting avenue for further investigation. Overall, our work demonstrates how excitability changes alone might quickly and selectively reshape network dynamics, implicating their potential role in storing memories and encoding stimulus-response mappings, and more generally in organizing flexible computations over rapid timescales.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Comparison to existing models</title><p>While we do not aim to provide a complete account of hippocampal replay, but rather to demonstrate how specific biophysical mechanisms can rapidly generate selective network sequences, we believe it is still worthwhile to compare our model to existing models for rapidly storing and recalling sequences in neural systems, both in terms of biological plausibility and computational robustness. One family of models for encoding and decoding sequences in hippocampus supposes that sequential information is stored in the timing of spikes relative to theta (4–8 Hz) and gamma (~40 Hz) oscillatory cycles in the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Lisman and Idiart, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Lisman, 1999</xref>). Briefly, gamma cycles are ‘nested’ within theta cycles, and a sequence of stimuli is stored by stimulus-specific neurons spiking at unique gamma cycles within the encompassing theta cycle. While these models provide a persuasive computational account of how oscillations might be used to store temporary information, it is not clear how the sensory input would be appropriately transformed so as to be ‘entered’ into the oscillation cycle at the correct time, how stable these mechanisms are in the face of noise, nor how multiple sequences might be stored simultaneously; in particular, sequence information could be lost if the oscillation were disrupted, and one would require an independent nested oscillation for a second sequence. In our LTP-IE-based spiking-network model, however, memories are directly entered into the network by physiological spiking patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), are stored in effective synaptic weight changes likely driven by ion channel inactivation (as opposed to persistent spiking activity) and might therefore be more robust to noise, and multiple sequences can theoretically be stored in the same network in a manner similar to how we have stored multiple stimulus-response mappings in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>.</p><p>The second main family of replay models either explicitly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Molter et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Veliz-Cuba et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Haga and Fukai, 2018</xref>) or implicitly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chenkov et al., 2017</xref>) assumes the sequences produced by the network are initially induced in the network via modification of recurrent network weights, for example through homosynaptic mechanisms like spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Markram et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bi and Poo, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fiete et al., 2010</xref>). While such models can indeed selectively bias network sequences, given the hypothesized weak magnitude of STDP, it is unclear whether such a mechanism could account for the awake trajectory replay observed in rodents, which can sometimes occur even when the animal has experienced the original trajectory only once (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Foster and Wilson, 2006</xref>), nor whether it could be used to immediately induce novel computations that the animal cannot afford to learn over extensive repetitions. In our model we rely on a strong, fast-acting mechanism, LTP-IE, which although heterosynaptic (unlike STDP, LTP-IE follows spiking regardless of which input elicited the spikes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hyun et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hyun et al., 2015</xref>) suffices in biasing a network toward producing highly specific sequences: LTP-IE ‘tags’ cells in the recurrent network with a higher probability of spiking in response to input (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), and sequential ordering is reconstructed by the existing but unmodified recurrent connectivity. While recent research has begun to investigate how small, biophysically plausible recurrent weight changes might encode new memories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Curto et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Yger et al., 2015</xref>), to our knowledge this has not been applied in the context of sequences. We would also like to note that experience-dependent short-term plasticity mechanisms, like lingering presynaptic calcium following spiking, can transiently make a neural ensemble more sensitive to subsequent inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Mongillo et al., 2008</xref>), suggesting such a mechanism might be able to play a similar role to excitability changes.</p><p>In real brain networks, excitability changes likely interact with recurrent synaptic mechanisms like STDP or synaptic long-term potentiation (LTP) to shape computation. For instance, it has been observed that changes in how dendrites integrate EPSPs to trigger spiking (effectively an excitability change since this would affect spiking even if EPSPs remained stable) can co-occur with canonical STDP or LTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Daoudal et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Daoudal and Debanne, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Campanac and Debanne, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Debanne and Poo, 2010</xref>). Excitability vs synaptic changes may also coordinate the transference of memories across timescales. For example, as observed in vivo and as predicted by our model, hippocampal sequences that replay during awake quiescence are significantly compressed relative to behavioral timescales, suggesting replayed spikes may occur within the appropriate time windows for slower-acting STDP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Markram et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bi and Poo, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dan and Poo, 2004</xref>). Indeed, it was shown that replaying place-tuned firing sequences in vitro that were previously recorded in vivo could induce long-term connectivity changes between cells with overlapping place fields (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Isaac et al., 2009</xref>, <italic>J. Neurosci.</italic>). Thus, LTP-IE may serve as a temporary buffer for sequences that could become embedded in the network as long-term memories through gradual synaptic changes triggered by repeated replay. Additionally, LTP-IE-based replay in our model occurred over a wide range of parameters. While our networks were spatially homogeneous for all parameter sets (i.e. connectivity depended only on <italic>differences</italic> between place fields), this suggests potential robustness to connectivity heterogeneities within a single network, for example encoding preferred paths through an environment learned over longer timescales. Intuitively, paths defined by pre-existing stronger connections should bias replay in their favor but might also be overwritten by transient excitability changes encoding paths just traveled. Overall, short-term memory and computational flexibility and their subsequent effect on memory consolidation and long-term network structure likely rely on a host of dynamics and plasticity mechanisms, but we propose LTP-IE may play a significant role.</p><p>Finally, selectively biasing cell recruitment without changing recurrence generalizes beyond increasing spike responses through LTP-IE. An alternative mechanism is to simply send stronger baseline inputs to a subset of neurons, corresponding in our model to increasing the gate input rate <italic>r<sup>G</sup></italic> for certain cells but not others, yet without applying LTP-IE. Such differential baseline inputs can act as context signals, and if interacting multiplicatively with sensory signals can control the gain of the latter without affecting their tuning; by modulating the gain of different neurons in such a way, one can then selectively and transiently encode context-dependent sensorimotor mappings without modifying synaptic weights (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Salinas, 2004b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Salinas, 2004a</xref>), similar to how one might do so with LTP-IE. Given the functional similarity of selective LTP-IE or differential gain-modulating inputs, one would expect them to support similarly flexible sequential dynamics and signal routing, depending on the pre-existing but fixed recurrence structure. Indeed, neurons in entorhinal cortex, which inspired the gating signals G in our network, have been shown to support history-dependent, graded persistent activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Egorov et al., 2002</xref>), suggesting the recurrent CA3 network could be subject to differential baseline inputs maintained over short-term memory timescales. Such a mechanism could act in concert with LTP-IE and could potentially act as an additional rapid and controllable gating signal governing effective excitabilities of neurons in the recurrent network.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Model limitations</title><p>One question we did not explicitly address is whether and how a decay timescale of LTP-IE would affect sequence storage and replay. Indeed, with no forgetting or selective LTP-IE activation, one would expect all neurons in our model to undergo LTP-IE after the animal had fully explored the environment, thus preventing sequential reactivation along specific trajectories through the network. While this problem would be partially solved by considering additional input dimensions as described above (i.e. so that even if the x-y space were fully explored, only a fraction of the x-y-θ space would have been explored), one might also imagine additional neuromodulatory inputs serving to control the strength of LTP-IE during exploration. Indeed, while (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hyun et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hyun et al., 2015</xref>) did not observe a return of activation-triggered LTP-IE to baseline during the course of their slice experiments, in vivo LTP-IE in CA3 might be modulated by additional upstream inputs. For example, the neurotransmitter acetylcholine is known to interact with the voltage-gated potassium channel Kv1.2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hattan et al., 2002</xref>), the ion channel hypothesized to underlie LTP-IE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hyun et al., 2015</xref>), and hippocampus receives state-dependent cholinergic inputs from medial septum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Yoder and Pang, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Mamad et al., 2015</xref>). Furthermore, memory-related excitability changes in dentate gyrus have been shown to decay after two hours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Pignatelli et al., 2019</xref>), suggesting similar decay mechanisms may exist in CA3. Thus, sufficient machinery for erasing or selectively modulating the overall effects of LTP-IE, for example as a function of arousal or motivation state, may converge in the brain region that has served as the inspiration for our model. Clinically, one would also expect regulation of the spatiotemporal extent of excitability changes to be crucial in preventing pathological dynamics, such as incomplete signal transmission that might lead to short-term memory deficits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Vallar and Shallice, 2007</xref>), or hyperexcitability without sufficient compensatory inhibition leading to seizure-like events, as exhibited in the ‘blowup’ regime of our spiking network model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).</p><p>Additionally, while we have assumed the upstream ‘gating’ inputs in our model are stochastic with homogeneous firing rates, cortical activity likely contains higher order structure beyond mean firing rates, such as the grid-like representations of space observed in neural firing patterns in entorhinal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">O'Keefe and Burgess, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Yamamoto and Tonegawa, 2017</xref>), the hippocampal input that inspired our gating inputs G. Our model demonstrates that replay can occur absent additional mnemonic information, but one would imagine such additional information would only increase the capacity and robustness for memory storage and computational flexibility, since this would act as an additional memory buffer. Furthermore, as mentioned above, entorhinal neurons may have the capacity for history-dependent persistent activity persisting over the same timescales as LTP-IE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Egorov et al., 2002</xref>), potentially supporting even more flexible heterogeneous gating inputs to the recurrent network. Investigating how such mechanisms would compete or synergize with LTP-IE could be a fruitful line of future inquiry.</p><p>What factors missing from our model might set the duration of replay events in more realistic situations? In our model, replay durations were determined by the length of the trajectory through the environment (4 m total in our simulations) and the replay speed was determined by the network parameters. Indeed, while empirical replay events and their accompanying sharp-wave ripples have typically been observed to occur over approximately 100 ms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Carr et al., 2011</xref>), when animals are allowed to explore larger environments replay can last several hundred milliseconds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Davidson et al., 2009</xref>), suggesting replay durations might be largely determined by the size of the environment, as in our model. Parallel lines of evidence, however, suggest hippocampal sequence replay may be gated by particular phases of slow, theta oscillations (4–8 Hz), which would constrain replay to occur within approximately 100–200 ms time windows (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Lisman and Idiart, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Fuentemilla et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Lisman, 2010</xref>). While we excluded additional oscillatory components from our model for the sake of parsimony, one can imagine imposing time-dependent gating input rates <italic>r<sup>G</sup></italic>(<italic>t</italic>) that, while spatially homogeneous, would oscillate at theta-like frequencies. One would expect such gating oscillations to constrain replay events to explicit phases of the theta cycle, thus preventing sequences of arbitrary duration from replaying.</p><p>Finally, an intriguing line of research suggests spatiotemporal propagation of activity in certain neural networks may follow a power-law distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beggs and Plenz, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beggs and Plenz, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Plenz and Thiagarajan, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fiete et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Scarpetta and de Candia, 2013</xref>). Activity patterns distributed as such would imply scale invariance (scale-freeness) of activity structures and suggest the network state sits at a phase transition between dynamical regimes that may be optimal for processing inputs that vary over a large range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Shew et al., 2009</xref>). Since activity levels and durations in our network were capped by inhibition and refractoriness, and by the limited environment size, we would not expect our network to exhibit scale-free activity patterns; however, exploring what network mechanisms and connectivity statistics could yield power-law distributed sequences through LTP-IE and examining how these might be involved in sequence-based stimulus processing would be an exciting line of future inquiry.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Experimental predictions</title><p>Despite its parsimony, our model of LTP-IE-based network sequences makes specific predictions that could be tested in hippocampal replay experiments. First, pharmacological blocking of LTP-IE during exploration should prevent the encoding of new trajectory information into CA3, consequently preventing subsequent replay. This could be achieved by in vivo application of nimodipine or PP2, which block intracellular calcium increase, protein tyrosine kinase activation, and Kv1.2 channel endocytosis, all potential mechanisms of LTP-IE, and which have been shown to block LTP-IE in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hyun et al., 2015</xref>). Second, inactivating medial entorhinal layer II (MEC II), which projects to CA3 and which we associate with gating inputs G in our analogy with hippocampal circuitry, should inhibit CA3 sequential replay events. Indeed, inactivation of MEC III inputs has been shown to inhibit forms of replay in CA1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Yamamoto and Tonegawa, 2017</xref>); we propose that a parallel effect would be seen in MEC II inputs to CA3. Finally, the core prediction of our sequence induction model is that the neurons do not have to be initially activated in the order (or the reverse order) in which they will later reactivate. As the only information explicitly added to the network at the time of encoding is the <italic>set</italic> of neurons activated, speed or ordering information must be reconstructed from existing connectivity. While identifying the position tunings of individual neurons in vivo and subsequently artificially activating them out of order currently presents a substantial technical challenge, one could potentially achieve a similar effect using a virtual reality environment with place-specific sensory cues, and in which specific places along a virtual trajectory were presented out of order. Our model predicts that as long as the animal had sufficient knowledge of which sensory cues corresponded to which environment locations, replay would occur in an order corresponding to a path through the environment, rather than the order in which the virtual places were presented.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Computational significance</title><p>Besides revealing a potential core mechanism for sequence induction, our model lends two key insights into the structure and control of replay in biological neural networks. First, it suggests a link between isotropy in pre-existing spatial representations in the network (i.e. the spatially organized connectivity) and the experimental observation that replay sometimes occurs in the forward, and sometimes in the reverse order relative to the neurons’ initial activation during the trajectory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Foster and Wilson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Davidson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Carr et al., 2011</xref>). In particular, since no directionality information is stored by LTP-IE (which only tags which neurons were recently active), replay should occur with equal chance in forward or reverse. (Note however, that as observed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Davidson et al., 2009</xref>, replay events may have an increased probability of originating at cells tuned to the animal’s current location, as a result of place-tuned inputs to the network during awake quiescence.) One would therefore not expect to observe reverse replay for neural sequences that do not have a natural spatial embedding, for example spoken sentences in humans. Second, the upstream gating signal in our model might serve as a substrate for the short-term state-dependence of replay, for example with arousal or motivation controlling when the gating signal is present or absent. This could ensure that replay occurs only at appropriate times (e.g. quiescent rest) without interfering with other computations being performed by the network, such as pattern separation in external sensory inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Leutgeb et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bakker et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Further, while our spiking network was embedded in 2-D space, our results frame the more general question of how a network embedded on a higher dimensional manifold, or with no natural embedding, supports excitability-based sequence induction and information flow. For example, one could imagine the rapid induction of spike sequences corresponding to movement along 3-D trajectories if the recurrent architecture reflected a 3-D space, as might occur within the 3-D hippocampal place-cell network of bats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Yartsev and Ulanovsky, 2013</xref>). More generally it remains an open and intriguing question as to which network structures are most suited to rapid excitability-based flexibility among sequences and behaviorally relevant computations. One example of a network model with no obvious spatial embedding, and which could potentially be recast in the framework of excitability-based information flow, is the ‘binding pool’ model of associative short-term memory proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Swan and Wyble (2014)</xref>. Here, associations are encoded in a set of steady, persistently active ‘binding’ units that allow preferential signal transmission among specific sets of units representing object features, to which the binding units are randomly connected. While the role of such persistent spiking in coding mnemonic information is presently undergoing substantial reevaluation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Sreenivasan et al., 2014</xref>), one could theoretically replace it with excitability increases, with an equivalent consequence for information transmission. We explored this possibility in the context of LTP-IE using a reduced model of LTP-IE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D,E</xref>), in which we were able to encode stimulus-response mappings in a random network by applying LTP-IE to a specific set of ‘switchboard’ neurons (analogous to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Swan and Wyble, 2014</xref>). Notably, since connectivity here required no training, this architecture may be well suited to transiently storing novel mappings through LTP-IE that the network has never seen before, so long as the neural ensembles encoding the relevant stimuli and responses were sufficiently (but randomly) connected to the switchboard/binding pool. The nuances of how such a network might implemented in biological spiking networks remains an open question, but our present work suggests its theoretical plausibility.</p><p>Finally, one can draw an equivalence between the modulation of cellular properties to shape sequences and information flow and selective variation in upstream modulatory inputs to a cell. For example, a neuron receiving strong inhibition might be less likely to participate in a computation than one receiving excitation, since the latter would be more likely to spike in response to inputs, similar to if one had increased its excitability through intrinsic cellular mechanisms. Indeed, it was recently shown that external modulatory inputs to a recurrent network could control the speed at which a computation performed by the network unfolded through time, closely recapitulating experimental results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Remington et al., 2018</xref>) More flexible control of neural information transmission via modulatory inputs has also been explored in the framework of gain-modulating context inputs that can effectively move a network into different stimulus-response mappings, also without changing synaptic connectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Salinas, 2004b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Salinas, 2004a</xref>). We propose that the control of information flow and computation in recurrent networks via effective excitability alone, without structural connectivity changes, might be a rich framework for investigating rapid cognitive flexibility and short-term information storage. This may lead to significant insights into how we adapt our mental processes and behaviors in the face of ever-changing environments and task demands.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Membrane and synaptic dynamics for spiking network simulation</title><p>We modeled single neurons as leaky integrate-and-fire neurons with conductance-based synapses according to the equation<disp-formula id="equ1"><mml:math id="m1"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>τ</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>m</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:msup><mml:mi>V</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mi>V</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>E</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>L</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>g</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>E</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mi>V</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>E</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>E</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>g</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>I</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mi>V</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>E</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>I</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></disp-formula>where <italic>V<sup>i</sup></italic> is the membrane voltage of neuron <italic>i; τ<sub>m</sub></italic> is the membrane time constant (50 ms for pyramidal cells [PCs], 5 ms for inhibitory cells [INHs]); <italic>E<sub>leak</sub></italic> is the leak/resting potential (−68 mV for PCs, −60 mV for INHs); <italic>g<sup>i</sup><sub>E</sub></italic> and <italic>g<sup>i</sup><sub>I</sub></italic> are the time-varying conductances of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs, respectively; <italic>E<sub>E</sub></italic> = 0 mV and <italic>E<sub>I</sub></italic> = −80 mV are the excitatory and inhibitory synaptic reversal potentials, respectively; and <italic>I<sup>i</sup><sub>ext</sub></italic> is any externally injected current to cell <italic>i</italic> (in units of the expected deflection in membrane voltage).

and accompanying author responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Fast and flexible sequence induction in spiking neural networks via rapid excitability changes&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Emilio Salinas as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Eve Marder as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript investigates, via computer simulations, the functional consequences of a physiological phenomenon known as long-term potentiation of intrinsic excitability (LTP-IE), whereby neurons that fire intensely (due to input S) for a short period of time then respond more strongly to subsequent input (from a different source G). This mechanism is important for several reasons: 1) reports of LTP-IE show a two-fold magnitude increase in EPSPs, substantially higher than what is reported for STDP, and 2) as the authors demonstrate, it can quickly generate highly effective, transient communication channels that may mediate cognitive flexibility. The computer simulations show that this mechanism can explain the replay of place cell responses observed in the hippocampus; specifically, the fact that such activation sequences can replay in forward or reverse order, and over a compressed time scale. More generally, this mechanism is also shown to allow the reactivation of arbitrary response sequences for cells embedded within a recurrent network.</p><p>The introduction of intrinsic plasticity concepts to the analysis of population sequences is highly innovative and quite interesting. Although the model has limitations, it represents a feasible and simple mechanism that could underlie hippocampal replay events, and it has other, more general implications. The manuscript is interesting, even provocative, and will certainly enrich the field.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The paper requires some updates with regard to the discussion of previous findings by other labs, and some clarification to maximize its impact.</p><p>1) Is LTP-IE-time-restricted in the model, or is it assumed to be long-lasting? This is an important question for two reasons. First, because of intersecting trajectories, which could substantially limit the proposed model. The model proficiently generates simple trajectories, such as ABCDE…, but in naturalistic environments (such as open field) there is replay of complex sequences, such as ABCDAEFG. Second, a similar issue arises when the trajectory inducing LTP-IE is very long, as this model would facilitate replays of any length.</p><p>The authors should consider some evidence showing that LTP-IE might be time-limited, see e.g. Pignatelli et al., 2019, which would reduce the impact of both of these concerns.</p><p>2) Explaining the replay of complex sequences, as mentioned above, would be a major contribution to the field, but it is not clear whether the model can generate those or not. There are many proposed models of reactivation of simple sequences, but none (as far as I know) for reactivation of complex/realistic sequences. While the authors are commended for proposing a new biophysical mechanism for explaining replay, this a moderate contribution to the field. What would be really exciting would be a model such as the one they propose that goes beyond the kind of simple sequences typically found in hippocampus studies with rodents running on linear tracks.</p><p>3) Discussion, last paragraph and elsewhere: the authors clearly state that their model works in the absence of synaptic modification, in fact this is one of the major points. This idea (that intrinsic plasticity can act based on existing, but not changing synaptic connectivity) has been presented by other groups before and this prior work should be cited and discussed in appropriate detail.</p><p>For instance, previous modeling work (Salinas, 2004; Salinas, 2004) showed that changes in excitability very similar to those proposed here, in which one input modulates the response to another, are ideal for switching a network from one functional configuration (say, sensory-motor map 1) to another (say, sensory-motor map 2). Although the changes in excitability in that earlier work went by a different name, &quot;gain modulation&quot;, the underlying mathematics would still apply, so discussing those earlier findings would bolster the argument that LTP-IE could indeed be computationally effective for the sorts of remapping proposed in this manuscript.</p><p>The work also needs to be discussed in the context of Moshe Abeles' neuronal avalanche concept (despite its stronger focus on the neocortex).</p><p>In the context of LTP-IE, it might be interesting to discuss a recent finding that spike firing can be independent of dendritic EPSP amplitudes, and is instead intrinsically controlled, see Ohtsuki and Hansel, 2018.</p><p>4) The authors state that 'this mechanism….is observed in hippocampus only'. If this statement refers to LTP-IE, it is not correct, see e.g. Daoudal, Hanada and Debanne, 2002. Debanne's work should also be cited with regard to STDP. If the statement does not refer to LTP-IE, this needs to be stated more precisely.</p><p>5) Given the co-occurrence of replay and sharp-wave ripples, the lack of inhibition in the current model may be a substantial limitation. Replay was triggered using depolarizing current, however the physiological relevance of the model would be bolstered if replay could be triggered by a sharp-wave ripple event in an inhibitory population. More broadly, how does the model behave if one were to add inhibition in addition to excitation?</p><p>6) Related to the above point, it was difficult to evaluate the robustness of the model. There are many parameters, but which ones are more critical for the results, and what is the 'operating range' of the model? Is the model robust to small perturbations in parameters?</p><p>7) Regarding Figure 4, it is unclear where in the brain a recurrent sensorimotor network with LTP-IE might exist to support the generation of transient associations using the proposed mechanism. What do the authors suggest is the biophysical substrate for non-spatial transient associations?</p><p>8) Some parts of the manuscript were found to be somewhat technical and difficult to follow. Specifically, throughout the Results: second paragraph; subsection “LTPIE increases membrane voltages and spike rates under random gating inputs”, first and last paragraphs; subsection “Spike sequences propagate along LTP-IE-defined paths through a network”, second paragraph; subsection “Dependence of LTP-IE-based sequence propagation on network parameters”, first paragraph and subsection “LTP-IE-based sequences can encode temporary stimulus response mappings”, last paragraph. The Results should be more accessible to a broader readership not specialized in computational neuroscience.</p><p>For instance, it is not easy to understand how the results in Figure 2 relate to, and emerge from, those in Figure 1. In general, it would be useful if the authors could better explain the relationship between their neuronal mechanism and the results.</p><p>In addition, while the model works well for encoding spatial trajectories in which the closeness of individual locations is pre-encoded in the recurrent connectivity weights, it is difficult to see how this would extend to the given example of cognitive flexibility (i.e., raising our right hand when a particular word is heard, and the left hand when a different word is heard), particularly if no a priori spatial relationship exists. Are spatial relationships necessary? There is no evidence provided to suggest that the neocortical network has the necessary architecture to support LTP-IE based replay.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.44324.012</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The paper requires some updates with regard to the discussion of previous findings by other labs, and some clarification to maximize its impact.</p><p>1) Is LTP-IE-time-restricted in the model, or is it assumed to be long-lasting?

First, unchecked excitability increases across a whole network could lead to pathological dynamics like seizure-like events unless inhibition was also correspondingly strengthened. Second, if all neurons underwent LTP-IE, e.g. through a long trajectory that covered all neurons’ place fields in the network, then the memory of the trajectory would be lost since all cells would be potentiated.</p><p>Since our simulations lasted tens of seconds at most, presumably less than a potential LTP-IE decay timescale, we did not explicitly model LTP-IE decay in our revised simulations. However, we have addressed potential mechanisms and consequences of such decay in the first paragraph of the “Model limitations<bold>”</bold> section of our Discussion, and we have referenced the work of Pignatelli et al., who found that excitability changes in the dentate gyrus decayed over about two hours.</p><p>Regarding the replay of complex sequences, we did not attempt to model this in our spiking network due to the complexity involved in identifying a valid parameter regime. However, we have addressed the problem of complex sequence replay in Figure 5A-C using a reduced network and LTP-IE model that captures the core algorithmic properties of LTP-IE.

Such an interaction of modulatory and input signals as described in Salinas’ 2004 papers is indeed quite conceptually and mathematically similar to the modulation of cell excitability via LTP-IE. In fact, the effective gating of input channels as described by Salinas might have additional interesting computational consequences, as it could potentially be modified even more rapidly and controllably than LTP-IE, if these signals arose from the dynamics of an upstream network. We have discussed our work in relation to Salinas’ in the fourth paragraph of our Discussion section “Comparison to existing models” and in the final paragraph of our Discussion section “Computational significance”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The work also needs to be discussed in the context of Moshe Abeles' neuronal avalanche concept (despite its stronger focus on the neocortex).</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing out this connection. We have discussed a connection to Abeles’ work on synfire chains in the second paragraph of our Discussion section.

We discuss LTP-IE outside of hippocampus in the fourth paragraph of our revised Discussion. Additionally, we have added several sentences discussing the potential interactions between LTP-IE and STDP, including the finding by Debanne’s group that the two may co-occur in physiological preparations, in the third paragraph of our Discussion section “Model limitations<bold>”</bold>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Given the co-occurrence of replay and sharp-wave ripples, the lack of inhibition in the current model may be a substantial limitation. Replay was triggered using depolarizing current, however the physiological relevance of the model would be bolstered if replay could be triggered by a sharp-wave ripple event in an inhibitory population. More broadly, how does the model behave if one were to add inhibition in addition to excitation?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the lack of inhibition in our model was a substantial limitation and thank the reviewers for encouraging us to explore it in more depth. To this end, we have rerun all of our spiking network simulations with an inhibitory pool of neurons now included and reciprocally connected to the excitatory pool. This is reflected in the network diagram of Figure 2A and the raster and population plots in Figure 3H,I.</p><p>Adding inhibition turned out to have the beneficial effects of promoting unidirectional sequence propagation (Figure 2F, 3D) in the network and relatedly introducing a winner-take-all-like interaction between competing sequences (Figure 3J), as well as making the network more robust to parameter changes. For instance, whereas in our original excitation-only model there was only a narrow “ridge” of excitatory recurrent weights and length scales that supported activity that did not either fade out or blowup, in our model that included inhibition, the regime in which stable replay was observed without blowing up was quite large (Figure 3B). In addition, including inhibition in the network indeed yielded a sharp-wave-ripple-like oscillatory component to the spontaneously generated replay events, depicted in a power spectrum analysis of the excitatory population activity (Figure 3H). We note, however, that in our model the spontaneous replay/sharp-wave-ripple events arise initially in the excitatory network, which triggers the back-and-forth oscillatory interaction with the inhibitory network. This appears to be consistent with some research that finds SWR origination to occur in CA3 and to subsequently propagate elsewhere [Buzsaki 1986; Csicsvari 2000; Carr 2011; Ramirez-Villegas 2018].</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Related to the above point, it was difficult to evaluate the robustness of the model. There are many parameters, but which ones are more critical for the results, and what is the 'operating range' of the model? Is the model robust to small perturbations in parameters?</p></disp-quote><p>While a full parameter search was prohibitively computationally expensive, we have explored the dependence of replay occurrence on a handful of pairs of parameters we believed to be crucial to the network dynamics, including the strength of excitation and inhibition, as well as the gating input rate and maximum LTP-IE level. These are shown in Figure 3A-C. The observed robustness of our E-I spiking network to variation in excitatory connection strength also suggests that the network may be able to contain heterogeneous network structures encoding long-term memories while still supporting short-term LTP-IE-dependent sequence replay; we have discussed this notion in the third paragraph of our Discussion section “Comparison to existing models”. We have also explored the parameter dependence of “virtual replay speed” in Figure 3F-G.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Regarding Figure 4, it is unclear where in the brain a recurrent sensorimotor network with LTP-IE might exist to support the generation of transient associations using the proposed mechanism. What do the authors suggest is the biophysical substrate for non-spatial transient associations?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing out this aspect of our original results. While we had briefly discussed LTP-IE in non-spatial context in our original Discussion, we agree that a more thorough investigation of this idea was worthwhile to pursue. To this end we have used our reduced model not only to investigate complex/intersecting trajectories but also to demonstrate the algorithmic potential of LTP-IE to encode stimulus-response relationships without a spatially organized network. Specifically, we have simulated a network similar to Swan and Wyble’s “binding pool” network [Swan, 2014], except using slightly different neural dynamics as well as multi-neuron ensembles to represent the “items” to be bound together, and importantly using LTP-IE as the memory substrate, rather than persistent activity. Our results are shown in Figure 5D-E and discussed in Results section “Encoding complex sequences and non-spatial mappings with LTP-IE” and in an additional couple of sentences in the second paragraph of our Discussion section <bold>“</bold>Computational significance<bold>”</bold>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Some parts of the manuscript were found to be somewhat technical and difficult to follow.

The Results should be more accessible to a broader readership not specialized in computational neuroscience.</p><p>For instance, it is not easy to understand how the results in Figure 2 relate to, and emerge from, those in Figure 1. In general, it would be useful if the authors could better explain the relationship between their neuronal mechanism and the results.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing out lines that were not clear upon reading. We have rewritten these specified sentences in a way that we hope makes them more transparent to an audience not specialized in computational neuroscience.</p><p>Additionally, to clarify the connection between Figure 1 and Figure 2 we have added a couple of new clarifying sentences in Results section “Spike sequences propagate along LTP-IE-defined paths through a network”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition, while the model works well for encoding spatial trajectories in which the closeness of individual locations is pre-encoded in the recurrent connectivity weights, it is difficult to see how this would extend to the given example of cognitive flexibility (i.e., raising our right hand when a particular word is heard, and the left hand when a different word is heard), particularly if no a priori spatial relationship exists. Are spatial relationships necessary? There is no evidence provided to suggest that the neocortical network has the necessary architecture to support LTP-IE based replay.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for raising these questions. While our spiking network model includes spatially organized connectivity, we do not believe spatial organization is strictly necessary for LTP-IE-dependent mappings. Specifically, we have addressed cognitive flexibility and transient stimulus-response mappings in networks with no a priori spatial relationship using our reduced model. See Figure 5D-E and our response to (7).</p></body></sub-article></article>
