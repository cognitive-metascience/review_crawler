the rodent homologue of primate pulvinar, projects extensively to sensory cortices. However, its functional role in sensory cortical processing remains largely unclear. Here, bidirectional activity modulations of LP or its projection to the primary auditory cortex (A1) in awake mice reveal that LP improves auditory processing in A1 supragranular-layer neurons by sharpening their receptive fields and frequency tuning, as well as increasing the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). This is achieved through a subtractive-suppression mechanism, mediated largely by LP-to-A1 axons preferentially innervating specific inhibitory neurons in layer 1 and superficial layers. LP is strongly activated by specific sensory signals relayed from the superior colliculus (SC), contributing to the maintenance and enhancement of A1 processing in the presence of auditory background noise and threatening visual looming stimuli respectively. Thus, a multisensory bottom-up SC-pulvinar-A1 pathway plays a role in contextual and cross-modality modulation of auditory cortical processing.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>pulvinvar</kwd><kwd>auditory cortex</kwd><kwd>suppression</kwd><kwd>inhibitory neuron</kwd><kwd>cross-modality modulation</kwd><kwd>contextual modulation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01DC008983</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Li I</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RF1MH114112</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Li I</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EY019049</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tao</surname><given-names>Huizhong W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EY022478</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tao</surname><given-names>Huizhong W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Electrophysiological recording and optogenetic manipulation approaches reveal that a multisensory bottom-up SC-LP-A1 pathway plays a role in contextual and cross-modality modulation of auditory cortical processing.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Thalamus is generally considered as a gate to the cerebral cortex. First-order thalamic nuclei, such as the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) and ventral medial geniculate body (MGBv), relay bottom-up sensory information to primary sensory cortices, visual and auditory, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kremkow and Alonso, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Winer et al., 2005</xref>). They serve as the major driver of sensory responses in the cortex for each respective sensory modality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Guillery and Sherman, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Halassa and Sherman, 2019</xref>). Compared to first-order thalamic nuclei, the functional roles of higher-order thalamic nuclei in sensory processing are much less well understood, although many of them are known to have broad connections with both primary and secondary cortices.</p><p>The lateral posterior nucleus (LP) of the thalamus is the rodent homologue of the primate pulvinar nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Harting et al., 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Harting et al., 1973</xref>). The latter is considered the largest thalamic complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Harting et al., 1973</xref>). Previous studies on LP/pulvinar have mostly been focused on its involvement in visual-related functions, such as visual attention, visually guided behaviors and eye movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dominguez-Vargas et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Saalmann et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Soares et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Stitt et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zhou et al., 2016</xref>), largely due to its extensive reciprocal connections with visual cortical areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beltramo and Scanziani, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bennett et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Juavinett et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kaas and Lyon, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nakamura et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Oh et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Roth et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Shipp, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Stitt et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wong et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zhou et al., 2018</xref>). Besides visual cortices, LP/pulvinar also has connections with other sensory cortices including primary and secondary auditory cortices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cappe et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hackett et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nakamura et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Oh et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Shipp, 2007</xref>) and contains auditory responsive neurons which exhibit short-latency responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chalupa and Fish, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gattass et al., 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Magariños-Ascone et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Woody et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yirmiya and Hocherman, 1987</xref>). However, the influence of LP on auditory cortical responses has rarely been examined. The impact of LP activity on the primary auditory cortex (A1) is of particular interest. It is known that the axonal projections from LP to primary sensory cortices mainly terminate in layer 1 (L1), whereas those to secondary sensory cortices mainly terminate in L4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Roth et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zhou et al., 2018</xref>). As L1 contains predominantly inhibitory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jiang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mesik et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Schuman et al., 2019</xref>), it is likely that the LP input to the primary sensory cortex plays some modulatory roles.</p><p>In the present study, we investigated the effect of LP activity on auditory responses of neurons in superficial layers of A1 using bidirectional optogenetic manipulation approaches. We found that LP activity improved auditory processing functions in A1 in that it helped to sharpen frequency tuning of A1 L2/3 pyramidal neurons and to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of their auditory responses, through subtractive suppression of their responses in analogous to a thresholding effect. In addition, we found that such effect could play a role in modulating A1 responses under noise background. Furthermore, we found that LP, by receiving salient input from SC, could also mediate the cross-modality modulation of A1 responses by visual looming stimuli.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Bidirectional modulation of frequency tuning and SNR in A1 L2/3 by LP activity</title><p>To study whether LP could influence auditory cortical processing, we applied optogenetic approaches to manipulate LP activity and examined changes in functional response properties of A1 neurons using single-cell loose-patch recordings in awake mice (see Materials and methods). For reversible and temporal silencing of neuronal spikes, we injected adeno-associated virus (AAV) encoding ArchT into LP and implanted an optic fiber over LP to deliver green LED light (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Recordings were made in the ipsilateral A1. To investigate auditory information processing functions, we presented a set of tone pips of varying frequencies and intensities (50 ms duration, 2–45 kHz, 10–70 dB sound pressure level or SPL) and recorded tone-evoked spike responses from L2/3 pyramidal neurons (see Materials and methods). A typical L2/3 pyramidal neuron exhibited a V-shaped tonal receptive field (TRF) with a distinct characteristic frequency (CF) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, left). We interleaved LED-on and LED-off trials so that TRFs without and with LP silencing could be compared in the same neuron. When LP was silenced, we observed an overall increase in response level and TRF size as compared to the LED-off condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, right; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>). Nevertheless, the overall shape of frequency tuning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) and the CF of TRF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>) were largely preserved. Analyzing all the recorded L2/3 neurons, we found significant increases in the spontaneous firing rate (FR), evoked FR and bandwidth of frequency tuning (as measured at an intensity level of 60 dB SPL and at 20 dB above the intensity threshold) when silencing LP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–F</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A</xref>). More importantly, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), as measured by the ratio of evoked to spontaneous FR, was reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). These results indicated that when LP activity was suppressed auditory information processing in A1 might be compromised due to broadening of frequency tuning and a reduction in SNR.</p><p>Next, we optogenetically activated LP by injecting AAV encoding channelrhodopsin2 (ChR2) into LP and delivering blue LED light pulses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). As shown by an example L2/3 pyramidal neuron, activation of LP decreased the amplitude of tone-evoked responses and shrank the TRF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I–J</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C–D</xref>), without changing the CF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Opposite to the effects of silencing LP, activation of LP reduced the spontaneous and evoked FR, and narrowed the frequency tuning bandwidth, while enhancing the SNR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K–N</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3B</xref>). Therefore, the frequency tuning and SNR of A1 L2/3 pyramidal neurons could be bidirectionally modulated by manipulating LP activity: increasing LP activity enhances frequency selectivity and SNR of auditory responses and thus generally improves auditory cortical processing, and vice versa for decreasing LP activity. As a control, we performed similar experiments in GFP-expressing animals and did not observe any significant changes in auditory response level by either green or blue LED light delivery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B and D</xref>). In L4, we did not observe any changes of either spontaneous or evoked FR induced by optogenetic manipulations of LP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). Therefore, the LP’s modulatory effect may be specific to superficial layers.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>LP exerts a thresholding effect on A1 L2/3 responses</title><p>Comparing frequency tuning curves without and with LP manipulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and J</xref>), it appears that LP activity just shifted the A1 frequency tuning curve up or down, without changing the tuning preference (i.e. the best frequency). To further elucidate the nature of LP modulation, we plotted firing rates evoked by effective tones (see Materials and methods) with versus without LP manipulation and then performed a linear regression analysis. As shown by the two example A1 neurons (the same as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and I</xref>), data points were distributed along a line which had a positive y-intercept for LP silencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1O</xref>) but a negative y-intercept for LP activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1P</xref>), supporting the notion that all the tone responses were elevated or reduced by a certain amount when LP activity was manipulated. We did a similar analysis for all the recorded neurons and found that the linearity was generally high (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> close to 1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Q</xref>). The slope of the best fit line was close to 1 for both LP silencing and activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1R</xref>), suggesting that there was no change in the response gain (i.e. no evidence for a multiplicative effect). The y-intercept was all positive for LP silencing but negative for LP activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1S</xref>). These results strongly suggest a subtractive-suppression-like modulation of A1 responses by LP activity, similar to a thresholding effect produced by increasing the level of background noise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Liang et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, LP can bidirectionally modulate auditory responses in superficial layers of A1 through a thresholding mechanism, that is, by shifting A1 frequency tuning up or down.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Effects of bidirectional manipulation of LP activity on A1 response properties.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Left, schematic experimental condition.

By injecting a retrograde dye, CTB-488, in A1, we examined the distribution of LP neurons projecting to A1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Numerous retrogradely labeled neurons were found in LP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, right), with a bias towards its caudal part (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Since LP axons project to L1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), which contains predominantly inhibitory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jiang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Schuman et al., 2019</xref>), it is possible that LP axons can indirectly suppress L2/3 pyramidal neurons via L1 inhibitory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ibrahim et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jiang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zhou et al., 2014</xref>). To test this idea, we injected AAV-ChR2 into LP and made whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings from A1 neurons in slice preparations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Cuts were made in the tissue along boundaries between A1 and secondary auditory cortices to prevent potential feedback input to A1 (see Materials and methods). TTX and 4AP were present in the bath solution to ensure that only monosynaptic responses were recorded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Petreanu et al., 2009</xref>). We performed whole-cell recordings from several types of neurons in A1: L1 inhibitory neurons labeled by crossing GAD2-Cre with the Ai14 (Cre-dependent tdTomato) reporter, pyramidal neurons identified as tdTomato-negative cells in GAD2-Cre::Ai14 animals, parvalbumin (PV) and somatostatin (SOM) positive inhibitory neurons labeled by crossing PV-Cre or SOM-Cre with Ai14, respectively. As shown by two example cells, blue light activation of LP-A1 axons resulted in a robust excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC) in the L1 inhibitory neuron, whereas no EPSC was observed in the pyramidal (PYR) cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Overall, none of the PYR neurons we recorded across L2-4 received direct input from LP, whereas more than 50% of L1 inhibitory neurons received direct LP input (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C and E</xref>). A similar fraction of PV neurons in L2/3 received direct input from LP, whereas none of the recorded SOM neurons did so (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D and E</xref>). A much smaller fraction of PV neurons in L4 also received LP input (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Together, these results indicate that LP-A1 axons preferentially innervate L1 inhibitory neurons and superficial-layer PV inhibitory neurons, which may then provide disynaptic inhibition to L2/3 pyramidal neurons.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>A1 cell types innervated by LP axons.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Slice recording paradigm.

Whether LP could play a similar role in auditory processing has been unknown. In an acoustic environment, one common contextual factor is the background noise. It has been shown that elevating the background noise level results in narrowing of frequency tuning of A1 neurons through a thresholding effect without changing the tuning preference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Liang et al., 2014</xref>). Since LP manipulations also produce a thresholding effect, we wondered whether LP could contribute to the noise-related contextual modulation. We noticed that LP neurons responded robustly to white-noise sound, with the response amplitude increasing with increasing noise levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Previous anatomical and electrophysiological studies have shown that the superior colliculus (SC) in the midbrain innervates LP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beltramo and Scanziani, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bennett et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gale and Murphy, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Stepniewska et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wei et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zingg et al., 2017</xref>). We thus wondered whether these noise responses in LP could be driven by SC input. Comparing the onset latency of noise responses in SC, LP, and A1 L4, we found that it was the shortest in SC, while similar between LP and A1 L4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). This suggests that the responses in LP (at least the early part) are unlikely due to feedback inputs from auditory cortices. Furthermore, silencing SC greatly reduced the amplitude of noise responses in LP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Our results thus indicate that the noise responses in LP are primarily driven by bottom-up input likely from SC.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>LP plays a role in noise-related contextual modulation of A1 responses.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Left, PSTH for responses of an example neuron in the caudal LP to white noise sound (marked by black line).

As shown by an example A1 L2/3 neuron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D and E</xref>, gray), increasing the noise level reduced the amplitude of the response evoked by the best-frequency tone. Silencing LP resulted in a general increase in the tone-evoked response, regardless of the noise level, but to different degrees (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D and E</xref>, red). Summarizing all the recorded L2/3 neurons, we found that silencing LP universally enhanced tone-evoked responses in A1 across different noise levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>, upper panel). Notably, the enhancement was larger at higher noise levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>, lower panel). This is consistent with the notion that LP neuron responses increase with increasing noise levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) and therefore exert a larger suppressive effect in A1 under a higher noise background. Silencing LP also elevated the spontaneous FR in a noise-level dependent manner so that the elevation was larger at higher noise levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). The SNR slightly decreased with increasing noise levels in the control condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>, upper panel, black), indicating that high-level noise has a detrimental effect on SNR, thus deteriorating auditory processing. Silencing LP not only reduced SNR, but also accelerated the detrimental effect of background noise (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>, upper panel, red). Again, the modulatory effect on SNR was larger at higher noise levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>, lower panel). Finally, the frequency tuning bandwidth was reduced with increasing noise levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>, upper panel), consistent with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ehret and Schreiner, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Liang et al., 2014</xref>).

In general, the influence of higher-order thalamus on auditory cortical processing has remained obscure. In the present study, our results demonstrate that LP activity can modulate auditory processing in superficial layers of A1. The overall outcome of increasing LP activity is to improve auditory processing by sharpening frequency tuning and enhancing SNR of auditory evoked responses. This is achieved by subtractive suppression of auditory evoked responses together with suppression of spontaneous firing activity. We also demonstrate that such modulatory effect is largely mediated by the direct projection of LP to A1, where LP axons preferentially innervate L1 inhibitory neurons and superficial-layer PV inhibitory neurons, leading to a net disynaptic inhibitory effect on L2/3 pyramidal neurons. The suppression of A1 L2/3 responses is consistent with our recent study showing a similar suppressive effect in L2/3 of the primary visual cortex (V1), which results in an enhancement of visual feature selectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fang et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>The subtractive effect on L2/3 responses suggests that L1 inhibitory neurons (and PV neurons in superficial layers as well) may be broadly tuned for frequency. The frequency tuning property of L1 inhibitory neurons in the auditory cortex has not been studied yet, but a previous study in the visual cortex does suggest that L1 inhibitory neurons are broadly tuned for visual features such as orientation and direction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mesik et al., 2019</xref>), and PV neurons in superficial layers of A1 have been shown to be broadly tuned for tone frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cohen and Mizrahi, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Li et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Liang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Maor et al., 2016</xref>). As for the local circuit involved, we suggest that both L1 inhibitory neurons and L2/3 PV neurons, which receive direct LP input, can directly inhibit L2/3 pyramidal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jiang et al., 2013</xref>), generating an overall suppressive effect. For L1 inhibitory neurons, their molecular identities have been reported to be diverse: 70% are NDNF+, 20% are nAchR+, and 10% are VIP+ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Schuman et al., 2019</xref>). It will be of great interest to investigate which of these cell types contributes to the LP-mediated modulation of A1 responses by using cell-type specific mouse lines. In addition, whether VIP+ neurons in L2/3 can also be involved in the suppressive effect remains to be tested.</p><p>The LP-mediated modulatory effect on A1 processing may be particularly pronounced and beneficial when there is a high noise background. A previous study has demonstrated that increasing background noise is equivalent to lowering the intensity of test (e.g. tone) stimuli, that is, shifting up the TRF by a certain Δthreshold value (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Liang et al., 2014</xref>). In the current study, we demonstrate that LP activity also exerts a similar thresholding effect on A1 frequency tuning. Our results suggest that the noise effect on A1 frequency tuning may be achieved, at least partially, through LP. The contribution of LP to noise-related contextual modulation of A1 frequency processing is in a positive manner, in that it helps not only to prevent SNR of auditory responses from being deteriorated quickly by high-level noise background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>) but also to accelerate the sharpening of frequency tuning with increasing noise levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>), which may compensate somewhat for the detrimental effect on SNR. Because LP activity is modulated by the noise level in that high-intensity noise activates LP neurons more than low-intensity noise (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), LP neurons have a stronger protective effect on A1 processing under high-intensity than low-intensity noise conditions.</p><p>It is known that LP/pulvinar has extensive reciprocal connectivity with cortical areas including visual and auditory cortices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hackett et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">De La Mothe et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nakamura et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Oh et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tohmi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zhou et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bennett et al., 2019</xref>). Previously, it has been suggested that LP/pulvinar serves in a cortico-thalamo-cortical (‘transthalamic’) indirect route for information transfer from one cortical area to another (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Guillery and Sherman, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sherman, 2016</xref>). Besides cortical inputs, LP also receive strong inputs from SC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beltramo and Scanziani, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bennett et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gale and Murphy, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Stepniewska et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wei et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zingg et al., 2017</xref>). In this study, we demonstrate that LP (mainly the caudal part) receives direct input from the auditory related part of SC and projects to A1, and that silencing SC produces changes in A1 functional response properties similar to silencing LP. These results together suggest that SC can relay bottom-up input to LP to drive its modulation of A1 processing.</p><p>In addition, SC is a multisensory structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Drager and Hubel, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">King and Palmer, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Meredith and Stein, 1986</xref>). The visual only part of SC, that is the superficial layer of SC, also projects strongly to the caudal LP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beltramo and Scanziani, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bennett et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fang et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, visual input may be able to modulate A1 responses as well via LP. Here, we demonstrate that visual looming stimuli modulate A1 L2/3 responses in a similar manner as increasing LP activity and that silencing LP blocks this modulation. This highlights a cross-modality feature of LP modulation. We should note however that the experiment with pharmacological silencing of LP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E–H</xref>) does not exclude possible involvements of LP-mediated pathways other than the bottom-up SC-LP pathway. For example, visual looming signals may reach LP through feedback pathways from visual and associative cortices and then modulate responses in A1. We postulate that the multisensory nature of SC and its strong projections to LP potentially endow LP with an ability to modulate A1 activity given any salient sensory stimuli.</p><p>In summary, our results suggest that a previously unrecognized pathway, the SC-LP-A1 pathway, can provide contextual and cross-modality modulation of A1 responses and auditory processing to enhance the salience of acoustic information. How this pathway may interact with the canonical colliculo-thalamo-cortical auditory pathway remains to be investigated in the future.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or <break/>reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">C57BL/6J</td><td valign="top">Jachson Laboratory</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:000664">IMSR_JAX:000664</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Ai14</td><td valign="top">Jachson Laboratory</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:007914">IMSR_JAX:007914</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>GAD2-IRES-Cre</italic></td><td valign="top">Jachson Laboratory</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:010802">IMSR_JAX:010802</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>PV-IRES-Cre</italic></td><td valign="top">Jachson Laboratory</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:008069">IMSR_JAX:008069</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>SOM-IRES-Cre</italic></td><td valign="top">Jachson Laboratory</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:013044">IMSR_JAX:013044</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td valign="top">AAV1-CAMKII-hChR2-eYFP</td><td valign="top">UPenn Vector Core</td><td valign="top">Addgene #26969</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td valign="top">AAV1-CAG-ArchT-GFP</td><td valign="top">UPenn Vector Core</td><td valign="top">Addgene #29777</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td valign="top">AAV1-hSyn-eNpHR3.0-mCherry</td><td valign="top">UPenn Vector Core</td><td valign="top">Addgene #26972</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td valign="top">AAV2/1-CB7-Cl-eGFP-WPRE-rBG</td><td valign="top">UPenn Vector Core</td><td valign="top">Addgene #105542</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td valign="top">AAV2/1-hSyn-Cre-WPRE-hGH</td><td valign="top">UPenn Vector Core</td><td valign="top">Addgene #105553</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td valign="top">AAV2/1-EF1a-DIO-hChR2-eYFP</td><td valign="top">UPenn Vector Core</td><td valign="top">Addgene #105553</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">Cholera Toxin Subunit B (Recombinant), Alexa Fluor 488 Conjugate</td><td valign="top">ThermoFisher</td><td valign="top">C22841</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">NeuroTrace 640/660 Deep-Red Fluorescent Nissl Stain</td><td valign="top">ThermoFisher</td><td valign="top">N21483</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">Muscimol</td><td valign="top">ThermoFisher</td><td valign="top">M23400</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">Bupivacaine</td><td valign="top">Sigma-Aldrich</td><td valign="top">B1160000</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">Tetrodotoxin (TTX)</td><td valign="top">Torcris</td><td valign="top">Cat.

Similarly, for silencing LP, light from a green LED source (530 nm, 10 mW, Thorlabs) was delivered continuously for stimulating ArchT-expressing neurons. For manipulation of terminals from LP to A1, optic cannula connected with a blue and an amber LED (589 nm, 10 mW, Thorlabs) source was placed on the surface of A1 to stimulate ChR2- and eNpHR3.0-expressing LP axons, respectively. The optogenetic stimulation preceded sound stimulation by 50 ms. Animals were allowed to recover for one week before recording session. During the recovery period, they were habituated to the head fixation on the flat running plate. The head screw was tightly fit into a metal post while the animal could run freely on the plate. Following recording sessions, animals were euthanized, and the brain was imaged to verify the specificity of virus expression and locations of implantations. Mice with mistargeted injections or misplacements of drug infusion tubes or optic fibers were excluded from data analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Slice preparation and recording</title><p>Three weeks following the injections, animals were decapitated following urethane anesthesia and the brain was rapidly removed and immersed in an ice-cold dissection buffer (composition: 60 mM NaCl, 3 mM KCl, 1.25 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 25 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 115 mM sucrose, 10 mM glucose, 7 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.5 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>; saturated with 95% O<sub>2</sub> and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>; pH = 7.4). Coronal slices at 350 µm thickness were sectioned by a vibrating microtome (Leica VT1000s), and recovered for 30 min in a submersion chamber filled with warmed (35°C) ACSF (composition:119 mM NaCl, 26.2 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 11 mM glucose, 2.5 mM KCl, 2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, and 1.2 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 2 mM Sodium Pyruvate, 0.5 mM Vitamin C). A1 or LP neurons were visualized under a fluorescence microscope (Olympus BX51 WI). Patch pipettes (~4–5 MΩ resistance) filled with a cesium-based internal solution (composition: 125 mM cesium gluconate, 5 mM TEA-Cl, 2 mM NaCl, 2 mM CsCl, 10 mM HEPES, 10 mM EGTA, 4 mM ATP, 0.3 mM GTP, and 10 mM phosphocreatine; pH = 7.25; 290 mOsm) were used for whole-cell recordings. Signals were recorded with an Axopatch 700B amplifier (Molecular Devices) under voltage clamp mode at a holding voltage of –70 mV for excitatory currents or 0 mV for inhibitory currents, filtered at 2 kHz and sampled at 10 kHz. Tetrodotoxin (TTX, 1 μM) and 4-aminopyridine (4-AP, 1 mM) were added to the external solution to isolate monosynaptic responses. Blue light stimulation (10 ms pulse, 3 mW power, 10–30 trials) was delivered via a mercury Arc lamp gated with an electronic shutter. PV+, SOM+ or L1 GAD2+ neuronal types were determined by the tdTomato expression. Laminar location of the recorded cell was determined by its depth from the pial surface. CNQX (10 µM) was added to verify glutamatergic transmission.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Sound and visual stimulation</title><p>White noise (50 ms, 70 dB sound pressure level or SPL) or tone pips (50 ms duration, 3 ms ramp) of various frequencies (2–45.25 kHz, 0.1 octave interval) and intensities (10–70 dB SPL, at 10 dB interval) were generated by custom-made software in LabView (National Instruments) through a 16-bit National Instruments interface, and delivered through a calibrated speaker (Tucker-Davis Technologies) to the contralateral ear. The 322 testing stimuli were presented in a pseudorandom sequence. The inter-stimulus interval between noise stimulation or tone pips was 1 s. For auditory stimuli embedded in noise of different levels, 50 ms tone pips at different intensities and frequencies as described above were embedded in white noise of different intensity levels (0, 15, 30, 45 dB SPL). The white noise was 250 ms in duration and preceded the tone pip by 100 ms.</p><p>Visual stimuli were generated in Matlab (MATLAB) with the Psychophysics Toolbox Version 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brainard, 1997</xref>) and were presented on a ViewSonic VA705b monitor (1920 × 1440 pixels, 33.9 cm wide, 27.2 cm high, 60 Hz refresh rate, mean luminance 41 cd/m<sup>2</sup>) mounted on a flexible arm. For visual noise stimulation, a set of dense white-noise patterns were presented. Each frame of the stimuli consisted of a grid of 20 × 20 squares (each square 4°×3°), intensities of which were determined by a m-sequence. Each pattern was presented for 200 ms and 30–50 patterns were presented according to the response level and fidelity. For grating stimulation, drifting sinusoidal gratings (12 directions, 0°−330°, 30° per step, 6 orientations) were presented in a pseudorandom order for 5–8 repetitions. The spatial frequency of the gratings was chosen to be 0.04 cycles per second (cpd) and temporal frequency to be 2 cycles per second (Hz). Each grating drifted for 1.5 s and another grating appeared, which remained to be static for 3 s before drifting. The looming stimulus was an expanding black disk presented from the upper visual field. It changed from 2° to 20° size (in diameter) within 250 ms. The largest black disk after the expansion stayed for another 250 ms, and the interstimulus interval was 250 ms. The auditory stimulus (tone pips as described above) was paired with each cycle of the looming stimulation with an onset delay of 200 ms. We usually only presented 30 cycles of looming stimulation to avoid a potential adaptation effect.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>In vivo electrophysiology</title><p>One week after the preparation, animals were head-fixed on the running plate, and electrophysiology recording with either optogenetic or pharmacological manipulation was carried out in a sound-attenuation booth. Loose-patch recordings were performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ibrahim et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Liang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zhou et al., 2014</xref>), with a patch pipette filled with an artificial cerebral spinal fluid (ACSF; 126 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl, 1.25 mM Na<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 26 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> and 10 mM glucose). A loose seal (0.1–0.5 GΩ) was made on the cell body, allowing spikes only from the patched cell to be recorded. Signals were recorded with an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Molecular Devices) under voltage-clamp mode, with a command voltage applied to adjust the baseline current to near zero. Loose-patch recording signals were filtered with a 100–5,000 Hz band-pass filter. The depths of the recorded neurons were determined based on the micromanipulator reading. Spikes could be detected without ambiguity because their amplitudes were normally higher than 100 pA, while the baseline fluctuation was &lt;5 pA. Multichannel recordings were carried out by lowering a 64-channel silicone probe (NeuroNexus) into the target region. Signals were recorded by an Open-Ephys system. Multi-unit signals during sound stimulation were recorded and saved for offline analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Data analysis</title><p>Noise-driven and tone-driven spike rates were analyzed within a 10–60 ms time window after the onset of sounds. For quantifying evoked firing rates, average baseline firing rate calculated within a 50 ms time window preceding the onset of sounds was subtracted. For quantifying changes in spontaneous firing rate, spontaneous firing rates calculated within a 50 ms time window before sound onsets were compared between LED-on and LED-off conditions. TRFs were reconstructed according to the array sequence. The frequency–intensity space was up-sampled 5 times along the frequency and intensity dimensions only for visualization purposes. The measurements of TRF parameters (e.g. bandwidth) were made from the raw data. Boundaries of the spike TRF were determined following previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Liang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Schumacher et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sutter and Schreiner, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Xiong et al., 2013</xref>). A threshold at the value equal to the spontaneous spike rate plus 20% of the peak evoked firing rate was then used to define significant evoked responses. Responses to frequency–intensity combinations that met this criterion were considered to fall within the TRF of the neuron, which generated the contour of the TRF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Xiong et al., 2013</xref>). Characteristic frequency (CF) was defined as the frequency (in Hz) at which the lowest sound pressure level was necessary to evoke a significant excitatory response. Bandwidth of TRF was determined as the total frequency range for effective tones at 60 dB SPL or at 20 dB SPL above the intensity threshold (i.e. BW20). SNR of auditory responses was calculated as the evoked firing rate divided by the spontaneous firing rate. To quantify changes in evoked firing rate, average tone-evoked firing rates across the TRF (under the control condition) were compared between control and activity manipulation conditions. Onset latency of spike responses was determined based on the generated peristimulus spike-time histogram (PSTH) as the interval between the stimulus onset and the time point where spike rate exceeded the average baseline by 2 standard deviations of baseline fluctuations.</p><p>To plot frequency tuning curve using the Envelope function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sun et al., 2010</xref>), the tone-evoked responses at 60 dB SPL with and without activity manipulation were normalized to the highest evoked firing rate in the control condition. Linear regression fitting for the normalized evoked firing rates with and without activity manipulation was performed for individual neurons in each group, and <italic>R<sup>2</sup></italic>, slope, and intercepts of the best fit line were determined.</p><p>For spike sorting of data obtained from multichannel recording, spike signals were filtered with a 300–3,000 Hz band-pass filter. The nearby four channels of the silicon probe were grouped as tetrodes and semi-automatic spike sorting was performed using the offline sorter of Plexon (Dallas, Texas) following our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>). Clusters with isolation distance &gt;20 were considered as separate clusters. Spike clusters were classified as single units only if the waveform SNR (signal-to-noise ratio) exceeded 4 (12 dB) and the inter-spike interval was longer than1.2 ms for &gt;99.5% of the spikes.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Statistics</title><p>Shapiro–Wilk test was first applied to examine whether samples had a normal distribution, and a p value &lt; 0.05 indicated non-normality. In the case of a normal distribution, <italic>Z</italic>-test or two-sided paired <italic>t</italic>-test was applied. Otherwise, the Wilcoxon signed-rank test was applied as a non-parametric test. Two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used to test whether data from two groups were from the same distribution. Statistical analysis was conducted with Matlab. Data were reported as mean ± SD unless otherwise mentioned.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by grants from the US National Institutes of Health to LIZ (R01DC008983; RF1MH114112) and HWT (EY019049 and EY022478).</p></ack><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Writing - original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Writing - original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Data curation, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Data curation, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Project administration, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Project administration, Writing - review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Animal experimentation: This study was performed in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health.

pulvinar, in controlling auditory cortex activity according to auditory but also visual context. Particularly interesting are the demonstrations that LP is critical for maintaining good signal-to-noise ratio for tone responses in the presence of background noise, and that it also improves auditory coding during visual threat, thanks to inputs received from the superior colliculus. This indicates non-trivial influences of secondary thalamic nuclei on auditory processing.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Contextual and Cross-Modality Modulation of Auditory Cortical Processing through Pulvinar Thalamus Mediated Thresholding&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Brice Bathellier as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Andrew King as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Alfonso junior Apicella (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors show that the analog of pulvinar in rodent, LP, projects to auditory cortex. Moreover its activation modulates spontaneous activity and auditory responses, putatively by driving GABAergic interneurons (in L1 but also PV cells in L2/3). This results in a decreased signal-to-noise ratio and sharper frequency tuning curves. Also, LP seems to be driven by superior colliculus and mediates inhibition of AC (but increases SNRs for sound response) during dark looming visual stimuli. Finally another interesting result is that LP activation improves SNRs in acoustic noise.</p><p>This is a really nice paper that studies the projection from LP to A1 in awake mice using a barrage of different circuit-specific tools. The authors elegantly demonstrate that the lateral posterior nucleus (LP) of the thalamus, the rodent homologue of the primate pulvinar thalamus, contributes to the maintenance and enhancement of primary auditory cortex processing in the presence of auditory background noise and threating visual looming stimuli, respectively. The study design is uncomplicated, and the experiments were carried out very carefully. The results are presented clearly and are overall convincing. Together, this makes an interesting study about a potentially ecologically relevant modulation of auditory cortex, in a multisensory context.</p><p>Nevertheless the reviewers pointed to a number of essential revisions to make in order to clarify particular points of the manuscript.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors claim throughout the paper that LP modulates auditory responses but that this modulation is purely additive and occurs both in spontaneous and evoked response. This seems to be more a global offset than a modulation. Unfortunately, we could not find in the text or Materials and methods section whether evoked firing rates are calculated after subtraction of baseline or not, but it seems it is done without baseline subtraction.</p><p>If this is correct, then baseline-subtracted evoked response would likely show no effect of LP (in)activation.</p><p>The authors should clarify that and mitigate their claim about a modulation while their main results rather describe an input bias acting both on evoked and spontaneous firing rates with the same strength.</p><p>Note that this 'input bias description' explains very well the SNR increase: SNR = (signal + LP_offset)/(baseline + LP_offset) as signal &gt; baseline, LP_offset has a stronger impact on the denominator, and SNR increases for a negative offset.</p><p>If this is correct, it would be clearer to say that LP activity removes some of the background activity to sharpen the actual signal, but without modulating the signal itself. In any case, baseline subtracted responses should be added to the manuscript and it should be discussed if the observed modulation is a simple offset or more than that.</p><p>That said, the very interesting results in acoustic noise conditions show that LP can also have an effect on responses to acoustic noise, which does not seem to be purely additive, as in that case LP silencing has much more impact for loud than quiet white noise. In this specific case, one observes a real down-modulation of the noise response by LP. So this should also be mentioned and it should be discussed why LP effects are not additive anymore in this case.</p><p>Also the authors could discuss potential operative models explaining how interneuron activations lead to the observed modulations. For example, are the authors able to say anything about the L1 inhibitory tuning properties? i.e. what is the local circuit mechanism that is leading to the L2/3 changes? Do you know anything about the identity of the L1 neurons contributing to the circuit (are they primarily VIP+)?</p><p>2) It seems from the figures and the Materials and methods that the receptive fields were upsampled. Were the bandwidths (and anything else extracted from the receptive fields) taken from the upsampled data? If so, this renders the result dependent on the technique used for upsampling. In this case measurements such as bandwidth should be extracted from raw data.</p><p>3) Why was 60dB used for your bandwidth measurement. It seems a little arbitrary given that the standard in the auditory field is to use &quot;BW10&quot; or &quot;BW20&quot; (i.e. bandwidths either 10 or 20 dB above threshold). Please, use these measurements as well. In looking at Figure 1B one cannot help but think that 60 dB was chosen because lower intensities did not exhibit a significant result – is that the case?</p><p>4) Could the authors elaborate a little of their choice of light power for activation/inactivation experiments? From the Materials and methods, it seems like 10mW was used. Was the same power used for both activation/inactivation experiments (and is this valid, given the differences between ChR2 and Arch)? Did they titrate power at all, i.e. if the power was kept the same for all experiments, then day-to-day experimental variability (differences in viral uptake, variation in fiber placement) become an additional confound.</p><p>5) The statistics used in the paper are insufficiently documented, and could be improved. In the Materials and methods section, it is stated that Shapiro-Wilk was used as a normality test prior to a paired t-test, if appropriate. However the results are never shown and the paired t-test seems to have been used for the majority of tests between on and off conditions throughout the paper. Please justify systematically the normality of the data or even better, use a non-parametric test (e.g. Signed test), which should just work as well.</p><p>6) Things become a little bit more circuit unspecific later in the paper. For example, the visual looming experiment is only carried out with a mass pharmacological silencing of LP. The results are certainly suggestive, given the rest of the paper, but alternate circuits and mechanisms should be thoroughly discussed and acknowledged.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.54157.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors claim throughout the paper that LP modulates auditory responses but that this modulation is purely additive and occurs both in spontaneous and evoked response.

For quantifying evoked firing rates, we have subtracted the baseline firing rate, which was calculated within a 50-ms time window preceding the onset of sound stimulation. For quantifying changes in spontaneous firing rate, we compared the spontaneous firing rates calculated within a 50-ms window before sound stimulation between LED-On and LED-Off conditions (LED stimulation preceded sound stimulation by 50 ms). We have clarified these details in the Materials and methods (subsection “Sound and visual stimulation”). Thus, the changes in evoked firing rate we report here represent a bona fide modulation of signals separate from the effect on the baseline activity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>That said, the very interesting results in acoustic noise conditions show that LP can also have an effect on responses to acoustic noise, which does not seem to be purely additive, as in that case LP silencing has much more impact for loud than quiet white noise.

Because loud noise activates LP neurons more strongly than soft noise, LP neuron activity has a stronger suppressive effect in A1 under the loud than soft noise condition. The additive effect we have described for frequency tuning changes only applies for a certain background noise condition, i.e. the background noise remains constant while tones of different frequencies are tested. We have clarified this point in the text (Discussion, third paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also the authors could discuss potential operative models explaining how interneuron activations lead to the observed modulations.

Do you know anything about the identity of the L1 neurons contributing to the circuit (are they primarily VIP+)?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for raising these questions. The additive effect suggests that L1 inhibitory neurons (and L2/3 PV neurons as well) are very broadly tuned for frequency. There has not been any published study on the frequency tuning property of L1 inhibitory neurons in auditory cortex yet. However, a previous study in the visual cortex does suggests that L1 inhibitory neurons are broadly tuned for visual features such as orientation and direction (Mesik et al., 2019) and PV neurons in superficial layers of A1 have been shown to be broadly tuned for frequency (Cohen and Mizrahi, 2015; Li et al., 2015; Liang et al., 2018; Maor et al., 2016). As for the local circuit involved, we postulate that both L1 inhibitory neurons and L2/3 PV cells can directly inhibit L2/3 pyramidal neurons (Jiang et al., 2013), generating the overall suppressive effect.</p><p>The molecular identity of L1 neurons is diverse: 70% are NDNF+, 20% are nAchR+, and 10% are VIP+ (Schuman et al., 2019). We will need cell-type specific mouse lines to test which of these cells types contributes most, but it is unlikely that VIP+ neurons are the answer. We have added these points in the Discussion (second paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) It seems from the figures and the Materials and methods that the receptive fields were upsampled.

The measurements of receptive field parameters (e.g. bandwidth) were made from the raw data. We have clarified this point in the Materials and methods (subsection “Data analysis”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Why was 60dB used for your bandwidth measurement.

Our results show that the change in bandwidth is still significant (see new Figure 1—figure supplement 3).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Could the authors elaborate a little of their choice of light power for activation/inactivation experiments? From the Materials and methods, it seems like 10mW was used. Was the same power used for both activation/inactivation experiments (and is this valid, given the differences between ChR2 and Arch)?

This is the maximum power provided in our current system. Because our experiments had a within-neuron control (i.e. the same cell without and with LED light illumination), variability in terminal power, expression level, etc. should not mask the overall effect.</p><p>The viral expression and fiber placement were always checked post hoc. Animals with improper locations of viral expression or fiber placement were excluded from data analysis (see the aforementioned subsection). These procedures help to minimalize potential confounding factors throughout our experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The statistics used in the paper are insufficiently documented, and could be improved.

In the case of non-normality, we used the Wilcoxon signed-rank test as a non-parametric test (subsection “Statistics” and also specified in figure legends).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Things become a little bit more circuit unspecific later in the paper. For example, the visual looming experiment is only carried out with a mass pharmacological silencing of LP. The results are certainly suggestive, given the rest of the paper, but alternate circuits and mechanisms should be thoroughly discussed and acknowledged.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewers have raised a good point. We have now discussed about possible alternative pathways, for example, in addition to the bottom-up SC-LP pathway, visual looming signals may reach LP through feedback input from visual and associative cortices and then modulate responses in A1 (subsection “LP mediates looming visual stimuli induced modulation of auditory responses in A1”). The experiment with pharmacological silencing of LP does not exclude the possibility of these alternative pathways.</p></body></sub-article></article>
