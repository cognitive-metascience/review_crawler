environmental signals to mediate behavior. Cnidarians, including jellyfish and sea anemones, both detect and capture prey using stinging cells called nematocytes which fire a venom-covered barb via an unknown triggering mechanism. Here, we show that nematocytes from <italic>Nematostella vectensis</italic> use a specialized voltage-gated calcium channel (nCa<sub>V</sub>) to distinguish salient sensory cues and control the explosive discharge response. Adaptations in nCa<sub>V</sub> confer unusually sensitive, voltage-dependent inactivation to inhibit responses to non-prey signals, such as mechanical water turbulence. Prey-derived chemosensory signals are synaptically transmitted to acutely relieve nCa<sub>V</sub> inactivation, enabling mechanosensitive-triggered predatory attack. These findings reveal a molecular basis for the cnidarian stinging response and highlight general principles by which single proteins integrate diverse signals to elicit discrete animal behaviors.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cnidarian</kwd><kwd>sensory physiology</kwd><kwd>calcium signaling</kwd><kwd>ion channel</kwd><kwd>neuroethology</kwd><kwd>nematocyst</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100003194</institution-id><institution>New York Stem Cell Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Robertson Neuroscience Investigator</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bellono</surname><given-names>Nicholas W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001032</institution-id><institution>Chicago Community Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Searle Scholars Program</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bellono</surname><given-names>Nicholas W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001207</institution-id><institution>Esther A. and Joseph Klingenstein Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Klingenstein-Simons Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bellono</surname><given-names>Nicholas W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R00DK115879</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bellono</surname><given-names>Nicholas W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1F31NS117055</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Weir</surname><given-names>Keiko</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Swiss National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P2SKP3-187684</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dupre</surname><given-names>Christophe</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P2SKP3_187684</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dupre</surname><given-names>Christophe</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Swiss National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P400PB-180894</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>van Giesen</surname><given-names>Lena</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund10"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000879</institution-id><institution>Alfred P.

We show nematocytes are intrinsically mechanosensitive but nCa<sub>V</sub> exhibits unique voltage-dependent inactivation that basally inhibits cellular activity, thereby preventing responses to extraneous mechanical stimuli, such as background water turbulence. We further show that sensory neurons make synaptic contact with nematocytes, and the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh) elicits a hyperpolarizing response that relieves nCa<sub>V</sub> inactivation to allow for subsequent cellular stimulation and chemo-tactile-elicited discharge. Thus, we propose that the specialized voltage dependence of nCa<sub>V</sub> acts as a molecular filter for sensory discrimination.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Nematocyte Ca<sub>V</sub> channels</title><p>We first obtained whole-cell patch clamp recordings from acutely dissociated nematocytes to investigate nematocyte signal transduction. Using intracellular cesium (Cs<sup>+</sup>) to block potassium (K<sup>+</sup>) currents revealed a voltage-gated inward current that was activated by positive or depolarized membrane voltages (I<sub>CaV</sub>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). In response to sustained positive voltage, voltage-activated ion channels enter a non-conducting, inactivated state and cannot be activated until returned to a resting state by negative membrane voltage. This property generally serves to limit responses to repetitive or prolonged stimulation, similar to receptor desensitization. Remarkably, I<sub>CaV</sub> began to inactivate at voltages more negative than we could technically measure, thus demonstrating an unusual voltage sensitivity of this conductance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>). To determine whether these properties were specific to nematocytes, we used a transgenic sea anemone with fluorescentlyÂ labeled neurons to facilitate direct comparison between these excitable cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nakanishi et al., 2012</xref>;Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Neuronal voltage-gated currents had a lower threshold for activation and exhibited much weaker voltage-dependent inactivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1AâD</xref>), similar to currents found in neurons of other animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hille, 2001</xref>), indicating that nematocytes exhibit unusual voltage-dependent properties. Ion substitution and pore blocker experiments confirmed I<sub>CaV</sub> is a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitive current (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E,F</xref>), consistent with the contribution of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> to chemo-tactile-induced discharge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Watson and Hessinger, 1994a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gitter et al., 1994</xref>;Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Increased concentrations of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> did not affect inactivation of I<sub>CaV</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1E</xref>), suggesting the enhanced voltage-dependent inactivation is intrinsic to the channel complex. This observation is important because it suggests I<sub>CaV</sub> renders nematocytes completely inactivated at typical resting membrane voltages and thus cells could not be stimulated from resting state.</p><p>To identify the ion channel mediating I<sub>CaV</sub>, we generated a tentacle-specific transcriptome and aligned reads from nematocyte-enriched cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sunagar et al., 2018</xref>). This strategy allowed us to search for differentially expressed transcripts that might encode Ca<sub>V</sub> channel subunits (pore-forming Î± and auxiliary Î² and Î±2Î´ subunits). The orthologue of <italic>cacnb2</italic>, a Î² subunit of Ca<sub>V</sub> channels, was the highest expressed Ca<sub>V</sub> transcript in nematocyte-enriched cells, with levels 14-fold higher than other cells in the sea anemone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Î² subunits can modulate voltage-dependence and trafficking in diverse ways depending on their splice isoform, interacting subunits, and cellular context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Buraei and Yang, 2010</xref>). Importantly, Î² subunits only interact with Î± subunits of high voltage-activated (HVA) calcium channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Perez-Reyes, 2003</xref>). In agreement with robust Î² subunit expression, we found significant enrichment for <italic>cacna1a,</italic> the pore-forming subunit of HVA Ca<sub>V</sub>2.1, and high expression of <italic>cacna2d1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1A,B</xref>). These observations are consistent with a previous report demonstrating specific expression of <italic>cacna1a</italic> in nematocytes of sea anemone tentacles and expression of Î² subunits in nematocytes from jellyfish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bouchard et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Moran and Zakon, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bouchard and Anderson, 2014</xref>).

In agreement with our observation that nAChR activation increases K<sup>+</sup> channel activity, ACh hyperpolarized nematocytes to negative voltages from which they were capable of producing robust voltage spikes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B,C</xref>). A select number of cells with a more positive resting voltage still failed to produce spikes, and therefore additional regulation could exist through the modulation of resting membrane voltage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5âfigure supplement 3A,B</xref>). These results suggest that the voltage-dependence for I<sub>CaV</sub> prevents basal activation to depolarizing signals, such as mechanical stimulation, but activation of nAChR hyperpolarizes the cell to relieve I<sub>CaV</sub> inactivation, thereby amplifying depolarizing signals to mediate cellular responses.</p><p>Consistent with a requirement for both mechano- and chemosensory input, we found the mechanoreceptor current blocker Gd<sup>3+</sup> inhibited chemo-tactile stimulation of discharge. Additionally, the nAChR antagonist mecamylamine greatly reduced chemo-tactile-induced discharge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>).

Moreover, the requirement for prey-derived chemicals was completely recapitulated by ACh (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). These results are consistent with a role for ACh signaling downstream of chemosensory stimulation. Thus, we propose that the unique I<sub>CaV</sub> voltage-dependent inactivation provides a mechanism by which nematocytes filter extraneous depolarizing mechanical signals, but can integrate chemosensory-induced hyperpolarization together with a depolarizing stimulus to elicit robust signal amplification and discharge responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Nematocyte Ca<sub>V</sub> properties filter salient chemo-tactile signals.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Model for nematocyte signal integration.

The involvement of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in this process is consistent with a well-established role for Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx in mediating discharge across multiple cnidarian species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">McKay and Anderson, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Santoro and Salleo, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Watson and Hessinger, 1994a</xref>). However, the exact mechanism by which Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx mediates discharge is unclear. It has been proposed that Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx alters the permeability of the nematocyst capsule and/or initiates the rapid dissociation of ions within the cyst to induce osmotic changes within the organelle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lubbock and Amos, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lubbock et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Weber, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tardent, 1995</xref>). Our transcriptomic analyses demonstrate that nematocytes express multiple Ca<sup>2+</sup> handling proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5âfigure supplement 3DâF</xref>), which could control Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling domains in response to spatiallyÂ restricted sensory transduction cascades. This organization would be consistent with the necessity for I<sub>CaV</sub>-mediated amplification of receptor-mediated nonselective cation conductances. Indeed, Ca<sub>V</sub> currents could mediate an increase ofÂ &gt;500 ÂµM Ca<sup>2+</sup> considering a uniform distribution across the small cytoplasmic volume (5%) not occupied by the nematocyst. Future studies will provide insight into the coupling between sensory transduction and organellar physiology.</p><p>Our results suggest one mechanism by which nematocytes integrate combined mechanical and chemical cues to filter salient environmental information and appropriately engage nematocyte discharge. However, cnidarians occupy distinct ecological niches and may have evolved different biophysical features to account for increased turbulence, specific behaviors, or particular prey and predatory targets. Numerous sea anemones occupy turbulent tidal pools, whereas others, like <italic>Nematostella vectensis,</italic> live in calmer regions. Similarly, cnidarians can undergo developmental transitions between immobile and free-floating medusa phases while maintaining the use of nematocytes for prey capture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Martin and Archer, 1997</xref>). Although forces generated from swimming prey are likely negligible in comparison with physical contact of the cnidocil, strong tidal waves may be sufficient to elicit mechanoreceptive responses which could interfere with pertinent chemo-tactile sensation and subsequent stinging responses. These ecological differences might require distinct filtering mechanisms for distinguishing salient prey or predator signals. For example, anatomical organization and pharmacological dependence for cellular and discharge activity in anthozoan nematocytes differs from hydrozoans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anderson and Mckay, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kass-Simon and Scappaticci, Jr., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Oliver et al., 2008</xref>). Indeed, nematocysts vary extensively in morphology, differing in the length of the extruded thread, the presence of spines, and the composition of toxins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kass-Simon and Scappaticci, Jr., 2002</xref>), likely reflecting the diversity of organismal needs.</p><p>The modularity provided by synaptic connections could increase the diversity of signals which regulate nematocyte discharge. For instance, distinct chemoreceptor cells could form synaptic connections with specific nematocyte populations to mediate discrete behavioral responses. In addition to chemical mixtures, such as prey extract, numerous amino acids, lipids, and N-acetylated sugars can individually modulate nematocyte discharge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Watson and Hessinger, 1992</xref>). While these are broadly-distributed molecules, it is possible distinct prey- or predator-derived compounds regulate specific chemosensory cells to engage predatory or defensive nematocytes, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brace, 1990</xref>). Indeed, we observed that both spirocytes and neurons make synaptic contacts with nematocytes, thus either could release ACh in response to specific stimuli. Future identification and characterization of chemosensory cells and the ecologicallyÂ relevant compounds which activate them will provide insight regarding chemical coding and mechanisms of synaptic signaling. Discharge can alsoÂ be regulated by organismal nutritional state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sandberg et al., 1971</xref>), suggesting nematocytes could receive input from digestive cells or hormones. Additionally, various cnidocyte types are found across the cnidarian phylum and regulated by stimuli relevant to their behavioral purpose. For example, the freshwater cnidarian, <italic>Hydra vulgaris</italic>, uses a specific cnidocyte to grasp surfaces for phototaxis, suggesting that these cells could be regulated downstream of a photoreceptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Plachetzki et al., 2012</xref>). Within anthozoans, nematocytes and spirocytes may use similar or distinct mechanisms to control discharge. Functional comparisons will reveal whether specific proteins, domains, or signaling mechanisms are conserved or give rise to the evolutionary novelties across these incredibly specialized cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Babonis and Martindale, 2014</xref>).</p><p>The ability to distinguish behaviorally-relevant stimuli, such as prey, from background noise is especially critical because nematocytes are single-use cells that must be replaced following discharge. Multiple species have taken advantage of these specialized conditions by adapting to evade and exploit nematocyte discharge for their own defensive purposes. For example, clownfish can live among the tentacles of sea anemones without harmful effects, although the exact mechanism by which this occurs is unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lubbock, 1980</xref>). Certain species of nudibranchs and ctenophores acquire undischarged nematocysts from prey and store them for later defense, indicating that these organisms are able to initially prevent discharge responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Greenwood, 2009</xref>). Understanding such regulation could reveal additional mechanisms by which cells process diverse stimuli and provide insight into the evolution of these interspecies relationships.</p></sec><sec

Whole-cell recording data were filtered at 1 kHz and sampled at 10 kHz. For single-channel recordings, data were filtered at 2 kHz and sampled at 20 kHz. Data were leak-subtracted online using a p/4 protocol, and membrane potentials were corrected for liquid junction potentials. For whole-cell nematocyte and neuron recordings, borosilicate glass pipettes were polished to 8â10 Mâ¦. The standard <italic>Nematostella</italic> medium was used as the extracellular solution and contained (in mM): 140 NaCl, 3.3 glucose, 3.3 KCl, 3.3 HEPES, 0.5 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.5 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, pH 7.6. Two intracellular solutions were used for recording. For isolating inward currents (mM): 133.3 cesium methanesulfonate, 1.33 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 3.33 EGTA, 3.33 HEPES, 10 sucrose, 10 CsEGTA, pH 7.6. For outward currents (mM) 166.67 potassium gluconate, 3.33 HEPES, 10 sucrose, 1.33 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 KEGTA, pH 7.6. In some experiments, BAPTA was substituted for EGTA.

The intracellular solution contained (mM): 140 cesium methanesulfonate, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 3.33 EGTA, 3.33 HEPES, 10 sucrose, pH 7.2.

The intracellular solution used (mM): 140 CsCl, 10 HEPES, 1 CsEGTA, pH 7.4.</p><p>The following pharmacological agents were used: N-Acetylneuraminic acid (NANA, 100 ÂµM, Sigma), glycine (100 ÂµM, Sigma), acetylcholine (1 mM), mecamylamine (100 ÂµM, 500 ÂµM for behavioral experiments, Tocris), GdCl<sub>3</sub> (100 ÂµM, Sigma), glutamate (1 mM), GABA (1 mM), nicotine (100 ÂµM, Tocris), tubocurarine (10 ÂµM, Tocris), TEA<sup>+</sup> (10 mM, Sigma), BAPTA (10 mM, Tocris), GDPÎ²S (1 mM, Sigma), and Cd<sup>2+</sup> (500 ÂµM, 250 ÂµM for behavioral experiments). All were dissolved in water. Prey extract was isolated from freshly-hatched <italic>Artemia. Artemia</italic> were flash-frozen, ground with mortar and pestle, filtered withÂ 0.22 ÂµM pores or 3 kDa ultracentrifugal filters (Amicon UFC500324). Pharmacological effects were quantified as differences in normalized peak current from the same cell following bath application of the drug (I<sub>treatment</sub>/I<sub>control</sub>). Whole-cell recordings were used to assess mechanical sensation together with a piezoelectric-driven (Physik Instrumente) fire-polished glass pipette (tip diameter 1 Î¼m). Mechanical steps in 0.5 Î¼m increment were applied every 5 s while cells were voltage-clamped at â90 mV. Single mechanosensitive channels were studied using excised outside-out patches exposed to pressure applied via a High-Speed Pressure Clamp system (HSPC, ALA-scientific). Pressure-response relationships were established using pressure steps in 10 mmHg increments. Voltage-dependence of currents was measured from â100 mV to 100 mV in 20 mV increments while applying repetitive 60 mmHg pressure pulses.</p><p>Unless stated otherwise, voltage-gated currents were measured in response to a 200 ms voltage pulse in 10 mV increments from a â110 mV holding potential. G-V relationships were derived from I-V curves by calculating G: GÂ =Â I<sub>CaV</sub>/(V<sub>m</sub>-E<sub>rev</sub>) and fit with a Boltzman equation. Voltage-dependent inactivation was measured during â10 mV (Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents in native cells), 0 mV (Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents in heterologously expressed channels), 60 mV (K<sup>+</sup> currents in native cells) voltage pulses following a series of 1 s pre-pulses ranging from â110 mV to 60 mV. Voltage-dependent inactivation was quantified as I/I<sub>max</sub>, with I<sub>max</sub> occurring at the voltage pulse following a â110 mV prepulse. In some instances, inactivation curves could not be fit with a Boltzman equation and were instead fitted with an exponential. The time course of voltage-dependent inactivation was measured by using a holding voltage of â110 mV or â70 mV and applying a 0 mV test pulse every 5 s. Recovery from inactivation was quantified by normalizing inactivated and recovered currents to those elicited from the same cell in which a 0 mV voltage pulse was applied from â110 mV. Test pulses from a holding voltage of â40 mV were used to assess inactivation, followed by pulses from â110 mV where currents quickly recovered to maximal amplitude. Repetitive stimulation using 20 ms pulses to â10 mV or 0 mV from a holding voltage of â90 mV was also used to measure inactivation in response to repetitive stimulation. Current inactivation kinetics were quantified by the portion of current remaining at the end of aÂ 200 ms pulse (R200) or fit with a single exponential. Activation was quantified as the time from current activation until peak amplitude. 200 ms voltage ramps from â120 to 100 mV were used to measure ACh-elicited currents. Stimulus-evoked currents were normalized to basal currents measured at the same voltage of 80 mV.</p><p>Single channel currents were measured from the middle of the noise band between closed and open states or derived from all-points amplitude histograms fit with Gaussian relationships at closed and open peaks for each excised patch record. Conductance was calculated from the linear slope of IâV relationships. N(P<sub>O</sub>) was calculated during pressure steps while voltage was held at â80 mV. In current clamp recordings, effects of ACh or intracellular ions on resting membrane potential was measured without current injection (IÂ =Â 0). 1 s depolarizing current steps of various amplitudes were injected to measure spikes which were quantified by frequency (spikes/second) or width (duration of spike). To test whether resting membrane potential affects the ability to generate spikes, hyperpolarizing current was injected to bring cells to negative voltages (&lt;-90mV) or ACh was locally perfused before depolarizing current injection.</p><p>The change in Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration from a nematocyte voltage spike was estimated based on the integral of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-selective nematocyte currents elicited by a 0 mV step, the same amplitude and slightly shorter duration than a voltage spike. Nematocyte volume was estimated from serial electron microscopy reconstruction with a non-nematocyst volume of approximately 5% of the total volume of the cell. We did not consider the volume occupied by other organelles, making for a conservative estimate. Furthermore, calculations were made with extracellular recording solution containing 0.5 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup>, which is approximately six-fold less than physiological concentrations. Thus, the large increase we calculated likely underestimates the total Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Immunohistochemistry</title><sec id="s4-5-1"><title>Neural staining</title><p>Adult Nv-Elav1::mOrange <italic>Nematostella</italic> were paralyzed in anesthetic solution, then placed in a 4% solution of PFA overnight.

Slides were incubated in acetylthiocholine and copper-buffered solution at 40Â°C until tentacles appeared white. The stain was developed with a silver solution so that stained areas appear brown. Slides were incubated in the presence of the silver staining solution (+substrate) or saline (-substrate), rinsed according to protocol, and mounted in Fluoromount-G (SouthernBiotech) and imaged using a scanning, transmitted light microscope.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Behavior</title><p>Discharge of nematocysts was assessed based on well-established assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Watson and Hessinger, 1994a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gitter et al., 1994</xref>). Adult <italic>Nematostella</italic> were placed in petri dishes containing a modified <italic>Nematostella</italic> medium, containing 16.6 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>. Animals were given appropriate time to acclimate before presented with stimuli. For assaying discharge, 5 mm round coverslips were coated with a solution of 25% gelatin (w/v) dissolved in medium, and allowed to cure overnight prior to use. Coverslips were presented to the animalâs tentacles for 5 s and then immediately imaged at 20X magnification using a transmitted light source. To assay behavioral response to prey-derived chemicals, freshly hatched brine shrimp were flash frozen and pulverized, then filtered through a 0.22 Âµm filter. Coverslips were dipped in the prey extract and immediately presented to the animal. All pharmacological agents were bath applied, except for acetylcholine (1 mM), which was delivered as a bolus immediately prior to coverslip presentation. Acetylcholine exposure did not produce movement or contraction of tentacles. Experiments carried out in the absence of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> were nominally Ca<sup>2+</sup> free and did not use extracellular chelators. The highest density of discharged nematocytes on the coverslip was imaged at 20X. Nematocyte discharge involves everting the barbed thread, causing them to embed in the gelatin-coated coverslips. Therefore, if nematocytes do not discharge, they are not captured by the gelatin-coated coverslip or visualized for quantification. Images were blindly analyzed using a custom Matlab routine (available in supplemental material) in which images were thresholded and the fraction of pixels corresponding to nematocytes was compared across experiments.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Electron microscopy</title><p>Tentacles from an individual <italic>Nematostella vectensis</italic> were placed between two sapphire coverslips separated by a 100 Î¼m spacer ring (Leica) and frozen in a high-pressure freezer (EM ICE, Leica). This was followed by freeze-substitution (EM AFS2, Leica) in dry acetone containing 1% ddH2O, 1% OsO4 and 1% glutaraldehyde at â90Â°C for 48 hr. The temperature was then increased at 5Â°C/h up to 20Â°C and samples were washed at room temperature in pure acetone 3 Ã 10 min RT and propylene oxide 1 Ã 10 min. Samples were infiltrated with 1:1 Epon:propylene oxide overnight at 4Â°C. The samples were subsequently embedded in TAAB Epon (Marivac Canada Inc) and polymerized at 60Â°C for 48 hr. Ultrathin sections (about 50 nm) were cut on an ultramicrotome (Leica EM UC6) and collected with an automated tape collector (ATUMÂ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kasthuri et al., 2015</xref>). The sections were then post-stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate prior to imaging with a scanning electron microscope (Zeiss SIGMA) using a back-scattered electron detector and a pixel size of 4 nm.</p><p>Once all the sections were scanned, images were aligned into a stack using the algorithm âLinear Stack Alignment with SIFTâ available in Fiji (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>). After alignment, images were imported into VAST (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Berger et al., 2018</xref>) so that every cell could be manually traced. By examining sections and following cellular processes contacts between cells of interest (e.g. neurons and nematocytes) were identified and assessed for the presence of dense-core vesicles in the vicinity (~500 nm). Such instances were labeled as putative synapses. Cells were then rendered in three dimensions using 3D Studio Max 2019 (Autodesk, San Rafael, CA).</p><p>Nematocytes were readily identified because resin does not infiltrate the nematocyst capsule, making for an âemptyâ appearance (large white area). Spirocytes were also readily identified based on their capsule containing a long, coiled filament. Sensory neurons were identified according to the higher number of dense core vesicles, higher number of synapses and the presence of sensory processes extending into the external environment.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Data were analyzed with Clampfit (Axon Instruments) or Prism (Graphpad) and are represented as meanÂ Â±Â s.e.m. <italic>n</italic> represents independent experiments for the number of cells/patches or behavioral trials.

While most people know that jellyfish sting their prey (or unwary swimmers), most do not know about the complex cells called nematocysts that harbor the stinging, venom-infused harpoons used by jellyfish and anemones. This study takes a soup to nuts approach with cell biology, ion channel biophysics, transcriptomics, and ultrastructural analysis embedded in a neuroethological context. Further, the ion channel biophysics ranges from calcium and calcium-activated K channels to mechanoreceptors to neurotransmitter receptors, calling on a variety of usually distinct topics blended in a comprehensive narrative. Especially intriguing are the interactions of mechanosensory and chemical input to trigger the discharge and the role of an unusual calcium channel inactivation and the relief of this inactivation by synaptic input to the nematocyst that triggers a long duration action potential and ejection of the nematocyst's harpoon.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>This paper was praised by the reviewers for its thoroughness and creativity. There are suggested revisions that will make this strong paper stronger contained in the reviewer's comments. Revisions will be handled by the Reviewing Editor and further review is not necessary. Reviewer #3 indicates some further experiments; these need not be pursued but if already completed could be included. Discussion should acknowledge that these experiments would further support the conclusions. Further amplifying the text as suggested by reviewer #2 could broaden the paper's appeal to the general reader.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>I had only one question.

If nematocytes do not discharge, they are not captured by the gelatin-coated coverslip or visualized for quantification. Discharged nematocysts are frequently embedded perpendicular to the coverslip surface so that the cyst (the majority of the nematocyte cell, so similar in appearance) is the most visible component versus the discharged thread.
