tissue with poor capacity for spontaneous repair. Here, we show that embryonic development of cartilage in the skate (<italic>Leucoraja erinacea</italic>) mirrors that of mammals, with developing chondrocytes co-expressing genes encoding the transcription factors Sox5, Sox6 and Sox9. However, in skate, transcriptional features of developing cartilage persist into adulthood, both in peripheral chondrocytes and in cells of the fibrous perichondrium that ensheaths the skeleton. Using pulse-chase label retention experiments and multiplexed in situ hybridization, we identify a population of cycling <italic>Sox5/6/9</italic>+ perichondral progenitor cells that generate new cartilage during adult growth, and we show that persistence of chondrogenesis in adult skates correlates with ability to spontaneously repair cartilage injuries. Skates therefore offer a unique model for adult chondrogenesis and cartilage repair and may serve as inspiration for novel cell-based therapies for skeletal pathologies, such as osteoarthritis.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>For our joints to move around freely, they are lubricated with cartilage. In growing mammals, this tissue is continuously made by the body. But, by adulthood, this cartilage will have been almost entirely replaced by bone. It is also difficult for adult bodies to replenish what cartilage does remain – such as that in the joints.</p><p>When growing new cartilage, the body uses so-called progenitor cells, which have the ability to turn into different cell types. Progenitor cells are recruited to the joints, where they transform into cartilage cells called chondrocytes, which generate new cartilage. But adults lack these progenitor cells, leaving them unfit to heal damaged cartilage after injury or diseases like osteoarthritis.</p><p>In contrast, certain groups of fishes, such as skates, sharks and rays, produce cartilage throughout their life — indeed their whole skeleton is made of cartilage. So, what is the difference between these cartilaginous fishes and mammals? Why can they generate cartilage throughout their lives, while humans are unable to? And does this mean that these adult fish are better at healing injured cartilage?</p><p>Marconi et al. used skates (<italic>Leucoraja erinacea</italic>) to study how cartilage develops, grows and heals in a cartilaginous fish. Progenitor cells were found in a layer that wraps around the cartilage skeleton (called the perichondrium). These cells were also shown to activate genes that control cartilage development. By labelling these progenitor cells, their presence and movements could be tracked around the fish. Marconi et al. found progenitor cells in adult skates that were able to generate chondrocytes. Skates were also shown to spontaneously repair damaged cartilage in experiments where cartilage was injured.</p><p>Marconi et al. have identified the skate as a new animal model for studying cartilage growth and repair. Studying the mechanisms that skate progenitor cells use for generating cartilage could lead to improvements in current therapies used for repairing cartilage in the joints.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>skate</kwd><kwd><italic>Leucoraja erinacea</italic></kwd><kwd>cartilage</kwd><kwd>skeleton</kwd><kwd>regeneration</kwd><kwd>progenitor</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>102175/Z/13/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Marconi</surname><given-names>Aleksandra</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000288</institution-id><institution>Royal Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>UF130182</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gillis</surname><given-names>J Andrew</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000288</institution-id><institution>Royal Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>URF/R/191007</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gillis</surname><given-names>J Andrew</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000288</institution-id><institution>Royal Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RGF\EA\180087</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gillis</surname><given-names>J Andrew</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004815</institution-id><institution>Isaac Newton Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>14.23z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gillis</surname><given-names>J Andrew</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000616</institution-id><institution>Fisheries Society of the British Isles</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Research Grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gillis</surname><given-names>J Andrew</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The ability of cartilaginous fishes to generate new cartilage through adulthood, and to spontaneously repair damaged cartilage, could shed light on novel cell-based therapies for cartilage injury in mammals.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Hyaline cartilage is a skeletal tissue that consists of a single cell type (the chondrocyte) embedded within a homogeneous, collagenous extracellular matrix (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gillis, 2018</xref>). In mammals, hyaline cartilage is predominantly an embryonic tissue, making up the anlage of the axial (chondrocranial, vertebral and rib) and appendicular (limb) endoskeleton. The vast majority of mammalian hyaline cartilage is replaced by bone during the process of endochondral ossification, with cartilage persisting temporarily in epiphyseal growth plates, and permanently at relatively few sites within the adult skeleton (e.g. in joints, as articular cartilage – <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Decker, 2017</xref>). In juvenile mammals, growth of articular cartilage occurs by cellular rearrangement and increases in chondrocyte volume (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Decker et al., 2017</xref>), and by appositional recruitment of new chondrocytes from a superficial population of slow-cycling chondroprogenitor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hayes et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Dowthwaite et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Karlsson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Williams et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kozhemyakina et al., 2015</xref>). However, evidence for the presence of chondroprogenitor cells in adult articular cartilage is scant, and this – combined with the avascular nature of the tissue – may account for why mammalian articular cartilage cannot heal spontaneously following injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hunziker, 1999</xref>).</p><p>Chondrichthyans (cartilaginous fishes – sharks, skates, rays and holocephalans), on the other hand, possess an endoskeleton that is composed largely of hyaline cartilage, and that remains cartilaginous throughout life. Though chondrichthyans reinforce their endoskeleton with a superficial layer of calcified cartilage (in the form of small mineralized plates called ‘tesserae’ – <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dean and Summers, 2006</xref>), the core of their endoskeletal elements persists as hyaline cartilage and does not undergo endochondral ossification. Like many fishes (and unlike mammals), chondrichthyans also exhibit an indeterminate type of growth, with a continued (albeit slow) increase in size through adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Dutta, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">McDowall, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Frisk and Miller, 2006</xref>). It therefore stands to reason that, in chondrichthyans, skeletal tissues may possess a persistent pool of chondroprogenitor cells to facilitate continued growth of their cartilaginous endoskeleton throughout adulthood, and that such cells (if present) could also impart the endoskeleton with an ability to undergo spontaneous repair following injury. However, basic mechanisms of hyaline cartilage development, growth and repair in chondrichthyans remain largely unexplored.</p><p>Here, we characterize the development and growth of the cartilaginous endoskeleton of a chondrichthyan, the little skate (<italic>Leucoraja erinacea</italic>), from embryonic development to adulthood. We demonstrate conservation of fundamental cellular and molecular characteristics of cartilage development between chondrichthyans and mammals, and we identify unique features of adult skate cartilage that contribute to its continued growth through adulthood. We further show that skates can repair surgically induced partial-thickness cartilage injuries, highlighting this system as a unique animal model for adult chondrogenesis and spontaneous hyaline cartilage repair.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The metapterygium of the skate, <italic>Leucoraja erinacea</italic></title><p>The pectoral fin endoskeleton of jawed vertebrates consisted ancestrally of three basal cartilages – from anterior to posterior, the propterygium, mesopterygium and metapterygium – and a series of articulating distal radials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Davis et al., 2004</xref>). Among extant jawed vertebrates, this ancestral ‘tribasal’ condition has been retained in the pectoral fins of chondrichthyans and non-teleost ray-finned fishes (e.g. in sturgeon, gar and bichir), but has been reduced in tetrapods and teleosts, to include only derivatives of the metapterygial and pro-/mesopterygial components, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Davis, 2013</xref>).

Briefly, hatchling skates were given a single intraperitoneal microinjection of EdU, and were then harvested at 1-, 5-, 10- and 40 days post-injection (hereafter referred to as 1-, 5-, 10- and 40 day chase, respectively), to test for label retention within the metapterygium. In animals analyzed at 1 day chase, EdU+ chondrocytes were recovered throughout the cartilage of the metapterygium, though with a concentration of EdU+ cells around the periphery of the element (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>), pointing to the continued proliferation of differentiated chondrocytes at hatching. We also observed EdU+ cells within the perichondrium of the metapterygium at 1 day chase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>).

This pattern of label retention (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4f</xref>) is suggestive of an expanding or self-renewing cell population within the perichondrium, with a greater number of label-retaining cells arising through proliferation of EdU+ progenitors but reduction in the number of label-retaining cells with eventual dilution of EdU to undetectable levels. In animals analyzed at 10- (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4g</xref>) and 40 days chase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4h</xref>), we observed numerous clusters of EdU+ chondrocytes in cartilage immediately adjacent to EdU+ perichondral cells. As cells of the inner perichondrium are known to give rise to new chondrocytes in the cartilaginous anlage of the chick limb skeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Scott-Savage and Hall, 1979</xref>), we speculate that these subperichondral EdU+ chondrocytes are the progeny of label-retaining perichondral cells, and that growth of the hatchling metapterygium occurs both through proliferation of differentiated chondrocytes, and by recruitment of new chondrocytes from progenitor cells within the perichondrium.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Proliferation of chondrocytes and recruitment of new chondrocytes from putative perichondral progenitors in skate hatchlings.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Transverse sections through the metapterygium of skate hatchlings reveals a concentration of label-retaining (EdU+) cells around the periphery of the element, both in the cartilage and in the perichondrium, as well as sparse label-retaining cells in the center of the metapterygium.

Label-retention experiments indicate that cells cycle in both the outer and inner perichondrium (possibly with the former giving rise to the latter, along with self-renewal), and that cells of perichondral origin give rise to new chondrocytes. In appositional growth, chondrocyte progeny of perichondral progenitors resides in peripheral hyaline cartilage (or, occasionally, become incorporated into growing tesserae).

In our pulse-chase label retention experiments, EdU+ cells are only recovered in the perichondrium after a pulse + 3 day chase (with the exception of a single label-retaining cell in a cartilage canal), with no label-retention in differentiated chondrocytes. However, we observe a striking increase in label-retaining cells within cartilage canals and core cartilage after pulse + 1–5.5 month chases, including a small number of chondrocytes in the centre of the metapterygium cartilage core, immediately adjacent to cartilage canals. Given the initial distribution of label retaining cells after the 3 day chase, we speculate that these core chondrocytes derive from label-retaining progenitors in the perichondrium and were transported to the cartilaginous core of the metapterygium via cartilage canals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). However, skate cartilage canals also contain red blood cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4h</xref>), which suggests that these structures may serve to vascularise the adult cartilaginous endoskeleton. If this is the case, then such vasculature could serve to transport cartilage progenitor or mesenchymal stem cell-like cells, from niches elsewhere in body, to the core cartilage of the metapterygium.</p><p>Cartilage canals that extend from the perichondrium into the core of endoskeletal elements have been shown to occur in the vertebrae, jaws and pectoral girdles of sharks and rays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hoenig and Walsh, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dean et al., 2010</xref>).

A comparative analysis of the mechanical properties of normal and repair cartilage remains to be conducted, though the ECM of skate repair cartilage is composed of type II collagen and appears to integrate seamlessly with adjacent tissue, and cells within repair cartilage appear indistinguishable from adjacent chondrocytes. While it is not currently possible to precisely trace the cell lineage of repair cartilage within our injury paradigm, the demonstrated chondrogenic potential of the adult skate perichondrium during normal growth, as well as our observation that mechanical perturbation of the surface of the metapterygium is sufficient to induce a large mass of ectopic cartilage beneath the perichondrium, points to the perichondrium as the most likely source of repair cartilage following injury.</p><p>Our findings stand in contrast with previous work in the dogfish (<italic>Scyliorhinus spp.</italic>), which determined that the cartilaginous skeleton of sharks could not heal following injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ashhurst, 2004</xref>). This was based on a design in which cartilaginous fin radials were bisected and monitored for repair over 26 weeks. It was observed that cut surfaces of dogfish fin rays were initially capped by a fibrous tissue, with subsequent appearance near the injury site of a disorganized, cartilage-like tissue that failed to integrate with existing ray cartilage or to unite the bisected elements. Importantly, the cartilage injury in that study (i.e. complete bisection) was severe, and may have posed an insurmountable barrier to repair, even for a tissue with local progenitors and repair potential (i.e. it is possible that the repair response that we report in skate requires some scaffold of normal cartilage as a foundation for repair). Additionally, fin rays are relatively small, and therefore may exhibit different growth properties relative to larger elements of the endoskeleton. Additional studies of repair potential across the range of skeletal elements and tissue types in cartilaginous fishes are needed to determine whether cartilage repair is a general feature of the skeleton, or a unique property of specific skeletal elements.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Skate as a model for adult chondrogenesis and cartilage repair</title><p>Osteoarthritis (OA) is a debilitating deterioration of joint cartilage with symptoms ranging from stiffness and joint pain to complete immobility.

However, the ability of this tissue to give rise to cartilage as a terminal product – rather than cartilage as an intermediate step toward endochondral bone – is significant and could be exploited to further our understanding of the molecular basis of stable and reliable adult chondrogenesis in vitro and in vivo. Further characterization of the transcriptional fingerprint of cell types within the skate perichondrium, and the gene regulatory basis skate chondrocytes differentiation during growth and repair, could provide a rich source of information on how MSCs and/or iPSCs could be edited or manipulated to enhance their efficacy in mammalian articular cartilage repair.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals, euthanasia and fixation</title><p><italic>Leucoraja erinacea</italic> adults and embryos were maintained in large rectangular tanks or seatables, respectively, in flow-through natural seawater at a constant temperature of 15°C at the Marine Resources Center of the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, MA, U.S.A.

Anaesthetized animals were given a pre-operative analgesic (0.25 mg butorphanol by intramuscular injection) and then moved from the anesthesia bath to an operating table, where their gills were perfused with anesthetic seawater for the duration of the procedure (~5 min). A small (~2 cm) surgical incision was made through the dorsal surface of the fin,~3 cm from the base of the metapterygium, and a wedge of cartilage was removed from the metapterygium using a 4 mm biopsy punch. Following biopsy, the incision was sutured, animals were given a postoperative dose of antibiotic (15 mg ceftazidime by intramuscular injection) and then recovered in aerated seawater until fully awake before returning to their holding tank. No animals died as a result of the procedure. Two animals were collected one-week post-operation, and then at monthly intervals for the following year.

The manuscript reports findings of great importance, including the conservation of cartilage formation and growth, from chondrichthyan fishes to mammals – an important connection for biomedical inference. Because these animals display constitutive growth, cartilage development is likely a perpetual event, providing a unique opportunity to study how cartilage can be repaired after damage, highlighting the need for models that can offer insights into how vertebrates can regenerate important skeletal tissues.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>In order for this manuscript to be considered further, the following points need to be addressed fully:</p><p>1) The authors need to provide phylogenetic evidence supporting either homology or orthology for the probes used to detect <italic>Col2a1</italic>, <italic>Sox9</italic>, <italic>Sox5</italic>, and <italic>Sox6</italic>. As presented now, all we know about these probes is that they were purchased from Molecular Instruments (subsection “mRNA in situ hybridization”). Sequences for the probes used, as well as an appropriate phylogenetic analysis, are requisite in order to ascertain both identity and specificity.</p><p>2) The authors speculate that &quot;…these core chondrocytes derive from label-retaining progenitors in the perichondrium and were transported&quot;. While this is a reasonable assessment, insufficient data is provided to resolve this matter unambiguously. Therefore, the authors should either provide alternative explanations for the origin of the circulating cells, or better justify/support why they consider only the perichondrium as a source of these cells.</p><p>3) Along the same lines, the authors should modify their Abstract, in which they write: &quot;perichondral progenitor cells that generate new cartilage during adult growth&quot;. This statement is not strictly demonstrated by the data presented.</p><p>4) Why did the authors not compare the retention of EdU in hatchling skates compared to adults? We understand the need to show this in the adult, but as this is a continuation of the 'developmental process' we should, therefore, have a comparative baseline of cartilage development and retention of the label. It seems there is a disconnect between the discussion of embryonic/hatchling tissue and then adult. This would permit disentangling the relationship between true development and adult growth (or prolonged development).</p><p>5) Similarly, and probably less important, there is no comparison of spontaneous damage repair in embryonic tissues. How does repair differ between embryos and adults? Would the overall mechanisms be similar? And therefore, is the repair during the growth/extended development observed in adults similar to repair during the development of the structures? If the authors have this data please consider its inclusion. Alternatively, the authors could provide some extended discussion of this omission instead.</p><p>6) Discussion. The connection between this work and studies in Osteoarthritis is intriguing, and absolutely worth a mention for the translational potential here; however, is the entire discussion on OA absolutely necessary? If the association between skate chondrogenesis and OA is not clearly presented at the start of this Discussion section, then the 'review' of OA in human patients loses the relevance of the skate affiliation. A clearly defined translational implication should be stated and this section should be kept brief to avoid the risk of overselling the implications of the work, which is in its infancy here and has no direct relationship to OA.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.53414.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>In order for this manuscript to be considered further, the following points need to be addressed fully:</p><p>1) The authors need to provide phylogenetic evidence supporting either homology or orthology for the probes used to detect Col2a1, Sox9, Sox5, and Sox6. As presented now, all we know about these probes is that they were purchased from Molecular Instruments (subsection “mRNA in situ hybridization”). Sequences for the probes used, as well as an appropriate phylogenetic analysis, are requisite in order to ascertain both identity and specificity.</p></disp-quote><p>We now include a complete phylogenetic analysis of our skate <italic>Col2a1</italic>, <italic>Agc</italic>, <italic>Sox9</italic> and <italic>Sox6</italic> sequences, with new text in the Materials and methods section describing the analysis (subsection “mRNA in situ hybridization and phylogenetic analysis”), and the resulting phylogenetic trees as new supplements to Figure 3 (Figure 3—figure supplements 1-4). These analyses fully support the orthology of our sequences. For <italic>Sox5</italic>, our sequence falls entirely within the 3’ UTR, so a phylogenetic analysis of coding sequence was not possible. However, we are nevertheless confident with the orthology of this sequence based on the very low BLAST scores (0 to 7e<sup>-70</sup>) for this sequence against other 3’ UTR sequences of predicted <italic>Sox5</italic> transcripts from other chondrichthyan genomes.</p><p>Molecular Instruments does not give us the sequences of the probes that they design for each target, as probes are designed using a proprietary algorithm. However, MI does test probe sequences against the skate genome to ensure that there is no off-target binding. Additionally, we have now included probe lot numbers in the Materials and methods section, so that others can purchase the exact probes that we used, should they wish to repeat this analysis.</p><p>Finally, we have now obtained and included GenBank accession numbers for all of the sequences used in our paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors speculate that &quot;…these core chondrocytes derive from label-retaining progenitors in the perichondrium and were transported&quot;. While this is a reasonable assessment, insufficient data is provided to resolve this matter unambiguously. Therefore, the authors should either provide alternative explanations for the origin of the circulating cells, or better justify/support why they consider only the perichondrium as a source of these cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with this comment, and we have adjusted the text accordingly. We speculate that the new core chondrocytes arise from perichondral progenitors, given that these progenitors clearly give rise to peripheral chondrocytes, and that the cartilage canals containing these pre-chondrocytes originate in the perichondrium. However, we also note in the text that skate cartilage canals contain red blood cells – and so, if skate cartilage is vascularized, it is absolutely possible that cartilage progenitors could be transported to the core of the metapterygium from elsewhere in the body. We have therefore added new text to the Discussion (subsection “Adult chondroprogenitor cells contribute to post-embryonic growth of cartilage in the skate”) to clarify this point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Along the same lines, the authors should modify their Abstract, in which they write: &quot;perichondral progenitor cells that generate new cartilage during adult growth&quot;. This statement is not strictly demonstrated by the data presented.</p></disp-quote><p>As with the previous point, we agree that we cannot say conclusively that perichondral progenitor cells give rise to the new chondrocytes that form in the core of the metapterygium adjacent to the blind end of cartilage canals. However, the vast majority of new (i.e. label-retaining) chondrocytes that we observe at 5.5 months are found in the periphery (i.e. in the hyaline cartilage of the intertesseral joint region). These cells sit adjacent to the perichondrium (and not in close proximity to cartilage canals or any other vasculature), and so it seems to us that the label-retaining cells of the perichondrium that we observe at the 1-day and 1-month chase time points are the only plausible source of these new chondrocytes. In our opinion, this is the most significant finding of the paper, and we believe that it is quite well supported by our data – so we would therefore like to keep this line in the Abstract (if the reviewing editor and reviewers agree?).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Why did the authors not compare the retention of EdU in hatchling skates compared to adults? We understand the need to show this in the adult, but as this is a continuation of the 'developmental process' we should, therefore, have a comparative baseline of cartilage development and retention of the label. It seems there is a disconnect between the discussion of embryonic/hatchling tissue and then adult. This would permit disentangling the relationship between true development and adult growth (or prolonged development).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this great suggestion. We actually did perform a label retention experiment with skate hatchlings during one of our past field seasons in Woods Hole, and we intended to use this experiment as part of a different study. However, we agree that it could be very informative here, and so we have carried out a series of new analyses (and prepared a new Figure 4), which we present in the Results subsection “Proliferation of chondrocytes and putative perichondral progenitor cells in the metapterygium of skate hatchlings”. We are really excited about these findings, as we think that they add a very nice dataset to the study.</p><p>Briefly: we conducted EdU pulse chase experiments by giving skate hatchlings an intraperitoneal microinjection of ~100µg EdU, and then harvesting at 1-, 5-, 10- and 40-days post injection. At 1dpi, we find EdU retention both within the chondrocytes of the metapterygium, and within the perichondrium. We quantified label-retaining cells within the perichondrium and found a striking increase in the number of EdU+ perichondral cells from 1 to 10 dpi, but then a decrease at 40dpi. We take this as an indication that perichondral cells are proliferating as the metapterygium grows, resulting in an increase in the number of EdU+ cells, until the EdU is eventually diluted beyond the limits of detectability (accounting for the decrease in EdU+ cells at 40dpi). We also observe clusters of EdU+ chondrocytes immediately beneath EdU+ perichondral cells at 10 and 40dpi, and we propose that these new chondrocytes are therefore likely of perichondral origin. Finally, we repeated our multiplexed ISH experiment with sections of metapterygium from skate hatchlings, and (as in adult skates) we observe flattened perichondral cells at the perichondral-cartilage interface, which co-express <italic>Sox9</italic>, <italic>Sox5</italic> and <italic>Sox6</italic> (but not <italic>Col2a1</italic>). We speculate that these are the same perichondral progenitor cells that we have identified through label retention and HCR in the adult skate metapterygium. So, overall, it appears as though hatchling skate cartilage grows both through continued proliferation of differentiated chondrocytes, and through recruitment of new chondrocytes from perichondral progenitor cells – but that by adulthood, new chondrocytes arise only from perichondral progenitors.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Similarly, and probably less important, there is no comparison of spontaneous damage repair in embryonic tissues. How does repair differ between embryos and adults? Would the overall mechanisms be similar? And therefore, is the repair during the growth/extended development observed in adults similar to repair during the development of the structures? If the authors have this data please consider its inclusion. Alternatively, the authors could provide some extended discussion of this omission instead.</p></disp-quote><p>I am afraid we do not have these data and cannot generate them in a timely manner (as it stands now, our summer 2020 Woods Hole field season has been cancelled due to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic). The overall aim of our paper was to investigate whether/how cartilage in skates undergoes continued post-embryonic growth and repair, as the persistence of a cartilaginous endoskeleton throughout life is really what sets chondrichthyans apart from other jawed vertebrates. While it would be interesting to look at mechanisms of skeletal repair in embryos, we would not be surprised if such repair occurred (as even many bony vertebrate taxa can repair damage to embryonic or early juvenile cartilaginous structures). In our opinion, the most exciting products of this study are the demonstrations of chondrogenesis and repair in adult animals. However, we hope that our inclusion of new data on cell proliferation and gene expression within the hatchling metapterygium will go some way toward addressing the reviewer’s questions about mechanisms of cartilage growth in younger animals (though we fully acknowledge that it doesn’t shed light on mechanisms of repair at earlier life stages).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Discussion. The connection between this work and studies in Osteoarthritis is intriguing, and absolutely worth a mention for the translational potential here; however, is the entire discussion on OA absolutely necessary? If the association between skate chondrogenesis and OA is not clearly presented at the start of this Discussion section, then the 'review' of OA in human patients loses the relevance of the skate affiliation. A clearly defined translational implication should be stated and this section should be kept brief to avoid the risk of overselling the implications of the work, which is in its infancy here and has no direct relationship to OA.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s point here, and we have cut this section down by ~1/3. We now have two paragraphs in this subsection of the Discussion: one outlining current challenge around the treatment of OA, and one about how novel animals models of adult chondrogenesis and cartilage repair could shed light on new therapeutic strategies. We have also updated the reference list to remove some of the references cited in the original version of this subsection. We feel that this streamlined subsection is much better than that original version, so we thank the reviewer for picking up on this.</p></body></sub-article></article>
