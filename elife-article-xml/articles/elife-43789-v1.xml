Represented by a right wing, <italic>Alcmonavis</italic> shows several derived characters, including a pronounced attachment for the pectoralis muscle, a pronounced tuberculum bicipitale radii, and a robust second manual digit, indicating that it is a more derived avialan than <italic>Archaeopteryx</italic>. Several modifications, especially in muscle attachments of muscles that in modern birds are related to the downstroke of the wing, indicate an increased adaptation of the forelimb for active flapping flight in the early evolution of birds.

Birds are the only living descendants of dinosaurs and, for paleontologists, the famous <italic>Archaeopteryx</italic> has played a pivotal role in this discussion. Living during the Jurassic period about 150 million years ago in what is now southern Germany, <italic>Archaeopteryx</italic> is generally accepted as the oldest known flying bird. Yet, with the discovery of other bird-like dinosaurs from the same period, a question has arisen as to whether <italic>Archaeopteryx</italic> is the only flying bird from the Jurassic.</p><p>To answer this question, Rauhut et al. carefully examined a fossil of an isolated wing skeleton that was recently discovered in the same region of Germany where <italic>Archaeopteryx</italic> was found. The new specimen shows several characteristics that are otherwise only found in modern birds and not seen in <italic>Archaeopteryx</italic>. As such, this fossil represents a new species and the most bird-like bird discovered from the Jurassic. Rauhut et al. named the species <italic>Alcmonavis poeschli</italic>, after the ancient name for a river that flows near the discovery site, the Greek word for bird, and Roland Pöschl – the collector who found the specimen.</p><p>The wing of <italic>Alcmonavis</italic> also shows several features related to the attachment of flight muscles that suggest it was better adapted for flapping flight than <italic>Archaeopteryx</italic>. Together these findings are mostly consistent with the hypothesis that birds first started flying by flapping their wings rather than starting from a gliding stage. However, more detailed studies of the anatomy of primitive birds and their close relatives are needed to further test this hypothesis.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Late Jurassic</kwd><kwd>bird evolution</kwd><kwd>flight</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001663</institution-id><institution>Volkswagen Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>I/84 640</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rauhut</surname><given-names>Oliver WM</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PZ00P2_174040</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Foth</surname><given-names>Christian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A new taxon from the Late Jurassic of southern Germany represents the second volant bird known from that time period and documents the improvement of flapping flight in bird evolution.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The so-called ‘Solnhofen limestones’ of southern Germany have long been known for their exceptionally preserved fossils (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arratia et al., 2015</xref>). Historically, most fossils reported from these rocks come from the Altmühltal Formation (sensu <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Niebuhr and Pürner, 2014</xref>; see that publication for a clarification of the confusing history of naming the Late Jurassic limestone units of the Franconian Alb), as these were subject to intensive quarrying for several commercial purposes, from construction to lithography, probably since Roman times (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Neumeyer, 2015</xref>). However, fossils have been known from the underlying Torleite and the overlying Mörnsheim formations for a long time (see e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Tischlinger, 2001</xref>), and more recent work in these units has shown that they are, at least at some localities, actually more fossiliferous than the Altmühltal Formation (see e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Viohl and Zapp, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Heyng et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Heyng et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Albersdörfer and Häckel, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Viohl, 2015</xref>).</p><p>Arguably the historically most important fossil taxon from the ‘Solnhofen limestones’ is the famous 'urvogel' <italic>Archaeopteryx</italic>, which has played a crucial role in the debate about the origin of birds (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Huxley, 1868</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Heilmann, 1926</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Ostrom, 1976a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib123">Wellnhofer, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Wellnhofer, 2009</xref>). This taxon is so far only known from the lower Tithonian of Bavaria, Germany, with the vast majority of specimens (nine out of eleven) being derived from the Altmühltal Formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Rauhut et al., 2018</xref>). Only one specimen (the 12<sup>th</sup> specimen; see comments on numbering of specimens below) comes from the Kimmeridgian/Tithonian boundary in the lowermost part of the Painten Formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Rauhut et al., 2018</xref>), and a single, fragmentary skeleton was reported from the Mörnsheim Formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), which overlies the Altmühltal Formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Mäuser, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Tischlinger, 2009</xref>), and was recently made the type of a new species of this genus, <italic>Archaeopteryx albersdoerferi</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Kundrát et al., 2019</xref>). In total, the genus <italic>Archaeopteryx</italic> seems to span some 700,000 to one million years, and notable variation between the different specimens might indicate evolutionary changes over this time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Rauhut et al., 2018</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43789.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Geographic and stratigraphic provenance of the new avialan specimen.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Map of the southern Franconian Alb with the palaeogeographic settings indicated and showing the localities of theropod specimens from the Solnhofen Archipelago (modified from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Foth and Rauhut, 2017</xref>).

However, the discovery of a diverse fauna of paravian theropods from slightly older rocks in China in the last decades (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Godefroit et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Godefroit et al., 2013b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Sullivan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib129">Xu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Lefèvre et al., 2017</xref>), and the identification of the ‘Haarlem specimen of <italic>Archaeopteryx</italic>’ as a separate taxon, <italic>Ostromia crassipes</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">von Meyer, 1857</xref>), representing a different clade of paravians, the Anchiornithidae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Foth and Rauhut, 2017</xref>), highlight the complexity of paravian evolution, diversity and distribution in the Late Jurassic, and make a careful re-evaluation of all maniraptoran specimens from the Late Jurassic plattenkalks of southern Germany necessary.</p><p>Here we report on a new paravian specimen from the Lower Tithonian Mörnsheim Formation, representing the second theropod specimen from this unit, which overlies the Altmühltal Formation. The new specimen represents the largest avialan theropod yet recorded from the Jurassic and provides further evidence on the forelimb anatomy and the origin of flapping flight in basal avialans.</p><sec id="s1-1"><title>Geological and palaeontological context</title><p>The Mörnsheim Formation is a unit of the southern German Weißjura Group, a package of mainly calcareous marine sediments that is widely distributed in Bavaria and Baden-Württemberg. In the southern Franconian Alp in Bavaria, the Weißjura Group in the region between Weißenburg and Regensburg is famous for often laminated, very fine-grained limestones of late Kimmeridgian to early Tithonian age, often collectively called ‘Solnhofen limestones’, and the fossils from these rocks are accordingly referred to as ‘Solnhofen fossils’. A large number of often local or regional names have been proposed for the different units that make up the ‘Solnhofen limestones’, but a recent overview of the lithostratigraphy of the area helped to clarify the nomenclature and correlations of the formations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Niebuhr and Pürner, 2014</xref>). Thus, the ‘Solnhofen limestones’ sensu stricto are now included in the Altmühltal Formation and restricted to the area northwest of Ingolstadt, whereas more eastern occurrences of contemporaneous plattenkalks are included in the Painten Formation. Both of these formations underly the Mörnsheim Formation. Biostratigraphic dating with the help of ammonites has furthermore shown that the Altmühltal Formation spans from the uppermost horizon of the <italic>Beckeri</italic> zone of the latest Kimmeridgian over five ammonite horizons to the <italic>rueppelianus</italic> horizon of the <italic>Hybonotum</italic> zone of the Early Tithonian, and that the lithographic limestones within this formation in the areas of Solnhofen and Eichstätt are not synchronous, but the Eichstätt Member is somewhat older (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Schweigert, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Schweigert, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Niebuhr and Pürner, 2014</xref>). Furthermore, in more eastern areas, important vertebrate fossils have also been found in the upper part of the Torleite Formation, which underlies the Painten Formation. In the light of this geological and stratigraphic complexity, the traditional habit to talk about all the fossils from these diverse units as the ‘fauna of the Solnhofen limestones’ has been abandoned in favour of the expression ‘fauna of the Solnhofen Archipelago’ in recent years, to distinguish the regional palaeoecological setting from the concrete geological unit that the different fossils are derived from (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Röper, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">López-Arbarello and Schröder, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Rauhut et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>The Mörnsheim Formation has its best outcrops in the areas between Mörnsheim, Solnhofen, Monheim, and Daiting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Lithologically, the Mörnsheim Formation differs from the Altmühltal Formation in the considerably higher amount of silicified limestones (‘Kieselplattenkalke’), especially in its lower part. Biostratigraphically, this unit represents the uppermost horizon of the <italic>Hybonotum</italic> zone, the <italic>moernsheimensis</italic> horizon, and is thus slightly younger than the Upper Solnhofen Member of the Altmühltal Formation. Fossils have been known for a long time from the Mörnsheim Formation, mainly from the locality of Daiting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Tischlinger, 2001</xref>), but the fauna of this formation has only partially been explored so far, mainly due to the fact that this formation has not been quarried extensively.</p><p>The specimen described here comes from the Schaudiberg, near Mühlheim, close to Mörnsheim (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Two quarries are currently exposed at the Schaudiberg, both owned by the Grundstücksgemeinschaft Pöschl/Leonhardt, a public quarry for fossil collectors, and the Old Schöpfel Quarry, which is being systematically excavated for fossils (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Heyng et al., 2015</xref>). The lower part of the Mörnsheim Formation has a total thickness of approximately 50 m at the Schaudiberg, but only parts of this are exposed in the two quarries. Some 8 m of the lowermost Mörnsheim Formation are exposed in the Old Schöpfel Quarry, with the boundary to the underlying Altmühltal Formation at the base of the section being currently covered. Thus, the currently exposed section starts some 4 m above this boundary with silicified laminated limestones and intercalated thick layers of massive limestones and silicified limestones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Heyng et al., 2015</xref>). In the higher part of the profile and the visitors quarry, the section becomes more dominated by laminated limestones and intercalations of laminated marly limestones and clays. The new urvogel specimen comes from a thin marly intercalation within the lowermost 2.5 m of the section in the Old Schöpfel Quarry. It was found in 2017 by Roland Pöschl, who leads the systematic excavations in this quarry. The Mörnsheim Formation at the Schaudiberg is very fossiliferous, with the most common fossils being strongly compressed ammonites, and a rich invertebrate and vertebrate fauna is present, but remains largely unstudied so far. In contrast to the underlying Altmühltal Formation, most vertebrate fossils in the Mörnsheim Formation are at least partially disarticulated and often fragmentary. In the Schaudiberg quarries, fishes are represented by chondrichthyans, including well-preserved specimens of <italic>Asteracanthus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Pfeil, 2011</xref>), actinopterygians (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Schröder and López-Arbarello, 2013</xref>), and mainly isolated remains of coelacanths. Tetrapods are represented by unstudied turtles, rhynchocephalians, marine crocodiles, and pterosaurs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Heyng et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Heyng et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Rauhut et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Rauhut et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Moser and Rauhut, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Rauhut, 2012</xref>), with the only formally studied taxon being the unusual rhynchocephalian <italic>Oenosaurus muehlheimensis</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Rauhut et al., 2012</xref>, so far. As noted above, the only theropod specimen reported from the Mörnsheim Formation so far is the fragmentary holotype of <italic>Archaeopteryx albersdoerferi</italic>, which comes from the outcrop area of Daiting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Tischlinger, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Kundrát et al., 2019</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s1-2"><title>Comments on the numbering and naming of avialan specimens from the Solnhofen Archipelago</title><p>Traditionally, the different specimens found in the Kimmeridgian-Tithonian limestones of Bavaria have been numbered according to the time they were first described as <italic>Archaeopteryx</italic> (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib123">Wellnhofer, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Wellnhofer, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Rauhut and Tischlinger, 2015</xref>). Thus, the London specimen is usually called the first skeletal specimen, the Berlin specimen the second and so on. Accordingly, more recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Foth et al., 2014</xref> described a new specimen that is hitherto simply known as the 11<sup>th</sup> specimen, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Rauhut et al., 2018</xref> described the 12<sup>th</sup> specimen. However, the story becomes more complicated if one accepts that some specimens might actually not belong to the genus <italic>Archaeopteryx</italic>, such as the Solnhofen specimen, which was argued to represent a distinct genus, <italic>Wellnhoferia</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Elzanowski, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Elzanowski, 2002</xref>; though see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Mayr et al., 2007</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib123">Wellnhofer, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Wellnhofer, 2009</xref>), or the Haarlem specimen, which was recently referred to a distinct genus of anchiornithids, <italic>Ostromia</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Foth and Rauhut, 2017</xref>). Thus, in this case, theoretically, the numbering of <italic>Archaeopteryx</italic> specimens would need to be revised, with the 11<sup>th</sup> specimen becoming the 10<sup>th</sup> specimen and so forth. However, we propose to retain the original numbering of specimens, even if one accepts the different generic assignments, in order to avoid confusion between the recent and older literature. Given the gradual assembly of the avialan body plan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brusatte et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cau et al., 2015</xref>) and the general similarity of the basalmost members of this clade, it might be justified to simply talk about 'urvogel specimens' instead of using the generic name <italic>Archaeopteryx</italic>, to thus accommodate the taxonomic uncertainty. Accordingly, the specimen described here should be regarded as the 13<sup>th</sup> urvogel specimen from the Solnhofen Archipelago.</p><p>Apart from the numbers, most specimens also have informal, but widely used names, usually based on their repository (‘London specimen’, ‘Berlin specimen’, ‘Eichstätt specimen’, etc.). In contrast to many other fossil taxa, it is these names, often in combination with the numbering outlined above, rather than specimen numbers that are usually used to identify the different specimens of <italic>Archaeopteryx</italic> and possible other basal avialans from the Kimmeridgian/Tithonian of Bavaria, even in the technical scientific literature (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Elzanowski, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Mayr et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib123">Wellnhofer, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Wellnhofer, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Rauhut et al., 2018</xref>). Unfortunately, however, the most recently described specimens have so far only been identified by their numbers, and no names have been proposed. Thus, in order to facilitate communication about the specimens, we here propose the following names for specimens 11 to 13:</p><p>11<sup>th</sup> specimen: This specimen represents an almost complete postcranial skeleton and parts of the skull of <italic>Archaeopteryx</italic>, preserved in articulation and with exceptionally detailed feather impressions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Foth et al., 2014</xref>). The specimen most probably comes from Upper Eichstätt Member of the Altmühltal Formation of the Schernfeld/Blumenberg area, close to Eichstätt (M. Röper, pers. com. to OR, 05.2018) and is currently on exhibition at the Museum Solnhofen. However, as neither the exact provenance nor the final repository of this specimen are certain by now, we propose to refer to it as the ‘Altmühl specimen’, referring to both its general area of provenance close to the Altmühl river and the geological unit it is derived from.</p><p>12<sup>th</sup> specimen: This specimen is an almost complete, although partially poorly preserved, largely articulated skeleton of <italic>Archaeopteryx</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Rauhut et al., 2018</xref>). It comes from the lowermost parts of the Painten Formation of the Gerstner Quarry in Schamhaupten and is currently on exhibition at the Dinosaurierpark Altmühltal in Denkendorf.

The manus is disarticulated from the radius and ulna and the metacarpus overlies the distal ulna.

Leonhardt, pers. com. to OR, 10.2017) and the proximal shaft of the radius is partially reconstructed. The bone preservation is generally rather poor, with all longbones being compressed, collapsing the shafts, and fractured, and the entepicondyle of the humerus is largely lost, as is the distal end of metacarpal I. However, the phosphatized remains of the original keratinous sheath of the unguals are rather nicely preserved, as it is often the case in theropod specimens from the Late Jurassic plattenkalks of southern Germany.</p></sec><sec id="s1-4-2"><title>Humerus</title><p>The right humerus is exposed in anteromedial view (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). As noted above, the bone is missing its proximal end, so its exact length cannot be established (the apparent outline of the bone in the sediment is an artefact of preparation, as the outline has been sculpted in the matrix used to fill the crack). However, the medial edge preserves the distal end of the internal tuberosity, indicating that only a small portion of the proximal end is missing, so that the complete length can be estimated to be approximately 90 mm (±2.5 mm; length as preserved: 81.4 mm). As in all maniraptoran theropods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Rauhut, 2003</xref>), the internal tuberosity was obviously proximodistally elongate and rectangular in outline, with approximately its distal third being preserved. Distally, it fades into the relatively sharp medial edge of the shaft in an oblique step. On the anterolateral side of the humerus, the distal half of the large, rectangular deltopectoral crest is preserved. Whereas the anterolateral edge of the proximal part of the crest seems to be rather sharp-edged, the distalmost c. 11 mm show an elongate oval facet for the insertion of the <italic>m. pectoralis</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). This facet is inclined anteromedially and reaches a maximal transverse width of 2.2 mm. A similar facet is also developed in <italic>Sapeornis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Provini et al., 2009</xref>; pers. obs. by CF on specimen JZT-DB 0047), <italic>Jeholornis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Lefèvre et al., 2014</xref>), <italic>Jixiangornis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Chiappe and Meng, 2016</xref>), <italic>Confuciusornis</italic> (e.g. JME 1997/1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chiappe et al., 1999</xref>), but it is absent in <italic>Archaeopteryx</italic>, anchiornithids and non-avian theropods (see discussion). Distal to this insertion, the deltopectoral crest fades into the anterolateral side of the shaft in an oblique, slightly concave step. As in all specimens of <italic>Archaeopteryx</italic>, other basal avialans like <italic>Confuciusornis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chiappe et al., 1999</xref>), and, to a lesser degree, in non-avialan maniraptorans (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Ostrom, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Clark et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Pei et al., 2014</xref>), the proximal part of the humerus that houses the deltopectoral crest is angled posteriorly in respect to the central shaft, with its posteromedial edge (excluding the internal tuberosity) forming an angle of approximately 38° towards the long axis of the shaft. This angle is larger than in non-avialan Paraves and <italic>Anchiornis</italic> (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Ostrom, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Burnham, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Pei et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Pei et al., 2017</xref>).

The humeral shaft distal to the deltopectoral crest is very slightly sigmoidal, with the proximal c. 30 mm being slightly convex anteriorly and concave posteriorly, whereas the distal end is slightly flexed anteriorly. Although the compaction of the shaft makes secure interpretation difficult, it seems that it was wider transversely than anteroposteriorly over its entire length. The minimal width of the shaft is c. 6.5 mm (all measurements should be seen with caution due to the compaction of the bones). The distal end gradually expands transversely to approximately 200% of the minimal shaft width (as far as this can be established; 13 mm as preserved) and the distal condyles expand anteriorly. A large, deep, triangular groove is present proximal to and between the condyles on the anterior side of the humerus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Although this groove might be somewhat exaggerated by the compaction of the bone, it nonetheless seems to be a genuine character of the bone. The medial rim of the groove is formed by a broad longitudinal ridge that is slightly offset laterally from the medial margin of the distal humerus and fades into the shaft some 15 mm proximal to the distal end. This groove and ridge have not been described for <italic>Archaeopteryx</italic> so far (due to the fact that the anterior side of the distal humerus is not exposed in any of the specimens referred to this genus), but they are also present in the humeri of the dromaeosaurids <italic>Deinonychus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Ostrom, 1969</xref>), and <italic>Bambiraptor</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Burnham, 2004</xref>), in <italic>Balaur</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brusatte et al., 2013</xref>) and the basal avialans <italic>Confuciusornis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chiappe et al., 1999</xref>) and <italic>Sapeornis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Provini et al., 2009</xref>).

The entepicondyle (ulnar condyle or condyles dorsalis) is largely missing, but its impression in the rock indicates that it was anteriorly expanded and posteromedially rounded. The ectepicondyle (radial condyle or condyles ventralis) is considerably expanded anteriorly and has a well-developed, anterodistally facing, transversely concave roller joint, similar to the condition in <italic>Deinonychus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Ostrom, 1969</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s1-4-3"><title>Ulna</title><p>The ulna is a slender element (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) and, with a length of 82 mm, slightly shorter than the estimated length of the humerus, as in <italic>Archaeopteryx</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib123">Wellnhofer, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Wellnhofer, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Foth et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Rauhut et al., 2018</xref>), non-avialan maniraptorans, <italic>Confuciusornis</italic> (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chiappe et al., 1999</xref>), and <italic>Apsaravis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Clarke and Norell, 2002</xref>), whereas both elements are of subequal length in <italic>Sapeornis</italic> (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib138">Zhou and Zhang, 2003a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Provini et al., 2009</xref>), and the ulna is longer than the humerus in many more derived avialans (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Hu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Wang et al., 2016</xref>).

The tubercle is offset from the ulnar articular surface by a ridge, but its proximal surface is convex and does not show an additional articular surface, as it is the case in the cotyla dorsalis of modern birds. A pronounced tubercle for the insertion of the biceps muscle cannot be identified, but the bone is strongly crushed in the area where this tubercle would be expected.</p><p>The shaft is slender and narrows gradually, but only slightly from approximately 7 mm at the proximal end to approximately 5 mm at its mid-length.

It is preserved in articulation with metacarpal II, but is separated from the latter by a clear sutural line and even slightly detached from metacarpal I on the palmar side, and was thus not fused into a carpometacarpus, similar to the situation found in non-avian Pennaraptora (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Botelho et al., 2014</xref>), and other basal avialans like <italic>Archaeopteryx</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Wellnhofer, 2009</xref>), <italic>Sapeornis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib138">Zhou and Zhang, 2003a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Botelho et al., 2014</xref>) and <italic>Confuciusornis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chiappe et al., 1999</xref>). The proximal articular surface is strongly convex transversely, with the medial side being more strongly convex than the lateral, so that the proximalmost point of the carpal is slightly placed medial to its mid-width (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). The distal side of the carpal is subdivided into a larger, gently concave lateral facet for the contact with metacarpal II and a much smaller, more strongly concave facet for metacarpal I. The plantar side of the semilunate carpal is exposed below the medial side of metacarpal I. It extends further medially than the palmar side, bordering the entire plantar medial expansion of the proximal articular surface of metacarpal I, as in <italic>Archaeopteryx</italic> and more basal paravians. Assuming a similar lateral expansion as the palmar side of the carpal, the plantar side is approximately 9.5 mm wide, but only 2.3 mm deep proximodistally at the point where the exposed section disappears below the palmar trochlea. The palmar ridge of the articular trochlea of the semilunate carpal is thus shorter and more strongly convex than the plantar ridge of the trochlea (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>), as in other paravian theropods, such as <italic>Deinonychus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Ostrom, 1969</xref>), <italic>Bambiraptor</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Burnham, 2004</xref>) and other taxa (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib128">Xu et al., 2014</xref>). Plantar and palmar trochlear ridges seem to be separated by a deep transverse groove on the proximal articular surface. The lateral edge of the semilunate carpal overlaps half of the area of the proximal end of distal carpal three and metacarpal III, although the latter are offset distally from the carpus.</p><p>Distal carpal three is a very small, round nubbin of bone some 1 mm wide transversely and slightly less deep proximodistally, which is attached to the proximal end of metacarpal III.</p></sec><sec id="s1-4-6"><title>Metacarpus</title><p>As in all maniraptorans, the metacarpus consists of three elements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>), which are here identified as metacarpals I-III, in agreement with the vast majority of works on theropods (but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib126">Xu et al., 2009</xref>, for an alternative interpretation). The metacarpus is preserved in articulation and exposed in palmar view. Metacarpal II is notably more robust than either metacarpal I or III (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>), with the width of its proximal shaft (c. 5 mm) being approximately twice that of metacarpal III (2.5 mm) and more than 185% of the width of the proximal articular surface of metacarpal I (2.7 mm). This differs from the more equal widths of metacarpal I and II in <italic>Archaeopteryx</italic> (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Wellnhofer, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib123">Wellnhofer, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Mayr et al., 2007</xref>), but also the less marked difference in other basal avialans, such as <italic>Sapeornis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib138">Zhou and Zhang, 2003a</xref>) and <italic>Confuciusornis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chiappe et al., 1999</xref>). In contrast, these proportions resemble the condition found in <italic>Jeholornis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib137">Zhou and Zhang, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Lefèvre et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Metacarpal I is unfortunately incompletely preserved, so that its exact length and maximum width cannot be established (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figures 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9</xref>). However, the position of the proximal end of phalanx I-1 might indicate the distal end of this metacarpal, in which case it would have been little more than 7 mm long, or about 17–17.5% of the length of metacarpal II and thus relatively much shorter than in <italic>Archaeopteryx</italic> (25–31%). The proximal articular surface of metacarpal I is 3 mm wide transversely and semilunate in outline, with a plantar-palmarly expanded lateral side and a transversely expanded plantar side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). As the plantar side is embedded in the sediment, it cannot be said whether a plantar process is present laterally, as it is the case in the dromaeosaurids <italic>Deinonychus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Ostrom, 1969</xref>) and <italic>Bambiraptor</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Burnham, 2004</xref>). The mediopalmar side of the proximal end shows a notable depression, distal to which the medial margin seems to have been somewhat expanded, but is broken off. The lateral side of metacarpal I is closely appressed to metacarpal II over its entire preserved length, and the proximal part of the palmar side forms a small lateral flange that overlaps the mediopalmar edge of metacarpal II (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). The distal condyles are broken off, so nothing can be said about the structure of the distal articulation.</p><p>Metacarpal II is massive, apparently subrectangular in cross-section and largely straight, with only the distal articular end being very slightly flexed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). The exact width of the proximal end is difficult to measure, as its palmar side is partially overlapped by flanges of metacarpals I and III, but it is approximately 5.8 mm. From there, the bone gradually tapers over its proximal two thirds to a minimal width of 3.2 mm some 25 mm from the proximal end, distal to which it expands again slightly. The distal end is slightly flexed medially and exposed somewhat obliquely, and has a maximal width of approximately 4.7 mm. The palmar surface of the distal end is collapsed, but the distal articulation was obviously strongly ginglymoidal, with a lateral condyle that is slightly wider and more distally expanded lateral than the medial condyle, which are separated by a marked, broad groove (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A,B</xref>).

The bone is straight and closely appressed to metacarpal II over its entire length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>), as in most basal paravian theropods, but unlike the flexed third metacarpal with a well-developed <italic>spatium intermetacarpale</italic> in most modern birds and some basal avialans, such as <italic>Jeholornis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib137">Zhou and Zhang, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib139">Zhou and Zhang, 2003b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Lefèvre et al., 2014</xref>). The proximal end is displaced distally by slightly more than 1 mm from the level of the proximal end of metacarpal I and II, as in oviraptorids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Longrich et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Balanoff and Norell, 2012</xref>), dromaeosaurids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Lü and Brusatte, 2015</xref>), <italic>Archaeopteryx</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Elzanowski, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Mayr et al., 2007</xref>), confuciusornithids (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib133">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>), enantiornithines (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib134">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>), and more derived birds. The proximal end has a medially flared, rounded flange that overlaps the lateropalmar edge of metacarpal II and thus reaches a maximal transverse width of 4 mm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). The flange disappears into the shaft some 4 mm from the proximal end, distal to which the shaft is 2.7 mm wide. The shaft remains of subequal width over most of its length, tapering only very slightly and reaching a minimal width of 2.4 mm some 5 mm from the distal end. Distally, the bone expands slightly again, mainly due to a rounded mediopalmar flange, to a maximal distal width of 2.9 mm. The distal articular surface is not ginglymoidal, but convex transversely, with a palmar depression between the slightly more massive lateral side of the articular surface and the mediopalmar flange (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A,B</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s1-4-7"><title>Digits</title><p>The hand of the new specimen shows the typical theropodan phalangeal formula of 2-3-4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>), with digit II being by far the longest of the three digits, followed by the subequal digit I (65% of the length of digit II) and digit III (64% of the length of digit II). Considering isolated phalanges, phalanx I-1 is the longest manual phalanx, being only very slightly longer (28.5 mm) than phalanx II-2 (28 mm).</p><p>Phalanx I-1 is long, slender, and slightly bowed, being convex plantarly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10C</xref>). The phalanx seems to be higher than wide (although this might be exaggerated by compression), and its length is approximately 6.5 times its proximal height. The proximal articular end is poorly preserved, but it seems to have been narrow and weakly ginglymoidal. On the palmar side of the proximal end a notable round tubercle probably marks the insertion of a flexor tendon. Directly distal to the proximal articular end, a short, but stout lateropalmar flange seems to have been present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10C</xref>). At mid-shaft, the phalanx seems to have a shallow longitudinal lateral groove, similar to, but less developed than in <italic>Ostromia</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Foth and Rauhut, 2017</xref>); however, as this groove is only apparent in the mid-section of the shaft, and the bone has generally suffered from strong compression, collapsing both the proximal and distal part, some uncertainty remains if this groove represents an original feature or an artefact of preservation. Interestingly, however, such a groove is not present in any of the other manual phalanges, but a similar structure is present in the also apparently uncrushed mid-shaft of the radius, and we thus tentatively regard this feature as a true character of this phalanx. The distal articular end of phalanx I- one is ginglymoidal, with the palmar side of the articular facet extending considerably further proximally than the plantar side. A well-developed collateral ligament pit is present and displaced plantarly from the mid-height of the distal end.</p><p>The ungual of the first digit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10D</xref>) is slightly smaller than the ungual of digit II, as in <italic>Anchiornis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Hu et al., 2009</xref>) and <italic>Archaeopteryx</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib123">Wellnhofer, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Wellnhofer, 2009</xref>), whereas ungual I is larger than that of the second digit in more basal tetanurans (e.g. <italic>Allosaurus</italic>: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Gilmore, 1920</xref>; oviraptorosaurs: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Clark et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Balanoff and Norell, 2012</xref>; <italic>Deinonychus</italic>: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Ostrom, 1969</xref>), but also in <italic>Sapeornis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib138">Zhou and Zhang, 2003a</xref>) and <italic>Confuciusornis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chiappe et al., 1999</xref>). The ungual of the first digit is strongly curved, with the tip of the bony claw being placed approximately 5.6 mm below the proximal articular facet, when the latter is oriented perpendicular. The proximal end has a maximal height of 7.2 mm, of which 3.9 mm are accounted for by the proximal articular facet, whereas the rest forms the very strongly developed flexor tubercle. The latter expands downwards from the articular surface to form a rounded palmar tubercle, the distopalmar extremity of which is expanded transversely into a small, triangular lateral tubercle. Distally, the flexor tubercle fades into the palmar margin of the ungual. When the proximal articular end is oriented perpendicular, the plantar margin of the ungual arches slightly upwards in its proximal part, as in most coelurosaurs, but in contrast to more basal theropods. A plantar lip at the proximal end of the ungual is absent. The ungual has a single, more or less centrally placed claw groove, palmar to which the bone is considerably wider transversely than on the plantar side. The palmar margin of the bony ungual is notably flattened, with the claw showing its greatest transverse width where the lateral side flexes into the palmar side, and tapering slightly towards the claw groove. The keratinous sheath of the claw is well preserved and largely hides the distal end of the bony ungual. It extends the length of the claw for approximately one third of the length of the bony element (measuring the maximum straight length of the ungual) and follows the curvature of the latter, so that the distal end of the sheath is placed approximately 9.5 mm below the proximal articular facet when the latter is oriented vertically.</p><p>In the second digit, the first phalanx is shorter (c. 81%) than the second phalanx, as in all theropods. However, the first phalanx of the second digit, which is exposed in palmar view, is strikingly robust, being by far the most robust phalanx of the manus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figures 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">10A,B</xref>), as it is the case in <italic>Sapeornis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Provini et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gao et al., 2012</xref>), <italic>Confuciusornis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chiappe et al., 1999</xref>) and more derived avialans, whereas this phalanx is only slightly more robust than phalanx II-2 in <italic>Archaeopteryx</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Mayr et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib123">Wellnhofer, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Wellnhofer, 2009</xref>) and more basal theropods. Thus, with a maximal transverse width of 5.5 mm, the proximal end of phalanx II-1 is more robust than the distal end of its respective metacarpal, and the bone narrows only slightly to a minimal width of 4.4 mm just distal to its mid-length. Although the phalanx is compressed, the preserved width seems to reflect the true width of the element, as indicated by the fitting articulation with metacarpal II. In contrast to the condition in more derived birds, but as in <italic>Sapeornis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Provini et al., 2009</xref>) and <italic>Confuciusornis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chiappe et al., 1999</xref>), the phalanx is not flattened but seems to have been rather robust, although it is largely collapsed. The proximal end of the phalanx has two well-developed, concave articular facets separated by a median ridge, fitting with the ginglymoidal distal articular end of the second metacarpal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A,B</xref>). In the shaft, the medial side of the bone is gently concave over its entire length, whereas the lateral side is slightly bulbously convex over its proximal third and becomes only slightly concave distally. The distal articular end of this phalanx is ginglymoidal, being somewhat twisted so that the palmar condyles face slightly lateropalmarly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A,B</xref>), which is furthermore slightly exaggerated by compression. The articular end thus consists of two well-rounded condyles separated by a notable groove. A shallow collateral ligament depression is present on the medial side of the end, being slightly displaced palmarly from the mid-height of the bone.</p><p>Phalanx II-2 is long, slender, and slightly flexed, being convex on the plantar side; it is exposed in medial view. The proximal end is 4.4 mm high plantar-palmarly and seems to have been narrow transversely, although this is certainly exaggerated by compression. The proximal articular end is concave. The height of the bone diminishes rapidly directly distal to the articular end, and then more gradually to a minimal value of 2.7 mm approximately two-thirds of the length of the bone from the proximal end. From here, the bone expands slightly again towards the strongly ginglymoidal distal articular end. The latter is very similar to the distal articular end of phalanx I-1 in extending further proximally on the palmar side and having a well-developed, plantarly displaced collateral ligament pit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10E</xref>).</p><p>The ungual of the second digit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10E</xref>) is slightly longer proximodistally than the ungula of digit I, but less strongly curved, so that the distal tip of the bony ungual is placed 5.5 mm below the articular facet. The flexor tubercle is slightly more offset distally from the proximal end than in the first ungual and accounts for c. 3 mm of the maximal proximal height of 6.6. mm. Furthermore, in contrast to ungual I this element shows a well-developed proximal lip on the plantar surface. Otherwise the ungual is similar to that of digit I, in having a transverse expansion of the palmar extremity of the flexor tubercle and a flattened palmar margin. The dorsal margin arches upwards from the articular end before the claw flexes downward again, as in the first ungual. The ungual sheath is also well preserved and extends to c. 13 mm below the proximal articular surface.</p><p>In digit III, the proximal two phalanges are shorter, taken together, than phalanx III-3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>), as in maniraptoriforms generally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Rauhut, 2003</xref>). Of the two proximal phalanges, phalanx II-1 is considerably longer (c. 150%) than phalanx II-2, but both are poorly preserved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A,B</xref>). Both phalanges are strongly compressed and collapsed, but the transverse width of phalanx III-1 can be estimated to be approximately 1.5 mm, or only about 25–30% that of the maximal width of phalanx II-1. Both phalanges seem to have been ginglymoidal, but nothing can be said about any morphological details. Phalanx III-3 is long and slender but straight, not flexed as it is the case in phalanges I-1 and II-2. The proximal end is poorly preserved but was approximately 2.5 mm high plantar-palmarly. From this end, the phalanx gradually tapers to a minimal height of 0.9 mm just proximal to the expansion of the ginglymoidal distal articular end. The latter is again generally similar to the distal ends of phalanges I-1 and II-2, being more narrow on the plantar than on the palmar side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10E</xref>).</p><p>The ungual of digit III (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10F</xref>) is by far the smallest of the manual unguals, as in most theropods. It is also less markedly curved than the other unguals, with the tip of the bone being placed approximately 2.4 mm below the articular facet. The flexor tubercle is proximally placed and similarly pronounced as in the first ungual and accounts for c. 2.2 mm of the maximal proximal height of 4.6 mm of the bone. In other characters, such as the upward arching proximal flexure of the claw, the singly claw groove, and the flattened palmar margin, the ungual is similar to the other manual unguals. This is also true for a transverse expansion of the distopalmar extremity of the flexor tubercle, further indicating that this represents the original condition and does not stem from compression or deformation. As in the other unguals, the sheath extends the ungual for slightly more than one third of the length of the bony element, and its tip is placed c. 5.2 mm below the proximal articular facet.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Taxonomic identification of SNSB-BSPG 2017 I 133</title><p>Traditionally, all paravian specimens from the late Kimmeridgian - early Tithonian laminated limestones of southern Germany have been identified as <italic>Archaeopteryx</italic>, and this would thus be an obvious identification for the new specimen as well.

the new specimen differs significantly from <italic>Archaeopteryx</italic> in the following ratios: manual phalanx I-1 vs. ulna, manual phalanx II-1 vs. manual phalanx I-1, manual phalanx II-2 vs. manual phalanx I-1, manual phalanx III-1 vs. manual phalanx I-1, manual ungual II vs. manual phalanx II-1, and manual digit I vs. manual digit II. When the juvenile Eichstätt specimen is excluded the ratios of manual phalanx III-2 vs. ulna, and manual phalanx III-2 vs. manual phalanx III-1 are also significant different from each other. A further significant difference from specimens of <italic>Archaeopteryx</italic> might be the length of metacarpal I, which seems to be considerably shorter in the new specimen, under the assumption that the position of the proximal end of the first manual phalanx indicates the length of this bone. However, as the distal end of metacarpal I is not preserved, this cannot be established with any certainty.</p><p>Likewise difficult to establish are probable differences in relative robusticity of structures in comparison with <italic>Archaeopteryx</italic>, mainly because of the strong compression of the new specimen. One striking feature of the new specimen is the width of the deltopectoral crest of the humerus, which seems to considerably exceed the width of the humeral shaft, similar to <italic>Confuciusornis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chiappe et al., 1999</xref>) and <italic>Ichthyornis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Clarke, 2004</xref>). This is an unusual feature not seen in specimens of <italic>Archaeopteryx</italic>, but some uncertainty remains due to the strong compression of the bone. Also unusual in the humerus is the angle at which the proximal part that bears the deltopectoral crest is offset from the distal shaft (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>). This angle is below 30° in dromaeosaurids, such as <italic>Microraptor</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Hwang et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Pei et al., 2014</xref>), <italic>Zhenyuanlong</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Lü and Brusatte, 2015</xref>), and <italic>Deinonychus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Ostrom, 1969</xref>), and most specimens of <italic>Anchiornis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Hu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Pei et al., 2017</xref>), and varies between 30° and 33° in specimens of <italic>Archaeopteryx</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11B–D</xref>; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib123">Wellnhofer, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Wellnhofer, 2009</xref>). However, this angle is 38° in the Mühlheim specimen, which is close to <italic>Confuciusornis</italic> (36°: SNSB-BSPG 1999 I 15; 38°: JME 1996/15, 1997/1; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11H</xref>) and some other more derived avialans such as <italic>Sulcavis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">O’Connor et al., 2013</xref>), <italic>Archaeorhynchus</italic> (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib135">Zhou et al., 2013</xref>), <italic>Yanornis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib136">Zhou and Zhang, 2001</xref>) or <italic>Gansus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Wang et al., 2016</xref>).</p><fig id="fig11" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43789.015</object-id><label>Figure 11.</label><caption><title>Comparison of humeral shape in some Mesozoic birds.</title><p>(<bold>A, E</bold>) <italic>Alcmonavis</italic>.

As noted in the description, the proximal part of this metacarpal is almost twice as wide as the proximal articular surface of metacarpal I. However, this metacarpal is not only robust in comparison to the other metacarpals, but also in itself: whereas the length of metacarpal II exceeds ten times the maximal width of the bone in specimens of <italic>Archaeopteryx</italic>, it is only around 8.2 times the maximal width of this element in SNSB-BSPG 2017 I 133 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12C,E</xref>). As the metacarpus is preserved in articulation, it seems very unlikely that this robusticity of metacarpal II is entirely due to preservation, and thus probably represents a true difference of the new specimen from specimens of <italic>Archaeopteryx</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12</xref>). On the other hand, this feature resembles the condition of many basal birds from the Jehol Group, for example <italic>Jeholornis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib137">Zhou and Zhang, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Lefèvre et al., 2014</xref>) and <italic>Archaeorhynchus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib135">Zhou et al., 2013</xref>), which highlight the transition of an individual metacarpal II to the major element of the fused capometacarpus of modern birds.</p><fig id="fig12" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43789.016</object-id><label>Figure 12.</label><caption><title>Mani of several paravian theropods for comparison with <italic>Alcmonavis</italic>.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Right manus of <italic>Velociraptor mongoliensis</italic> (IGM 100/982) in plantar view.

In non-avialan paravians and specimens that can securely be referred to <italic>Archaeopteryx</italic> (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12A–C</xref>), this phalanx is only slightly more robust than phalanx II-2 or III-1 (e.g. 1.25 times the width of phalanx II-2 at the proximal shaft in the Berlin specimen), but it is more than 1.7 times the width of the widest part of phalanx II-2 and more than twice the width of phalanx II-1 in the Mühlheim specimen. This pronounced robusticity of phalanx II-1 in comparison with <italic>Archaeopteryx</italic> (and more basal paravians) probably represents an apomorphic character shared by SNSB-BSPG 2017 I 133 and more derived avialans, as a widened phalanx proximalis digiti majoris is a general character of avialans more derived than <italic>Archaeopteryx</italic>, and is present e.g. in basal forms, such as <italic>Jeholornis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Lefèvre et al., 2014</xref>), <italic>Sapeornis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib132">Yuan, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Provini et al., 2009</xref>), <italic>Chongmingia</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Wang et al., 2016</xref>), and <italic>Confuciusornis</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chiappe et al., 1999</xref>). The phalanx in the Mühlheim specimen is plesiomorhic in comparison to most more derived avialans (i.e., Ornithothoraces) in that it is not dorsoventrally flattened, but seems to be rather robust also in this plane. In this respect it is similar to the robust phalanx in <italic>Jeholornis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Lefèvre et al., 2014</xref>), <italic>Sapeornis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib132">Yuan, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Provini et al., 2009</xref>) and <italic>Confuciusornis</italic>. In the latter, this element is dorsoventrally robust at least along its anterior edge, whereas the posterior edge is somewhat flattened (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12D</xref>; SNSB-BSPG 1999 I 15, JME 1997/1, 2005/1).</p><p>Apart from these morphometric differences, there are also several qualitative characters that differ between the new specimen and specimens of <italic>Archaeopteryx</italic>. One of these characters concerns the insertion of the <italic>m. pectoralis</italic> on the deltopectoral crest of the humerus. This facet is not especially marked, or only indicated by slight thickening of the apex of the crest in most non-avialan theropods. In <italic>Archaeopteryx</italic>, the anterior side of the deltopectoral crest is only exposed in the London, Thermopolis and, partially, the Maxberg specimens (pers. obs.; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">de Beer, 1954</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Heller, 1959</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Mayr et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib123">Wellnhofer, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Wellnhofer, 2009</xref>). Although the edge of the deltopectoral crest is slightly damaged in the London and Thermopolis specimens, it can be established that these specimens follow the general theropodan condition of not showing a marked facet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figure 13</xref>). In contrast, SNSB-BSPG 2017 I 133 shows a well-developed, anteromedially inclined, elongate oval facet for the insertion of the <italic>m. pectoralis</italic> on the deltopectoral crest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Again, this character is present in many basal avialans from the Jehol group (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14">Figure 14</xref>) and seems to be a derived character in comparison with <italic>Archaeopteryx</italic> (see below).</p><fig id="fig13" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43789.017</object-id><label>Figure 13.</label><caption><title>Proximal part of the humerus of specimens of <italic>Archaeopteryx</italic> in anteromedial view, showing the lack of a pronounced facet for the pectoralis muscle in this taxon.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) London specimen.

However, due to preservation the exact development of this tuberculum in specimens of <italic>Archaeopteryx</italic> is difficult to establish. Several specimens, including the Munich, Altmühltal and Ottmann and Steil (&quot;chicken wing“) specimens show that this tuberculum is present in this taxon. Although a direct comparison of this structure is difficult due to preservation, these specimens seem to show a rounded to triangular expansion that is different from the crest-like, more rectangular tubercle in the new specimen. In those avialan specimens from the Jehol Group where this characters can be evaluated it varies between a triangular and crest-like state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chiappe et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Provini et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib135">Zhou et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>If the interpretation of longitudinal furrows on the radius and phalanx I-1 as original features is correct, these are further differences from <italic>Archaeopteryx</italic>. As noted above, such furrows are observed in some other paravian theropods in variable elements (see e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chiappe and Walker, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Sanz et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Hu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Foth and Rauhut, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib131">Xu et al., 2017</xref>), but the combination of such furrows in the radius and only one manual phalanx might be unique for SNSB-BSPG 2017 I 133. However, as such features might be easily overlooked, more studies of these morphologies are needed.</p><p>Finally, apart from being relatively smaller, the manual unguals also show differences from those of specimens of <italic>Archaeopteryx</italic>. Especially the shape, position and prominence of the flexor tubercle seems to differ. In general the flexor tubercles in the new specimen seem to be placed slightly more proximally than in specimens of <italic>Archaeopteryx</italic> and the tubercles are more pointed, that is the angle between their proximal and distal margin are sharper; this is especially marked in manual ungual II. Likewise, the transverse distopalmar expansion of the flexor tubercle, which is present in all three unguals of the Mühlheim specimen, is not present in specimens of <italic>Archaeopteryx</italic>.</p><p>The comparison with the anchiornithid <italic>Ostromia</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Foth and Rauhut, 2017</xref>) is more difficult due to the fragmentary nature of both specimens. Most of the forelimb bones of <italic>Ostromia</italic> are actually preserved as imprints, so that only parts of the manus can be used for comparison. Like <italic>Ostromia</italic>, SNSB-BSPG 2017 I 133 seems to possess a longitudinal furrow along the manual phalanx I-1, a character that is also shared with <italic>Sinornithosaurus</italic> and <italic>Jianianhualong</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Foth and Rauhut, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib131">Xu et al., 2017</xref>). However, <italic>Ostromia</italic> shows similar grooves also in manual phalanx III-3, while the corresponding element is smooth in <italic>Alcmonavis</italic>. Striking differences between <italic>Alcmonavis</italic> and <italic>Ostromia</italic> are present in the size and shape of the manual unguals. When compared to the length of the manual phalanx I-1, the first ungual of <italic>Ostromia</italic> is much smaller than that of <italic>Alcmonavis</italic>. In contrast, the third ungual is much smaller in <italic>Alcmonavis</italic> when compared to the size of the first ungual, while in <italic>Ostromia</italic> they almost have the same size. While some basal avialans like <italic>Jeholornis</italic> and <italic>Sapeornis</italic> from the Jehol Group show enlarged manual unguals, they also show a clear size reduction from manual ungual I to III (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib137">Zhou and Zhang, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib138">Zhou and Zhang, 2003a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Provini et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gao et al., 2012</xref>). The flexor tubercles of the manual unguals in <italic>Ostromia</italic> are much more distally displaced than in SNSB-BSPG 2017 I 133 (but also <italic>Archaeopteryx</italic>). As described above, the flexor tubercles of SNSB-BSPG 2017 I 133 are very prominent and pointed ventrally, while in <italic>Ostromia</italic> they are relatively low, forming a plateau-like ventral apex (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib123">Wellnhofer, 2008</xref>: Figure 5.79B, C; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Foth and Rauhut, 2017</xref>: Figures 3B and 4). Furthermore, like <italic>Archaeopteryx</italic>, <italic>Ostromia</italic> lacks the transverse distopalmar expansion of the flexor tubercle and a notably flattened palmar margin of the bony ungual. While the manual unguals of <italic>Confuciusornis</italic>, <italic>Jeholornis</italic> and <italic>Sapeornis</italic> still bear prominent flexor tubercles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chiappe et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib137">Zhou and Zhang, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib139">Zhou and Zhang, 2003b</xref>), they become reduced within Ornithothoraces (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib135">Zhou et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>In summary, despite the overall similarity and very similar proportions, the new specimen shows numerous small differences from <italic>Archaeopteryx</italic>, precluding a referral to this taxon. Several characters, including the markedly concave proximal articular surface of the ulna, the very massive phalanx II-1 and the marked, anteromedially inclined facet for the attachment of the m. pectoralis in the humerus, are shared with more derived avialans, and indicate that the Mühlheim specimen represents a third, phylogenetically slightly more crownward taxon of avialans from the Tithonian limestones of southern Germany. From the description and comparisons of the specimen it is furthermore clear that SNSB-BSPG 2017 I 133 also cannot be referred to <italic>Ostromia</italic> or to any other known theropod taxon.

This crest serves as attachment site for several proximal forelimb muscles that extend from the shoulder girdle to the humerus. In crocodiles, these muscles are mainly the <italic>m. coracobrachialis brevis</italic>, which attaches on a large area on the medial side of the crest, the <italic>m. deltoideus clavicularis</italic>, the attachment of which covers most of the lateral side of the crest, and the <italic>m. supracoracoideus</italic>, which attaches on the apex of the crest, whereas the <italic>m. pectoralis</italic> only has a rather small attachment on the mediodistal side of the crest, just below the apex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Meers, 2003</xref>).

Numerous specimens of paravian theropods were studied for comparison, including all other urvogel specimens from the Solnhofen Archipelago (the currently missing Maxberg specimen could only be studied on the basis of a high quality cast at the BSPG) and several specimens of anchiornithids and basal avialans from China.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Nomenclatural acts</title><p>The electronic edition of this article conforms to the requirements of the amended International Code of Zoological Nomenclature, and hence the new names contained herein are available under that Code from the electronic edition of this article.

However, the latter are used in respect to anatomical features that are typical for birds, but not present in non-avialan dinosaurs. Thus, we prefer the terms 'anterior' and 'posterior' over 'cranial' and 'caudal' (as the latter might be confused with anatomical regions of the skeleton), and refer to the different sides of long bones according to their orientation in the resting pose in a theropod dinosaur.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>UV imaging of <italic>Alcmonavis poeschli</italic></title><p>Many fossils from the Upper Jurassic plattenkalks of southern Germany are fluorescent under artificial ultraviolet light (UV) which allows a more precise investigation of morphological details of skeletal remains as well as of soft parts. Since each fossil fluoresces slightly differently, a variety of filters and high performance UV-A lamps is required for investigation and imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Tischlinger and Arratia, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Tischlinger, 2015</xref>). For our investigation of the 13th urvogel we used different UV-lamps with wavelengths of 312 nanometers (UV-B) and 365–366 nm (UV-A).</p><p>During the UV pictorial documentation of the 13th urvogel best results were obtained with a wavelength of 365–366 nanometers (long-wave radiation, UV-A). The following UV lamps were used:</p><p>3 Benda UV lamps: type N, 16 Watt, UV-A, 366 nanometers (size of filter 200 mm x 50 mm);</p><p>1 Labino UV lamp: UV-Spotlight S135, 35 Watt, UV-A, peak at 365 nm: spotlight (&gt;50.000 microwatts per cm² at 30 cm distance) plus midlight reflector replacement (&gt;8.000 microwatts per cm² at 30 cm distance).</p><p>The visibility of details under UV was enhanced considerably by an established filtering technique, crucial for the photographic documentation. The application of different filters allowed a selective visualisation of peculiar fine structures. Color compensation filters (yellow, cyan and magenta of different types and densities) were adjusted in front of the camera lens or under the microscope objective lens (if pictures were taken through the microscope). The optimum number and specification of the compensation filters was tested in a series of experiments. The predominant color of luminescence was of minor importance. In fact, the crucial decision on the amount of filtering was the optimal visibility of details and their differentiation from surrounding structures and the matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Tischlinger and Arratia, 2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Phylogenetic analysis</title><p>In order to test the phylogenetic position of the new taxon, we included it in a modified version of the phylogenetic data matrix used in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Foth and Rauhut, 2017</xref>.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;A non-archaeopterygid bird (Dinosauria; Theropoda; Avialiae) from the Late Jurassic of southern Germany&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by four peer reviewers, including Trevor Worthy as Guest Editor and Reviewer #2, and the evaluation has been overseen by Diethard Tautz as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Jingmai Oconnor (Reviewer #4).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript describes a new fossil, the thirteenth urvogel from the Solnhofen archipelago (where <italic>Archaeopteryx</italic> derives from), showing that it represents a second avialan taxon that is slightly more derived than <italic>Archaeopteryx</italic>. The conclusion that follows is that some flight adaptations and the transition towards Aves evolved earlier than previously thought. This is a major discovery - if substantiated - and thus one that requires extraordinary justification. You provide an excellent morphological description of an important new specimen, in a well written manuscript supplied with wonderful photographs in both normal and UV light. However, while it reveals some new anatomical details, the specimen is fragmentary, with only wing bones, and some of the key conclusions of the manuscript are rather poorly supported by the actual data as presented. In addition, some speculative ideas are presented as too definitive in the abstract and conclusion. Added comparisons and attention to the points raised below may possibly overcome these obstacles; hence a revision is invited.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Adequate Diagnosis from <italic>Archaeopteryx</italic></p><p>Two reviewers have strong reservations as to whether the fossil is adequately diagnosed as distinct from <italic>Archaeopteryx</italic> and more ancestral avialan. There is also concern how well the erection of a new genus name for the fossil is substantiated. In the diagnosis, the authors differentiate the fossil from &quot;all other theropods&quot;, but what would be needed is an explicit differentiation from <italic>Archaeopteryx</italic> and the newly erected &quot;<italic>Ostromia</italic>&quot;.</p><p>Does the phrase &quot;all theropods&quot; in the diagnosis include birds as well? If it does, some of the features, such as a &quot;large deltopectoral crest&quot;, are erroneously listed, as these do occur in avians (or &quot;avialans&quot; sensu the authors). One reviewer was not convinced by the diagnosis distinguishing it from other theropods, noting that the phalanges seem very mobile (whereas the digits are typically preserved straight indicating more rigidity (which would be necessary for flight) in <italic>Archaeopteryx</italic>; also the morphology of the semilunate is more non-avian than avian, and the same seems possible with regards to the distal humerus, and the proportions of the claws relative to their digits (not including horny sheath). We think a stronger diagnosis is therefore required. Throughout the description, anywhere comparison is only made with avians, non-avians should be added (and vice versa).</p><p>2) Comments on specific morphologies</p><p>There are reservations concerning the interpretation of the humerus that need addressing.</p><p>Some of the alleged differences between the new fossil and previously described specimens are controversial. For example, one of the key features listed by the authors, the alleged presence of an impression for musculus pectoralis, cannot be established with certainty in some other <italic>Archaeopteryx</italic> fossils, such as the London specimen, in which the deltopectoral crest appears to be abraded in the corresponding region (see Figure 12 of the manuscript). This facet in the new fossil does not appear to be substantially different from that found in Mei long (Figure 14B), and certainly it is much less developed than the corresponding muscular impression in more crownward birds. Reviewer Oconnor noted that the attachment for the pectoralis on the distal end of the deltopectoral crest has not been widely described, at least not in non-ornithothoracine Early Cretaceous birds (it is mentioned in Martinavis; Walker et al., 2007), so taxa that have this feature should be listed together with citations (be careful, although it may appear present from a figure, if it wasn't described, its appearance in a photograph is possibly an artefact of preservation/photography, e.g., <italic>Sapeornis</italic> IVPP V13396 – Provini et al., 2008, or the holotype of <italic>Jeholornis</italic>. It is not mentioned in any of the papers cited, and in Oconnor's experience with basal Jehol birds is not common and so must have been independently evolved in Alcomavis, or perhaps only appears in the most ontogenetically mature specimens of <italic>Archaeopteryx</italic> (and potentially other Mesozoic birds).</p><p>It is not accurate to estimate the length of the humerus as it is incomplete and to do so based on assumptions about the size of the internal tuberosity. Better to just state its minimal length (and not use this element for ratios and comparison). Which other taxa show elongate oval facet for the insertion of the m. pectoralis (make sure to check non-avians)?</p><p>With regards to the angle of the proximal portion of the humerus relative to the shaft the authors say to a lesser degree in non-avians but this seems a bit misleading – it is also strongly angled in a number of non-avian paravians, especially it seems in dromaeosaurids (Ji et al., 2000 – <italic>Sinornithosaurus; Microraptor</italic>, any number of references) but also present in <italic>Anchiornis</italic> (this is another reason why line drawing reconstructions of the forelimb in 4-5 key taxa would be really helpful). Reviewer Worthy suggested that the shaft angle (Subsection “Humerus”, etc) is perhaps increased by inclusion of the bicipital crest. The bicipital crest can be seen to join the shaft roughly co-level with the distal end of the deltopectoral crest, and thus the bicipital crest adds width to the ventral (here posteromedial) side of the shaft. Exclusion of the bicipital crest would lead to a lesser angle of the proximal section of the shaft relative to that more distally. Thus, using the ventral shaft margin as a proxy for shaft angle is not homologous between taxa that have a definite and enlarged bicipital crest and those that do not. A revision of definition of this metric would avoid this issue. Applies to the Discussion section as well.</p><p>Ulna – since the humerus is not fully preserved, it is not accurate to compare an estimated length and then derive comparisons. Compare proximal end of ulna to Anchiornis. Although caution is mentioned often, the distal ulna seems pretty crushed flat but still described heavily. The features described are only present in <italic>Archaeorhynchus</italic> or also present in other stem birds? Label the anteromedially directed ridge in Figure 6.</p><p>Radius – compare longitudinal groove to that in enantiornithines.</p><p>Carpals – MC I seems to be broken and it was unlikely it was as short as described. MC II is thicker than I and III in <italic>Microraptor</italic> as well; also, Mc III is slightly offset proximally.</p><p>Digits – Digit I ungual largest in <italic>Anchiornis</italic> (see Pei et al., 2017); digit II phalanx 1 is certainly robust but it appears strongly exaggerated as preserved, as two surfaces are exposed and flattened so it appears to be a single exposed surface of a hyper-robust phalanx. If this is taken into account, then the proximal articular surface of the phalanx is slightly narrower than the matching articular surface on metacarpal II. I do not see this described convexity on the plantar surface of phalanx II-2. The flexed morphology described in the penultimate phalanges of digits I and II is very subtle, at best, and should be described as so.</p><p>Unguals – it is stated (Discussion section) that the unguals are larger (proportionately) in <italic>Archaeopteryx</italic> but if the ungual (not including horny sheaths which may or may not be complete or in situ) is compared to the length of the penultimate phalanx, they are proportionately larger in Alcomavis. A table of ratios would be helpful to further help illustrate differences between this specimen and other urvogels and closely related taxa. <italic>Confuciusornis</italic> does not show a reduction in manual claws from I to III (II is smallest). Since this specimen is larger than other <italic>Archaeopteryx</italic> specimens, the pronounced muscle attachments could be explained by ontogeny (as suggested by the authors themselves somewhat), especially given that the difference between these taxa is pretty minor if the robustness of phalanx II-1 is taken out.</p><p>3) Advisability of creating a new nomen</p><p>Even if the new specimen can be shown to differ from other <italic>Archaeopteryx</italic> fossils in some features, it is contentious, and some would say not advisable to assign a name to these fragmentary remains. The past years have seen an inflation in new and rather poorly diagnosed <italic>Archaeopteryx</italic>-like avians from the Solnhofen limestone, and in light of the very fragmentary preservation of the fossil, the manuscript would be scientifically more rigorous if the authors opted against naming a new taxon.</p><p>4) Phylogenetic analysis</p><p>The phylogenetic analysis is presented in rather a cursory way. It is unacceptable not to have support values in the presented phylogenetic trees. For example, it is misrepresentative to say the strict consensus is well resolved (subsection “Phylogenetic position of <italic>Alcmonavis”</italic>) yet not show the evidence that there is in fact very weak support for such resolution. At the very least Bremner support values should be given so that readers can see which of these clades has any semblance of support – one assumes that as no values are given and given the statement, that clade support is very low indeed – but readers deserve to be shown this, not have these data occluded. Ideally bootstrap values over 50% should be shown because anything less shows the clades are highly unstable and probably are not real in terms of evolutionary history. As presented, the placement of <italic>Alcmonavis</italic> is discussed as an afterthought in this section. Surely the focus should be on the new taxon and then use known taxa secondly to validate the tree.</p><p>Given it is well established that missing data drive a taxon to the base of the clade in which it would otherwise reside (e.g., Sansom, 2015), some comment on the placement of the new taxon is warranted; why, what character evidence precludes that, for example, the new taxon really lies within Jelholornithidae or another slightly more derived position, than the node it appears in the tree? Character evidence for the critical nodes should be discussed, identifying the derived characters that place the new fossil in a more crownward position than <italic>Archaeopteryx</italic>.</p><p>Sansom, 2015.</p><p>The phylogenetic analyses should state which multistate characters were ordered (if any).</p><p>Major clade names, including all Family names used in text, should be shown on the trees in the Supplementary file.</p><p>5) Improvement of figures</p><p>While the currently presented figures are excellent, some more are needed. Key to demonstrating the distinction from <italic>Archaeopteryx</italic>, are photos and or line drawings of the important elements of the new fossil in direct comparison with those of &quot;<italic>Archaeopteryx</italic>&quot; that explicitly show the differences in morphology and proportions. It is also desirable to add some figures, at least in Supplementary file, of key features of the new fossil directly compared with a meaningful selection of stem birds and non-avian maniraptorans to aid with comparison.</p><p>6) Tabular presentation of key data to facilitate comparison</p><p>Use of two more tables might facilitate comparisons better. For example, the section on Comments on the numbering and naming of avialan specimens from the Solnhofen Archipelago is useful, but quite long. Perhaps include the data in a table listing all 13 specimens, their current taxonomy, their numbers and correlative 'names' and institution, and include just a couple sentences to justify the new names for the eleventh to thirteenth specimens. If length is an issue then it could be in Supplementary file, but it is of more use to the audience in the main text, i.e. not lost/invisible in the Supplementary file.</p><p>Similarly, a table with comparative key measurements for the 12 <italic>Archaeopteryx</italic> specimens including ratios should also be provided, so demonstrating how similar this specimen is to other urvogel specimens.</p><p>7) Discussion on possible flight mode of the fossil</p><p>This section is entirely speculative and not well substantiated. Various authors have detailed that flapping flight capabilities are unlikely for <italic>Archaeopteryx</italic>. The different morphology of the supracoracoideus muscle is just one argument contra flapping flight capabilities of <italic>Archaeopteryx</italic>, and the anatomy of <italic>Archaeopteryx</italic> does not show any evidence that this animal was capable of take-off through flapping flight (comparisons with extant pigeons certainly are not appropriate, as the latter have a completely different skeletal morphology than any Jurassic avians). Even though Voeten et al. recently proposed flapping flight capabilities of <italic>Archaeopteryx</italic>, their arguments based on the thickness of the bone cortex are far from compelling. Likewise, it is not clear why the presence of a tubercle for musculus <italic>biceps brachii</italic> on the radius would indicate flapping flight capabilities (so much the more as the presence/absence of this feature in other <italic>Archaeopteryx</italic> specimens is difficult to assess). Given the speculative nature of this interpretation, to include in the abstract a sentence like &quot;Several modifications, especially in muscle attachments related to the downstroke of the wing, indicate a rapid adaptation of the forelimb for active flapping flight in the early evolution of birds&quot; is not justified by the data (so much the more as the discussion is far less definitive).</p><p>Given the great similarities of the general skeletal architecture of this fragmentary wing to the known <italic>Archaeopteryx</italic> remains (three unfused metacarpals with large ungual phalanges, similar phalangeal proportions etc.), it is highly unlikely that substantial differences in flight mode to <italic>Archaeopteryx</italic> existed.

There is also concern how well the erection of a new genus name for the fossil is substantiated. In the diagnosis, the authors differentiate the fossil from &quot;all other theropods&quot;, but what would be needed is an explicit differentiation from Archaeopteryx and the newly erected &quot;Ostromia&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>The explicit differentiation of <italic>Alcmonavis</italic> to <italic>Archaeopteryx</italic> and <italic>Ostromia</italic> was already provided in the first part of the Discussion section of the previous manuscript. To avoid confusion, we rearranged the manuscript and put the diagnosis after the description and discussion of the differences so that the reader already has this information before the new taxon is defined.</p><p>We extended the comparison between <italic>Alcmonavis</italic> to <italic>Archaeopteryx</italic> and <italic>Ostromia</italic> by including statistical analyses on various limb proportions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Does the phrase &quot;all theropods&quot; in the diagnosis include birds as well? If it does, some of the features, such as a &quot;large deltopectoral crest&quot;, are erroneously listed, as these do occur in avians (or &quot;avialans&quot; sensu the authors). One reviewer was not convinced by the diagnosis distinguishing it from other theropods, noting that the phalanges seem very mobile (whereas the digits are typically preserved straight indicating more rigidity (which would be necessary for flight) in Archaeopteryx; also the morphology of the semilunate is more non-avian than avian, and the same seems possible with regards to the distal humerus, and the proportions of the claws relative to their digits (not including horny sheath). We think a stronger diagnosis is therefore required. Throughout the description, anywhere comparison is only made with avians, non-avians should be added (and vice versa).</p></disp-quote><p>As stated in the text, <italic>Alcomonavis</italic> is diagnosed based on a combination of characters, i.e., single characters listed in the diagnosis do not have to be unique. Of course, large deltopectoral crests are typical for many basal birds, but in its extension the deltopectoral crest of <italic>Alcmonavis</italic> is larger than in <italic>Archaeopteryx</italic>, anchiornithids and other non-avian theropod dinosaurs.</p><p>The reviewer is correct that in many pygostylian birds, the digits are rigid, especially in Ornithothoraces. This also seems to be the case in most <italic>Archaopteryx</italic> specimens, but also in <italic>Anchiornis</italic> or <italic>Microraptor</italic>. However, we believe that the preservation of the phalanges in <italic>Alcmonavis</italic> is not an indicator of missing rigidity, but a taphonomic artefact caused by an advanced stage of decay; indeed, fossils of the Mörnsheim Formation tend to be more strongly disarticulated and disrupted than those of the underlying Altmühltal Formation, which has yielded the vast majority of specimens of <italic>Archaeopteryx</italic>. Moreover, some specimens of <italic>Archaeopteryx</italic>, including the &quot;chicken wings&quot; and the twelfth specimen, also show strongly flexed phalanges. Indeed, similar “mobile” preservations can be also found in <italic>Sapeornis</italic> (IVPP V13396), <italic>Pengornis</italic> (IVPP V15336), <italic>Gansus</italic> (BMNHC-PH1392) and many specimens of <italic>Confuciusornis</italic> (DNHM-D2454, IVPP V10928, IVPP V12352, IVPP V13156 or JME 1997-1) (see e.g., Falk et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2019 or Chiappe and Meng, 2016), so we consider this simply to be an artefact of preservation.</p><p>We already stated that the morphology of the semilunate carpal of <italic>Alcomonavis</italic> resembles that of non-avian theropods like <italic>Deinonychus</italic>, being not fused to the metacarpus. However, the latter situation is also not present in other basal birds, including <italic>Jeholornis, Sapeornis</italic> or <italic>Confuciusornis</italic>. In fact, a fusion of carpal and metacarpal bones happens first time within Ornithothoraces, like in <italic>Archaeorhynchus</italic> (see e.g., Botehlo et al., 2014). However, even this partial fusion in <italic>Archaeorhynchus</italic> seem to be occur very late in ontogeny (Wang and Zhou, 2017). Despite the fact that we did not include any diagnostic character from the carpal region, we added a comparison to the description.</p><p>All measurements of the unguals based on the bony element. The sheath was not taken into account. Our statistical analyses shows that UI is significant smaller when compared to the ulna length and UII when compared to the length of manual phalanx II-1.</p><p>Concerning the diagnosis we don't see how the &quot;strength&quot; of the diagnosis depends on how bird-like or not the new taxon is – although no clear autapomorphic characters can currently be identified, the combination of characters seen in this wing skeleton is unique within both non-avialan and avialan theropods.</p><p>We have added comparisons with derived maniraptoran theropod dinosaurs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Comments on specific morphologies</p><p>There are reservations concerning the interpretation of the humerus that need addressing.</p><p>Some of the alleged differences between the new fossil and previously described specimens are controversial. For example, one of the key features listed by the authors, the alleged presence of an impression for musculus pectoralis, cannot be established with certainty in some other Archaeopteryx fossils, such as the London specimen, in which the deltopectoral crest appears to be abraded in the corresponding region (see Figure 12 of the manuscript). This facet in the new fossil does not appear to be substantially different from that found in Mei long (Figure 14B), and certainly it is much less developed than the corresponding muscular impression in more crownward birds. Reviewer Oconnor noted that the attachment for the pectoralis on the distal end of the deltopectoral crest has not been widely described, at least not in non-ornithothoracine Early Cretaceous birds (it is mentioned in Martinavis; Walker et al., 2007), so taxa that have this feature should be listed together with citations (be careful, although it may appear present from a figure, if it wasn't described, its appearance in a photograph is possibly an artefact of preservation/photography, e.g., Sapeornis IVPP V13396 – Provini et al., 2008, or the holotype of Jeholornis. It is not mentioned in any of the papers cited, and in Oconnor's experience with basal Jehol birds is not common and so must have been independently evolved in Alcomavis, or perhaps only appears in the most ontogenetically mature specimens of Archaeopteryx (and potentially other Mesozoic birds).</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is right that the margin of the deltopectoral crest in London specimens is slightly abraded, increasing towards proximal. More distal the margin of the crest is still intact so that the presence of a facet can be ruled out (pers. obs. by OR). Furthermore, the crest is partially preserved also in the Thermopolis and Maxberg specimen (cast of the latter at the BSPG), none of which shows any sign of such a facet. To strengthen our case, we added a photo of the right humerus of the Thermopolis specimen, which shows the same situation to Figure 12. Furthermore, we added another photo showing the same region in <italic>Alcmonavis</italic> for comparison.</p><p>Based on the figure we provided in the previous version, it appears that <italic>Mei long</italic> possesses such a facet, but actually the photo shows the margin of the crest, which faces anterior (in many theropods the deltopectoral crest is not flat but slightly curved). Like in <italic>Ornitholestes</italic> (discussed in the manuscript) the margin is slightly expanded transversally. We changed the relevant sections in the manuscript accordingly.</p><p>We do not follow the argumentation that the appearance of undescribed structures in photographs are artefacts of preservation/photography. We believe that the illustration of anatomical details is part of a description, and it becomes even more essential, when the written part is rather brief (which is often the case, unfortunately). In this context, the documentation of preservational artefacts is also necessary to avoid misinterpretations. Nevertheless, the presence of the facet in <italic>Sapeornis</italic> is confirmed by pers. obs. of CF, and in <italic>Confuciusornis</italic> by pers. obs. of OR. The structure of the respective specimen is now illustrated in Figure 14. As it is not properly figured, we did not cite the holotype of <italic>Jeholornis</italic>, but a referred specimen, which was described by Lefèvre et al., (2014).</p><p>Although muscle attachments often become more conspicuous during ontogeny, the London specimen, which, as shown, does not have such as facet, is certainly not a young individual, and is not so much smaller than the new specimen. Thus, this specimen should show some sort of pronounced facet, which is not the case.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is not accurate to estimate the length of the humerus as it is incomplete and to do so based on assumptions about the size of the internal tuberosity. Better to just state its minimal length (and not use this element for ratios and comparison). Which other taxa show elongate oval facet for the insertion of the m. pectoralis (make sure to check non-avians)?</p></disp-quote><p>We now added the actual length of the humerus as preserved. However, as fossils often suffered damage during the preservation or excavation process it is common in palaeontology to provide estimated length for respective elements. The estimation of the humerus length is based on ratios of complete elements known from other paravians. Nevertheless, as the correct length of the element is not known, the humerus length was not considered for statistical comparisons.</p><p>In the previous version, taxa with an oval facet were listed in the Discussion section. For comparison, we added taxa to the description and made a reference to the discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>With regards to the angle of the proximal portion of the humerus relative to the shaft the authors say to a lesser degree in non-avians but this seems a bit misleading – it is also strongly angled in a number of non-avian paravians, especially it seems in dromaeosaurids (Ji et al., 2000 – Sinornithosaurus; Microraptor, any number of references) but also present in Anchiornis (this is another reason why line drawing reconstructions of the forelimb in 4-5 key taxa would be really helpful). Reviewer Worthy suggested that the shaft angle (Subsection “Humerus”, etc) is perhaps increased by inclusion of the bicipital crest. The bicipital crest can be seen to join the shaft roughly co-level with the distal end of the deltopectoral crest, and thus the bicipital crest adds width to the ventral (here posteromedial) side of the shaft. Exclusion of the bicipital crest would lead to a lesser angle of the proximal section of the shaft relative to that more distally. Thus, using the ventral shaft margin as a proxy for shaft angle is not homologous between taxa that have a definite and enlarged bicipital crest and those that do not. A revision of definition of this metric would avoid this issue. Applies to the Discussion section as well.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct that the proximal ends of the humeri of <italic>Anchiornis, Sinornithosaurus</italic> and <italic>Microraptor</italic> are angled, but less than 30 percent. We already provided these values for Dromaeosauridae and <italic>Anchiornis</italic> in the Discussion section of the previous version. We added this comparison also to the description.</p><p>The bicipital crest (internal tuberosity in non-avialan theropods) is usually included in this measurement, so the values should be comparable.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Ulna – since the humerus is not fully preserved, it is not accurate to compare an estimated length and then derive comparisons. Compare proximal end of ulna to Anchiornis. Although caution is mentioned often, the distal ulna seems pretty crushed flat but still described heavily. The features described are only present in Archaeorhynchus or also present in other stem birds? Label the anteromedially directed ridge in Figure 6.</p></disp-quote><p>The most detailed description of <italic>Anchiornis</italic> (including photos) was provided by Pei et al., 2017. Unfortunately, they describe only a minor expansion and a reduced olecranon process, which is a common morphology in Maniraptora. Nothing is stated concerning the cotylae. Neither the figures in Pei et al., 2017 nor personal photos of various <italic>Anchiornis</italic> specimens taken by CF can help to add more comparison.</p><p>The distal expansion of the ulna is more common in Avialae, so we added more comparisons. It is also present in <italic>Archaeopteryx</italic>, but is less pronounced and more symmetrically shaped.</p><p>We have only described features of the distal ulna that can be established despite the crushing of the bone.</p><p>The ridge was labelled in the figure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Radius – compare longitudinal groove to that in enantiornithines.</p></disp-quote><p>We added a comparison into the description section and also discussed the presence of this character in the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Carpals – MC I seems to be broken and it was unlikely it was as short as described. MC II is thicker than I and III in Microraptor as well; also, Mc III is slightly offset proximally.</p></disp-quote><p>We noted in the description that Mc I is incomplete. How short this element was is everybody's guess; we only say that IF the position of the first phalanx indicates the distal end of this metacarpal (which is the case in several other similarly preserved theropod specimens), this element was very short. However, we did not use the possible length of this metacarpal for any formal analysis.</p><p>Unfortunately, we cannot evaluate this based on the scientific literature. Personal observations of several specimens by CF shows that the proximal end of MCI is strongly expanded in <italic>Microraptor</italic> (see also measurements provided by Hwang et al., 2002), while it becomes thinner distally. However, this is not the exact situation we found in <italic>Alcmonavis</italic> and <italic>Jeholornis</italic>. Generally, Mc II seems to be less robust in <italic>Microraptor</italic> than in <italic>Alcmonavis</italic>.</p><p>Because the metacarpus of <italic>Alcmonavis</italic> shows no signs of disarticulation, the offset position of Mc III most likely represents the actual situation. As already stated in the text, this morphology is present in many other Avialae, but also in several oviraptorids and dromaeosaurids (these comparisons were added to the text).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Digits – Digit I ungual largest in Anchiornis (see Pei et al., 2017);</p></disp-quote><p>The measurements provided for <italic>Anchiornis</italic> by Hu et al., 2009; Pei et al., 2017 and Guo et al., 2018 all show that the ungual of digit II is slightly longer than that of digit I. Personal observation of the holotype by CF confirms this.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>digit II phalanx 1 is certainly robust but it appears strongly exaggerated as preserved, as two surfaces are exposed and flattened so it appears to be a single exposed surface of a hyper-robust phalanx. If this is taken into account, then the proximal articular surface of the phalanx is slightly narrower than the matching articular surface on metacarpal II. I do not see this described convexity on the plantar surface of phalanx II-2. The flexed morphology described in the penultimate phalanges of digits I and II is very subtle, at best, and should be described as so.</p></disp-quote><p>We gave this character a lot of thought and scrutiny of the actual fossil. Although the phalanx might give the impression of two surfaces being exposed, this does not seem to be the case; especially at the proximal end we are confident that this is the true width of the phalanx, whereas the distal end seems to show some internal twist in the phalanx, giving the impression that both palmar and lateral surface are exposed. Again, however, detailed investigation of the specimen indicate that this is not due to compression, but largely reflects the true morphology (although some compression is evident, as stated in the description), with the distal articular surface being slightly twisted. We added a sentence on the preservation in the description.</p><p>Concerning the flexed morphology of the penultimate phalanges, we noted in the description that these elements are &quot;slightly bowed&quot; or &quot;slightly flexed&quot;. Furthermore, their morphology can be seen in the figure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Unguals – it is stated (Discussion section) that the unguals are larger (proportionately) in Archaeopteryx but if the ungual (not including horny sheaths which may or may not be complete or in situ) is compared to the length of the penultimate phalanx, they are proportionately larger in Alcomavis. A table of ratios would be helpful to further help illustrate differences between this specimen and other urvogels and closely related taxa. Confuciusornis does not show a reduction in manual claws from I to III (II is smallest). Since this specimen is larger than other Archaeopteryx specimens, the pronounced muscle attachments could be explained by ontogeny (as suggested by the authors themselves somewhat), especially given that the difference between these taxa is pretty minor if the robustness of phalanx II-1 is taken out.</p></disp-quote><p>Statistical comparisons with <italic>Archaeopteryx</italic> reveal that UI of the Altmühl specimen is relatively smaller compared to the Ulna, while UII is relatively smaller compared to the preungular phalanx, both on a significant level. In contrast, UI is not relatively smaller compared to PI-1, because the latter element is relatively shortened, too.</p><p>We corrected the observation concerning the claw reduction in <italic>Confuciusornis</italic>.</p><p>As morphology and relative size of the relevant muscle attachments sites on humerus and radius do not really vary throughout the different specimens of <italic>Archaeopteryx</italic>, ontogenetic variation would imply drastic morphological changes in the final phase of ontogeny. However, as growth curves of tetrapods usually have a logarithmic, inverted exponential or logistic shape (Karkach, 2006), significant shape changes are rather expected in the phase of early ontogeny. Therefore, we consider the differences as interspecific.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Advisability of creating a new nomen</p><p>Even if the new specimen can be shown to differ from other Archaeopteryx fossils in some features, it is contentious, and some would say not advisable to assign a name to these fragmentary remains. The past years have seen an inflation in new and rather poorly diagnosed Archaeopteryx-like avians from the Solnhofen limestone, and in light of the very fragmentary preservation of the fossil, the manuscript would be scientifically more rigorous if the authors opted against naming a new taxon.</p></disp-quote><p>We disagree with the reviewer that there is &quot;an inflation in new and rather poorly diagnosed <italic>Archaeopteryx</italic>-like avians from the Solnhofen limestone&quot; – on the contrary, there rather is a problem with the assumption that all avialian theropods from the Solnhofen Archipelago (please see the manuscript for why we prefer not to talk about the &quot;Solnhofen limestone&quot;) should be <italic>Archaeopteryx</italic>, as we now know that other, bird-like theropods were around in the Late Jurassic, as outlined by Rauhut et al., (2018) and in the current manuscript. Thus, in an attempt to better diagnose the genus <italic>Archaeopteryx</italic>, we realized that some specimens cannot be referred to this genus with certainty, and that one specimen, in particular (the Haarlem specimen), showed significant differences. As a species name was already available for this specimen, we thus proposed a new genus name, <italic>Ostromia</italic> (Foth and Rauhut 2017). However, this is the only non-archaeopterygid paravian theropod named from the Solnhofen Archipelago (and, as outlined, we only provided a new generic name for an existing species that can be shown to not fit in the genus <italic>Archaeopteryx</italic>), so this is hardly &quot;an inflation in new and rather poorly diagnosed <italic>Archaeopteryx</italic>-like avians&quot;.</p><p>Regarding the new specimen, we approached its study with the same premise: First we tried to clarify if the specimen can be referred to <italic>Archaeopteryx</italic> with any certainty. Apart from the general proportions – which, as outlined in the manuscript, do also not differ significantly from several other paravians and basal avialans – there is no reason to refer this specimen to the genus <italic>Archaeopteryx</italic>. As our detailed study of the specimen revealed several differences to all other specimens of <italic>Archaeopteryx</italic>, the character combination shown by this specimen is unique in theropods in general, and a phylogenetic analysis found this specimen in an intermediate position between <italic>Archaeopteryx</italic> and later avialans, we opted to create a new taxon, after considering alternative options for almost a year.</p><p>Fragmentary preservation is not in itself an argument against naming new taxa, as demonstrated by literally thousands of fossil vertebrate species (especially in palaeoornithology it is not unusual that new species are based even on single bones) – what matters is if a new taxon can be adequately diagnosed. As the character combination demonstrated by the new specimen is unique within theropods (as also supported by the phylogenetic analysis), we argue that this is the case for <italic>Alcmonavis</italic>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Phylogenetic analysis</p><p>The phylogenetic analysis is presented in rather a cursory way. It is unacceptable not to have support values in the presented phylogenetic trees. For example, it is misrepresentative to say the strict consensus is well resolved (subsection “Phylogenetic position of Alcmonavis”) yet not show the evidence that there is in fact very weak support for such resolution. At the very least Bremner support values should be given so that readers can see which of these clades has any semblance of support – one assumes that as no values are given and given the statement, that clade support is very low indeed – but readers deserve to be shown this, not have these data occluded. Ideally bootstrap values over 50% should be shown because anything less shows the clades are highly unstable and probably are not real in terms of evolutionary history. As presented, the placement of Alcmonavis is discussed as an afterthought in this section. Surely the focus should be on the new taxon and then use known taxa secondly to validate the tree.</p></disp-quote><p>We estimated bootstrap and Bremer support values for each node. Bootstrap values are generally low. For the equal-weight parsimony analysis, the phylogenetic position of <italic>Alcmonavis</italic> is supported by a Bremer support of 2, which is higher than for most other clades, including the phylogenetic position of <italic>Archaeopteryx</italic> (implied-weight parsimony leads to similar results). The support values for each node are shown for the strict consensus trees in the Supplementary file. The updated version of Figure 15. shows now the Bremer support values for the Avialae.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Given it is well established that missing data drive a taxon to the base of the clade in which it would otherwise reside (e.g., Sansom, 2015), some comment on the placement of the new taxon is warranted; why, what character evidence precludes that, for example, the new taxon really lies within Jelholornithidae or another slightly more derived position, than the node it appears in the tree? Character evidence for the critical nodes should be discussed, identifying the derived characters that place the new fossil in a more crownward position than Archaeopteryx.</p></disp-quote><p>In the Discussion section of the phylogeny, we listed the characters that support the more crownward position than <italic>Archaeopteryx</italic>.</p><p>We agree that it could be possible that the missing data places <italic>Alcmonavis</italic> closer to the base of Avialae. As the autapomorphies for the more derived position of <italic>Jeholornis, Sapeornis</italic> and co. are based mainly on forelimb characters, we believe that the phylogenetic position of <italic>Alcmonavis</italic> is robust.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Sansom, 2015.</p><p>The phylogenetic analyses should state which multistate characters were ordered (if any).</p></disp-quote><p>We provided a character list in the previous version.

Key to demonstrating the distinction from Archaeopteryx, are photos and or line drawings of the important elements of the new fossil in direct comparison with those of &quot;Archaeopteryx&quot; that explicitly show the differences in morphology and proportions. It is also desirable to add some figures, at least in Supplementary file, of key features of the new fossil directly compared with a meaningful selection of stem birds and non-avian maniraptorans to aid with comparison.</p></disp-quote><p>We added a figure comparing the outlines of humeri of several avialan theropods for comparison, plus a figure showing an actual specimen of <italic>Sapeornis</italic> in the taxonomic Discussion section. We furthermore added several basal paravian and basal avialan mani in the figure showing the manus of <italic>Archaeopteryx</italic> and changed part of the figure comparing the attachment area of the pectoralis muscle.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Tabular presentation of key data to facilitate comparison</p><p>Use of two more tables might facilitate comparisons better. For example, the section on Comments on the numbering and naming of avialan specimens from the Solnhofen Archipelago is useful, but quite long. Perhaps include the data in a table listing all 13 specimens, their current taxonomy, their numbers and correlative 'names' and institution, and include just a couple sentences to justify the new names for the eleventh to thirteenth specimens. If length is an issue then it could be in Supplementary file, but it is of more use to the audience in the main text, i.e. not lost/invisible in the Supplementary file.</p></disp-quote><p>As one of the peculiarities of <italic>Archaeopteryx</italic> is the use of the numbers of finds and colloquial names rather than the specimens numbers, even in the scientific literature, we think it to be important to clarify both the numbering and the colloquial names used. Tables with lists of specimens (up to the twelfth specimen) can be found in other publications (e.g. Rauhut et al., 2018), so simply adding three names to these lists seems rather redundant. It is furthermore important to point out that especially the numbering of specimens should be fixed, as current developments of taxonomic identifications or uncertainty make the numbering of <italic>Archaeopteryx</italic> specimens somewhat ambiguous (e.g. the twelfth specimen has been called eleventh specimen in the popular press in some cases, following the identification of the Haarlem specimen as a separate taxon).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Similarly, a table with comparative key measurements for the 12 Archaeopteryx specimens including ratios should also be provided, so demonstrating how similar this specimen is to other urvogel specimens.</p></disp-quote><p>Tables, showing the measurements of various are <italic>Archaeopteryx</italic> specimens are already available in Mayr et al., 2007 or Wellnhofer, 2009. However, we agree that for comparison it is useful to show those ratios, where <italic>Alcmonavis</italic> differs from <italic>Archaeopteryx</italic>, including T and p values. These values are shown in Table 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Discussion on possible flight mode of the fossil</p><p>This section is entirely speculative and not well substantiated. Various authors have detailed that flapping flight capabilities are unlikely for Archaeopteryx. The different morphology of the supracoracoideus muscle is just one argument contra flapping flight capabilities of Archaeopteryx, and the anatomy of Archaeopteryx does not show any evidence that this animal was capable of take-off through flapping flight (comparisons with extant pigeons certainly are not appropriate, as the latter have a completely different skeletal morphology than any Jurassic avians). Even though Voeten et al. recently proposed flapping flight capabilities of Archaeopteryx, their arguments based on the thickness of the bone cortex are far from compelling. Likewise, it is not clear why the presence of a tubercle for musculus biceps brachii on the radius would indicate flapping flight capabilities (so much the more as the presence/absence of this feature in other Archaeopteryx specimens is difficult to assess). Given the speculative nature of this interpretation, to include in the abstract a sentence like &quot;Several modifications, especially in muscle attachments related to the downstroke of the wing, indicate a rapid adaptation of the forelimb for active flapping flight in the early evolution of birds&quot; is not justified by the data (so much the more as the discussion is far less definitive).</p></disp-quote><p>We are aware that the flight mode of <italic>Archaeopteryx</italic> is still highly debated and many scientists favour a gliding flight as it costs less energy. Being familiar with the environment of the Solnhofen Archipelago, we would like to point out that the habitat of <italic>Archaeopteryx</italic> and Co. was an arid bush land with only a few small trees. Consequently, we find an arboreal life style with passive gliding flight for <italic>Archaeopteryx</italic> as often suggested rather unlikely.</p><p>The mentioned studies on the musculature of the pectoral girdle just show that the configuration was different in <italic>Archaeopteryx</italic> compared to modern volant birds (it was probably more similar to that of ostriches). If these differences really prevent flapping movements in <italic>Archaeopteryx</italic> is speculative (ostriches are still able to flap their forelimbs). 3D reconstructions of the shoulder girdle and forelimb of <italic>Archaeopteryx</italic>, based on a synchrotron scan of the well-preserved Thermopolis specimen, indicate that <italic>Archaeopteryx</italic> was actually able to perform a wing stroke (Carney, 2016; Heers and Carney, 2017). Due to different muscle configurations the flight stroke was certainly not as well “optimized” than in modern volant birds, but already possible. In the revised version, we cite a couple of recent studies supporting our case.</p><p>Showing the presence of the <italic>tuberculum bicipitale radii</italic> in three specimens of <italic>Archaeopteryx</italic>, we do not know why this character is controversial for <italic>Archaeopteryx</italic>. In other specimens the structure is simply not visible due to the orientation of the radius or overlap of matrix or other bones.</p><p>To avoid confusion, we never compared the flight performance of <italic>Archaeopteryx</italic> or <italic>Alcmonavis</italic> with that of pigeons. We cited the relevant study, because it shows, which muscles are active during different phases of a wing stroke in modern volant birds. Using this as an analogue, we hypothesize that the presence of <italic>tuberculum bicipitale radii</italic> indicates a stronger <italic>m. biceps brachii</italic>. We believe that this is related to active movements during flight, because for gliding the wing just need to act as passive airfoil and does not require such modifications in the elbow.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Given the great similarities of the general skeletal architecture of this fragmentary wing to the known Archaeopteryx remains (three unfused metacarpals with large ungual phalanges, similar phalangeal proportions etc.), it is highly unlikely that substantial differences in flight mode to Archaeopteryx existed. The speculative nature of this discussion and interpretation should be addressed.</p></disp-quote><p>We already made a very detailed comparison to <italic>Archaeopteryx</italic> regarding the enlarged muscle attachment sites present in <italic>Alcmonavis</italic>. Assuming that these areas are associated with stronger muscles, an improvement of the flight ability is likely. Please note, that we never claimed that the flight mode of <italic>Alcmonavis</italic> is substantially different from <italic>Archaeopteryx</italic> (we apologize if the term “rapid” may has caused this impression).</p><p>Applying the logic of the argument, no improvement for the flight ability of <italic>Confuciusornis</italic> is to be expected either, as it has three unfused metacarpals with large ungual phalanges, and more or less similar phalangeal proportions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Biogeographic interpretations.</p><p>These speculations towards the end of the manuscript should be deleted altogether.</p></disp-quote><p>We deleted the Conclusions section.</p></body></sub-article></article>
