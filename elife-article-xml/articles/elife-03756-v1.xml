diaphragm, using a single vesicle–vesicle lipid/content mixing assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Diao et al., 2012</xref>). When complexin-1 was included, a more pronounced Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered fusion burst was observed, effectively synchronizing the process. Here we show that complexin-1 also reduces spontaneous fusion in the same assay. Moreover, distinct effects of several complexin-1 truncation mutants on spontaneous and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered fusion closely mimic those observed in neuronal cultures. The very N-terminal domain is essential for synchronization of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered fusion, but not for suppression of spontaneous fusion, whereas the opposite is true for the C-terminal domain. By systematically varying the complexin-1 concentration, we observed differences in titration behavior for spontaneous and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered fusion. Taken together, complexin-1 utilizes distinct mechanisms for synchronization of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered fusion and inhibition of spontaneous fusion.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03756.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03756.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>synaptic vesicle fusion</kwd><kwd>neurotransmitter release</kwd><kwd>complexin</kwd><kwd>synaptotagmin</kwd><kwd>SNARE</kwd><kwd>membrane fusion</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brunger</surname><given-names>Axel T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R37-MH63105</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brunger</surname><given-names>Axel T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Building on previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Diao et al., 2012</xref>), we show that the mechanism by which complexin suppresses spontaneous fusion is distinct from the mechanism by which it synchronizes Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered fusion.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Synaptic proteins orchestrate Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered membrane fusion between synaptic vesicles and the plasma membrane, leading to neurotransmitter release upon an action potential. Key players are neuronal soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptors (SNAREs) synaptobrevin-2/VAMP2 (Vesicle Associated Membrane Protein), syntaxin-1A, and SNAP-25A (Synaptosomal-Associated Protein 25); synaptotagmin; complexin; Munc-18/Sec1, and Munc13 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Südhof and Rothman, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Jahn and Fasshauer, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Südhof, 2013</xref>). While it is well established that SNARE proteins provide the minimal energy to drive membrane fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Weber et al., 1998</xref>) and synaptotagmin-1 is the Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor for fast synchronous release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fernández-Chacón et al., 2001</xref>), the molecular mechanisms of complexin, Munc18, and Munc13 are less certain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kümmel et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Li et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ma et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Trimbuch et al., 2014</xref>). Moreover, the molecular events and protein conformational changes that accomplish Ca<sup>2+</sup>-regulated, fast membrane fusion are still unknown. In this Research Advance we focus on the mechanisms of complexin.</p><p>Complexin is a small soluble protein of 134 residues found mainly in the presynaptic terminal. Studies in cortical neuronal cultures revealed that complexin 'activates' fast synchronous release and inhibits spontaneous ‘mini’ release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Maximov et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kaeser-Woo et al., 2012</xref>); these studies used RNA-interference double-knockdown of both complexin-1 and complexin-2 isoforms combined with rescue by various truncation and point mutants of complexin-1. In contrast, complexin double-knockout mice showed impairment of both synchronous and spontaneous release in hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Reim et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Xue et al., 2010</xref>). At variance, a complexin double-knockout in <italic>Drosophila</italic> impaired synchronous release but enhanced spontaneous release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Xue et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Jorquera et al., 2012</xref>). Overexpression of complexin-1 in PC12 cells suppressed both K<sup>+</sup>-dependent acetylcholine release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Itakura et al., 1999</xref>) and evoked release in chromaffin cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Archer et al., 2002</xref>). Moreover, expressing synaptobrevin-fused complexin-1 in cultured cortical neurons substantially diminished both spontaneous and evoked neurotransmitter release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Tang et al., 2006</xref>). Taken together, a consensus has emerged that the two main physiological functions of complexin in neurons at <italic>normal</italic> expression levels consist of activation of synchronous release and suppression of spontaneous release.</p><p>Complexin has four domains that are involved in the two main physiological functions of complexin in neurons. The N-terminal domain (residues 1–27) of complexin-1 activates fast synchronous release whereas the accessory helix domain (residues 28–48) is critical for suppressing spontaneous release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Maximov et al., 2009</xref>). The α-helical SNARE binding domain of complexin-1 (residues 49–70) is essential for all physiological functions; it binds to the groove between the synaptobrevin-2 and syntaxin-1A α-helices in the core part of the neuronal SNARE complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Chen et al., 2002</xref>). The C-terminal domain (residues 71–134) has a role in suppressing spontaneous release, but it is expendable for evoked release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kaeser-Woo et al., 2012</xref>). The C-terminal domain also promotes vesicle priming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kaeser-Woo et al., 2012</xref>) and binding to anionic membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Diao et al., 2013b</xref>).</p><p>Previously, we used a single vesicle–vesicle lipid/content mixing assay with reconstituted neuronal SNAREs, synaptotagmin-1, and complexin-1 to decipher the membrane states upon Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggering, and we found that the presence of complexin-1 greatly enhances the burst of fusion events upon Ca<sup>2+</sup>-injection, that is, complexin-1 effectively synchronizes Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered fusion in our minimal system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Diao et al., 2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>In this Research Advance, we extended our single vesicle–vesicle content mixing assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Diao et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kyoung et al., 2013</xref>) by monitoring both spontaneous and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered fusion during the same observation cascade (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and ‘Materials and methods’).

The association of an SV vesicle to a surface-immobilized PM vesicle is characterized by fluorescence intensity increases during the 1 min period after initial SV vesicle loading. Spontaneous and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered fusion events are characterized by a subsequent stepwise increase of the content dye fluorescence intensity during the respective 1 min observation periods. The time point of the arrival of Ca<sup>2+</sup> is determined by the appearance of fluorescence intensity from soluble Cy5 dyes that are part of the injected solution (bottom trace).</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03756.004">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03756.004</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-03756-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig></p><p>As before, we observed that complexin-1 synchronizes Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered fusion together with synaptotagmin-1 and neuronal SNAREs, producing a higher amplitude upon Ca<sup>2+</sup> triggering (the probability of fusion per associated vesicle in the first 1-sec time bin upon Ca<sup>2+</sup>-injection with and without complexin-1 is 1.7% and 0.6%, respectively) and a faster decay rate (with complexin-1: 0.43 s<sup>−1</sup>, without complexin-1: 0.11 s<sup>−1</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), in qualitative agreement with studies of cultured cortical mouse neurons and in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Reim et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Maximov et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Xue et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Jorquera et al., 2012</xref>).

Thus, in the presence of complexin-1, the ratio of the probability of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered fusion is 85 times higher than the probability of spontaneous fusion, whereas in the absence of complexin this ratio is only 6; so complexin increases this ratio more than ten fold.<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03756.002</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Complexin-1 synchronizes Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered fusion and inhibits spontaneous fusion in concert with synaptotagmin-1 and neuronal SNAREs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold> and <bold>B</bold>) Probability of fusion vs time upon 500 μM Ca<sup>2+</sup>-injection and spontaneous fusion, both in the presence of full-length synaptotagmin-1 and neuronal SNAREs, but with and without 2 μM complexin-1 (Cpx) as indicated.

The probability of spontaneous fusion was determined by counting the number of associated SV vesicles that underwent fusion during the spontaneous fusion periods during multiple repeat experiments; the higher the number in the bar chart, the more spontaneous fusion events occurred (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>). To assess the degree of synchronization of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered fusion events we determined the rate of the decay of the respective fusion histograms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>) and also plotted the amplitude of the histograms upon Ca<sup>2+</sup>-injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>); the higher the numbers in these respective bar charts, the more synchronization occurs. For comparison of these quantities, we normalized panels E and G, and used the same concentration for wild type and the complexin-1 mutants (2 μM).</p><p>We found that the central SNARE-binding domain of complexin-1 is essential for both spontaneous and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered fusion since mutation of four residues in that domain (R48A, R59A, K69A, Y70A, C105A, termed ‘4M’ mutant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Maximov et al., 2009</xref>]) is similar to the control without complexin-1 (compare first and last columns in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D–G</xref>). The N-terminal domain is essential for synchronization of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered fusion, but not for the suppression of spontaneous fusion (third columns in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D–G</xref>). The opposite is true for the C-terminal domain: it is essential for suppressing spontaneous fusion, but not for synchronization (fifth columns in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D–G</xref>). Moreover, the accessory domain is essential for the suppression of spontaneous fusion (fourth columns in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D–G</xref>). All these results are in excellent qualitative agreement with studies performed with cultured cortical neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Maximov et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kaeser-Woo et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>We next studied the effect of complexin-1 on spontaneous and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered fusion as a function of complexin-1 concentration ranging from 0–2 μM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>). The suppression of spontaneous fusion by complexin-1 becomes significant between 100 and 500 nM complexin-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).

As a control, addition of an excess of the soluble fragment of synaptobrevin-2 (a.a. 1–96) reduced the association between SV and PM vesicles to background levels even at the highest complexin-1 concentration tested (2 μM), indicating that complexin-1 alone does not cause significant SV-PM vesicle association (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, right-most column).<fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03756.005</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Suppression of spontaneous fusion and synchronization of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered fusion vs complexin-1 concentration (in concert with synaptotagmin-1 and neuronal SNAREs).</title><p>The bar graphs show the effect of wildtype complexin-1 at specified concentrations on SV-PM vesicle association (<bold>A</bold>), the number of spontaneous fusion events divided by the number of associated SV vesicles (<bold>B</bold>), the decay rate of the histogram of fusion events upon Ca<sup>2+</sup>-injection (<bold>C</bold>), and the amplitude of the first 1-sec time bin upon Ca<sup>2+</sup>-injection (<bold>D</bold>).

Our assay qualitatively reproduces the effects of complexin-1 and key mutations on both spontaneous release and evoked release that have been observed in cortical neuronal cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Maximov et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kaeser-Woo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p>Previous reconstituted assays of complexin function led to some apparently conflicting conclusions. For example, complexin-1 suppressed SNARE-mediated content-mixing in a cell-based assay, and the combination of synaptotagmin-1 and Ca<sup>2+</sup> reversed this effect, albeit on a very slow time scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Giraudo et al., 2009</xref>). Complexin-1 promoted both spontaneous and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered lipid mixing using a single vesicle–vesicle lipid-mixing assay together with neuronal SNAREs, but, surprisingly, in the absence of synaptotagmin-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Yoon et al., 2008</xref>). In contrast, complexin-1, together with neuronal SNAREs and synaptotagmin-1, reduced Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent lipid-mixing and it enhanced Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered lipid mixing using an ensemble assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Malsam et al., 2012</xref>). Moreover, this ensemble fluorescence study revealed enhanced lipid-mixing upon Ca<sup>2+</sup> triggering with a complexin-1 fragment without the N-terminal and accessory domains. Thus, this lipid-mixing result does not correlate with the observation that the N-terminus of complexin-1 is essential for activation of fast synchronous release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Maximov et al., 2009</xref>). In contrast, our single vesicle–vesicle content-mixing assay correlates well with the physiological data since the N-terminal and accessory domains are required for synchronization of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered fusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F,G</xref>). In retrospect, many previous studies suffered from the lack of a genuine content mixing indicator and the use of an ensemble method that cannot distinguish between effects due to vesicle association and fusion, see discussion in refs. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Diao et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">2013c</xref>). Our single vesicle–vesicle content mixing assay addresses both limitations. Another single vesicle–vesicle content mixing assay was also developed using a much larger probe (dual-labeled DNA hairpin) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Diao et al., 2010</xref>); using this assay, accelerated fusion pore expansion by complexin-1 was observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lai et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Our single vesicle–vesicle content mixing assay revealed that the effect of complexin-1 on synchronization of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered fusion becomes significant between 50 and 100 nM, well above the k<sub>D</sub> of the interaction between complexin-1 and the ternary SNARE complex of ∼10 nM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Xu et al., 2013</xref>), yet the effect on spontaneous fusion becomes only significant at higher complexin concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Models of complexin function have primarily focused on a clamping or hindrance mechanism that restricts spontaneous release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Giraudo et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Krishnakumar et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kümmel et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Li et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Trimbuch et al., 2014</xref>), along with a model that combined the clamping role with the facilitation/synchronization role of complexin-1 and, in particular, its N-terminal domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Xue et al., 2010</xref>). However, if the same mechanism would facilitate synchronization as well, one would expect identical behaviors as the concentration of complexin-1 is increased. Yet, the different titration behaviors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) suggest that there are differences in mechanisms for synchronization of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered fusion and for suppressing spontaneous fusion. Moreover, genetic manipulations of the single complexin homolog in <italic>Drosophila</italic> show that the suppression and synchronization functions are genetically separable, also supporting the notion of distinct mechanisms in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Cho et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Complexin-1 and binary (syntaxin-1A/SNAP-25) SNARE complex interact weakly, as measured by a pull-down assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">McMahon et al., 1995</xref>) and by single molecule experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Weninger et al., 2008</xref>), although studies by ITC and fluorescence anisotropy did not reveal a significant interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Pabst et al., 2002</xref>). The dissociation constant of an interaction between the accessory helical domain and a partially assembled SNARE complex had been measured to be in the low μM range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kümmel et al., 2011</xref>) although a re-examination of this interaction has cast doubt on the original derivation of that estimate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Trimbuch et al., 2014</xref>). Finally, the C-terminus of complexin-1 interacts with anionic membranes, but no estimate for the affinity is available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Diao et al., 2013b</xref>). In any case, the C-terminus is not essential for the synchronization function of complexin-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). It is of course possible that the weak interactions between complexin-1 and the binary complex or partially folded SNARE complex and the membrane become more significant in the context of molecular crowding at the membrane point contact.</p><p>Taken together, we propose that the synchronization function of complexin-1 is primarily driven by the core interaction with the SNARE complex in concert with the N-terminal domain and with possible assistance from the accessory domain. The suppression of spontaneous fusion also requires the core interaction and the accessory domain. However, in contrast to synchronization, suppression of spontaneous fusion involves membrane binding by the C-terminal domain of complexin-1, but the N-terminal domain is not involved. These distinct roles of the N- and C-terminal domains may explain the different titration behaviors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) and suggest distinct mechanisms for both functions of complexin-1.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Protein purification</title><sec id="s4-1-1"><title>Synaptobrevin and syntaxin</title><p>Full-length, cysteine-free rat synaptobrevin-2 (VAMP2) and rat syntaxin-1A (Stx1a) were prepared using the same protocols.

The protein concentration was measured by absorbance at 280 nm and aliquots were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Protein reconstitution</title><p>We used the same membrane compositions and protein densities as in our previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Diao et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kyoung et al., 2013</xref>). Likewise, the reconstitution protocol was similar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kyoung et al., 2013</xref>) with several changes: the concentration of 2-mercaptoethanol in the dialysis and vesicle-free buffers was changed from 1% to 0.1%, an extra dialysis step was added to ensure removal of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and detergent, all dialysis buffers contained 0.8 g/l Chelex 100 resin (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) and 2.5 g/l Bio-beads SM2 (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA), and the Sepharose CL-4B column (GE Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden) was packed under constant pressure.</p><p>Briefly, SV vesicles were reconstituted with both synaptotagmin-1 and synaptobrevin-2 (except for specified conditions in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> were SV vesicles were only reconstituted with synaptobrevin-2), while PM vesicles were reconstituted with syntaxin-1A and SNAP-25A, using the previously described lipid compositions. The protein-to-lipid ratios used were 1:200 for synaptobrevin-2 and syntaxin-1A, and 1:1000 for synaptotagmin-1. A 3–5-fold excess of SNAP-25 (with respect to syntaxin-1A) and 3.5 mol% PIP<sub>2</sub> were added to the protein-lipid mixture for PM vesicles only. Dried lipid films were dissolved in 110 mM OG buffer containing purified proteins. Detergent-free buffer (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 90 mM NaCl, 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol) was then added to the protein-lipid mixture until the detergent concentration reached the critical micelle concentration of 24.4 mM. The vesicles were then subjected to size exclusion chromatography using a Sepharose CL-4B column, packed under near constant pressure by gravity with a peristaltic pump (GE Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden) in a 5 ml column with a 2 ml bed volume, that was equilibrated with <italic>buffer V</italic> (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 90 mM NaCl, 20 µM EGTA, 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol) followed by dialysis into 2 l of detergent-free buffer V supplemented with 5 g of Bio-beads SM2 and 0.8 g/l Chelex 100 resin. After 4 hr, the buffer was changed with 2 l of fresh buffer V containing Bio-beads and Chelex, and dialysis continued for 12 hr. During the preparation of SV vesicles, 50 mM sulforhodamine B (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) was present in all solutions prior to the size exclusion chromatography step. As described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kyoung et al., 2011</xref>), the presence and purity of reconstituted proteins was confirmed by SDS-PAGE of the vesicle preparations, and the directionality of the membrane proteins (facing outward) was assessed by chymotrypsin digestion followed by SDS-PAGE. The size distributions of the SV and PM vesicles were analyzed by cryo-EM, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Diao et al., 2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Single vesicle–vesicle content-mixing assay</title><sec id="s4-3-1"><title>Overview</title><p>SV vesicles were labeled with a soluble fluorescent content dye at a moderately self-quenching concentration; for simplicity in this work we did not include a lipid-dye since we were exclusively interested in the exchange of content, the correlation for neurotransmitter release. The PM vesicles were immobilized on a surface that was passivated with polyethylene glycol (PEG) and functionalized via streptavidin-biotin linkages. SV vesicles were then added in the absence or presence of complexin-1 at the specified concentration. At variance with our previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Diao et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kyoung et al., 2013</xref>) where we incubated the SV vesicles for 20 min, we directly started monitoring the arrival of SV vesicles to surface-immobilized PM vesicles during the first minute acquisition period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, we refer to this as the vesicle association period—we prefer not to use the term ‘docking’ since it has a different meaning during the lifecycle of a synaptic vesicle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Südhof, 2013</xref>]). A stepwise increase in fluorescence emission of a spot in the field of view indicated the formation of a SV-PM vesicle pair during the vesicle association period.</p><p>Unbound SV vesicles were then removed through extensive washing with vesicle-free buffer, while continuing real-time observation of the fluorescence intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>); consequently we did not observe any additional SV-PM vesicle associations after the washing step. While continuing the observation for another one-minute period, a second step-wise increase of fluorescence intensity appeared for some fraction of the associated SV vesicles, which indicated Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent, that is, spontaneous fusion events (referred to has the spontaneous fusion period). Next, we injected 500 μM Ca<sup>2+</sup> solution, and continued monitoring for another minute, referred to as the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered fusion period. For associated SV vesicles that did not undergo spontaneous fusion during the second period, a step-wise increase in fluorescence intensity during the third period indicated a Ca<sup>2+</sup> triggered fusion event. To determine the temporal arrival of Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the evanescent field of our TIR microscope setup, soluble Cy5 dye was added with the Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffer to monitor the emergence of fluorescence intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, bottom panel). Thus, our improved single vesicle–vesicle assay enables one to monitor the association of SV vesicles, spontaneous, and Ca<sup>2+</sup> triggered fusion events during the same data acquisition. Our system is thus ideally suited to study the opposing functions of complexin on SV-PM vesicle association, spontaneous release, and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered release.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-2"><title>Details</title><p>Surface passivation of quartz slides was performed by coating the surface with polyethylene glycol (PEG) molecules to eliminate non-specific binding of vesicles. The same protocol and quality controls (surface coverage and non-specific binding) were used as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Diao et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kyoung et al., 2013</xref>), except that PEG-SVA (Laysan Bio, Inc.) instead of mPEG-SCM (Laysan Bio, Inc.) was used since it has a longer half life. The surface was functionalized by inclusion of biotin-PEG during pegylation. A quartz slide was assembled into a flow chamber and incubated with neutravidin (0.1 mg/ml). Biotinylated PM vesicles (100× dilution) were immobilized by incubation at room temperature (∼25°C) for 30 min, followed by three rounds of washing with 120 µl buffer V, in order to remove unbound PM vesicles; each buffer wash effectively replaces the (∼3 µl) flow chamber volume &gt;100 times. Consequently, we did not observe any additional SV-PM vesicle association events during the subsequent observation periods. Upon the start of illumination and recording of the fluorescence from a particular field of view of the flow chamber, SV vesicles (diluted 100 to 1000 times) were loaded into the flow chamber to directly monitor vesicle association of SV vesicles to PM vesicles for one minute; when complexin-1 was included in a particular experiment, it was added concurrently together with the SV vesicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). While continuing the recording, the flow chamber was washed three times with 120 µl of buffer V (including complexin-1 at the specified concentration, if applicable) in order to remove unbound SV vesicles. Subsequently, we continued recording for another minute to monitor spontaneous fusion events. To initiate Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered fusion events within the same field of view, a solution consisting of buffer V, 500 µM Ca<sup>2+</sup>, 500 nM Cy5 dye molecules (used as an indicator for the arrival of Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the evanescent field), and, if applicable, complexin-1 was injected into the flow chamber. The injection was performed at a speed of 66 µl/s by a motorized syringe pump (Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA) using a withdrawal method similar to the one described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kyoung et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>In our previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Diao et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kyoung et al., 2013</xref>), we used each flow chamber to monitor just one round of fusion events, which limited the throughput of individual studies and wasted most of the sample in the flow chamber. In order to increase the throughput of the assay and make better use of the vesicle samples, after intensive washing (3 × 120 µl) with buffer V containing 20 μM EGTA to remove Ca<sup>2+</sup> from the sample chamber, we repeated the entire acquisition procedure (vesicle association, spontaneous fusion, and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered fusion) in a different imaging area within the same flow chamber. This process was repeated for a total of five rounds. SV vesicles were diluted 1000× for the first and second repeat rounds, 200× for the third and fourth repeat rounds, and 100× for the fifth repeat round in order to offset the slightly increasing saturation of the surface with SV vesicles.</p><p>All experiments were performed on a prism-type total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscope using 532 nm (green) laser (CrystaLaser, Reno, NV) excitation. Two observation channels were created by a 640 nm single-edge dichroic beamsplitter (FF640-FDi01-25x36, Shemrock, Rochester, NY): one channel was used for the fluorescence emission intensity of the content dyes and the other one for that of the Cy5 dyes that are part of the injected Ca<sup>2+</sup>-solution. The two channels were recorded on two adjacent rectangular areas (45 × 90 μm<sup>2</sup>) of a charged-coupled device (CCD) camera (iXon+ DV 897E, Andor Technology USA, South Windsor CT). The imaging data were recorded with the smCamera software from Taekjip Ha's group at the University of Illinois. Our procedure resulted in a time series of images over a total of three minutes, consisting of the subsequent 1-min periods of vesicle association, spontaneous, and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered fusion, plus 5 s intervals for buffer exchanges. The arrival time of Ca<sup>2+</sup> was determined by monitoring of the Cy5 channel.</p><p>Fluorescent spots in the content dye channel were detected, but only those spots were analyzed that showed exactly one stepwise increase during the immediately preceding vesicle association period; this procedure excludes SV vesicles that were already associated during a previous round when performing repeat experiments using the same flow chamber. Stepwise increases in the fluorescence intensity time traces (examples shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) were automatically detected by the computer program described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Diao et al., 2013c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kyoung et al., 2013</xref>) and manually checked to ensure correct performance of the automated procedure. Histograms for spontaneous and triggered fusion event occurrence were plotted with a time bin of 1 s and fitted to a single exponential decay function. We did not observe any instances of SV-PM vesicle associations that showed more than one stepwise increase of the content dye fluorescence intensity during the observation periods. In other words, at most one fusion event was observed per associated SV-PM vesicle pair, consistent with the notion that each diffraction limited spot corresponds to a single pair of SV-PM vesicles rather than multiple SV vesicles docked to one PM vesicle.</p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Brandon Choi for discussions and critical reading

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Randy Schekman (Senior editor) and 3 reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The following individuals responsible for the peer review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Richard Aldrich (Reviewing editor); James Rothman, and Yeon-Kyun Shin (peer reviewers).</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>In this short report, Brunger and colleagues have elegantly extended their single vesicle content mixing assay to monitor vesicle recruitment (docking) and spontaneous fusion along calcium triggered fusion events. The work is technically difficult, and we have nothing but admiration for their success in doing so in this in vitro system. Using a soluble self-quenched fluorescent dye inside a vesicle that mimics the synaptic vesicles, they continuously monitor the recruitment of the vesicles (first 1 min acquisition), the spontaneous, calcium-independent fusion events (second 1 min acquisition) and the calcium-triggered fusion events triggered by injection of 500 µM calcium (third 1 min acquisition). They find that complexin increases the number of vesicles associated, suppresses spontaneous release and synchronizes calcium-triggered release. Mutations/truncation studies allow them to identify the role of different domains and these results in good agreement with previous studies done in cultured neurons. Lastly, they examine the effect of complexin concentration and report a different titration behavior for spontaneous release as compared to calcium-triggered release. Based on this they conclude that the complexin inhibits spontaneous release and calcium-triggered release via different mechanism.</p><p>What is new and interesting here is that the authors were able to observe the inhibition of content mixing in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>. One other interesting observation is that the requirement of the very N-terminal region for the acceleration of vesicle fusion, which was previously observed by Sudhof and coworkers in cultured neurons. The results are the nice follow-up of the authors' previous work on complexin 1 and should be interesting to broad readership of <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>The following issues must be adequately addressed in a revised manuscript.</p><p>1) The notion that complexin inhibits spontaneous and calcium triggered release by different mechanisms is entirely rooted in the purportedly different concentration dependencies of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B vs 3C/3D</xref>. This difference, if it exists, is rather small. The mid-points of the two curves are at about the same concentration of complexin, given the errors involved (indicated by the error bars). The authors should strongly tone down (including in the title) the conclusion of the paper especially since they also report that the same small domain/s in complexin are involved in suppressing spontaneous release and synchronizing Ca<sup>2+</sup> release.</p><p>2) Significant technical point: The first 1 min of acquisition period is assigned as the 'vesicle association period' and the number of vesicles recruited shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2 fig3">Figure 2D &amp; 3A</xref> correspond to the 1 min time point. Are all docking events completed within that 1 min period? Or does docking continue beyond this time point even though un-docked vesicles are removed with a buffer wash? This is critical since the data shown in both <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2 fig3">Figures 2 and 3</xref> are normalized to the number of associated vesicles. The spontaneous and calcium-triggered events are recorded in in the same observation cascade (the former after ∼1 min and later after ∼2 min) and if docking continues beyond the marked association period, then it could significantly alter the normalized data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2 fig3">Figures 2 &amp; 3</xref>.</p><p>3) For the detection of spontaneous fusion the authors counted content mixed vesicle pairs during the first 1 min. We recommend that they run the experiment for several more minutes to increase the credibility of the data. Also, the experiment should be let to go all the way through to the end to see if the cumulative results actually saturate</p><p>4) Several years back Chapman and coworkers have proposed the possibility that synaptotagmin 1, instead of complexin, has the capacity of clamping SNARE-dependent membrane fusion. In this regards, the authors must test if this is the case with their in vitro experiments.

This difference, if it exists, is rather small. The mid-points of the two curves are at about the same concentration of complexin, given the errors involved (indicated by the error bars).

In response to their concerns we performed statistical significance tests of the titrations shows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B-D</xref>. We found that the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered synchronization and amplitude exhibits a statistically significant increase between 50 and 100 nM complexin. In contrast, there is a statistically significant decrease of spontaneous fusion between 100 and 500 nM complexin. Thus, the difference in titration behaviors for spontaneous and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered fusion is significant with a roughly ten-fold concentration difference in the most sensitive complexin concentration. Moreover, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> shows that the N-terminus, but not the C-terminus is essential for complexin’s effect on synchronization, but the reverse is true for complexin’s suppression of spontaneous fusion. Thus, we still feel that our data collectively suggest differences in mechanisms for these two functions. Moreover, genetic manipulations of the single complexin homolog in <italic>Drosophila</italic> show that the suppression and synchronization functions are genetically separable, also supporting the notion of distinct molecular mechanisms (PNAS 111, 10317-10322, 2014). Nevertheless we have softened and clarified the statements related to this point throughout the paper.</p><p><italic>2) Significant technical point: The first 1 min of acquisition period is assigned as the 'vesicle association period' and the number of vesicles recruited shown in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2 fig3"><italic>Figure 2D &amp; 3A</italic></xref> <italic>correspond to the 1 min time point. Are all docking events completed within that 1 min period? Or does docking continue beyond this time point even though un-docked vesicles are removed with a buffer wash? This is critical since the data shown in both</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2 fig3"><italic>Figures 2 and 3</italic></xref> <italic>are normalized to the number of associated vesicles. The spontaneous and calcium-triggered events are recorded in in the same observation cascade (the former after ∼1 min and later after ∼2 min) and if docking continues beyond the marked association period, then it could significantly alter the normalized data shown in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2 fig3"><italic>Figures 2 &amp; 3</italic></xref>.</p><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment that has been prompted by a rather terse description of the methods that we used. First, to avoid confusion we have changed the term “vesicle buffer” to “buffer V”. Please note that this is buffer only, with no vesicles. Thus, after the 1 minute observation time we wash out any free vesicles. Our washing procedure was as follows: while continuing the recording the flow chamber (∼ 3 μL) was washed three times with 120 μL of buffer V (including complexin at the specified concentration, if applicable) in order to remove unbound SV vesicles; thus each wash exchanges the sample volume roughly a hundred times. Consequently, we did not observe any additional docking events during the subsequent fusion observation periods. The normalization in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2F-G</xref> and 3B-D used the number of events during the association period. Moreover, only those single vesicle-vesicle fluorescence intensity traces that exhibited a distinct event during the association period were analyzed for fusion events during the subsequent observation periods. We have added these explanations to the Materials and Methods section and the main text.</p><p><italic>3) For the detection of spontaneous fusion the authors counted content mixed vesicle pairs during the first 1 min. We recommend that they run the experiment for several more minutes to increase the credibility of the data. Also, the experiment should be let to go all the way through to the end to see if the cumulative results actually saturate</italic>.</p><p>Unfortunately, photobleaching prevented us from continuing monitoring fluorescence intensity past ∼1 minute period. Instead, we performed multiple repeat experiments, leading to statistically significant differences in spontaneous fusion probabilities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2 fig3">Figures 2E, 3B</xref>).</p><p><italic>4) Several years back Chapman and coworkers have proposed the possibility that synaptotagmin 1, instead of complexin, has the capacity of clamping SNARE-dependent membrane fusion. In this regards, the authors must test if this is the case with their in vitro experiments. The authors must carry out the control experiments without synaptotagmin 1 to examine the effect of complexin 1 on SNAREs in the absence synaptotagmin 1</italic>.</p><p>We thank the reviewers for the suggestion and performed experiments with and without synaptotagmin as well as with and without wildtype complexin (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and associated discussion in the text). We do not find evidence for a clamping role of synaptotagmin in our system.</p><p><italic>5) Effects of complexin 1 and one of its mutant on vesicle content mixing were previously examined by the same first author published in PNAS (2013).
