Most global analyses of the innate immune response have focused on transcription induced by defined immunostimulatory ligands, such as lipopolysaccharide. However, the response to pathogens involves additional complexity, as pathogens interfere with virtually every step of gene expression. How cells respond to pathogen-mediated disruption of gene expression to nevertheless initiate protective responses remains unclear. We previously discovered that a pathogen-mediated blockade of host protein synthesis provokes the production of specific pro-inflammatory cytokines. It remains unclear how these cytokines are produced despite the global pathogen-induced block of translation. We addressed this question by using parallel RNAseq and ribosome profiling to characterize the response of macrophages to infection with the intracellular bacterial pathogen <italic>Legionella pneumophila</italic>. Our results reveal that mRNA superinduction is required for the inducible immune response to a bacterial pathogen.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.22707.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.22707.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22707.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>We are constantly exposed to microbes that are capable of causing disease, but our immune system is generally able to protect us by producing specific proteins that help kill the microbes. In response, many infectious microbes have developed ways to obstruct the immune system of their host. For example, a bacterium called <italic>Legionella pneumophila</italic> – which can cause serious lung infections – blocks the ability of host immune cells to generate new proteins.</p><p>To make a new protein, genetic information in the form of DNA is first copied to make molecules called messenger ribonucleic acids (or mRNAs for short). These molecules are then used as templates to make the protein. Despite the fact that <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> is capable of interfering with this vital process, the host is still able to mount a protective immune response. It was not clear how this is possible.</p><p>To address this question, Barry et al. studied immune cells from mice that had been infected with <italic>L. pneumophila</italic>. The experiments show that these immune cells produce large amounts of mRNAs that correspond to proteins needed for the immune response. These mRNAs overwhelm the protein production block imposed by the bacteria, allowing the immune cells to produce these proteins and trigger an immune response.</p><p>The experiments suggest that, in response to microbes that block the production of proteins, changes in the amount of mRNA in a cell are the strongest indicators of how much protein the cells will be able to produce. These findings shed new light onto how the immune system can overcome interference by microbes to protect the host.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.22707.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.22707.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd><italic>Legionella pneumophila</italic></kwd><kwd>translation</kwd><kwd>ribosome profiling</kwd><kwd>macrophages</kwd><kwd>innate immunity</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000884</institution-id><institution>Cancer Research Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Barry</surname><given-names>Kevin C</given-names></name><name><surname>Vance</surname><given-names>Russell E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007909</institution-id><institution>Fibrolamellar Cancer Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Barry</surname><given-names>Kevin C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CA195768</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ingolia</surname><given-names>Nicholas T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vance</surname><given-names>Russell E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000861</institution-id><institution>Burroughs Wellcome Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vance</surname><given-names>Russell E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AI075039</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vance</surname><given-names>Russell E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AI063302</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vance</surname><given-names>Russell E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Infected cells superinduce expression of mRNA in order to initiate an immune response to a bacterial pathogen that blocks host protein synthesis.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Gene expression is a concerted process that is regulated at multiple steps, including transcription, mRNA degradation, translation, and protein degradation. Most global studies of gene expression have focused on the transcriptional response, but the relative importance of transcription in determining protein levels remains debated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Li et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Schwanhäusser et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Breker and Schuldiner, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Maier et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Vogel and Marcotte, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">de Sousa Abreu et al., 2009</xref>). One recent study analyzed the response of dendritic cells to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and found that changes in mRNA levels accounted for ~90% of observed alterations in protein levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jovanovic et al., 2015</xref>). However, the response to infection with a virulent pathogen is certainly more complicated than the response to a purified immunostimulatory ligand such as LPS. Indeed, pathogens have evolved to disrupt or manipulate almost every cellular process involved in gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Finlay and McFadden, 2006</xref>). An effective innate immune response to infection therefore requires that host cells be able to induce appropriate responses in the face of pathogen manipulation.</p><p>Inhibition of host protein synthesis is a common strategy used by many viral and bacterial pathogens to disrupt host gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mohr and Sonenberg, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lemaitre and Girardin, 2013</xref>). For example, the intracellular bacterial pathogen <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> uses its Dot/Icm type IV secretion system (T4SS) to translocate into host cells several effector proteins that block host protein synthesis, including at least four effectors that target the elongation factor eEF1A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lemaitre and Girardin, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barry et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Belyi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fontana et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Shen et al., 2009</xref>). Similarly, the bacterial pathogen <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> blocks host translation elongation by secretion of exotoxin A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lemaitre and Girardin, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dunbar et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Iglewski et al., 1977</xref>). Interestingly, we previously discovered that host cells respond to protein synthesis inhibition — whether by <italic>Legionella</italic>, exotoxin A, or by pharmacological agents that block translation initiation or elongation — by initiating a specific host response characterized by production of specific pro-inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin-23 (<italic>Il23a</italic>), granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (<italic>Csf2</italic>) and interleukin-1α (<italic>Il1a</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barry et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fontana et al., 2011</xref>). The mechanism by which infected host cells are able to produce certain cytokines despite a global (&gt;90%) block in protein synthesis remains unclear, but at least two distinct models have been proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mohr and Sonenberg, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lemaitre and Girardin, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barry et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fontana et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dunbar et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fontana and Vance, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">McEwan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chakrabarti et al., 2012</xref>). One model posits that the block in protein synthesis leads to superinduction of cytokine mRNAs that is sufficient to overcome the partial block in host protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barry et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fontana et al., 2011</xref>). Alternatively, it has been proposed that host cells may circumvent the global block in protein synthesis by selective translation of specific cytokine transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dunbar et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Asrat et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>To determine how host cells mount an inflammatory response when protein synthesis is disrupted, we performed parallel RNAseq and ribosome profiling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ingolia et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">2011</xref>) of <italic>Legionella</italic>-infected mouse primary bone-marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs). The results reveal the relative contributions of translational regulation and mRNA induction in controlling immune responses to pathogenic <italic>L. pneumophila</italic>, and support a model in which the majority of gene induction in response to pathogenic infections occurs at the level of mRNA induction. We were able to identify a subset of mRNAs that display higher-than-average ribosome occupancy, but the elevated occupancy of these mRNAs was observed in uninfected cells as well as in cells infected with <italic>L. pneumophila</italic>. We propose that mRNA superinduction provides a robust mechanism for host cells to initiate a response to infection despite pathogen-mediated disruption of host gene expression.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>mRNA superinduction mediates the host response to virulent <italic>L. pneumophila</italic></title><p>The relative role of transcription versus translation in mediating the inducible response to an infection with a virulent bacterial pathogen remains unclear. Thus, we performed ribosome profiling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ingolia et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">2011</xref>) and total (rRNA-depleted) RNA sequencing of BMMs infected with <italic>L. pneumophila</italic>. BMMs were infected with a virulent Δ<italic>flaA</italic> strain, an avirulent T4SS-deficient Δ<italic>dotA</italic>Δ<italic>flaA</italic> strain, or a Δ<italic>7</italic>Δ<italic>flaA</italic> strain that lacks the seven effectors associated with inhibition of host protein synthesis. RNA was isolated at 6 hr post-infection, which was the earliest we could detect significant <italic>L. pneumophila</italic>-induced translation inhibition without marked cytotoxicity (data not shown). <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> strains on the Δ<italic>flaA</italic> background were used to reduce cell cytotoxicity by avoiding the effects of NAIP5/NLRC4 inflammasome activation by flagellin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Molofsky et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ren et al., 2006</xref>) and we previously showed loss of flagellin does not affect blockade of host translation or the transcriptional induction of inflammatory cytokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barry et al., 2013</xref>). Control experiments demonstrated that ~90% of macrophages were infected with at least one bacterium under our infection conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>).</p><p>Lysates from infected macrophages were split and used to generate ribosome profiling libraries and RNAseq libraries, thereby allowing us to compare directly the mRNA levels and ribosome occupancy of those mRNAs from the same cells. As a confirmation of the quality of the ribosome profiling libraries, ribosome footprints were found to map preferentially to the exonic regions of infection-induced genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), and showed a strong bias toward 27–28 nucleotide fragment lengths (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), consistent with the known size of ribosome-protected footprints. In accord with previous studies, induction of ribosome footprints on <italic>Gem</italic>, <italic>Csf2</italic>, and <italic>Il23a</italic> required the seven-bacterial effectors associated with the block in host protein synthesis, while induction of ribosome footprints corresponding to <italic>Il1a</italic> and <italic>Il1b</italic> required the bacterial T4SS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–F</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22707.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Mapping of ribosome profiling reads to the genomic sequence of specific <italic>L. pneumophila</italic>-induced genes of interest.</title><p>(<bold>A–F</bold>) Ribosome footprint reads were mapped to the genome and the number of footprints on the mRNAs for <italic>Gapdh</italic> (A), <italic>Csf2</italic> (B), <italic>Gem</italic> (C), <italic>Il23a</italic> (D), <italic>Il1a</italic> (E), and <italic>Il1b</italic> (F) was visualized.

We found that the majority of T4SS-dependent increases in ribosome footprints could be explained at the level of mRNA induction, as there was nearly a perfect linear correlation between the extent of mRNA induction and ribosome footprints for all T4SS-induced genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). This correlation held for numerous known pathogen-induced mRNAs, including <italic>Il23a</italic>, <italic>Gem</italic>, <italic>Csf2</italic>, <italic>Il6</italic>, <italic>Tnf</italic>, <italic>Cxcl1</italic>, <italic>Cxcl2</italic>, <italic>Dusp1</italic>, and <italic>Dusp2</italic>, as well as for the cytokines <italic>Il1a</italic> and <italic>Il1b</italic> that were previously proposed to be preferentially translated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Asrat et al., 2014</xref>). To confirm that cytokine protein levels correlate with mRNA levels, we infected BMMs with Δ<italic>flaA</italic> or Δ<italic>dotA</italic>Δ<italic>flaA L. pneumophila</italic> and measured the levels of 42 cytokines or immune-related proteins in the supernatants or cell lysates of these BMMs at 6 hr, using commercially available bead arrays. Of the cytokines assayed, 18 cytokines/proteins were measured above the limit of detection in lysates, and 22 cytokines/proteins were measured above the limit of detection in supernatants. The T4SS-dependent fold-induction of these protein levels was plotted versus the T4SS-dependent fold-induction of mRNA levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–C</xref>). We observed a robust correlation between the extent of mRNA induction and the extent of protein induction, particularly in lysates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).

However, the analyses did not reveal whether there is differential ribosome occupancy of constitutively expressed (i.e. non-induced) mRNAs. We thus analyzed the ratio of ribosome footprint reads to RNAseq reads for all (induced and non-induced) transcripts in uninfected BMMs, and in BMMs infected with Δ<italic>flaA</italic>, Δ<italic>dotA</italic>Δ<italic>flaA</italic>, or Δ<italic>7</italic>Δ<italic>flaA L. pneumophila</italic>. This analysis revealed a wide range of ribosome occupancies across different transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–D</xref>). As might be anticipated, many of the mRNAs with the highest ribosome occupancy encoded abundant ‘housekeeping’ proteins, including <italic>Acta1</italic> and histone mRNAs (e.g. <italic>Hist1h2ba</italic>, <italic>H2afj</italic>, and <italic>Hist3h2ba</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>).

profiling is that it permits the mapping of ribosome footprints with nucleotide resolution. Thus, to characterize the position of ribosomes on mRNAs after infection with <italic>L. pneumophila</italic>, we generated metagene ribosome footprint profiles from libraries generated from WT BMMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Metagene profiles were generated by mapping the inferred A site position of ribosome footprint reads relative to the start (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,C,E,G,I</xref>) or stop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B,D,F,H,J</xref>) codon on a given transcript. Mapped reads were then summed to produce a global view of the distribution of ribosomes across all transcripts in our dataset. As expected from the known stepwise codon-by-codon movement of the ribosome, all metagene plots demonstrated a characteristic three-nucleotide periodicity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Interestingly, metagene ribosome profiles of uninfected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–B</xref>), Δ<italic>flaA</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C–D</xref>), Δ<italic>dotA</italic>Δ<italic>flaA</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E–F</xref>), or Δ<italic>7</italic>Δ<italic>flaA</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G–H</xref>) infected BMMs appeared grossly similar to each other, even though global translation is blocked only in the Δ<italic>flaA</italic> and Δ<italic>7</italic>Δ<italic>flaA L. pneumophila</italic>-infected conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barry et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fontana et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Asrat et al., 2014</xref>). This result can be explained by the fact that ribosome metagene profiles do not distinguish whether ribosome footprints arise from stalled or translating ribosomes, unless the stall occurs at a characteristic distance from the start or stop codon. In fact, we did notice a slight increase in the number of ribosomes found at the start site of the transcript in Δ<italic>7</italic>Δ<italic>flaA L. pneumophila</italic>-infected BMMs as compared to other conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref>). This may reflect a selective block in translation initiation by this strain (see below). In addition, we noted that in all conditions, ribosomes accumulated at the stop codon, suggesting that, in BMMs, translation termination may be a limiting step in translation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J</xref>).<fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22707.013</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Metagene profiles of <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> infected BMMs.</title><p>(<bold>A–J</bold>) Metagene profiles of uninfected (A–B), Δ<italic>flaA</italic> (C–D), Δ<italic>dotA</italic>Δ<italic>flaA</italic> (E–F), Δ<italic>7</italic>Δ<italic>flaA</italic> (G–H) <italic>L. pneumophila</italic>-infected B6 BMMs and a merge (I–J).

If the weighted average is less than 1, this shows that this region has reduced ribosome footprints, while if the weighted average is greater than one this shows that there are more ribosome footprints in this region. Following a brief pulse of cells with harringtonine (red line) there is a change in the distribution of ribosomes from the 5ʹ end of the mRNA to the 3ʹ end of the mRNA (i.e., as the ribosomes continue to move 5ʹ to 3ʹ; <bold>C–F</bold>) as compared to untreated cells (blue line).

We therefore analyzed our translation run-off datasets to assess translation elongation on a per-mRNA basis. We plotted the number of ribosome footprint reads for each transcript in paired untreated and harringtonine treated samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A–D</xref>). In this analysis, we expect that an mRNA with actively elongating ribosomes would show a reduction in the number of 5ʹ reads in the harringtonine treated sample, as ribosomes will run off the transcript, compared to the untreated sample. In order to best measure run-off elongation and avoid the expected but confounding effects of harringtonine-induced accumulation of footprints at start codons (which were clearly observed; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), we excluded the first 25 codons and analyzed ribosome footprint occupancy over the next 300 codons. Consistent with our previous analysis, we find that uninfected, Δ<italic>dotA</italic>Δ<italic>flaA</italic>, and Δ<italic>7</italic>Δ<italic>flaA</italic>-infected BMMs show a clear global signature of ribosome run-off, again suggesting that the block in host protein synthesis induced by Δ<italic>7</italic>Δ<italic>flaA L. pneumophila</italic> infection is occurring at the level of translation initiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A–D</xref>).

Interestingly, in all conditions tested, cytokine-related genes fell well within the average of ribosome retention across all transcripts, and if anything, were found to have reduced ribosome run-off compared to a typical gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A–D</xref>). A similar trend was seen when we further examined ribosome run-off for specific immune and housekeeping transcripts by plotting the cumulative read counts over the length of the mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). These results imply that at this time point, cytokine transcripts are not preferentially translated in response to pathogenic infection, but instead are controlled at the level of mRNA induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A–D</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22707.016</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Immune-related genes do not have increased translation rates in response to infection with <italic>L. pneumophila</italic>.</title><p>(<bold>A–D</bold>) Read counts from paired samples treated with harringtonine or left untreated were plotted for uninfected (<bold>A</bold>), Δ<italic>flaA</italic> (<bold>B</bold>), Δ<italic>dotA</italic>Δ<italic>flaA</italic> (<bold>C</bold>), or Δ<italic>7</italic>Δ<italic>flaA</italic>-infected (<bold>D</bold>) BMMs showing where cytokine-related transcripts (pink circles; <italic>Csf1</italic>, <italic>Csf2</italic>, <italic>Cxcl1</italic>, <italic>Cxcl2</italic>, <italic>Dusp1</italic>, <italic>Dusp2</italic>, <italic>Ifnb1</italic>, <italic>Il10</italic>, <italic>Il12b</italic>, <italic>Il1a</italic>, <italic>Il1b</italic>, <italic>Il23a</italic>, <italic>Il6</italic>, <italic>Lyz1</italic>, and <italic>Tnf</italic>) and housekeeping transcripts (blue circles; <italic>Gapdh</italic>, <italic>Rpl31</italic>, <italic>Rps17</italic>, and <italic>Tuba1a</italic>) fall among all transcripts (black circles).

A recent study showed that in response to innate immune stimulation with purified LPS, dendritic cells almost entirely control the induction of genes at the level of transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jovanovic et al., 2015</xref>). However, this conclusion may not apply to cells infected with a virulent pathogen that manipulates gene expression. We thus investigated the relative contributions of mRNA induction and translation during infection with an intracellular bacterial pathogen, <italic>L. pneumophila</italic>, that blocks host protein synthesis.</p><p>Pathogen-induced blockade of host protein synthesis has been shown in a number of infection models to be sensed by the host and induce an inflammatory response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barry et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fontana et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dunbar et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">McEwan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chakrabarti et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fontana et al., 2012</xref>). We previously identified IL-1α as a key inflammatory cytokine induced preferentially in response to translation inhibition imposed by <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barry et al., 2013</xref>). However, the mechanism by which cytokine proteins are induced despite a pathogen-induced translation blockade remains unclear. We previously provided evidence for a model in which translation inhibition results in a failure to synthesize negative feedback inhibitors of transcription, for example, IκB or A20 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fontana et al., 2011</xref>). We proposed this results in a massive and sustained production of cytokine transcripts, termed mRNA superinduction, that is sufficient to overcome the partial (~95%) block in translation and allow for production of cytokine proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barry et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fontana et al., 2011</xref>). Another report provided data suggesting that IL-1 production is mediated by MyD88-enhanced protein synthesis, although alternative explanations were also entertained (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Asrat et al., 2014</xref>). A third study proposed that virulent <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> regulates cap-dependent translation initiation, via manipulation of the mTOR signaling pathway, to regulate the protein levels of highly abundant transcripts in infected macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ivanov and Roy, 2013</xref>). In our present study, we found that the induction of ribosome footprints by <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> could be explained by an underlying induction of mRNAs. We did not find evidence for selective ribosome loading of abundant cytokine mRNAs. In addition, ribosome run-off experiments confirmed that cytokine mRNAs are not selectively translated during infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Furthermore, we find that the role of MyD88 signaling in gene expression appears to be primarily at the level of mRNA induction and not translational regulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Thus, we conclude that preferential translation does not account for the majority of specific gene induction following infection by <italic>L. pneumophila.</italic></p><p>It remains possible that selective translation initiation mechanisms, for example, via uORFs, might also contribute modestly to the inducible immune response to <italic>L. pneumophila</italic>, but these subtle effects were not evident in our global analysis. In any case, it is difficult to explain how regulation of translation initiation could overcome a downstream pathogen-induced block in translation elongation such as is observed during <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> infection. It is also possible that post-translational mechanisms, which are not addressable with the ribosomal profiling techniques used here, may regulate protein production by infected cells. Indeed, inflammasome-dependent caspase-1 processing is known to be an important post-translational regulatory mechanism controlling IL-1β production by infected cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">von Moltke et al., 2013</xref>). Lastly, our data do not specifically address the mechanism of mRNA induction, although our prior work suggested mRNA induction involves new transcription rather than increased mRNA stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fontana et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Although wild-type <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> blocks translation elongation via translocated effectors, we found that Δ<italic>7</italic>Δ<italic>flaA L. pneumophila</italic> lacking the effectors nevertheless blocks protein synthesis at the level of translation initiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Thus, in contrast to a previous study that used virus-based translation reporter experiments in <italic>L. pneumophila</italic>-infected RAW macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ivanov and Roy, 2013</xref>), we were clearly able to dissociate the <italic>L. pneumophila</italic>-induced block in host protein synthesis into two components: (1) an elongation block that required the seven translocated effectors, and (2) an initiation block that did not require the seven effectors. In addition, our analysis represents an advance over prior studies because we were able to analyze the translation of all endogenous transcripts simultaneously as opposed to measuring translation only of a single exogenous reporter mRNA. Intriguingly, in contrast to the effector-dependent block in translation that we show occurs at the level of elongation, the majority of host-mediated regulation of translation occurs at the level of translation initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hershey et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, while it is possible that a novel bacterial effector that directly targets translation initiation could explain the residual inhibition of translation by the Δ<italic>7</italic>Δ<italic>flaA L. pneumophila</italic> mutant, we favor the hypothesis that the residual block in host protein synthesis may be a result of the host stress response induced by pathogenic infection, consistent with numerous prior studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mohr and Sonenberg, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lemaitre and Girardin, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chakrabarti et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ivanov and Roy, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Janssens et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Tattoli et al., 2012</xref>). Indeed, T4SS-competent <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> has been suggested to induce membrane damage that inhibits the mTOR pathway and blocks translation initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ivanov and Roy, 2013</xref>). Further studies will be required to identify the bacterial and host pathways required for the residual translation inhibition caused by the Δ<italic>7</italic>Δ<italic>flaA L. pneumophila</italic> mutant.</p><p>The results presented here further support a role for translation inhibition as a signal that the innate immune system uses to recognize and preferentially respond to pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fontana et al., 2011</xref>). Our work provides nucleotide-level analysis of the global block in host protein synthesis induced by <italic>L. pneumophila</italic>, and demonstrates that <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> infection results in inhibition of host protein synthesis both at the level of translation initiation and elongation. Importantly, our results also provide insights into the molecular mechanisms by which host cells are able to mount a protective immune response despite a pathogen-induced block in protein synthesis. Using ribosome run-off assays in combination with ribosome profiling and RNAseq, we find that mRNA superinduction, rather than selective mRNA translation, is the strategy by which host cells produce inflammatory cytokines in the face of pathogen-mediated translation inhibition. To be effective, the strategy of mRNA superinduction requires that the magnitude of mRNA superinduction exceeds the magnitude of the block in protein synthesis. Indeed, our data suggest this is the case, as we observe &gt;1000 fold induction of certain mRNAs, whereas we previously estimated the block in protein synthesis to be ~95% (20-fold) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fontana et al., 2011</xref>). One possible advantage of mRNA superinduction as a strategy for overcoming a pathogen-mediated block of protein synthesis is that it does not require specific translation factors, as was previously proposed might mediate selective mRNA translation in <italic>L. pneumophila</italic>-infected cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Asrat et al., 2014</xref>). In addition, in mammalian cells, selective translation is usually regulated at the level of translation initiation, a strategy that would be easily defeated by pathogens such as <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> that block the downstream process of translation elongation. Importantly, since numerous viral and bacterial pathogens and toxins interfere with host protein synthesis, we propose that our results may provide general insight into the inducible innate immune response to infection.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>These studies were carried out in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health under animal protocol AUP-2014-09-6665.

Uninfected BMMs were classified as BMMs that were not associated with <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> or only associated with extracellular (Cascade Blue + TexasRed double positive) bacteria. Infected BMMs were classified as macrophages containing at least one intracellular <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> (Texas Red only), independent of the number of extracellular bacteria associated with the BMM. In experiments where the cell membrane of BMMs was labeled with FITC-conjugated wheat germ agglutinin along with DIC, Cascade Blue, and TexasRed, analysis of infectivity was undertaken using the imaging software Imaris (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_007370">SCR_007370</ext-link>; Bitplane, Zurich, Switzerland). Using Imaris, surfaces of BMMs were drawn on the FITC-conjugated wheat germ agglutinin channel to mark individual BMMs. All extracellular bacteria were removed from analysis by generating a new channel that subtracted the Cascade Blue channel from the TexasRed channel, for example Intracellular Channel = TexasRed Channel – (Scaling Value x Cascade Blue Channel). The scaling value was calculated by measuring the average pixel intensities in each channel for double positive bacteria. As an example, if the TexasRed channel had an average pixel intensity of 350 and the Cascade Blue channel was 3500 then the equation would be: Intracellular Channel = TexasRed Channel – (0.1 x Cascade Blue Channel). The outcome of this calculation is the generation of a channel that removes the TexasRed signal of extracellular bacteria, thus allowing for analysis of bacteria that are only intracellular. Lastly, using the Sortomato utility (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://open.bitplane.com/tabid/235/Default.aspx?id=90">http://open.bitplane.com/tabid/235/Default.aspx?id=90</ext-link>) in Imaris, new cell surfaces were drawn for cells that contained a signal in the new Intracellular channel (with double positive bacteria removed), marking cells infected with an intracellular bacterium. Surfaces were also drawn for cells that did not have a signal in the Intracellular channel, marking uninfected BMMs or BMMs only associated with extracellular <italic>L. pneumophila</italic>. Results were checked by eye to confirm that all surfaces accurately marked uninfected and infected BMMs; the surfaces generated by Sortomato were used to quantify infectivity.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank members of the Vance and Barton Laboratories for discussion and Justin De Leon, Edward Roberts, and Matthew Krummel for technical assistance.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Michel Nussenzweig (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Barry, et al., investigate the important issue of how phagocytic cells can raise a cytokine response in the presence of protein synthesis inhibition that occurs in response to pathogens. Previous studies have shown that macrophages hyperinduce cytokine transcripts in response to <italic>Legionella pneumophila</italic> proteins that interfere with host cell protein synthesis inhibitors. In spite of the fact that many of the induced transcripts appear to produce little increase in translation relative to uninfected cells, some of these transcripts are productively translated. Two other labs have forwarded models that the successfully translated products are a consequence of either RNA abundance or perhaps some pattern recognition control of translation. The authors show that the amount of ribosome loading is directly proportional to the transcript abundance, arguing the ability to detect cytokines in the presence of protein synthesis inhibitors is due to massive overexpression of cytokine transcripts. All three reviewers thought the experimental approach was powerful and convincing. However, there was considerable debate as to the novelty of the main conclusion. In particular, Ivanov and Roy, 2013, previously came to the same conclusion that cytokine production in macrophages infected with pathogenic <italic>Legionella</italic> occurred due to high levels of mRNA expression. The present studies clearly strengthen this conclusion substantially, but were not considered to represent a conceptual advance. However, there do appear to be unexpected and interesting aspects to the data that could be explored further, such as the apparent effects of pathogen infection on translational elongation. Following discussion, there was agreement among the reviewers to consider a revised manuscript that further distinguishes this work from the prior studies and addresses experimental weaknesses.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) A more compelling case is required that the findings represent a conceptual advance beyond that of prior work, particularly that of Invanov and Roy. The authors can consider how to best approach this, but one avenue would be to expand investigation/analysis of the control of translational elongation by pathogen infection.</p><p>2) The authors should measure protein levels of a set of representative and biologically important host defense cytokines or host defense proteins to establish whether post-translational mechanisms or superinduction is more important for determining actual cytokine/host defense protein levels.</p><p>The reviewers considered the issue of whether the elongation block or the initiation block is being overcome by transcript abundance to not be clearly resolved.</p><p>One reviewer commented: There is no demonstration in the literature that bypass of the highly expressed proteins is due to bypass of translation elongation. Most of the expression of cytokines is occurring 5-6 hours after infection, and that is also when the translation initiation block is setting in. Also, Roy and coworkers claim that most of the effects are due to effects on translation initiation blockade, so the literature is a little confusing here. It is reasonable to suppose that the expression of cytokines is due to bypass of translation initiation because of the timing, so if they have data that contradicts that point, that is of interest. The second reviewer agreed with this comment.</p><p>With respect to the question of more specific direction on revision:</p><p>One reviewer responded: In this system, there are two types of translation bypass that can be blocked, either elongation or initiation. With these highly expressed genes, it looks like high level expression is able to overcome the elongation block. If a case can be made for this by looking at a few of these transcripts in detail, that would be a novel contribution. It is even possible they have the data in hand, and that just by analyzing the data in a different fashion they can show this.

Adjusting the text to highlight this finding, and adding some data along the lines suggested by (the other reviewer) should improve this study and assuage my concerns.</p><p>We feel there still may be some confusion, but we will try to address each of the major points above as clearly as possible in turn:</p><p>Essential Revision 1:We are asked to better clarify the conceptual advance of our work over that of Ivanov and Roy. In particular, the reviewers state “There was considerable debate as to the novelty of the main conclusion. In particular, Ivanov and Roy, 2013, previously came to the same conclusion that cytokine production in macrophages infected with pathogenic <italic>Legionella</italic> occurred due to high levels of mRNA expression. The present studies clearly strengthen this conclusion substantially, but were not considered to represent a conceptual advance.”</p><p>Overall Response:The fundamental unresolved question at issue is: how do macrophages infected with <italic>Legionella</italic> make cytokines despite experiencing a pathogen-induced block in protein synthesis? There appears to be some confusion over what the Ivanov and Roy paper is claiming. In our opinion, Ivanov and Roy invoke a very different model – involving selective or preferential translation of specific mRNAs – than the model we propose in our manuscript, which does not involve preferential translation. One reason for the confusion may be that the Ivanov and Roy paper is primarily focused on modulation of mTOR by <italic>Legionella</italic> and thus is not entirely clear on the (side) question of how cytokine mRNAs are being translated. Most importantly, however, we believe that our paper is the only one that provides the experimental data required to distinguish various possible models to explain cytokine induction.Thus, we feel our paper represents a substantial advance over Ivanov and Roy.</p><p>Detailed Response:</p><p>In their Abstract, Ivanov and Roy state: “Detection of pathogen signatures resulted in translational biasing toward proinflammatory cytokines through mTOR-mediated regulation of cap-dependent translation.” In our opinion, the invocation of “translational biasing” and specific effects on cap-dependent translation implies a model in which there is selective or preferential translation of specific cytokine transcripts. This is in polar opposition to our model, which proposes there is no preferential translation or translational biasing: indeed, our data demonstrate that all mRNAs are translated indistinguishably. Thus, we propose a model in which mRNA abundance, not translation efficiency, explains differential protein production.</p><p>There are several other sections of the Ivanov and Roy paper that make it clear that they are favoring a model in which there is preferential translation of pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-6) versus anti-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-10). For example, consider this passage from their paper:</p><p>“Although there were substantial differences in cytokine production in response to virulent <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> and the avirulent <italic>L. pneumophila dotA</italic> mutant, these differences did not correlate with gene expression. The amount of <italic>Il6</italic> mRNA was similar under all infection conditions, and <italic>Il10</italic> mRNA was more abundant after infection with virulent <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> even though IL-10 production was lower (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Thus, the cytokine biasing observed in response to virulent <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> involved post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression.”</p><p>Later, on p. 1224, Ivanov and Roy even propose a specific translation mechanism to explain the differential translation of IL-6 vs IL-10, stating that “IL-10 production was more sensitive to inhibition of eIF4E than was IL-6 production…Thus, cytokine biasing in LPS-treated macrophages was achieved by modulation of the cap-dependent translation initiated by eIF4E.” We note that Ivanov and Roy propose that differential cap-dependent translation regulates IL-6 vs. IL-10 production without actually examining the translation rates of IL-6 vs. IL-10. Nevertheless, in our opinion, these excerpts clearly illustrate that Ivanov and Roy are proposing a preferential translation model, which is entirely distinct from the model we propose. We therefore do not agree with the reviewers’ comment that “Ivanov and Roy, 2013, previously came to the same conclusion that cytokine production in macrophages infected with pathogenic <italic>Legionella</italic> occurred due to high levels of mRNA expression” and we do not agree that we are “simply using [our] data to confirm previous publications in the field.”</p><p>Despite the above potential disagreement about what Ivanov and Roy are claiming, we feel the most important point is that the only way to reach a conclusion about whether or not there is translational biasing is by a direct examination of the rate at which cytokine mRNAs are translated in infected cells.It is very important to emphasize that Ivanov and Roy perform no experiments whatsoever to address the translation rate of cytokine mRNAs. Thus, although they claim in their Abstract and elsewhere that they favor a model in which there is translational biasing, there is no experimental support for such a model in their paper. By contrast, we perform detailed ribosome profiling of infected cells, including experiments in which we examine ribosome run-off in harringtonine-pulsed cells. These data allow us for the first time to examine the translation rate across individual cytokine mRNAs in infected cells and allow us (and us alone) to conclude there is no evidence for preferential translation of cytokine mRNAs in infected cells.</p><p>A second related issue raised by reviewers was whether our data might refute the claim of Roy and Ivanov that the primary translational block in infected cells is a block of translation initiation. The reviewers suggest that “by looking at the group of highly expressed transcripts (say the top 8 or so), can they demonstrate a pattern that shows that elongation inhibition (rather than initiation inhibition) is the thing that is being overcome in these transcripts.”</p><p>We agree that Ivanov and Roy believe the primary translation block in infected cells is at the level of translation <italic>initiation</italic>. By contrast, our data demonstrate that cells infected with wild-type <italic>Legionella</italic> experience a block in <italic>both</italic> translation initiation <italic>and</italic> elongation. Thus, this is another important distinction between our paper and the Ivanov and Roy paper and further substantiates our claim (above) that the two papers are presenting very different models/conclusions.</p><p>In fact, we believe that one of the significant aspects of our paper is that we are able to experimentally and genetically dissect the two distinct mechanisms <italic>Legionella</italic> uses to block translation. By performing ribosome run-off experiments we observe that in wild-type infected cells, ribosomes do not run off of (i.e., elongate across) mRNAs, whereas we do see robust run-off (elongation) in uninfected cells or cells infected with the avirulent ∆<italic>dotA</italic>∆<italic>flaA</italic> mutant. Importantly, the block in elongation we observe depends entirely on effectors translocated by <italic>Legionella</italic>, as a strain lacking these effectors (∆<italic>7</italic>∆<italic>flaA</italic>) did not block translation elongation. However, since this strain still blocks translation (as previously reported by us and several other groups, including Ivanov and Roy), we conclude that the block by the ∆7 strain is at the level of translation initiation (and probably involves inhibition of cap-dependent translation mTORC1, as proposed by Ivanov and Roy). Our model is thus that <italic>Legionella</italic> blocks elongation via translated effectors, and blocks initiation via a 7-effector-independent mechanism.Importantly, although Ivanov and Roy provide evidence for an effector-independent block of translation <italic>initiation</italic>, they do not address the effector-dependent block in <italic>elongation</italic>, and thus, they do not experimentally or genetically distinguish the two levels of translational blockade that are imposed by <italic>Legionella</italic> (as we do). This is an important point because it implies that the ability of cells to make cytokine is robust to pathogen-induced blockade of translation, regardless of whether it is elongation, or initiation, or both, that is blocked. In essence our data provide an important mechanism by which hosts could potentially circumvent any mechanism pathogens use to disrupt host protein synthesis.</p><p>If we have interpreted the reviewers’ comments correctly, it seems the reviewers appreciate the above distinction between our paper and that of Ivanov and Roy, and appreciate that it is an important distinction. The reviewers also seem to appreciate that an important distinction between our paper and the Ivanov and Roy paper is that we examined translation rates of individual mRNAs, whereas the analysis of translation in the Ivanov and Roy paper is simply bulk analysis (e.g., puromycin incorporation). We believe it is appreciation of this latter point that leads the reviewers to ask us to demonstrate that highly expressed cytokine mRNAs are experiencing a block in elongation in addition to the block in initiation. However, we believe these data are already provided in the manuscript in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref> and 2, where we quantify the number of ribosome footprints in the presence and absence of harringtonine. Ongoing translation elongation permits ribosome run-off during harringtonine treatment and this is reflected in a decrease in ribosome footprints after harringtonine treatment in the uninfected, ∆dot and ∆7 conditions. Importantly, such runoff is not observed in WT-infected cells, implying that there is a block in translation elongation in these cells. Importantly, the lack of run-off (i.e., translation elongation) is apparent for highly expressed transcripts as well as moderately or low expressed transcripts (as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>, where all genes lie on the diagonal).</p><p>In summary: our data demonstrate that <italic>Legionella</italic> blocks translation <italic>initiation</italic> and <italic>elongation</italic> and that this dual block is apparent among highly expressed transcripts as well as more moderately expressed transcripts. Thus, we conclude that the ability of <italic>Legionella</italic>-infected cells to produce cytokine proteins is not related to selective escape of the block in translation elongation or initiation, but is instead due to the dramatic upregulation of cytokine mRNA levels.</p><p>In relation to the issue of elongation vs. initiation, the reviewers made a few other related comments that we would like to respond to with the hope that it will help clarify our position:</p><p>“There is no demonstration in the literature that bypass of the highly expressed proteins is due to bypass of translation elongation.”</p><p>We somewhat agree with this point. Certainly, as discussed above, the Ivanov paper does not address whether <italic>Legionella</italic> inhibits translation elongation. However, there are other studies showing that <italic>Legionella</italic> effectors target host elongation factors (e.g., modification of eEF1 via direct glucosylation). Given these past results, we think it is reasonably well accepted that translation elongation is blocked in <italic>Legionella</italic>-infected cells, and thus, the ability of infected cells to produce proteins must require some kind of ‘bypass’ of an elongation block. However, we agree with the reviewer that our paper is the first to demonstrate that there is both an effector-induced block in elongation and a 7-effector-independent block in initiation.</p><p>As an aside, we would also like to add that the term ‘bypass’ might be confusing and think it should be avoided. We do not literally think that host cells encode a mechanism to somehow reverse a block in elongation, i.e., remove the glucose residue from the elongation factor, or somehow allow ribosomes to function without an elongation factor. Instead, we believe that the way cells ‘bypass’ the elongation block (which is a ~95% block, not a 100% block) is by superinducing cytokine mRNAs. Most of these mRNAs are also likely blocked, but since the cytokines are induced in some cases by 3 logs, this is sufficient to overcome the ~1 log block in translation.</p><p>“Most of the expression of cytokines is occurring 5-6 hours after infection, and that is also when the translation initiation block is setting in.”</p><p>We agree with this. However, it is also important to note that at this time point, the block in elongation has already occurred. So, both elongation and inhibition are blocked, and thus, if proteins are made at this time point, then both blocks must be overcome.</p><p>“Also, Roy and coworkers claim that most of the effects are due to effects on translation initiation blockade, so the literature is a little confusing here.”</p><p>Yes, we agree that the literature in general (and the Roy paper in particular) is confusing. Roy and coworkers do suggest there is a block in initiation, but they do not rule out or address whether there is also a block in elongation. Indeed, their methodology does not allow them to distinguish whether there is a transcript-specific block in initiation or elongation (and, indeed, as discussed above, our ability to do so is one of the important issues our work clarifies).</p><p>“It is reasonable to suppose that the expression of cytokines is due to bypass of translation initiation because of the timing, so if they have data that contradicts that point, that is of interest.”</p><p>Yes, we believe that our data clearly show that at 6h post infection the cells are experiencing both a block in elongation and initiation, and we do agree with the reviewer that this is a point of interest.</p><p>Essential Revision 2:The reviewers ask us to examine protein levels of cytokines to address whether mRNA induction or post-translational mechanisms contribute most to the ultimate levels of cytokine proteins.</p><p>To address the request of the reviewers, we infected macrophages with wild-type or ∆<italic>dot</italic> mutant <italic>Legionella</italic> for 6hr and then measured levels of 42 cytokines or other proteins in the supernatant or in cell lysates using commercially available bead arrays (Rodent MAP 4.0-Mouse Sample Testing, Ampersand Biosciences, Saranac Lake, NY, USA). Of the cytokines assayed, 18 cytokines/proteins were measured above the limit of detection in lysates, and 22 cytokines/proteins were above the limit of detection in supernatants. We plotted the T4SS-dependent fold-induction of these cytokine protein levels against the T4SS-dependent fold-induction of the cytokine mRNA levels. The results are now shown in new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>. The results show a remarkably robust correlation between the extent of mRNA induction and the extent of protein induction, particularly in lysates. The correlation seems to apply for the most highly induced proteins/mRNAs (e.g., IL-10 and GMCSF (=Csf2)) but also for more modestly induced cytokines (Il1a, Il1b, Cxcl10, etc.). The correlation is somewhat less robust when looking at protein levels in the cell supernatant, but this may reflect differing rates of secretion, accumulation in the supernatant over time, re-binding to cell surface receptors, and stability in the supernatant. Nevertheless, taken together, the results are consistent with our overall conclusion that the inducible immune response to <italic>Legionella</italic> is due primarily to mRNA superinduction.</p></body></sub-article></article>
