Mechanisms responsible for the reparative process remain elusive. It has been hypothesized that tendon heals through both intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms in which cells from both within the tendons and the surrounding tissues are necessary for the healing process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chang et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">de Mos et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gelberman et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Harrison et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jones et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Manske and Lesker, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Peacock, 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Potenza, 1962</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Salingcarnboriboon et al., 2003</xref>). However, molecular evidence for the contribution of extrinsic tissues to support such notion is missing.</p><p>Tendon fibers are enveloped by a dense membrane of connective tissues that are composed of epitenon and tendon sheaths, bridging blood vessels, lymphatics and nerves to tendon fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Elliott, 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hess et al., 1989</xref>). Tendon sheaths are classified as extrinsic tissues in contrast to tendon fibers and epitenons, which are intrinsic structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kannus, 2000</xref>). Tendon sheath only covers tendon fibers in high friction areas where it provides lubrication for the functions of fibers comprising, for examples, the Tibialis anterior tendon, the peroneus longus and brevis tendon, and the flexor and extensor tendons. <italic>Tubulin polymerization-promoting protein family member 3</italic> (<italic>Tppp3</italic>) is the first and only molecular marker to be identified that is expressed in developing epitenon and tendon sheath (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Staverosky et al., 2009</xref>). However, <italic>Tppp3</italic> expression is also found in developing muscles and forming joints. It is not clear whether <italic>Tppp3</italic> is also expressed in adult tendon sheaths. Additional molecular markers are therefore needed to investigate the function of sheath tissues in adult tendon remodeling and repair.</p><p>Hedgehog (Hh) signaling plays important roles in the skeletal system, in both bone and cartilage development and homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Karp et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Vortkamp et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mak et al., 2006</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">, 2008a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">2008b</xref>). Apart from bones and cartilages, it has been recently demonstrated that Hh signaling is also involved in tendon development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Liu et al., 2012</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Schwartz et al., 2015</xref>). Hh-responding cells were found in the tendon insertion sites but not in the mid-substances during the perinatal stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Liu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Schwartz et al., 2015</xref>), suggesting that Hh signaling plays a role in the process that transitions fibrocartilage to tendon fibers. In addition, the removal of Hh signaling in <italic>Scleraxis</italic> (<italic>Scx</italic>)-expressing cells reduces the biomechanical strength of the adult mouse tendons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Liu et al., 2013</xref>). This suggests that Hh signaling regulates early events in tendon fiber formation and remodeling. These accumulating evidence sources prompted us to hypothesize that Hh signaling is implicated in tendon repair. Here, we identified a new adult tendon sheath specific marker <italic>Osteocalcin</italic>, which is encoded by the <italic>Bglap </italic>g<italic>ene</italic>. We established that <italic>Bglap</italic>-expressing cells from sheath tissues possess stem/progenitor cell properties and that they participate in tendon repair. More importantly, Hh signaling mediates its effect through TGFβ signaling to regulate the expression of <italic>Mkx</italic> and collagen I. Our studies demonstrate the first molecular evidence for the contribution of extrinsic sheath tissues during tendon healing and that manipulation of Hh signaling may be a therapeutic target for tendon repair.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Osteocalcin as a tendon sheath marker</title><p>The molecular evidence of extrinsic tissues in tendon repair is unclear. This is partly due to the lack of specific markers for molecular tracing of these cell populations during the repair process. To access the biology of tendon sheath tissues during tendon repair, we first determined markers that are specifically expressed in mouse adult tendon sheaths. <italic>Tppp3</italic> is the only marker reported that is expressed in developing sheath tissues, epitenon and paratenon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Staverosky et al., 2009</xref>). Consistent with this work in mouse embryos, we found that <italic>Tppp3</italic> was also specifically expressed in adult tendon sheaths (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Interestingly, <italic>Osteocalcin</italic>, which is encoded by the <italic>Bglap</italic> gene also showed a specific expression pattern similar to that of <italic>Tppp3</italic> in the sheath tissues. QRT-PCR analysis revealed that <italic>Tppp3</italic> and <italic>Bglap</italic> were highly expressed in sheath tissues as compared to tendon fibers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Thus, we asked whether <italic>Bglap</italic> can be used as an adult tendon sheath specific marker. We crossed <italic>BGLAP-Cre</italic> transgenic mice, a <italic>Cre</italic> line driven by the human BGLAP promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zhang et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mak et al., 2008a</xref>), with a <italic>Rosa26<sup>mT/mG</sup></italic> mouse line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Muzumdar et al., 2007</xref>) for lineage tracing of <italic>Bglap-</italic>expressing cells in tendon tissues. As expected, strong and specific GFP signals were detected in tissues surrounding the tendon fibers of the <italic>BGLAP-Cre;Rosa26<sup>mT/mG</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Cross-sections of tendon tissues displayed highly specific GFP signals in the sheath tissues but not in tendon fibers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). To further verify that the GFP<sup>+</sup> cells are highly specific to tendon sheaths but not tendon fibers, the sheath and fiber tissues of the <italic>BGLAP-Cre;Rosa26<sup>mT/mG</sup></italic> mice were dissected separately and subjected to cell-sorting for green fluorescence. We found that about 80% of the cells isolated from the sheath tissues were GFP<sup>+</sup>, of which approximately 1.5% had clonogenic capacity as shown by a colony-formation assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Consistently, both <italic>Tppp3</italic> and <italic>Bglap</italic> were strongly expressed in the sorted GFP<sup>+</sup> cells of the sheath tissues but poorly expressed in GFP<sup>–</sup> cells in the tendon fiber tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Thus, our data indicate that <italic>Bglap</italic> is specifically expressed in adult tendon sheaths and can be used as a tendon sheath specific marker.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30474.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Bglap as a tendon sheath specific marker.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Fluorescent immunohistochemistry of mouse sheath tissues of the adult Tibialis anterior tendon at 2 months old (n = 5 mice per group).

After 14 days, colonies derived from a single cell were visualized by fluorescence imaging and crystal violet staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>). Like tdTomato<sup>+</sup> tendon fiber-derived cells that possess stem-cell-like properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bi et al., 2007</xref>), GFP<sup>+</sup> sheath-derived cells also showed colonies of heterogeneous size and cell density. BMP2 and TGF-β1 are important factors in regulating bone and tendon formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rodeo et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Liu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gori et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pryce et al., 2009</xref>).

These responses were highly similar to those of tendon fiber-derived stem/progenitor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bi et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Next, we tested the multipotent differentiation potentials of the sheath-derived cells toward osteogenesis, adipogenesis and chondrogenesis as compared to tendon-fiber-derived cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C–H</xref>). We found that sheath-derived cells differentiated into all three lineages with differentiating potential comparable to that of tendon stem/progenitor cells.

A full-thickness medial edge of the defect was created along the entire Achilles tendon and the sheath tissues transplants were placed in close proximity underneath the injured tendon. Two days after injury, most of the GFP<sup>+</sup> sheath tissues were still localized at the implanted position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>).

Furthermore, the overall collagen content was significantly increased in the sheath-transplanted group after injury (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>).

It has been previously reported that Hh signaling is activated for tissue regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zhao et al., 2015</xref>). In addition, Hh signaling is also active at the insertion site and in tendon cells during tendon development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Liu et al., 2012</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">, 2013</xref>). Its activity correlates with cell proliferation rate in tendon tissues. These data suggest that Hh signaling may control the early differentiation process in tendon progenitor cells. Thus, we examined the gene profiles of tendon markers in wild-type mice after injury (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–C</xref>). We found that tendon progenitor markers and tendon ECM markers were all significantly upregulated after injury (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref>). We also noticed that Hh ligand Shh, but not Dhh and Ihh, was significantly upregulated in the sheath tissues after injury (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Thus, we tested the Hh signaling activity after injury <italic>in vivo</italic> by using a <italic>Ptch1<sup>lacZ/+</sup></italic> mouse model, which is derived from a floxed allele of <italic>Ptch1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mak et al., 2006</xref>). <italic>Ptch1</italic> is a transcriptional target of Hh signaling, and the expression of the <italic>LacZ</italic> gene represents the activity of Hh signaling. Conditional loss of <italic>Ptch1</italic> by crossing with <italic>Stra8-Cre</italic> mice leads to gain of <italic>LacZ</italic> expression in the germline embryowide. A full-thickness medial edge of the defect was introduced into the Tibialis anterior tendon of the left hind limb of the <italic>Ptch1<sup>lacZ/+</sup></italic> mice; the tendon fibers in this region were surrounded by true tendon sheaths. Interestingly, strong X-gal staining was observed at 2 weeks after injury in the surrounding sheath tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D,E</xref>). Hh target gene <italic>Gli1</italic>, as well as the tendon-sheath markers <italic>Tppp3</italic> and <italic>Bglap</italic>, were strongly induced in the injured tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>).

It remains to be determined, however, whether these sheath-derived <italic>Bglap<sup>+</sup></italic> lineage cells differentiate into genuine tenocytes or just scarring sheath cells that invade into the tendon proper after tendon injury. Our data show that the co-expression of <italic>Mkx</italic> and <italic>Col1a1</italic> in the <italic>Bglap<sup>+</sup></italic> cells is indistinguishable between tenocytes and sheath cells. More specific markers may be required to address this question definitively.</p><p>Interestingly, true tendon sheath does not continuously envelope the tendon fibers entirely. It covers only areas that are subjected to high levels of fiction, and is believed to lubricate the surrounding tissues during movement. Our findings unravel an additional novel function of sheath tissues that is specific for tendon remodeling and repair. As tendon fibers in regions of high fiction are more vulnerable to wearing and injuries, the proximity of progenitor cells in the sheath tissues provides an efficient source of cells for local or short-range migration for tendon fiber repair.</p><p>Our findings demonstrate that Hh signaling is strongly activated upon injury, possibly due to the strong induction and secretion of Shh (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). In fact, activation of Hh signaling in sheath tissues triggers the proliferation of sheath progenitor cells. This generates a pool of progenitor cells for tendon differentiation and tendon fiber repair. It has been shown previously that Hh signaling regulates the early differentiation of progenitor cells at the tendon insertion site during embryonic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Liu et al., 2012</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">, 2013</xref>). Our results further reveal the importance of activation of Hh signaling in early events during adult tendon repair. In addition, the activation of Hh signaling results in significant upregulation of <italic>Mkx</italic> expression. <italic>Mkx</italic> plays an important role in the differentiation of tendon progenitor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ito et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Suzuki et al., 2016</xref>). It has been shown that <italic>Mkx</italic>-expressing mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) significantly promote tendon healing by activation of TGFβ signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Liu et al., 2015</xref>). Our results also show that Hh signaling activates TGFβ signaling. TGFβ signaling is a major regulatory pathway for tenogenesis. It is essential for the recruitment and maintenance of tendon progenitors for tendon formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pryce et al., 2009</xref>). It also induces collagen formation and matrix remodeling during tendon healing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hou et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Potter et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kayama et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, activation of Hh signaling plays at least two roles. First, as an early event after injury, it ensures the availability of a sufficient pool of progenitor cells for repair. Second, it activates signaling cues for further cell differentiation and ECM production for tendon fiber regeneration. Our work suggests that activation of Hh signaling in sheath tissues may be a therapeutic intervention for tendon injury.</p><p>In conclusion, we have identified <italic>Bglap</italic> as a new marker for adult sheath tissues. <italic>Bglap</italic>-expressing sheath cells possess stem cell properties and contribute to tendon repair in which Hh signaling is necessary and sufficient to promote the proliferation of <italic>Mkx<sup>+</sup></italic> cells. Our results reveal important molecular evidence that Hh signaling is required for tendon repair that is mediated by extrinsic tendon sheath tissue.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent <break/>(<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>BGLAP-Cre;Rosa26<sup>mT/mG</sup></italic></td><td valign="top">This paper</td><td valign="top">NA</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent <break/>(<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>Ptch1<sup>c/c</sup>;BGLAP-Cre</italic></td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mak et al.

and accompanying author responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Osteocalcin expressing cells from tendon sheaths contribute to tendon repair by activating Hedgehog signaling&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been favorably evaluated by Didier Stainier (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Henry Kronenberg (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The reviewers agree that this is an interesting paper showing that tendon sheath cells express osteocalcin and have stem-like properties in vitro, including differentiation into cells with tendon-like gene expression. After transplantation, these cells clearly associate with the tendon, which correlates with upregulation of tendon-associated genes and improved mechanical properties of the injured tendon. While the reviewers note the many strengths of this substantial study, a major and unanimous concern was that the assertion that tendon sheath cells contribute to new tenocytes was not well enough substantiated. For example, the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> do not conclusively show that GFP<sup>+</sup> sheath cells are expressing a molecular tendon signature, as opposed to inducing neighboring host cells to induce these markers. An alternative explanation that cannot be excluded is that sheath cells contribute instead to scarring around the tendon, as sheath-mediated scarring is frequently considered a major clinical problem after laceration injuries (see studies by the labs of Richard Gelberman, Hani Awad, and Regis O'Keefe). Additional experiments are therefore required to demonstrate that HOC-Cre/GFP<sup>+</sup> sheath cells are differentiating into tenocytes after injury. This may involve FACS-sorting GFP<sup>+</sup> cells after the graft in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and performing molecular analysis and/or co-staining GFP<sup>+</sup> cells in sections with tendon markers (e.g. Mkx). It would also be helpful to demonstrate that HOC-Cre/GFP<sup>+</sup> cells contribute to new tenocytes after tendon injury (without grafting), for example by showing GFP<sup>+</sup> cells within the tendon in cross-section (i.e. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) and/or co-staining anti-GFP with anti-Mkx or other tendon markers after tendon repair following injury.</p><p>The reviewers also identified a number of more minor issues that should be addressed to improve the manuscript - listed below. The manuscript would also benefit from careful proofreading as there are a number of grammatical and spelling errors. Given that these new experiments may take some time, it may be helpful to hear what your plan will be to address these concerns and your expected time-frame, especially related to the major concern about HOC-Cre lineage tracing mentioned above.</p><p>1. The Mohawk antibody appears to stain beyond the nucleus, which is not typical for transcription factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>). It is also curious that Mkx is not observed in tendon cells since this is typically considered a tendon differentiation marker. Please explain. Mohawk in situ hybridization data for at least some of these experiments could help confirm results.</p><p>2. For histology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D-F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), native tendon controls should be included for comparison.</p><p>3. In their Discussion, the authors talk about how osteocalcin protein is likely to contribute to the tendon matrix proteins. While this is likely to be true, the authors should mention that osteocalcin is a secreted hormone that binds to receptors (one of which is called GPRC6A) and has been shown to have effects in mice on islets secreting insulin, and on fat, muscle, and nerve cells (see for example, Mera et al, Cell Metabolism 23:1078(16)). It would be useful (but not required here) to see if tendon cells, particularly after injury, express receptors for osteocalcin, and, of course, it would be of interest to know if osteocalcin KO mice have normal tendon repair. None of this needs to be shown for this paper, however. But the possible paracrine actions of osteocalcin should be mentioned.</p><p>4.

After transplantation, these cells clearly associate with the tendon, which correlates with upregulation of tendon-associated genes and improved mechanical properties of the injured tendon. While the reviewers note the many strengths of this substantial study, a major and unanimous concern was that the assertion that tendon sheath cells contribute to new tenocytes was not well enough substantiated. For example, the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> do not conclusively show that GFP<sup>+</sup>sheath cells are expressing a molecular tendon signature, as opposed to inducing neighboring host cells to induce these markers. An alternative explanation that cannot be excluded is that sheath cells contribute instead to scarring around the tendon, as sheath-mediated scarring is frequently considered a major clinical problem after laceration injuries (see studies by the labs of Richard Gelberman, Hani Awad, and Regis O'Keefe). Additional experiments are therefore required to demonstrate that HOC-Cre/GFP<sup>+</sup>sheath cells are differentiating into tenocytes after injury. This may involve FACS-sorting GFP<sup>+</sup>cells after the graft in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and performing molecular analysis and/or co-staining GFP<sup>+</sup>cells in sections with tendon markers (e.g. Mkx).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for these comments and suggestions. The expression of tendon progenitor marker Mkx was examined in the injured tendon sections (with/without sheath transplantation groups) as shown in newly added <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>. The Mkx expression was detected with the secondary antibody with far-red fluorescence (Excitation Maximum 633nm, A-21072, Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) to avoid the confusion with tdTomato signals (Excitation Maximum, 554nm). Our results showed that some of the GFP<sup>+</sup> cells expressed Mkx in the areas of the injured Achilles tendon tissues. Furthermore, FACS-sorted GFP<sup>+</sup> cells isolated from the graft in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> by qRT-PCR as shown in newly added <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B</xref> also showed upregulation of tendon progenitor marker <italic>Mkx</italic> and main ECM component <italic>Col1a1</italic> as compared to the control sheaths.

Strong Mkx expression is observed in the tendon progenitors at E13.5 and E14.5 (Anderson, Arredondo et al. 2006, Liu, Watson et al. 2010) and subsequently declined in differentiated tendon cells in the limb and tail tendons at E16.5. The expression of Mkx is very weak in tendon cells at postnatal stages P0 and P14.

In their Discussion, the authors talk about how osteocalcin protein is likely to contribute to the tendon matrix proteins. While this is likely to be true, the authors should mention that osteocalcin is a secreted hormone that binds to receptors (one of which is called GPRC6A) and has been shown to have effects in mice on islets secreting insulin, and on fat, muscle, and nerve cells (see for example, Mera et al, Cell Metabolism 23:1078(16)). It would be useful (but not required here) to see if tendon cells, particularly after injury, express receptors for osteocalcin, and, of course, it would be of interest to know if osteocalcin KO mice have normal tendon repair. None of this needs to be shown for this paper, however. But the possible paracrine actions of osteocalcin should be mentioned.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank for the comments.

It may be better to say that the data show that they participate in tendon repair.</p></disp-quote><p>We have revised the statement as suggested in the last paragraph of the Introduction.</p></body></sub-article></article>
