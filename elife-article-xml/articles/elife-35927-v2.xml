neurons and initiate persistent changes in cellular function. However, the impact of IEG-TFs on circuit connectivity and function is poorly understood. We investigate the specificity with which the IEG-TF NPAS4 governs experience-dependent changes in inhibitory synaptic input onto CA1 pyramidal neurons (PNs). We show that novel sensory experience selectively enhances somatic inhibition mediated by cholecystokinin-expressing basket cells (CCKBCs) in an NPAS4-dependent manner. NPAS4 specifically increases the number of synapses made onto PNs by individual CCKBCs without altering synaptic properties. Additionally, we find that sensory experience-driven NPAS4 expression enhances depolarization-induced suppression of inhibition (DSI), a short-term form of cannabinoid-mediated plasticity expressed at CCKBC synapses. Our results indicate that CCKBC inputs are a major target of the NPAS4-dependent transcriptional program in PNs and that NPAS4 is an important regulator of plasticity mediated by endogenous cannabinoids.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>NPAS4</kwd><kwd>immediate early gene transcription factor</kwd><kwd>CCK basket cell</kwd><kwd>DSI</kwd><kwd>CA1 pyramidal neuron</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000875</institution-id><institution>Pew Charitable Trusts</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>00028631</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bloodgood</surname><given-names>Brenda L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005665</institution-id><institution>Kinship Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>14-SSP-184</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bloodgood</surname><given-names>Brenda L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001391</institution-id><institution>Whitehall Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2013-12-88</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bloodgood</surname><given-names>Brenda L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2013154395</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hartzell</surname><given-names>Andrea L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Behaviorally-driven expression of the immediate early gene transcription factor NPAS4 changes local circuit connectivity and short-term plasticity by selectively recruiting CCK basket cell synapses to pyramidal neuron somas.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Immediate-early gene transcription factors (IEG-TFs) are expressed in response to sensory experiences and are routinely used to identify task-relevant neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bullitt, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Guenthner et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Renier et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Ye et al., 2016</xref>), including those associated with memory formation and behavioral plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alén et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cai et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cowansage et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Garner et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mayford and Reijmers, 2015</xref>). In spite of their wide-spread use as tools, surprisingly little is known about how IEG-TFs alter connectivity between specific neuron subtypes, influence plasticity, or impact circuit function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Minatohara et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>The IEG-TF neuronal PAS domain protein 4 (NPAS4) is expressed exclusively in response to membrane depolarization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lin et al., 2008</xref>), explicitly linking this expression to the activity history of the neuron. Behaviorally induced NPAS4 directs the reorganization of inhibition along the somato-dendritic axis of hippocampal pyramidal neurons (PNs), enhancing somatic inhibition and reducing inhibition in the proximal dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bloodgood et al., 2013</xref>). NPAS4 is therefore poised to convert transient increases in neuronal activity into long-lasting changes in how PNs are functionally embedded in the local inhibitory circuit. However, we do not know whether the expression of NPAS4 in PNs leads to the regulation of synapses made by specific inhibitory neuron subtypes.</p><p>Inhibitory neuron subtypes are highly heterogeneous, each with distinct functions within their local circuit. In CA1 of the hippocampus, somatic inhibition is provided by cholecystokinin (CCK)- and parvalbumin (PV)-expressing basket cells (BCs), which have unique and complementary roles in gating PN output. This provides a straightforward system in which to ask whether NPAS4 regulates select subtypes of inhibitory inputs. Fast-spiking PVBCs provide reliable, precisely timed neurotransmission in response to predominantly feedforward synaptic input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Glickfeld and Scanziani, 2006</xref>), positioning them to finely regulate the timing of PN action potential (AP) firing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pouille and Scanziani, 2001</xref>). By contrast, CCKBCs elicit slower and less reliable, asynchronous inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Daw et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hefft and Jonas, 2005</xref>) in response to the summation of both feedforward and feedback synaptic input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Glickfeld and Scanziani, 2006</xref>). Importantly, CCKBCs express a variety of neuromodulatory receptors, including cannabinoid receptors (CB1Rs) that are localized to their axon terminals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dudok et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Glickfeld et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Katona et al., 1999</xref>). Indeed, activation of CCKBC CB1Rs by endocannabinoids, which are released from postsynaptic PNs, underlies depolarization-induced suppression of inhibition (DSI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wilson and Nicoll, 2001</xref>), a form of retrograde signaling that confers onto active PNs a transient window of increased excitability and plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Carlson et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chevaleyre and Castillo, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zhu and Lovinger, 2007</xref>). Activity-driven NPAS4 expression increases somatic inhibition onto PNs, but it is unknown whether this synaptic regulation is interneuron subtype-specific. Given the marked differences between PV- and CCKBCs, the functional significance of experience-driven modulation of somatic inhibition will be determined by the subtype(s) of basket cell synapses that are regulated by NPAS4 expression.</p><p>Using behavioral manipulations in combination with electrophysiological, pharmacological, and anatomical approaches, we show that novel sensory experiences selectively increase the number of inhibitory synapses made by individual CCKBCs onto CA1 PNs through an NPAS4-dependent mechanism. Moreover, we find that this interneuron subtype-specific circuit change strongly enhances DSI expression by active PNs.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>NPAS4 is expressed in CA1 PNs in response to environmental enrichment</title><p>We manipulated the sensory experiences of juvenile wildtype (WT) mice by housing littermates in an enriched environment (EE), which consisted of a running wheel and several novel objects that were regularly refreshed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, see 'Materials and methods' for details).

The overlap of immunofluorescence within the pyramidal cell layer was quantified as a proxy for somatic inhibitory synapses.</p><p>We compared immunofluorescence between WT and KO hemispheres in mice housed in SE and EE using a two-way ANOVA and observed a significant effect of genotype and housing as well as a significant interaction effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>; Genotype: F(1,37)=17.96, p=0.0001; Housing: F(1,37)=16.38, p=0.0003; Interaction: F(1,37)=11.46, p=0.0017, two-way ANOVA).

To answer this question, the CA1 region of the hippocampus was infected with AAV-Cre-GFP to generate a sparse population of <italic>Npas4</italic> KO neurons within a larger population of WT neurons. Four days after virus injection, animals were housed in SE or EE for 4–7 days and then acute hippocampal slices were prepared. Simultaneous whole-cell voltage clamp recordings were obtained from neighboring WT and <italic>Npas4</italic> KO PNs within superficial or deep sublayers of CA1. Evoked inhibitory postsynaptic currents (eIPSCs) were elicited by focal stimulation of axons in the pyramidal cell layer and monosynaptic inhibitory currents were isolated by bath application of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor antagonists (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H,I,K, and L</xref> 10 μM CPP and NBQX). Consistent with our immunohistochemistry data, we measured no systematic difference in eIPSC amplitudes between WT and KO neurons in mice from SE in either superficial or deep PNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H and K</xref>; Superficial – WT: 1059.9 ± 198.9 pA, KO: 1119.8 ± 192.5 pA, t=1.01, p=0.33, paired t-test, Deep – WT: 952.5 ± 200.7 pA, KO: 959.4 ± 139.55, W=−6.00, p=0.79, Wilcoxon Signed-rank test). However, housing mice in an EE resulted in considerably larger eIPSCs in WT neurons relative to neighboring <italic>Npas4</italic> KO neurons when the pair of PNs was localized to superficial CA1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>; WT: 1035.3 ± 196.9 pA, KO: 715.2 ± 116.1 pA, t=2.27, p=0.04, paired t-test).

Increased sensory experience associated with EE, however, led to a significant increase in immunofluorescence in superficial CA1 from WT hemispheres that was not present in the KO hemispheres (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref>; EE: superficial – WT: 159.51 ± 28.30 AU, KO: 67.87 ± 9.45 AU, p&lt;0.001, two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post hoc tests).

Stimulation of axons in the cell body layer produces an eIPSC that is a mixture of CCK- and PVBC inputs. These cell types utilize distinct subtypes of voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs) to trigger neurotransmitter release (N- and P/Q-type, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hefft and Jonas, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Poncer et al., 1997</xref>), enabling the pharmacological isolation of CCKBC neurotransmission by blocking P/Q-type VGCCs (300 nM ω−agatoxin IVA [ω−AgTx-IVA], <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mintz et al., 1992</xref>). Juvenile mice were stereotaxically infected with AAV-Cre-GFP in order to generate a sparse population of <italic>Npas4-</italic>knockout neurons in CA1. After four days, mice were housed in SE or EE for an additional 4–7 days and acute slices were prepared as above. In superficial CA1 of mice from SE, when P/Q-type VGCCs were antagonized and eIPSCs were evoked by electrical stimulation of axons in the pyramidal cell layer, eIPSCs originating from CCKBCs were of equivalent amplitudes in <italic>Npas4</italic> KO PNs and neighboring WT PNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>; WT: 778.7 ± 158.8 pA, KO: 960.1 ± 161.2 pA, t=1.01, p=0.33, paired t-test). In superficial CA1 of mice from EE, eIPSCs originating from CCKBCs were ~30% smaller in <italic>Npas4</italic> KO neurons than in neighboring WT neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>; WT: 552.47 ± 104.75 pA, KO: 389. 80 ± 121.90 pA, W=84, p=0.032, Wilcoxon Signed-rank Test). Importantly, housing mice in an EE significantly increased the normalized difference in CCKBC eIPSC amplitudes between WT and KO PNs in superficial CA1 relative to that seen in mice in SE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>; SE: 0.081 ± 0.10, EE: 0.31 ± 0.07, t=1.18, p=0.041, unpaired t-test).

We first determined the rate of successes and failures of transmission from individual CCKBCs onto WT and KO PNs. Although there were few failures recorded in both genotypes, uIPSCs recorded in <italic>Npas4</italic> KO PNs had a significantly lower success rate than did WT neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>; WT: 0.94 ± 0.02, KO: 0.82 ± 0.04; U=22.00, p=0.01, Mann-Whitney U Test; 60–100 trials per connected pair, APs evoked at 0.1 Hz). This difference in success rate could be explained in one of two ways; NPAS4 could regulate <italic>P</italic> for individual CCKBC synapses, resulting in the measurement of a higher average success rate for CCKBC–WT PN pairs. Alternatively, NPAS4 could regulate the number of synapses made between CCKBC–PN pairs, such that a higher success rate would be recorded from pairs that have a greater number of synaptic contacts between them, even if all synapses had the same <italic>P</italic>. To test whether NPAS4 might regulate release probability at individual CCKBC synaptic contacts, we measured the postsynaptic responses to pairs of APs and calculated paired pulse ratios (PPRs). Changes in this type of short-term plasticity are generally attributed to shifts in <italic>P</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Regehr, 2012</xref>). However, we detected no effect of genotype on PPRs as well as no interaction between genotype and PPR at various inter-spike-intervals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>; 20 ms – WT: 0.81 ± 0.11, KO: 1.04 ± 0.18, 50 ms – WT: 0.85 ± 0.13, KO: 0.99 ± 0.12, 200 ms – WT: 0.83 ± 0.04, KO: 0.78 ± 0.10, and 1000 ms – WT: 0.94 ± 0.07, KO: 0.83 ± 0.17; Genotype: F(1,57)=0.77, p=0.39; Inter-spike-interval: F(3,57)=0.12, p=0.94; Interaction: F(3,57)=0.64, p=0.59), suggesting that the probability of release at individual synapses made onto WT and KO neurons is unchanged. Similarly, the latency to uIPSC onset after AP firing by the CCKBC was unchanged between the two PN genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>; WT: 1.65 ± 0.12 ms, KO: 1.66 ± 0.17 ms, U=51.00, p=0.80, Mann-Whitney U Test), providing further evidence for similar presynaptic organization between synapses converging on <italic>Npas4</italic> WT and KO neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boudkkazi et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sabatini and Regehr, 1999</xref>).</p><p>If release probability at CCKBC synapses onto WT and KO neurons is indistinguishable, an NPAS4-mediated increase in the number of contact sites made by individual CCKBCs onto PNs is the most parsimonious mechanism to account for the lower success rate of uIPSCs in <italic>Npas4</italic> KO neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Del Castillo and Katz, 1954</xref>). To confirm this and to investigate possible changes in <italic>Q</italic>, we calculated the coefficient of variation (CV) and variance of the uIPSC amplitude recorded from each PN and compared this to the mean uIPSC amplitude. Comparing the CV for each PN’s uIPSC amplitude to the mean response revealed a strong negative correlation across all cells, with smaller-amplitude uIPSCs having larger CVs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref>). The average CV for WT PNs was half that measured from KO neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J</xref>; WT: 44.17 ± 5.90, KO: 79.40 ± 9.80, t=3.199, p=0.005, unpaired t-test), indicating that the difference in uIPSC amplitudes between WT and <italic>Npas4</italic> KO neurons is due to a change in <italic>N</italic> and unlikely to reflect differences in <italic>Q</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berninger et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kerchner and Nicoll, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Le Bé et al., 2007</xref>). Moreover, variance–mean analysis of uIPSC amplitudes shows a linear relationship for both CCKBC–WT PN and CCKBC–KO PN pairs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5K</xref>; WT: R<sup>2</sup>=0.89, KO: R<sup>2</sup>=0.84) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Foster and Regehr, 2004</xref>). Strikingly, the linear fits of the WT and KO data sets are essentially superimposable (slope – WT: 55.55 ± 4.73, KO: 54.91 ± 5.46), confirming that the probability of release is unchanged and providing an indirect measurement of the quantal amplitude as ~55 pA in both genotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Reid and Clements, 1999</xref>).</p><p>CCKBCs generate significant asynchronous release, which is quantal in nature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Daw et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hefft and Jonas, 2005</xref>), thus we measured the amplitude of asynchronous events allowing us to measure Q directly. A series of 20 APs were evoked at 40 Hz in the CCKBC and the amplitude of asynchronous events quantified during the first 100 ms after the last spike (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5L</xref>).

We compared the percent suppression of spontaneous IPSC integrated current after DSI (DSI magnitude) in WT and KO PNs from mice in both housing conditions. In WT PNs from mice housed in SE, spontaneous IPSCs were suppressed by approximately 25% after the spike train (DSI magnitude, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Notably, housing mice in EE resulted in a nearly two-fold increase in DSI magnitude relative to SE in WT PNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B and C</xref>, DSI magnitude in WT – SE: 26 ± 7%, EE: 48 ± 4%, p&lt;0.05, two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post hoc test).

Thus NPAS4 likely enhances the gradient of CCKBC inhibition along the superficial to deep axis, and our finding reinforces the idea that superficial and deep CA1 PNs form separate microcircuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Danielson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Geiller et al., 2017</xref>).

Intriguingly, these findings indicate that CCKBCs and PNs communicate through a unique signaling pathway that is dynamically established by the expression of an IEG-TF in the postsynaptic PN. The next challenge will be to elucidate the molecular mechanisms through which experience-driven NPAS4 in PNs specifically communicates with CCKBCs to signal the need for more synapses. Recent work has revealed that the formation of CCKBC synapses relies on postsynaptic expression of the dystroglycan complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Früh et al., 2016</xref>), whereas formation of PVBC synapses does not. Dystroglycans, and the proteins that associate with them, are compelling candidates through which NPAS4 may regulate CCKBC synapses, although others may yet be identified.</p><p>In comparison to PVBCs, CCKBCs are less well-studied. A distinguishing characteristic of CCKBCs is the sensitivity of their synapses to cannabinoids, and consequently their susceptibility to dynamic regulation by the postsynaptic PN through DSI. Here, we have uncovered an experience-driven enhancement of DSI that requires NPAS4 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), generating several intriguing hypotheses about how the expression of this IEG-TF might shape PN network dynamics. For example, our data imply that PNs in which NPAS4 is expressed will be subject to enhanced CCKBC inhibition, thus reducing CA1 PN spiking during low to moderate network activity. However, when PN activity levels surpass the threshold for triggering cannabinoid production, leading to the temporary suppression of transmission from CCKBCs through DSI, a temporal window will open in which the PN can disinhibit itself, generate more APs, and lower the threshold for plasticity. More broadly, a function of NPAS4 expression may be to increase the signal and reduce the noise within the local microcircuit by refining PN firing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bartos and Elgueta, 2012</xref>). As DSI of CCKBC synapses can also facilitate the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) in PNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Carlson et al., 2002</xref>), this window of disinhibition may facilitate LTP at inputs active during DSI and help to coordinate the plasticity of common inputs to NPAS4-expressing neurons. These hypotheses simply require NPAS4 to regulate DSI by increasing the number of CCKBC synapses, effectively increasing the ratio of somatic inputs onto a PN that are susceptible to DSI, but our experiments cannot rule out the possibility that NPAS4 is also a direct regulator of the DSI pathway.</p><p>There is accumulating evidence in support of a role for CCKBCs in shaping hippocampal circuit function. Indeed, abnormal wiring of CCK inhibitory neurons disrupts the spatial coherence of place fields (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Del Pino et al., 2017</xref>), and the opposing gradients of inhibition from PV- and CCKBCs along the superficial to deep axis of the hippocampus underlies the heterogeneity of PN spiking associated with sharp wave ripples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Valero et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, NPAS4-dependent recruitment of CCKBC inputs may play a role in the spatial coherence of place fields and increase the difference in firing patterns observed during active and resting behavior states.</p><p>Notably, exposure of animals to EE induced NPAS4 in similar numbers of PNs localized to superficial or deep CA1, yet we did not detect a significant effect of EE or a requirement of NPAS4 in regulating somatic inhibition in the deep sublayer. This sublayer specificity may indicate that NPAS4 regulates target genes that selectively recruit CCKBC boutons to both superficial and deep PNs, but that a preexisting preference of CCKBC axons for superficial CA1 is the limiting organizational feature. Alternatively, different types of behavioral manipulations may reveal a more significant NPAS4-mediated inhibitory synapse phenotype in deep CA1 PNs. It is also worth noting that while we do not observe a significant change in somatic inhibition of PNs in deep CA1, NPAS4 expression in these cells may regulate other populations of synapses, such as those made by dendrite-targeting INs. The current study describes a role for NPAS4 in regulating somatic inhibition specifically provided by CCKBCs to superficial CA1 PNs, however NPAS4 has also been reported to decrease inhibitory synapses in the proximal apical dendrites of CA1 PNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bloodgood et al., 2013</xref>). A thorough investigation into the nature of NPAS4-dependent regulation of dendritic inhibitory synapses is a crucial next step toward understanding how sensory experience shapes information processing by hippocampal PNs.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type (species) <break/>or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Gene (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td><italic>Npas4</italic></td><td>NA</td><td>Gene ID: 225872</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent <break/>(<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td><italic>Npas4<sup>f/f</sup></italic></td><td>Michael Greenberg <break/>(HMS)</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent <break/>(Adeno-associated virus)</td><td><italic>Cre-GFP</italic></td><td>Penn Vector Core</td><td>AAV1.hSyn.HI.eGFP- <break/>Cre.WPRE.SV40</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent <break/>(Adeno-associated virus)</td><td><italic>mRFP</italic></td><td>Penn Vector Core</td><td>AAV1.hSyn.TurboRFP.WPRE.rBG</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>anti-Npas4</td><td>Michael Greenberg <break/>(HMS)</td><td/><td>1 to 1000</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>anti-Gephyrin</td><td>Synaptic Systems</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2619834">AB_2619834</ext-link></td><td>1 to 200</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>anti-VGAT</td><td>Synaptic Systems</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_887873">AB_887873</ext-link></td><td>1 to 350</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>anti-CB1R</td><td>Synaptic Systems</td><td>RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2619970">AB_2619970</ext-link></td><td>1 to 500</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>anti-parvalbumin</td><td>Abcam</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_298032">AB_298032</ext-link></td><td>1 to 1000</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>anti-NeuN</td><td>Synaptic Systems</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2619988">AB_2619988</ext-link></td><td>1 to 1000</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>Further information and requests for resources and reagents should be directed to lead contact, Brenda Bloodgood (blbloodgood@ucsd.edu).</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animal husbandry and handling</title><p>Animals were handled according to protocols approved by the UC San Diego Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, which were in accordance with federal guidelines.

interests of transparency, eLife includes the editorial decision letter and accompanying author responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;The IEG <italic>Npas4</italic> recruits CCK basket cell synapses and enhances cannabinoid-mediated plasticity in the mouse hippocampus&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Gary Westbrook as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Imre Vida (Reviewer #2). The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This paper shows that enriched environment exposure causes increases in CCK basket cell synapses onto pyramidal cells in CA1, and associated increases in depolarization-induced suppression of inhibition, and that these effects are induced by increased levels of the inducible transcription factor NPAS4. All three reviewers agreed that these are important and significant results and that the data supporting the main results are convincing. However, there are some points that should be clarified to increase the likelihood that these results would have a broad impact. Also, some conclusions should be toned down (i.e., all conclusions must be based strongly on convincing data, see essential points 2-6 below). The specific substantial concerns are listed below.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Throughout the manuscript, the authors compare different experimental effects, but it is unclear whether they compared the different experimental effects in the same statistical analysis, as is proper (see Nieuwenhuis et al., Nature Neuroscience 2011). As one example (although this issue persists throughout the paper), in Figure 2C, where the authors refer to an ANOVA, what exactly did they test in the ANOVA? Did they observe a significant interaction between environmental condition and genotype? Related to this point, the authors should report statistics (e.g., F-statistics) and degrees of freedom, not just p-values.</p><p>2) Regarding the Abstract and Introduction, last paragraph, Discussion, second paragraph (Selective enhancement of CCKBC inhibition). In the paired recording experiments, the authors do not report if <italic>Npas4</italic> KO affected PVBC-PN unitary IPSCs, after EE or SE exposure. Were experiments of this type carried out at the same time as the reported experiments and not reported (since paired recordings were conducted blindly to interneuron types, and identified with posthoc anatomy)? Without such experiments the conclusions of cell-type selective actions are not strongly supported by the physiological evidence. The sole physiological evidence of selectivity is that the presumed PVBC eIPSC (in conotoxin) is unaffected by <italic>Npas4</italic> KO after EE exposure. However, this is indirect evidence of lack of effect on presumed PVBC synapses. For this reason, without these data, the conclusions regarding cell specificity of these effects should be toned down.</p><p>3) The authors' conclusion that EE selectively enhances inhibition mediated by CCKBCs is not supported by direct evidence. This was tested for PVBC-PN synapses (Figure 4—figure supplement 2) showing no change in unitary connectivity of PVBC to PC. But the authors did not test in WT mice if eIPSCs in superficial PNs (ex. Figure 1), pharmacologically isolated IPSC (ex. Figure 2) or unitary IPSCs of CCKBC-PN pairs (ex. Figure 4) were larger after EE relative to SE. The results with KO showed that a component of these IPSCs is <italic>Npas4</italic>-dependent after EE, but it is not clear if this &quot;new&quot; <italic>Npas4</italic>-dependent component contributes to an enhancement of synaptic inhibition, or not. For this reason, the strength of these conclusions should be toned down.</p><p>4) Experience-driven NPAS4 expression is similar in superficial and deep PNs, yet anatomical evidence indicates changes in inhibitory synaptic connectivity (VGAT, gephyrin, CB1R) only in superficial PNs. The physiological evidence about NPAS4 effects in deep and superficial PNs is not so clear. The authors do not systematically report (and presumably did not test) <italic>Npas4</italic> KO effects in SE and EE, on IPSCs in superficial and deep PNs (i.e., subsection “NPAS4 underlies an experience-dependent enhancement of somatic inhibition in superficial CA1”, last paragraph and Figure 1: the effects of KO in deep PNs after SE exposure was not tested?; subsection “NPAS4 exclusively regulates CCKBC, not PVBC, synapses in CA1”, fourth paragraph and Figure 2: the effects of KO in sup and deep PNs in SE condition was not tested?; subsection “NPAS4 exclusively regulates CCKBC, not PVBC, synapses in CA1”, last paragraph and Figure 3: the effects of KO in sup PNs after SE, or in deep PNs after SE and EE, were not tested?; subsection “NPAS4 strengthens CCKBC input by increasing the number of synapses made by individual CCKBCs onto a PN”, first paragraph and Figure 4: was the effect of KO on unitary CCKBC IPSCs only observed after EE? Is the effect of KO absent in mice exposed to SE?). In the absence of these data, the conclusions, again, should be toned down.</p><p>5) Subsection “NPAS4 strengthens CCKBC input by increasing the number of synapses made by individual CCKBCs onto a PN”, fourth paragraph, and Figure 5: The rate of success of transmission in CCKBC-PN pair recordings was reduced after <italic>Npas4</italic> KO. This seems as the closest direct measure of presynaptic probability of release at those synapses that the authors have. Thus it would seem that their conclusion of unaltered properties of unitary IPSCs (subsection “NPAS4 strengthens CCKBC input by increasing the number of synapses made by 232 individual CCKBCs onto a PN”, fifth and last paragraphs, Discussion, second paragraph and elsewhere) is incorrect, as is their conclusion of no change in presynaptic release probability. Although it is not clear how <italic>Npas4</italic> KO postsynaptically would affect presynaptic release, it would seem that the authors cannot rule out such changes.</p><p>6) Abstract, Introduction, last paragraph, subsection “Sensory Experience Enhances DSI Expression in CA1 PNs through an <italic>Npas4</italic>-Dependent Mechanism”, Figure 6: With regard to NPAS4 as regulator of plasticity, it is not clear if NPAS4 is a direct or indirect regulator of plasticity because of enhanced spontaneous inhibition. Could the increased magnitude in DSI after EE be due to the increased level of synaptic inhibition after EE? In Figure 6, the level of sIPSC activity seems higher after EE relative to SE in wt. Is this actually the case? Are sIPSC frequency and amplitude different in SE vs EE? Is there a correlation between sIPSC frequency pre-DSI and magnitude of DSI (in SE and EE)? Does normalizing/reducing sIPSC activity after EE to similar levels as SE, restore DSI magnitude? This would seem important to resolve since if so <italic>Npas4</italic> regulation of DSI would be indirect and due to its effect on level of inhibition. These possibilities should be addressed or discussed.</p><p>7) Regarding the title, IEG is not necessarily a standard acronym that is understood by the broad scientific audience of <italic>eLife. eLife</italic> tries to avoid all acronyms in the title. Also, &quot;plasticity&quot; may be misleading, and the authors should consider using &quot;modulation&quot; instead.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.35927.026</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Throughout the manuscript, the authors compare different experimental effects, but it is unclear whether they compared the different experimental effects in the same statistical analysis, as is proper (see Nieuwenhuis et al., Nature Neuroscience 2011).

In the paired recording experiments, the authors do not report if Npas4 KO affected PVBC-PN unitary IPSCs, after EE or SE exposure.

However, this is indirect evidence of lack of effect on presumed PVBC synapses. For this reason, without these data, the conclusions regarding cell specificity of these effects should be toned down.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included two additional experiments (Figure 3 and Figure 3—figure supplement 1) exploring the impact of EE and NPAS4 on PVBC synapses. We do not see any evidence of EE or NPAS4-dependent regulation of PVBC synapses made onto PNs in any context. Nonetheless, we do not have sufficient data to completely assert this (i.e. synaptically connected pairs of PVBC and NPAS4 knockout PNs from mice housed in SE and EE) so we have addressed this in the Discussion.</p><p>To briefly summarize our findings with respect to PVBCs:</p><p>- Figure 3: We show by co-immunostaining for VGAT, gephyrin, and PV that WT and KO hemispheres are indistinguishable in both superficial and deep CA1 from mice housed in SE or EE. Thus, the immunostaining proxies for PVBC synapses do not change with EE or genotype.</p><p>- Figure 3:In the presence of conotoxin to isolate PVBC inputs, neighboring WT and KO PNs have similar amplitude evoked IPSCs in superficial CA1 from mice housed in SE and EE. Thus, PVBC mediated inhibition within the superficial sub-layer does not change, even though this is the region where we see both EE and NPAS4 dependent changes in inhibition</p><p>- Figure 3—figure supplement 1: In the presence of conotoxin, WT and KO PNs have similar amplitude evoked IPSCs in deep CA1 from mice in housed in EE.</p><p>- Figure 4:The amplitude of unitary IPSCs recorded from synaptically connected PVBC–WT PNs pairs from mice housed in SE and EE are indistinguishable, confirming EE does not appreciably change PVBC inputs onto individual PNs.</p><p>Collectively these data indicate that PV inputs onto PNs do not appreciably change between SE and EE and loss of NPAS4 also does not have a detectable impact on PVBC synapses isolated pharmacologically. However, we don’t have data looking specifically at synaptically connected PVBC-NPAS4 KO PNs pairs. When we began searching for synaptically connected BC–NPAS4 KO PN pairs, we had already established that EE was not significantly impacting PVBC-PN inhibitory synapses but was changing CCKBC-PN connectivity. Because of this, we focused on CCKBC–PN connections and did not look for synaptically connect PNs when the presynaptic neuron had the electrophysiological profile of a PVBC. As these experiments are quite low yield, it was not possible for us to collect this data set within the 2-month revision period, but this caveat is addressed in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors' conclusion that EE selectively enhances inhibition mediated by CCKBCs is not supported by direct evidence. This was tested for PVBC-PN synapses (Figure 4—figure supplement 2) showing no change in unitary connectivity of PVBC to PC. But the authors did not test in WT mice if eIPSCs in superficial PNs (ex. Figure 1), pharmacologically isolated IPSC (ex. Figure 2) or unitary IPSCs of CCKBC-PN pairs (ex. Figure 4) were larger after EE relative to SE. The results with KO showed that a component of these IPSCs is Npas4-dependent after EE, but it is not clear if this &quot;new&quot; Npas4-dependent component contributes to an enhancement of synaptic inhibition, or not. For this reason, the strength of these conclusions should be toned down.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included new data supporting our assertion that EE selectively enhances inhibition from CCKBCs onto PNs.</p><p>- Most directly we now show in Figure 4 that the amplitude of unitary IPSCs recorded from synaptically connected CCKBCs and WT PN pairs more than doubles in animals from EE as compared to SE.</p><p>- Figure 2: We now show that in the presence of agatoxin to isolate CCKBC inputs, neighboring WT and KO PNs have similar amplitude evoked IPSCs in superficial CA1 from mice housed in SE. Previously we had shown that in mice housed in EE, the evoked IPSC is larger in the WT PN in comparison to the neighboring KO PN.</p><p>- Figure 2—figure supplement 1: We show that in the presence of agatoxin, WT and KO PNs have similar amplitude evoked IPSCs deep CA1 from mice housed in EE, again indicating NPAS4 specifically regulates somatic inhibition onto superficial CA1 PNs.</p><p>Thus, EE doubles the unitary IPSC made by CCKBCs onto WT PNs. This phenotype is restricted to superficial CA1 and it not present in NPAS4 KO neurons.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Experience-driven NPAS4 expression is similar in superficial and deep PNs, yet anatomical evidence indicates changes in inhibitory synaptic connectivity (VGAT, gephyrin, CB1R) only in superficial PNs. The physiological evidence about NPAS4 effects in deep and superficial PNs is not so clear. The authors do not systematically report (and presumably did not test) Npas4 KO effects in SE and EE, on IPSCs in superficial and deep PNs (i.e., subsection “NPAS4 underlies an experience-dependent enhancement of somatic inhibition in superficial CA1”, last paragraph and Figure 1: the effects of KO in deep PNs after SE exposure was not tested?; subsection “NPAS4 exclusively regulates CCKBC, not PVBC, synapses in CA1”, fourth paragraph and Figure 2: the effects of KO in sup and deep PNs in SE condition was not tested?; subsection “NPAS4 exclusively regulates CCKBC, not PVBC, synapses in CA1”, last paragraph and Figure 3: the effects of KO in sup PNs after SE, or in deep PNs after SE and EE, were not tested?; subsection “NPAS4 strengthens CCKBC input by increasing the number of synapses made by individual CCKBCs onto a PN”, first paragraph and Figure 4: was the effect of KO on unitary CCKBC IPSCs only observed after EE? Is the effect of KO absent in mice exposed to SE?). In the absence of these data, the conclusions, again, should be toned down.</p></disp-quote><p>We now include data comparing WT and KO PNs in superficial and deep CA1 from animals in SE and EE (Figure 1). Additionally (and described in the response to points 2 and 3), we detect an EE and NPAS4 dependent change in CCKBC inputs onto superficial CA1 PNs but not deep (Figure 2, Figure 2—figure supplement 1); PVBC are unchanged in every context (Figure 3, Figure 3—figure supplement 1). We also have evaluated uIPSCs from CCKBCs onto WT PNs in SE and see they are smaller than in EE and comparable to uIPSCs recorded from KO PNs in EE (Figure 4). Together these data show that EE and NPAS4 are only impacting somatic inhibition in superficial CA1 PNs and this phenotype emerges from experience and NPAS4-dependent increases in CCKBC inputs.</p><p>We do not exclude the possibility that NPAS4 expression in deep CA1 PNs regulates some other aspect of PN function (for example dendritic inhibitory synapses) and this is explicitly included in the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Subsection “NPAS4 strengthens CCKBC input by increasing the number of synapses made by individual CCKBCs onto a PN”, fourth paragraph, and Figure 5: The rate of success of transmission in CCKBC-PN pair recordings was reduced after Npas4 KO. This seems as the closest direct measure of presynaptic probability of release at those synapses that the authors have. Thus it would seem that their conclusion of unaltered properties of unitary IPSCs (subsection “NPAS4 strengthens CCKBC input by increasing the number of synapses made by 232 individual CCKBCs onto a PN”, fifth and last paragraphs, Discussion, second paragraph and elsewhere) is incorrect, as is their conclusion of no change in presynaptic release probability. Although it is not clear how Npas4 KO postsynaptically would affect presynaptic release, it would seem that the authors cannot rule out such changes.</p></disp-quote><p>The success rate of transmission at a single synapse is directly related to the probability of release. Since each CCKBC axon makes multiple synapses, and transmission from each synapse is independent, the success rate recorded in the postsynaptic neuron conflates P and N. For example, if there are 2 boutons each with p = 0.5, the success rate of detecting any transmission between the cells would be 75%. But if there are 15 synapses each with P = 0.5, the predicted success rate of transmission between the cells would be essentially 1. Our measurements of paired pulse facilitation, a reliable indicator of P, at CCKBC synapses made onto WT and KO PNs are not significantly different between genotypes. This suggests that the number of synapses made onto KO neurons is likely smaller resulting in a lower overall success rate for transmission. We have attempted to communicate this more clearly in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Abstract, Introduction, last paragraph, subsection “Sensory Experience Enhances DSI Expression in CA1 PNs through an Npas4-Dependent Mechanism”, Figure 6: With regard to NPAS4 as regulator of plasticity, it is not clear if NPAS4 is a direct or indirect regulator of plasticity because of enhanced spontaneous inhibition.

These possibilities should be addressed or discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>We have quantified spontaneous IPSC frequency and amplitude in WT and KO PNs from SE and EE.

We observed no effect of genotype on sIPSC frequency at baseline as well as no interaction effect. For sIPSC amplitude at baseline, we observe no effect of housing environment, genotype, or interaction. While higher sIPSC frequency in SE at baseline is surprising, this is hard to interpret in the context of using carbachol to induce spontaneous IPSCs. As a cholinergic agonist, carbachol will increase spontaneous release from multiple cell types. This is especially confounding given that experience-induced <italic>Npas4</italic> has been shown to decrease dendritic inhibitory synapses in mice housed in EE. It is also possible that some component of the cholinergic system in the hippocampus is down regulated by activity induced by environmental enrichment. Because of these considerations, we cannot interpret this piece of information in good faith so we would prefer to not include it in the final manuscript. We do find it to be an extremely interesting observation that we hope to explore further in the future.</p><p>To the reviewers’ next point, there is no significant correlation between sIPSC frequency and the magnitude of DSI by linear regression for each data set: SE WT, SE KO, EE WT, and EE KO. We have addressed whether <italic>Npas4</italic> might be regulating DSI indirectly through increasing CCKBC synapses versus directly regulating the DSI pathway in the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Regarding the title, IEG is not necessarily a standard acronym that is understood by the broad scientific audience of eLife. eLife tries to avoid all acronyms in the title.
