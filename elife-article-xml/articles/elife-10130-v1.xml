How talin and kindlin contribute to these events in non-hematopoietic cells is poorly understood. Here we report that fibroblasts lacking either talin or kindlin failed to activate β1 integrins, adhere to fibronectin (FN) or maintain their integrins in a high affinity conformation induced by Mn<sup>2+</sup>. Despite compromised integrin activation and adhesion, Mn<sup>2+</sup> enabled talin- but not kindlin-deficient cells to initiate spreading on FN. This isotropic spreading was induced by the ability of kindlin to directly bind paxillin, which in turn bound focal adhesion kinase (FAK) resulting in FAK activation and the formation of lamellipodia. Our findings show that talin and kindlin cooperatively activate integrins leading to FN binding and adhesion, and that kindlin subsequently assembles an essential signaling node at newly formed adhesion sites in a talin-independent manner.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.10130.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.10130.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10130.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>A meshwork of proteins called the extracellular matrix surrounds the cells that make up our tissues. Integrins are adhesion proteins that sit on the membrane surrounding each cell and bind to the matrix proteins. These adhesive interactions control many aspects of cell behavior such as their ability to divide, move and survive.</p><p>Before integrins can bind to the extracellular matrix they must be activated. Previous research has shown that in certain types of blood cells, proteins called talins and kindlins perform this activation. These proteins bind to the part of the integrin that extends into the cell, causing shape changes to the integrin that allow binding to the extracellular matrix. However, it is not clear whether talin and kindlin also activate integrins in other cell types.</p><p>Fibroblasts are cells that help to make extracellular matrix proteins, and are an important part of connective tissue. Theodosiou et al. engineered mouse fibroblast cells to lack either talin or kindlin, and found that both of these mutant cell types were unable to activate their integrins and as a result failed to bind to an extracellular matrix protein called fibronectin.</p><p>Even when cells were artificially induced to activate integrins by treating them with manganese ions, cells lacking talin or kindlin failed to fully activate integrins and hence did not adhere well to fibronectin. This suggests that talin and kindlin work together to activate integrins and to maintain them in this activated state.</p><p>When treated with manganese ions, cells that lacked talin were able to flatten and spread out, whereas cells that lacked kindlin were unable to undergo this shape change. Theodosiou et al. found that this cell shape is dependent on kindlin and its ability to bind to and recruit a protein called paxillin to “adhesion sites”, where integrins connect the cell surface with the extracellular matrix. Kindlin and paxillin then work together to activate other signaling molecules to induce the cell spreading.</p><p>The next challenge is to understand how talin and kindlin are activated in non-blood cells and how they maintain integrins in an active state.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.10130.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.10130.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>talin</kwd><kwd>kindlin</kwd><kwd>paxillin</kwd><kwd>integrin</kwd><kwd>focal adhesion</kwd><kwd>cell spreading</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Veterans Affair Merit Award</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1I01BX002196</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zent</surname><given-names>Roy</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000052</institution-id><institution>NIH Office of the Director</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RO1-DK083187</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zent</surname><given-names>Roy</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000052</institution-id><institution>NIH Office of the Director</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RO1-DK075594</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zent</surname><given-names>Roy</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000052</institution-id><institution>NIH Office of the Director</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-DK069221</award-id> <principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zent</surname><given-names>Roy</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>322652</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fässler</surname><given-names>Reinhard</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFB-863</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fässler</surname><given-names>Reinhard</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004189</institution-id><institution>Max-Planck-Gesellschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fässler</surname><given-names>Reinhard</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Kindlin-2 co-operates with talin to activate fibronectin-binding integrins on fibroblasts and subsequently induces cell spreading by recruiting paxillin to small, peripheral nascent adhesions.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Integrins are heterodimeric transmembrane receptors that mediate cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix (ECM) and to other cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hynes, 2002</xref>). The consequence of integrin-mediated adhesion is the assembly of a large molecular network that induces various signaling pathways, resulting in cell migration, proliferation, survival and differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Winograd-Katz et al., 2014</xref>). The quality and strength of integrin signaling is controlled by the interaction between integrins and substrate-attached ligands, which is, in turn, regulated by the on- and off-rates of the integrin–ligand binding process. The on-rate of the integrin–ligand binding reaction (also called integrin activation or inside-out signaling) is characterized by switching the unbound form of integrins from an inactive (low affinity) to an active (high affinity) conformation. The affinity switch proceeds from a bent and clasped low affinity conformation to an extended and unclasped high affinity conformation with an open ligand-binding pocket (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Askari et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Springer and Dustin, 2012</xref>). This change in affinity is believed to be induced through the binding of talin and kindlin to the β integrin cytoplasmic domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Moser et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Shattil et al., 2010</xref>) and divalent cations to distinct sites close to the ligand-binding pocket (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gailit and Ruoslahti, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mould et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Xia and Springer, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mould et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>The stabilisation of integrin–ligand complexes is mediated by integrin clustering and catch bond formation between integrin and bound ligand. The stabilizing effect of clustered integrins is achieved by the ability of dissociated integrin–ligand complexes to rebind before they leave the adhesion site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">van Kooyk and Figdor, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Roca-Cusachs et al., 2009</xref>), while catch bonds are receptor–ligand bonds whose lifetime increases with mechanical force (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kong et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kong et al., 2013</xref>). Both mechanisms extend the duration and increase the strength of integrin-mediated adhesion and signaling (also called outside-in signaling) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Koo et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">van Kooyk and Figdor, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Maheshwari et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Roca-Cusachs et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Coussen et al., 2002</xref>), and depend on the association of integrins with the actin cytoskeleton via talin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Roca-Cusachs et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Friedland et al., 2009</xref>), and probably kindlin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Ye et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>The talin family consists of two (talin-1 and -2) and the kindlin family of three isoforms (kindlin-1-3), which show tissue-specific expression patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Calderwood et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Moser et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Shattil et al., 2010</xref>). The majority of studies that defined integrin affinity regulation by talin and kindlin were performed on αIIbβ3 and β2-class integrins expressed by platelets and leukocytes, respectively. These cells circulate in the blood and hold their integrins in an inactive state until they encounter soluble or membrane-bound agonists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Evans et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bennett, 2005</xref>). The prevailing view is that agonist-induced signaling pathways activate talin-1 and the hematopoietic cell-specific kindlin-3, which cooperate to induce integrin activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Moser et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Han et al., 2006</xref>) and clustering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cluzel et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Ye et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Integrin affinity regulation in non-hematopoietic cells such as fibroblasts and epithelial cells is poorly understood. It is not known how integrin activation is induced on these cells (no integrin-activating agonists have been identified) and it is also controversial whether talin and kindlin are required to shift their integrins into the high affinity state. While there are reports showing that talin and kindlin are required for integrin activation in epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Montanez et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Margadant et al., 2012</xref>), it was also shown that in myoblasts and mammary epithelial cells activation of β1 integrins, adhesion and spreading on multiple ECM substrates can proceed in the absence of talin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Conti et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wang et al., 2011</xref>). Likewise, it was reported that focal adhesion kinase (FAK)-deficient fibroblasts develop small, nascent adhesions (NAs) at the edge of membrane protrusions without visible talin and that integrins carrying a mutation in the talin-binding site can still nucleate and stabilize NAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lawson et al., 2012</xref>). Also fibroblasts lacking talin-1 and -2 were shown to adhere to fibronectin (FN) and initiate isotropic spreading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>). Another intriguing study demonstrated that overexpression of kindlin-2 in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells inhibits rather than promotes talin head-induced α5β1 integrin activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Harburger et al., 2009</xref>). Given the fundamental importance of talin and kindlin for integrin activation in hematopoietic cells, the findings of these studies are unexpected and imply that either integrin affinity regulation is substantially different in fibroblasts and epithelial cells or the experimental approaches used to manipulate protein expression and localization were imperfect.</p><p>To directly evaluate the functions of talin and kindlins for FN-binding integrins on fibroblasts, we used a genetic approach and derived fibroblasts from mice lacking either the <italic>Tln1</italic> and <italic>-2</italic> or the <italic>Fermt1</italic> and <italic>-2</italic> genes. We show that integrin affinity regulation depends on both talin and kindlin, and that kindlin has the additional function of triggering cell spreading by binding directly to paxillin in a talin-independent manner.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Kindlins and talins control cell morphology, adhesion and integrin expression</title><p>To obtain cells lacking the expression of talin-1 and kindlin-2, we intercrossed mice carrying <italic>loxP</italic> flanked (floxed; fl) <italic>Tln1</italic> or <italic>Fermt2</italic> alleles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), isolated kidney fibroblasts and immortalized them with the SV40 large T antigen (parental fibroblasts).

Loss of talin-1 or kindlin-2 expression in fibroblasts was compensated by talin-2 or the de novo expression of kindlin-1, respectively, allowing adhesion and spreading, although to a lesser extent compared with control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>).

To test whether the inability of Tln<sup>Ko</sup> and Kind<sup>Ko</sup> cells to adhere to ECM proteins is due to an integrin activation defect, we bypassed inside-out activation by treating cells with Mn<sup>2+</sup>, which binds to the integrin ectodomain and induces unbending and unclasping of integrin heterodimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mould et al., 1995</xref>).

To directly assess integrin activation, we made use of an antibody against the 9EG7 epitope, which specifically recognizes Mn<sup>2+</sup> and/or ligand activated β1 integrins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bazzoni et al., 1995</xref>). The amount of 9EG7 epitope exposure relative to total β1 integrin exposure corresponds to the integrin activation index, which can be measured by flow cytometry using 9EG7 and anti-total β1 integrin antibodies. These measurements revealed that Tln<sup>Ctr</sup> and Kind<sup>Ctr</sup> cells bound 9EG7 antibodies, while Tln<sup>Ko</sup> and Kind<sup>Ko</sup> cells lacked 9EG7 binding in the absence of Mn<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A</xref>). Mn<sup>2+</sup> treatment significantly increased 9EG7 binding by Tln<sup>Ctr</sup> and Kind<sup>Ctr</sup> cells, which was further elevated in the presence of FN-Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) ligand known to stabilize the high affinity state of integrins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A</xref>). Mn<sup>2+</sup>-treated Tln<sup>Ko</sup> and Kind<sup>Ko</sup> cells bound significantly less 9EG7 antibodies than control cells, which marginally increased with FN-RGD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A</xref>). Moreover, the normalization of the 9EG7 binding to the total β1 integrin surface levels also indicated a significantly lower influence of Mn<sup>2+</sup> and FN-RGD on the integrin activation index of Kind<sup>Ko</sup> as compared to Tln<sup>Ko</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A</xref>). These findings confirm that both, talin and kindlin are required for β1 integrin activation and to stabilize Mn<sup>2+</sup>-induced unbending/unclasping of α5β1 integrins.</p><p>Our findings so far suggest that talin and kindlin are required to activate FN-binding integrins and maintain Mn<sup>2+</sup>-induced activation of FN-binding integrins. To further analyze whether ligand-induced stabilisation of high-affinity integrin conformations (also termed ‘ligand-induced integrin activation; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Du et al., 1991</xref>) can form in the absence of talin or kindlin, we used atomic force microscopy (AFM)-based single cell force spectroscopy (SCFS). We attached control, Tln<sup>Ko</sup> or Kind<sup>Ko</sup> cells to Concanavalin A (ConA)-coated cantilevers, allowed the cells to contact surfaces coated with either wild type FN-III<sub>7-10</sub> (FN-RGD) or an integrin-binding-deficient FN-III<sub>7-10</sub> fragment lacking the RGD binding motif (FN-ΔRGD) for increasing contact times, either in the absence or presence of Mn<sup>2+</sup> and then detached them from the substrate by lifting the cantilever (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,C</xref>). In the absence of Mn<sup>2+</sup> Tln<sup>Ctr</sup> and Kind<sup>Ctr</sup> cells developed significant adhesion to FN-RGD within 5 s contact time. After a contact time of 20 s around 2 nN force was required to disrupt adhesion to FN-RGD, and after 50 and 120 s, respectively, 3 and 6 nN were required (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Tln<sup>Ko</sup> and Kind<sup>Ko</sup> cells failed to develop measurable adhesions to FN-RGD after contact times of 5, 20, 50 and 120 s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Treatment with Mn<sup>2+</sup> induced a slight and similar increase of force required to disrupt adhesion of control, Tln<sup>Ko</sup> and Kind<sup>Ko</sup> cells to FN-RGD after 5 s contact time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). However, with increasing contact times, the AFM profiles of Tln<sup>Ko</sup> and Kind<sup>Ko</sup> cells differ in the presence of Mn<sup>2+</sup>. While the adhesion force increased concomitantly with longer contact times in Tln<sup>Ctr</sup>, Kind<sup>Ctr</sup> and Tln<sup>Ko</sup> cells, adhesion forces of Kind<sup>Ko</sup> cells plateaued after 50 s and showed no further increase towards 120 s contact time. The latter finding suggests that kindlin stabilizes integrin–ligand complexes with time, by inducing integrin clustering and/or by modulating the off-rate of integrin ligand bonds, for example, through associating with the integrin-linked kinase (ILK)-Pinch-Parvin (IPP) complex that links kindlin to the F-actin cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cluzel et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Ye et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Montanez et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fukuda et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>We next tested whether their impaired integrin function affects the assembly of FN into fibrils, which requires association of active α5β1 integrin with the actin cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pankov et al., 2000</xref>), and whether re-expression of talin and kindlin reverts the defects of Tln<sup>Ko</sup> and Kind<sup>Ko</sup> cells.

To test whether spreading can also be induced in adherent Tln<sup>Ko</sup> and Kind<sup>Ko</sup> cells, we bypassed their adhesion defect with Mn<sup>2+</sup>, seeded them for 30 min on FN and stained with an antibody against total β1 integrin and the β1 integrin activation epitope-reporting 9EG7 antibody. As expected, Tln<sup>Ctr</sup> or Kind<sup>Ctr</sup> cells clustered 9EG7-positive β1 integrins in NAs and focal adhesions (FAs), whose frequency and size increased upon Mn<sup>2+</sup> treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref>). In contrast, the sporadic and very weakly adherent Tln<sup>Ko</sup> and Kind<sup>Ko</sup> cells were small, round and formed small and finely dispersed β1 integrin aggregates over the entire cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) and lacked 9EG7-positive signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) in the absence of Mn<sup>2+</sup> treatment. Upon Mn<sup>2+</sup> treatment 37 ± 1% (n=684, mean ± standard deviation of three independent experiments) of the Tln<sup>Ko</sup> cells showed isotropic membrane protrusions (circumferential lamellipodia) with small, dot-like aggregates of β1 integrin, kindlin-2, paxillin and ILK at the membrane periphery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), which eventually detached from the substrate leading to the collapse of the protruded membrane (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>). Furthermore, 9EG7-positive β1 integrins accumulated along the lamellipodial edge and beneath the nucleus of Tln<sup>Ko</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). The remaining cells were spheroid, with half of them showing short, finger-like protrusions, which were motile due to their poor anchorage to the substrate. In the case of Kind<sup>Ko</sup> cells, we analysed 652 cells in three independent experiments and found that only 7 ± 1% (mean ± standard deviation) of the cells established lamellipodia, which formed around the entire circumference in 2 ± 0.4% (mean ± standard deviation) of the cells. Around 93 ± 1% of the Kind<sup>Ko</sup> cells were spheroid (mean ± standard deviation) and frequently had finger-like, motile protrusions with small dot-like signals containing β1 integrin and talin but rarely paxillin or ILK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Importantly, re-expression of Tln1V in Tln<sup>Ko</sup> cells or K2GFP in Kind<sup>Ko</sup> cells normalized FA formation and spreading on FN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). These findings indicate that kindlin-2 expressing Tln<sup>Ko</sup> cells can initiate the formation of large lamellipodia and assemble β1 integrins in lamellipodial edges.<media content-type="glencoe play-in-place height-250 width-310" id="media1" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-10130-media1.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10130.013</object-id><label>Video 1.</label><caption><title>Spreading Kind<sup>Ctr</sup>, Tln<sup>Ko</sup> and Kind<sup>Ko</sup> cells on FN.</title><p>Assembled time lapse movies of Kind<sup>Ctr</sup>, Tln<sup>Ko</sup> and Kind<sup>Ko</sup> cells.

Mn<sup>2+</sup>-treated and non-permeablized cells were seeded on FN, stained with anti-total β1 integrin antibodies, and then permeabilized, immunostained for paxillin and imaged with normal resolution TIRFM and dSTORM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Each localization detected by dSTORM was plotted as a Gaussian distribution around its centre with an average spatial accuracy of ~20 nm (resolution limit of dSTORM imaging). Since two or more localizations from single or multiple dyes in close proximity cannot be distinguished, the number of localizations does not directly reflect integrin numbers. However, all antibody molecules display the same average behaviour with respect to the number of localizations per second in all areas of the cell. This allowed to average the number of localizations per second and µm<sup>2</sup> and to plot them in a heat map representation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), which directly reflects the density of stained β1 integrin molecules and thus the degree of integrin clustering. The β1 integrin staining of Tln<sup>Ctr</sup> and Kind<sup>Ctr</sup> cells revealed small round structures of ~50 nm diameter indicating clusters of integrins larger than the resolution limit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>; high magnification; see arrowheads). Furthermore, high numbers of localizations were enriched in paxillin-positive FAs and in NAs at the lamellipodial edge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>; see arrowheads). In these areas, we observed a high average density of 60–120 localizations s<sup>–1 </sup>µm<sup>–2</sup>, while outside of the adhesion sites ~0–20 localizations s<sup>–1 </sup>µm<sup>–2</sup> were detected, indicating a high degree of β1 integrin clustering within and a low degree of clustering outside of adhesion sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Tln<sup>Ko</sup> cells with circumferential lamellipodia showed a high density of blinking with up to 100 localizations s<sup>–1 </sup>µm<sup>–2</sup> at lamellipodial edges (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C,D</xref>; see arrowheads), which appeared less compact than in control cells. Kind<sup>Ko</sup> cells showed &gt;120 localizations s<sup>–1 </sup>µm<sup>–2</sup> in the periphery and finger-like membrane protrusions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C,D</xref>; see arrowheads), which were also observed in Tln<sup>Ko</sup> cells that adopted a spheroid rather than an isotropic spread shape (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). The exclusive presence of these large and entangled β1 integrin aggregates on Tln<sup>Ko</sup> and Kind<sup>Ko</sup> cells with small, spheroid shapes and protrusions suggests that they were induced by spatial constraints rather than specific signaling.</p><p>These findings demonstrate that, in contrast to Kind<sup>Ko</sup> cells, Mn<sup>2+</sup>-treated kindlin-2-expressing Tln<sup>Ko</sup> cells induce circumferential membrane protrusions with β1 integrins at the protrusive edges.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Kindlin-2 binds and recruits paxillin to NAs</title><p>Our data so far indicate that the expression of kindlin-2 enables initial, isotropic spreading and the accumulation of integrins in lamellipodia of Mn<sup>2+</sup>-treated Tln<sup>Ko</sup> cells. To identify binding partner(s) of kindlin-2 that transduce this function to downstream effectors, we performed yeast-two-hybrid assays with kindlin-2 as bait using a human complementary DNA (cDNA) library containing all possible open reading frames and a human keratinocyte-derived cDNA library. Among the 124 cDNAs identified from both screenings, 17 coded for leupaxin and 11 for Hic-5. Immunoprecipitation of overexpressed green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged paxillin family members, paxillin, Hic-5 and leupaxin in HEK-293 cells with an anti-GFP antibody efficiently co-precipitated FLAG-tagged kindlin-2 (K2flag) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Conversely, overexpressed GFP-tagged kindlin family members (kindlin-1, kindlin-2, kindlin-3) co-precipitated Cherry-paxillin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Since fibroblasts express high levels of paxillin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>), we performed all further interaction analysis with paxillin. Immunoprecipitations of GFP-tagged paxillin or kindlin-2 truncation mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3A</xref>) revealed that the interaction between kindlin-2 and paxillin was dramatically reduced in the absence of the Lin-11, Isl-1 and Mec-3 (LIM)1-4, LIM2-4 or LIM3-4 domains of paxillin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), or the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain (K2ΔPHGFP; lacking amino acids 380-477) or the N-terminus of kindlin-2 including the F0, F1, and the N-terminal part of the F2 domains (K2NTGFP; terminating at the end of F1; spanning amino acids 1-229) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). As expected, the interaction between kindlin-2 and ILK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Montanez et al., 2008</xref>), which is mediated via a recently identified sequence in the linker domain between the end of the N-terminal F2 and the beginning of the PH domain (amino acids 353–357) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fukuda et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Huet-Calderwood et al., 2014</xref>), was abolished by the K2NTGFP truncation but unaffected by the deletion of the PH domain (K2ΔPHGFP) or the deletion of the N-terminal F0 and F1 domains (K2CTGFP, spanning amino acids 244-680) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Importantly, immunoprecipitation of Kind<sup>Ctr</sup> lysates with antibodies against paxillin co-precipitated kindlin-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), confirming interactions between the endogenous proteins. Pull down experiments with recombinant full-length paxillin or paxillin-LIM3 domain and recombinant kindlin-2 demonstrated that binding to LIM3 and full-length paxillin is direct, Zn<sup>2+</sup>-dependent and abrogated with ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3B</xref>). Kind<sup>Ko</sup> cells were transduced with K2GFP or K2ΔPHGFP expression constructs, seeded on FN for different times and stained for β1 integrin, paxillin and F-actin. The experiments revealed that the expression of K2GFP in Kind<sup>Ko</sup> cells rescued spreading and induced robust paxillin recruitment to β1 integrin-positive NAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F,G</xref>). In contrast, expression of K2ΔPHGFP failed to recruit paxillin to β1 integrin-positive adhesion sites at the rim of membrane protrusions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F,G</xref>) and induce normal cell spreading (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4A</xref>) despite proper, although weaker, localisation to β1 integrin-positive adhesion sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4B,C</xref>). Interestingly, mature FAs in K2ΔPHGFP-expressing cells were prominent after 30 min and contained significant amounts of paxillin, indicating that paxillin is recruited to mature FAs in a kindlin-2-independent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10130.018</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Kindlin binds and recruits paxillin to NAs.</title><p>(<bold><bold>A</bold></bold>) GFP-IP of lysates from HEK 293T cells overexpressing GFP-tagged paxillin, Hic5 and leupaxin constructs (Pxn, paxillin; Hic5; Lpx, leupaxin) and K2flag reveal interaction of kindlin-2 with all three paxillin family members.

Paxillin in turn, was shown to bind, cluster and activate FAK in NAs, which leads to the recruitment of p130Cas, Crk and Dock followed by the activation of Rac1 and the induction of cell spreading, and, in concert with growth factor signals, to the activation of Akt-1 followed by the induction of cell proliferation and survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Schlaepfer et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bouchard et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brami-Cherrier et al., 2014</xref>). We therefore hypothesized that the recruitment of paxillin and FAK by kindlin-2 triggers the isotropic spreading and expansion of Tln<sup>Ko</sup> cells. To test this hypothesis, we seeded our cell lines on FN or poly-L-lysine (PLL) in the presence or absence of epidermal growth factor (EGF) and Mn<sup>2+</sup>. We found that EGF induced similar phosphorylation of tyrosine-992 (Y992) of the epidermal growth factor receptor (pY992-EGFR) in control, Tln<sup>Ko</sup> and Kind<sup>Ko</sup> cells. The phosphorylation of tyrosine-397 of FAK (pY379-FAK) in Kind<sup>Ctr</sup> cells was strongly induced after the adhesion of control cells on FN and was not further elevated after the addition of EGF and Mn<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Furthermore, EGF and Mn<sup>2+</sup> treatments further increased pY397-FAK levels in Tln<sup>Ko</sup> cells and localized pY397-FAK to peripheral NA-like adhesions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A-C</xref>). In sharp contrast, Kind<sup>Ko</sup> cells seeded on FN or treated with EGF and Mn<sup>2+</sup> failed to induce pY397-FAK, pY31-Pxn, pY118-Pxn (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A-C</xref>) and localize pY397-FAK to peripheral membrane regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>).

To clarify this issue, we established mouse fibroblast cell lines that lacked either talin-1/2 (Tln<sup>Ko</sup>) or kindlin-1/2 (Kind<sup>Ko</sup>) and tested whether they were able to activate integrins and mediate substrate adhesion and signaling. In line with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bottcher et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Margadant et al., 2012</xref>), the deletion of <italic>Tln1/2</italic> or <italic>Fermt1/2</italic> genes changed the surface levels of laminin- and collagen-binding integrins. Since surface levels of α5 and αv integrins remained unchanged between Tln<sup>Ko</sup> and Kind<sup>Ko</sup> cells, we were able to establish the specific roles of talin and kindlin for the function of FN-binding integrins under identical conditions.</p><p>A major finding of our study demonstrates that integrin affinity regulation (activation) is essential for fibroblast adhesion and depends on both talin and kindlin-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,D</xref>). The unambiguity of this finding was unexpected in light of several reports showing that integrin activation and integrin-mediated adhesion still occurs in talin-depleted cells, or is inhibited when kindlin-2 is overexpressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Harburger et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lawson et al., 2012</xref>). The previous studies that addressed the functional properties of talin used siRNA-mediated protein depletion, a combination of gene ablation and siRNA technology, or approaches to interfere with talin recruitment to NAs either by ablating the talin upstream protein FAK or by expressing an integrin that harbors a mutation in the talin binding site. Since the majority of approaches deplete rather than eliminate proteins from cells and adhesion sites, the respective cells were most likely recruiting sufficient residual protein to adhesion sites to allow integrin activation, cell adhesion and spreading, and the assembly of adhesion- and signaling-competent NAs. It is possible that not all integrin molecules have to be occupied by talin and therefore low levels of talin suffice, particularly in NAs that were shown by fluorescence correlation spectroscopy to contain only half the number of talin relative to α5β1 integrin and kindlin-2 molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bachir et al., 2014</xref>). However, when the entire pool of talin is lost or decreased below certain thresholds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Margadant et al., 2012</xref>) integrins remain inactivate and consequently adhesion sites do not form. With respect to kindlin, it was reported that overexpressed kindlin-2 in CHO cells inhibits rather than promotes talin head domain-induced α5β1 integrin activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Harburger et al., 2009</xref>). An integrin inhibiting effect of kindlin-2 is inconsistent with our study, which identified a crucial role for kindlin in integrin activation, as well as with other studies also demonstrating that kindlin-2 promotes integrin functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Montanez et al., 2008</xref>). It could well be that the reported inhibition of α5β1 by kindlin-2 represents an artifact that arose from protein overexpression.<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10130.028</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Model for the roles of talin and kindlin during inside-out and outside-in signaling of α5β1 integrin.</title><p>Integrin subunits are modelled according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zhu et al.

(<bold><bold>B</bold></bold>) In the absence of talin (Tln<sup>Ko</sup>) and presence of Mn<sup>2+</sup>, kindlin-2 allows adhesion by stabilizing the high affinity conformation of a low number of integrins and the direct binding of paxillin, leading to nucleation of integrins, recruitment of FAK, FAK-dependent signaling and lamellipodia formation.

We observed that Mn<sup>2+</sup>-treated Tln<sup>Ko</sup> and Kind<sup>Ko</sup> cells expressed the activation-dependent epitope 9EG7 and adhered to FN, albeit at significantly lower levels and efficiencies than the normal parental or rescued cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B,C</xref>). This observation strongly indicates that talin and kindlin also cooperate to maintain the extended and unclasped conformation of active integrins. Although it is not known how talin and kindlin keep integrins in an active state, it is possible that they stabilize this conformation by linking the unclasped β integrin cytoplasmic domain to the plasma membrane and/or to cortical actin, which may firmly hold separated integrin α/β subunits apart from each other. The expression of mutant talins and kindlins in our cells should allow us to examine these possibilities in future.</p><p>Finally, our study also revealed that Mn<sup>2+</sup>-treated Tln<sup>Ko</sup> cells began to form large, circumferential lamellipodia that eventually detached from FN, leading to the collapse of the protruded membrane. This initial isotropic spreading was significantly less frequent in Kind<sup>Ko</sup> cells, and has also been observed in talin-2-depleted talin-1<sup>–/–</sup> cells on FN, although these cells did not require Mn<sup>2+</sup> for inducing spreading, which is likely due to the presence of residual talin-2 that escaped siRNA-mediated depletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>). These findings strongly suggest that integrin binding to FN enables kindlin-2 in Tln<sup>Ko</sup> cells to cluster β1 integrins (as shown for αIIbβ3 by kindlin-3 in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Ye et al., 2013</xref>) and to trigger a signaling process that initiates spreading.</p><p>To find a mechanistic explanation for the kindlin-2-mediated cell spreading, we used the yeast-two-hybrid technology to identify paxillin as a novel and direct binding partner of kindlin-2. The interaction of the two proteins occurs through the LIM3 domain of paxillin, which was previously identified as integrin adhesion-targeting site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brown et al., 1996</xref>), and the PH domain of kindlin-2. It is not unusual that PH domains fulfill dual roles by binding phospholipids and proteins, either simultaneously or consecutively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Scheffzek and Welti, 2012</xref>). The expression of a PH domain-deficient kindlin-2 in Kind<sup>Ko</sup> cells rescues adhesion to FN and FA maturation, however, significantly impairs spreading and plasma membrane protrusions. This finding together with the observations that paxillin-null fibroblasts and embryonic stem cells have defects in spreading, adhesion site remodeling and formation of lamellipodia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hagel et al., 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wade et al., 2002</xref>) indicates that the kindlin-2/paxillin complex induces the elusive signaling process, leading to initial spreading of Tln<sup>Ko</sup> and talin-depleted cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>). Indeed, the kindlin-2/paxillin complex in NAs recruits FAK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Deramaudt et al., 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Thwaites et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Choi et al., 2011</xref>), which cooperates with growth factor receptors (such as EGFR) to induce signaling pathways that activate Erk and Akt to promote proliferation and survival, as well as Arp2/3 and Rac1 to induce actin polymerization and membrane protrusions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B,E</xref>). Kindlin-2 also recruits ILK, which binds in the vicinity of the kindlin-2 PH domain and links integrins to actin and additional signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). The short-lived nature of the initial spreading of Tln<sup>Ko</sup> and talin-depleted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>) cells shows that talin concludes the integrin-mediated adhesion process in NAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>) and induces the maturation of FAs. The formation of paxillin-positive FAs in cells expressing the PH domain-deficient kindlin-2 suggests that the recruitment of paxillin to FAs occurs either in a kindlin-independent manner or through a modification of kindlin in a second binding motif.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mouse strains and cell lines and cell culture</title><p>The floxed kindlin-1 (<italic>Fermt1<sup>flox/flox</sup></italic>), floxed talin-1 (<italic>Tln1<sup>flox/flox</sup></italic>) and the constitutive talin-2-null (<italic>Tln2<sup>–/–</sup></italic>) mouse strains have been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rognoni et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nieswandt et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Conti et al., 2009</xref>).

Your submission has been favorably evaluated by Vivek Malhotra (Senior editor) and three reviewers.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Senior editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors provide evidence in support of the hypothesis that talins and kindlins have a role in the activation of fibronectin-binding integrins in mesenchymal cells. They also identify a potential novel mechanism through which fibronectin-binding integrins can activate FAK and promote spreading and proliferative and survival signalling via formation of lamellipodia.</p><p>These findings are highly significant, however, the authors need to show that kindlin regulates integrin's affinity for its ligands and identify the signalling pathways regulated by kindlin and their functional significance. The specific major (essential) revisions and minor issues of the reviewers follow.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> are really interesting but, rather than measuring adhesion to fibronectin, the authors should measure the binding of the soluble cell binding domain of fibronectin and of Mab 9EG7 to suspended cells +/- Mn<sup>2+</sup>. Expression of Rap1-V12 from an inducible promoter can be used to &quot;physiologically&quot; activate integrins.</p><p>2) The proposed proliferative defect shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A</xref> is just a modest delay in entry in S phase. If the cells were just plated, it may be a consequence of the delayed spreading. Growth curves over 1 week would be necessary to strengthen the contention that kindlins promote cell proliferation. In addition, the proposed survival defect shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3B</xref> is non-existent as the talin and the kindlin KO cells survive very well (only 0.5 to 1% of them undergo apoptosis). Importantly, the immunoblotting experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> are superficial. They need to be extended to include cells not treated with Mn<sup>2+</sup> as well as talin KO cells reconstituted with talin. In addition, the phosphorylation of paxillin, Akt at residue T408 (the required PDK1 site), p70-S6K, S6, 4E-BP1, Raf, MEK and ERK has not been studied. Finally, that FAK kinase activity necessarily plays a role in signaling downstream of kindlins is not convincing as PF-228 is used at 5 μM (25x dose required to inhibit FAK 397 in most cells).</p><p>3) The contention that loss of talins or kindlins changes the repertoire of fibronectin-binding integrins in a similar fashion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) is not convincing. The data seem to suggest that there is a switch from α-v β-3 to α-v β-5 and that the decreased expression of α-3 and α-6 allows equal expression of α-5 in kindlin-null cells, but the changes may be more complex as the authors have not examined the expression of α-v β-1. The most definitive way to address the issue is to purify fibronectin-binding integrins from surface-labeled cells by affinity chromatography on Fn-CBD in the presence of Mn<sup>2+</sup> and subject the eluted proteins to IP with anti-α-v, α-5, β-1, β-3, and β-5.</p><p>4) The sections describing effects of talin and kindlin on integrin &quot;activation&quot; are quite confusing, although it is clear that talin and kindlin are important for adhesion to Fn. Mn<sup>2+</sup> activation clearly does partially rescue the adhesion defect of both talin and kindlin deficient cells, but the AFM profiles for talin and kindlin deficient cells look completely different in the presence of Mn<sup>2+</sup>. This should be emphasized in the text. Is it assumed that only the first 5s AFM time point assesses &quot;activation&quot; and later timepoints assesses &quot;integrin clustering&quot;? It is difficult to see from the AFM figures that Mn<sup>2+</sup> induced &quot;stronger integrin-ligand bonds&quot; than non-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), as the controls (non-Mn<sup>2+</sup> treated cells) are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>. If the authors assume the same degree of integrin activation in talin and kindlin KO cells in the presence of Mn<sup>2+</sup>, this should be examined directly. To assess activation, effects on 9EG7-binding in talin and kindlin deficient cells vs controls in the absence and presence of Mn<sup>2+</sup>, should be quantified, for example by flow cytometry. In addition, soluble binding assays should be performed (as the authors have done previously in Montanez et al, 2008). The authors have attempted to assess clustering of the integrins in talin KO and kindlin KO cells in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. It is clearly difficult to assess specific vs spatially-driven clustering in cells with such different morphology, and therefore difficult to draw conclusions about the role of kindlin in integrin clustering in these cells. In the Results section, the authors state that &quot;the integrin-activating compound Mn<sup>2+</sup> can only partially substitute for the adhesion promoting roles that talin and kindlin accomplish together&quot;, however, it is stated that &quot;we circumvented their integrin activation defect with Mn<sup>2+</sup>&quot;. If there is a severe activation/adhesion defect in the presence of Mn<sup>2+</sup> (especially for Kindlin-KO cells), this clearly also has implications for outside-in signaling profiles the cells.</p><p>5) It is unclear from the results that the integrin/paxillin complex promotes cell proliferation, as stated in the subheading “The kindlin-2/paxillin complex promotes FAK-mediated cell spreading and proliferation”; this has not directly been assessed here. Also, the statement about a connection between the reduced Akt signaling and proliferation &quot;which provides an explanation for their reduced proliferation…&quot; is too strong, as this hypothesis has not been tested here. Kindlin deletion has also been shown to affect other signaling pathways such as TGF-β signaling and proliferation, etc. Do cells which express kindlin that cannot bind paxillin display reduced Akt activation and proliferation? Does expression of active FAK influence Akt activation or proliferation? Does the cell survival defect of kindlin and talin KO cells unspecifically affect their adhesion and signaling profiles?</p><p>6) As kindlin clearly has other effects in cells than those dependent on integrins, it would be important to assess whether cells where the integrin-kindlin interaction has been abolished show the same phenotype as KO cells. E.g., what is the adhesion and signaling phenotype of TT/AA-β1-integrin fibroblasts (where kindlin cannot bind the integrin), do they have similar defects in spreading, FAK activation, signaling and proliferation as kindlin knockout cells? What about cells expressing mutant kindlin that cannot bind integrin?</p><p>7) Integrin-mediated adhesion depends on the level of integrin expression. Since integrins are heterodimers, we didn't find measurements of individual integrin subunits reassuring that levels of the relevant integrin for these studies, α5β1 (or αvβ3 for that matter), were comparable among the various cells. Flow cytometry using complex-specific antibodies would address this concern.</p><p>8) Since the KO cells express αvβ3, as well as α5β1, the inability of Mn<sup>2+</sup> have any effect on cell adhesion to vitronectin is puzzling.</p><p>9) Considering the variability in the AFM measurements, it appears that in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2B and C</xref>, in contrast to Kind<sup>Ko</sup> cells, the Tln<sup>Ko</sup> cells do develop measureable adhesions to FN and that Mn<sup>2+</sup> increases the strength of the adhesions of nearly control levels. Similarly, Mn<sup>2+</sup> increased the adhesion of the Kind<sup>Ko</sup> cells, although less so than the control cells. Since there is evidence that the interaction of integrins with ligands is a multi-step process with adhesion strength increasing as the time of contact between integrin and ligand increases, the interpretation of the these experiments, i.e., the kindlin stabilizes integrin ligand complexes with time by inducing or maintaining integrin clusters is not necessarily the only conclusion.</p><p>10) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>: If we have interpreted the distribution of dots correctly, these data suggest that talin and kindlin are not necessarily required to form integrin clusters.</p><p>11) If the control fibroblasts are maintained in suspension, are kindlin and talin constitutively associated with β1 tail? Do the cells constitutively bind 93G7? What is the distribution of integrin in the suspended cells?</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Kindlin-2 cooperates with talin to activate integrins and induces cell spreading by directly binding paxillin&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.

If the cells were just plated, it may be a consequence of the delayed spreading. Growth curves over 1 week would be necessary to strengthen the contention that kindlins promote cell proliferation. In addition, the proposed survival defect shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3B</xref> is non-existent as the talin and the kindlin KO cells survive very well (only 0.5 to 1% of them undergo apoptosis). Importantly, the immunoblotting experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> are superficial. They need to be extended to include cells not treated with Mn<sup>2+</sup> as well as talin KO cells reconstituted with talin. In addition, the phosphorylation of paxillin, Akt at residue T408 (the required PDK1 site), p70-S6K, S6, 4E-BP1, Raf, MEK and ERK has not been studied. Finally, that FAK kinase activity necessarily plays a role in signaling downstream of kindlins is not convincing as PF-228 is used at 5 μM (25x dose required to inhibit FAK 397 in most cells).</italic></p><p>The two aims of this paper were (1) to investigate whether talin and kindlin are as essential for integrin-mediated adhesion of fibroblasts as for integrin-mediated adhesion of hematopoietic cells (neutrophils, T cells, platelets, hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, etc.), and (2) to determine what kind of major signaling outputs can be delivered by talin or kindlin. We found that (1) talin and kindlin are essential to induce integrin-mediated adhesion of fibroblasts to FN, and that (2) kindlin can induce isotropic spreading by recruiting paxillin. The beauty of the latter finding was that it solved a conundrum and showed for the first time a mechanism explaining how paxillin (which was discovered in the early nineties) can be recruited to integrin adhesion sites.</p><p>We also noted a slight proliferation defect in cells lacking kindlin expression. Although this is in agreement with a reduced FAK activation triggered by paxillin-mediated recruitment of FAK to integrin adhesion sites, we never aimed at deeply investigating this finding, mainly because our cells were immortalized and therefore not suitable for such studies. The same is true for the survival. We therefore removed the cell survival data from the manuscript and toned down our findings on cell proliferation in the text.</p><p>In parallel we performed a number of experiments suggested by the reviewers:</p><p>a) We replaced the BrdU proliferation assay with growth curves over 5 days that show the reduced proliferation of Kind<sup>Ko</sup> cells compared to Talin<sup>Ko</sup> and the control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>b) We repeated the immunoblots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> including both rescue cell lines and different conditions (FN, FN+EGF, FN+EGF+Mn<sup>2+</sup>) and probed with antibodies against different signalling components including Y410-p130Cas, pT308-Akt, S473-Akt, pT202/pY204 Erk1/2, pY31-Pxn, pY118-Pxn (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>c) Regarding the FAK kinase activity, we repeated the assay using increasing concentrations of FAK inhibitor starting from 0.3 µM, which show a dose-dependent decrease in the percentage of lamellipodia in Tln<sup>Ko</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>).</p><p><italic>3) The contention that loss of talins or kindlins changes the repertoire of fibronectin-binding integrins in a similar fashion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) is not convincing. The data seem to suggest that there is a switch from α-v β-3 to α-v β-5 and that the decreased expression of α-3 and α-6 allows equal expression of α-5 in kindlin-null cells, but the changes may be more complex as the authors have not examined the expression of α-v β-1. The most definitive way to address the issue is to purify fibronectin-binding integrins from surface-labeled cells by affinity chromatography on Fn-CBD in the presence of Mn<sup>2+</sup> and subject the eluted proteins to IP with anti-α-v, α-5, β-1, β-3, and β-5.</italic></p><p>The reviewers are correct; we indeed observe a switch from αvβ3 to αvβ5 in the kindlin and talin knockout cell lines. Our whole studies rely on similar expression of α5 integrins. Our initial FACS analyses show this and we now also determined the levels of α5β1 integrin by selective immunoprecipitation of α5 integrins from the cell surface of live cells of the talin and kindlin control and knockout cell lines followed by western blot analysis with antibodies against α5 and β1 integrins. These experiments show comparable levels of α5β1 integrin presented on the cell surface of Talin<sup>Ctr</sup>, Kind<sup>Ctr</sup>, Talin<sup>Ko</sup> and Kind<sup>Ko</sup> cell lines. This data is included in the revised manuscript as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>. In addition, we examined the expression of αvβ1 in our cell lines by αv immunoprecipitation followed by β1 western blotting and found either barely or no detectable β1 subunits. Altogether this indicates that the major FN-binding integrins on our cell lines are indeed α5β1 and αvβ5 integrins.</p><p><italic>4) The sections describing effects of talin and kindlin on integrin &quot;activation&quot; are quite confusing, although it is clear that talin and kindlin are important for adhesion to Fn. Mn<sup>2+</sup> activation clearly does partially rescue the adhesion defect of both talin and kindlin deficient cells, but the AFM profiles for talin and kindlin deficient cells look completely different in the presence of Mn<sup>2+</sup>. This should be emphasized in the text. Is it assumed that only the first 5s AFM time point assesses &quot;activation&quot; and later timepoints assesses &quot;integrin clustering&quot;? It is difficult to see from the AFM figures that Mn<sup>2+</sup> induced &quot;stronger integrin-ligand bonds&quot; than non-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), as the controls (non-Mn<sup>2+</sup> treated cells) are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>. If the authors assume the same degree of integrin activation in talin and kindlin KO cells in the presence of Mn<sup>2+</sup>, this should be examined directly. To assess activation, effects on 9EG7-binding in talin and kindlin deficient cells vs controls in the absence and presence of Mn<sup>2+</sup>, should be quantified, for example by flow cytometry. In addition, soluble binding assays should be performed (as the authors have done previously in Montanez et al, 2008). The authors have attempted to assess clustering of the integrins in talin KO and kindlin KO cells in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. It is clearly difficult to assess specific vs spatially-driven clustering in cells with such different morphology, and therefore difficult to draw conclusions about the role of kindlin in integrin clustering in these cells. In the Results section, the authors state that &quot;the integrin-activating compound Mn<sup>2+</sup> can only partially substitute for the adhesion promoting roles that talin and kindlin accomplish together&quot;, however, it is stated that &quot;we circumvented their integrin activation defect with Mn<sup>2+</sup>&quot;. If there is a severe activation/adhesion defect in the presence of Mn<sup>2+</sup> (especially for Kindlin-KO cells), this clearly also has implications for outside-in signaling profiles the cells.</italic></p><p>The reviewers’ comments that the sections describing the effects of talin and kindlin on integrin ‘activation’ are confusing, although it is clear that talin and kindlin are important to establish cell adhesion to fibronectin. We apologize for the confusion and revised our text to describe these effects more clearly. The reviewers also mentioned that the AFM-based SCFS results show different adhesion profiles for talin and kindlin deficient cells in the presence of Mn<sup>2+</sup>. We agree that this is the case and now in our revision specifically report that the adhesion strength restored upon Mn<sup>2+</sup> administration differs in both Tln<sup>Ko</sup> and Kind<sup>Ko</sup> cells. In our opinion, this result suggests that both talin and kindlin play different roles in integrin mediated adhesion wherein only the role of talin can be accomplished partially upon Mn<sup>2+</sup> administration and not the role of kindlin.</p><p>The reviewers further question whether “it is assumed that only the first 5s AFM time point assesses &quot;activation&quot; and later time points assesses &quot;integrin clustering&quot;. Yes, the first 5s AFM time point assesses very early adhesion events (i.e. &quot;activation&quot;) established by integrins binding to FN. At later time points (&gt;5s) cell adhesion is considerably strengthens and therefore may reflect the clustering of integrins. Such time dependency of cells establishing adhesion to ECM proteins has been frequently reported in SCFS experiments. The early binding events at short contact times between cell and substrate (within few seconds) are dominated by the binding of single integrins (or CAMs). At extended time ranges (above a few tens of seconds) the integrins (or CAMs) cluster thereby strengthening cell adhesion to the substrate (Taubenberger et al., Mol Biol Cell. 2007; Friedrichs et al., JBC 2008). Thus from insight provided previously we can safely assume that the cell adhesion increasing with higher contact times is due to integrin clustering.</p><p>The reviewers also comment that “it is difficult to see from the AFM figures that Mn<sup>2+</sup> induced &quot;stronger integrin-ligand bonds&quot; than non-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), as the controls (non-Mn<sup>2+</sup> treated cells) are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>”. We agree, but used this representation, as we wanted to lay emphasis on differences in adhesion strengths among these cells with and without Mn<sup>2+</sup>.</p><p>As suggested by the reviewers we assessed integrin activation by analyzing the binding of Mab 9EG7 to wild-type and mutant fibroblasts in the presence and absence of Mn<sup>2+</sup> by FACS. This data shows that talin as well as kindlin are required for activating β1 integrin and stabilizing Mn<sup>2+</sup>-induced unbending/unclasping of α5β1 integrins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A,B</xref>). We also determined the binding of soluble FN. Although we observed weak binding of soluble FN to suspension cells that is increased upon Mn<sup>2+</sup> treatment we decided against including it into the revised manuscript because a detailed analysis of the FACS histograms revealed only minor shifts compared to background binding that renders the analysis unreliable (see also comment 1)</p><p>(c) We rephrased the sentence “we circumvented their integrin activation defect with Mn<sup>2+</sup>”. We wanted to say that the complete loss of integrin functions in the absence of either talin or kindlin required a trick that bypasses their role in integrin activation. Although Mn<sup>2+</sup> is doing this, the effect of Mn<sup>2+</sup> on mutant cells is significantly less pronounced than compared to wild-type cells indicating that the maintenance of Mn<sup>2+</sup>-induced integrin activation is also dependent on talin and kindlin. Hence, the two proteins are required to activate integrins (which we now show with binding of Mab 9EG7) and to maintain the “Mn<sup>2+</sup>-induced activation state”.</p><p><italic>5) It is unclear from the results that the integrin/paxillin complex promotes cell proliferation, as stated in the subheading “The kindlin-2/paxillin complex promotes FAK-mediated cell spreading and proliferation”; this has not directly been assessed here. Also, the statement about a connection between the reduced Akt signaling and proliferation &quot;which provides an explanation for their reduced proliferation…&quot; is too strong, as this hypothesis has not been tested here. Kindlin deletion has also been shown to affect other signaling pathways such as TGF-β signaling and proliferation, etc. Do cells which express kindlin that cannot bind paxillin display reduced Akt activation and proliferation? Does expression of active FAK influence Akt activation or proliferation? Does the cell survival defect of kindlin and talin KO cells unspecifically affect their adhesion and signaling profiles?</italic></p><p>As stated above (see point 2) we were not aiming at analyzing the role of kindlin and talin for proliferation and survival in depth. Our studies show an involvement of the two proteins but the changes between them are small, probably because our cells are immortalized with the large T antigen. We thank the reviewers for their comment and as a result we removed the part on survival and toned down the results of proliferation and stuck to our major aims: (1) do integrins work without talin or kindlin in non-hematopoietic cells? and (2) which major signaling outputs are triggered by FN-adherent cells that express either talin or kindlin (paxillin recruitment leading to membrane protrusion)?</p><p>As suggested by the reviewers, we still analyzed Akt activation in cells expressing Kindlin-2ΔPH, which shows impaired paxillin binding. Indeed we found that Kind<sup>Ko</sup> cells re-expressing Kindlin2-GFP but not Kindlin-2ΔPH induce FAK and Akt phosphorylation when seeded on FN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>).</p><p><italic>6) As kindlin clearly has other effects in cells than those dependent on integrins, it would be important to assess whether cells where the integrin-kindlin interaction has been abolished show the same phenotype as KO cells. E.g., what is the adhesion and signaling phenotype of TT/AA-β1-integrin fibroblasts (where kindlin cannot bind the integrin), do they have similar defects in spreading, FAK activation, signaling and proliferation as kindlin knockout cells? What about cells expressing mutant kindlin that cannot bind integrin?</italic></p><p>The TT/AA mutation in the β1 integrin tail reduces but does not abolish kindlin-2 binding (Fitzpatrick et al., JBC 2014). Furthermore, cells expressing TT/AAβ1 integrins express several other integrins, which are not mutated and therefore bind kindlin. Similarly, mutant forms of kindlins reduce the binding affinities for integrins but do not abolish binding. This, however, would be important to evaluate the experiments with such mutants especially in light of a recent paper from our lab showing that minimal amounts of kindlin-3 are sufficient for basal cellular functions (Klapproth et al., Blood 2015). So, it is difficult to perform conclusive experiments with such cells (which are available in the lab) as this cells system is not ‘clean’ enough.</p><p><italic>7) Integrin-mediated adhesion depends on the level of integrin expression. Since integrins are heterodimers, we didn't find measurements of individual integrin subunits reassuring that levels of the relevant integrin for these studies, α5β1 (or αvβ3 for that matter), were comparable among the various cells. Flow cytometry using complex-specific antibodies would address this concern.</italic></p><p>We are not aware of complex-specific antibodies for mouse α5β1 integrins. In order to address the reviewers’ concern we determined the levels of α5β1 integrin by selective immunoprecipitation of α5 integrins from the cell surface of live Tln<sup>Ctr</sup>, Kind<sup>Ctr</sup>, Tln<sup>Ko</sup> and Kind<sup>Ko</sup> cells followed by western blot analysis with antibodies against α5 and β1 integrins. These experiments confirm the comparable levels of α5β1 integrin presented on the cell surface of Talin<sup>Ctr</sup>, Kindlin<sup>Ctr</sup>, Talin<sup>Ko</sup> and Kindlin<sup>Ko</sup> cell lines. This data is included in the revised manuscript as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>. If at all, the Kindlin<sup>Ko</sup> cells have even slightly more α5β1 integrin on their cell surface compared to Talin<sup>Ko</sup> cells indicating that the cell adhesion and spreading defects of Kindlin<sup>Ko</sup> cells on fibronectin are clearly not due to reduced α5β1 integrin levels.</p><p><italic>8) Since the KO cells express αvβ3, as well as α5β1, the inability of Mn<sup>2+</sup> have any effect on cell adhesion to vitronectin is puzzling.</italic></p><p>We thank the reviewers for this comment. We carefully analyzed our vitronectin and realized by SDS-PAGE that our vitronectin batch was faulty as we observed protein running at the wrong molecular weight. We repeated the adhesion assay with different vitronectin batches form different companies and can now show adhesion of Mn<sup>2+</sup>-treated Tln<sup>Ko</sup> but not Kind<sup>Ko</sup> cells to VN. The new adhesion assay is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>. The differential adhesion of Mn<sup>2+</sup>-treated Tln<sup>Ko</sup> and Kind<sup>Ko</sup> cells to VN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) despite similar surface levels of αv integrin points to particularly important role(s) for Kindlin-2 in αv integrins-VN adhesion and signalling (Liao et al., 2015).</p><p><italic>9) Considering the variability in the AFM measurements, it appears that in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2B and C</xref>, in contrast to Kind<sup>Ko</sup> cells, the Tln<sup>Ko</sup> cells do develop measureable adhesions to FN and that Mn<sup>2+</sup> increases the strength of the adhesions of nearly control levels. Similarly, Mn<sup>2+</sup> increased the adhesion of the Kind<sup>Ko</sup> cells, although less so than the control cells. Since there is evidence that the interaction of integrins with ligands is a multi-step process with adhesion strength increasing as the time of contact between integrin and ligand increases, the interpretation of the these experiments, i.e., the kindlin stabilizes integrin ligand complexes with time by inducing or maintaining integrin clusters is not necessarily the only conclusion.</italic></p><p>Indeed, our experiments measure that Tln<sup>Ko</sup> and Kind<sup>Ko</sup> cells in the presence of Mn<sup>2+</sup> restore the time-dependent adhesion strengthening. Whereas the adhesion of Tln<sup>Ko</sup> cells is fully restored in the presence of Mn<sup>2+</sup>, that of Kind<sup>Ko</sup> cells is restored by about only 50% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,C</xref>). Thus, we conclude that both talin and kindly play distinguishable roles in establishing integrin adhesion and adhesion strengthening. We thank the reviewers for this comment, which encouraged us to discuss the role of kindlin in establishing and strengthening integrin-mediated cell adhesion to FN in more detail. It is possible that kindlin is not only inducing integrin clustering but also modulating the off-rate of integrin-ligand bonds. This role could be mediated through ILK-Pinch-Parvin (IPP) binding, which may link kindlin to the F-actin cytoskeleton. We changed the text accordingly to provide this alternative conclusion.</p><p><italic>10)</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>: If we have interpreted the distribution of dots correctly, these data suggest that talin and kindlin are not necessarily required to form integrin clusters.</p><p>As mentioned in the manuscript, a fraction of kindlin- and almost all talin-deficient cells fail to undergo isotropic spreading. These cells are small, rounded, have small finger-like protrusions and display similar distributions and aggregations of integrin localizations on their surface. It could well be that neither talin nor kindlin is required for clustering. However, these small, non-spread cells may cluster their integrins simply because of a lack of space on the cell surface. We changed the text to make this point clearer.</p><p><italic>11) If the control fibroblasts are maintained in suspension, are kindlin and talin constitutively associated with β1 tail? Do the cells constitutively bind 93G7? What is the distribution of integrin in the suspended cells?</italic></p><p>a) Since the affinity of talin or kindling to integrin tails is very low, it is difficult or almost impossible to determine the association of talin or kindlin to integrins by regular immunoprecipitation in cell lysates. We therefore performed β1 integrin immunoprecipitation experiments after DSP crosslinking of adherent and suspension cells and used β1 YY/AA expressing cells that carry point mutations in the talin and kindlin binding sites as control. We frequently detect reduced co-IPed kindlin-2 and talin which would argue against a constitutively association with β1 integrin tail. However, the results varied depending on the DSP crosslinking time and would require more time and alternative assays to fully address this issue. As the conclusions in our manuscript do not depend on the question if kindlin-2 and talin are constitutively associated with β1 integrin we did not include this data into the revised manuscript.<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10130.030</object-id><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Talin and kindlin binding to the β1 integrin cytoplasmic domain.</title><p>Kind<sup>Ctr</sup> or cells expressing a talin and kindlin-binding deficient β1 integrin (β1 YY/AA) were either kept in suspension (susp.) for 3h or seeded on FN-coated dishes (adh.) before incubation for 15 min with 0.5 mM DSP crosslinker at RT. β1 integrin complexes were immunoprecipitated and analyzed by western blotting for presence of talin and kindlin-2.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.10130.030">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.10130.030</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-10130-resp-fig2-v1.tif"/></fig></p><p>b) Immunofluorescence staining for β1 integrin in the presence and absences of Mn<sup>2+</sup>, of suspended Tln<sup>Ctr</sup> and Kind<sup>Ctr</sup> cells revealed aggregates of β1 integrins in F-actin-positive membrane spikes, which were indistinguishable from Tln<sup>Ko</sup> or Kind<sup>Ko</sup> cells.
