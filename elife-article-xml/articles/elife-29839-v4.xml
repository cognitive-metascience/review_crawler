To achieve whole-brain recording with the ability to detect both small synaptic potentials and action potentials, we developed a voltage-sensitive dye (VSD) imaging technique based on a double-sided microscope that can image two sides of a nervous system simultaneously. We applied this system to the segmental ganglia of the medicinal leech.

Sensory information and behavioral states are represented as dynamic activity patterns of neuronal populations in large neuronal networks. To clarify the neuronal mechanisms underlying sensory processing and behavioral generation, it is necessary to determine which neurons are involved in functionally relevant neuronal dynamics and how those neuronal components interact with each other within the larger network. Technological advances in neuroimaging have enabled brain-wide recording of neuronal activity with sufficiently fine spatial resolution to identify individual neurons within a population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahrens et al., 2013</xref>). Researchers can perform pan-neuronal Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging in selected animals with nervous systems comprising small neuronal populations, including larval zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahrens et al., 2013</xref>) and <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Schrödel et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Kato et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Nguyen et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Although Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging is a convenient tool for detecting neuronal activity, it is limited to intracellular events that are associated with a change in Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration. Thus, Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging measures neither subthreshold depolarizing nor hyperpolarizing synaptic events. Accordingly, it is difficult to observe synaptic integration processes using Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicators. In contrast, voltage sensitive dyes (VSDs) can detect both action potentials and sub-threshold excitatory and inhibitory synaptic potentials. Voltage sensors have enabled neuroscientists to examine ethologically relevant neuronal dynamics and to functionally map parts of the nervous systems of sea slugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bruno et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Hill et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Hill et al., 2014</xref>) and the medicinal leech <italic>Hirudo verbana</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Briggman et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Briggman and Kristan, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Frady et al., 2016</xref>). The central nervous system of the leech consists of a ventral nerve cord connecting a head brain, 21 nearly identical segmental ganglia and a tail brain. The segmental ganglion of the leech is particularly well suited for comprehensive recording using VSD imaging for two reasons: It consists of only about 400 identifiable neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Pipkin et al., 2016</xref>), mostly as bilateral pairs, arranged in a well-preserved geometry in a single spherical shell surrounding a central neuropil, and it functions as a basic unit of sensory processing and control of several behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kristan et al., 2005</xref>). In the leech segmental ganglion, multiple neuronal circuits responsible for reflexive and voluntary locomotor behaviors have already been characterized by electrophysiology and VSD imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Briggman et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Briggman and Kristan, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Frady et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kristan et al., 2005</xref>). However, existing technology only allowed imaging one side of a ganglion at a time, and hence captured the activity of at most half of the full ensemble of neurons: researchers could record from, at most, approximately 15% of all 6000 neurons in a pedal ganglion of <italic>Aplysia</italic>, and fewer than 50% of all 400 neurons in a leech segmental ganglion. In addition, VSDs applied in these previous studies were limited by their sensitivity or response speed: electrochromic dyes used in sea slugs did not possess enough sensitivity to detect subthreshold potentials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bruno et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Hill et al., 2015</xref>) and FRET-based dye previously used in the leech had a non-negligible delay between optical signal and actual voltage change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Briggman et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Briggman and Kristan, 2006</xref>).</p><p>To overcome these limitations, we developed a double-sided microscope for VSD imaging, consisting of precisely aligned upright and inverted fluorescent microscopes, and imaged voltage changes from the neuronal membrane stained by a highly-sensitive, fast VSD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Woodford et al., 2015</xref>). This microscope enabled us to record from all cell bodies of a leech ganglion regardless of their location, and allowed us, for the first time, to directly analyze functional relationships between neurons located on opposite surfaces. We combined this double-sided neuronal imaging system with simultaneous electrophysiological recording and stimulation, which allowed us to monitor motor outputs, to verify agreement of VSD signals with actual membrane potentials, and to activate or inhibit selected target cells by injecting current.</p><p>To demonstrate the utility of the newly developed VSD imaging method, we addressed the following two questions. (1) How are individual identifiable neurons that exhibit higher discriminability for the different sensory stimuli distributed across different surfaces of the ganglion? (2) To what extent are neural circuit components unique or shared between different behaviors?</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>VSD imaging using double-sided microscopy system</title><p>Double-sided VSD imaging requires simultaneously focusing two fluorescent microscopes.

Both microscopes were equipped with 20x objectives. An optically stabilized high-power LED (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Wagenaar, 2012</xref>) provided excitation light through the top objective, which operated in epifluorescence mode. The top objective also functioned as a condenser lens for imaging with the bottom objective, which thus operated in transfluorescence mode (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). Because of the high NA (1.0) of the top objective, inhomogeneities in the imaged tissue did not cause substantive deviations from uniform illumination of the bottom focal plane.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29839.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Double-sided voltage sensitive dye imaging.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Schematic of the double-sided microscope.

We used highly sensitive CCD cameras (Photometrics QuantEM 512SC) to image neuronal activity with single cell resolution throughout the ganglion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). We suppressed mechanical vibration noise by replacing the internal fans of the CCD cameras with external blowers. Photon noise was not substantially different between the top and the bottom image (Top: 72 ± 3 ppm; Bottom: 65 ± 3 ppm (mean ± SEM over 10 areas size-matched to typical cells).</p><p>We imaged neural activity with a new-generation voltage sensitive dye, VF2.1(OMe).H (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Woodford et al., 2015</xref>), which is sensitive enough to record subthreshold events and fast enough to detect action potentials with accurate timing. The dye was loaded into somatic membranes on both aspects of a ganglion by bath application and a perfusion pump for targeted delivery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Briggman et al., 2005</xref>). In leech ganglia, the sensitivity reached 2.7 ± 0.3 % per 100 mV (mean ± SD across five ganglia in two leeches) at resting potential (−50 mV) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Microscopic motion artifacts can have outsized effects on VSD signals compared to Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals because of the limited relative change in fluorescence of VSDs and their location in the cell membrane. Accordingly, we applied a custom motion correction algorithm to all imaging data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref> and Materials and methods). Bleaching artifacts in the optical signals were corrected using locally fitted cubic polynomials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Wagenaar and Potter, 2002</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>) and global fluctuations were subtracted away (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lippert et al., 2007</xref>) (Materials and methods). The voltage sensor faithfully detected various types of membrane potential change, including action potentials, excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic potentials, and rhythmic oscillation during fictive behaviors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>).

One of the major advantages of VSDs is that recorded traces can be directly compared to intracellular voltage recordings. This allowed us to identify selected cells in our recordings by comparing our data to previously published intracellular activity of those neurons in the same behaviors. In our setup, the preparation is accessible to intracellular and extracellular electrodes advanced from the upper surface.</p><p>Optically recorded signals simultaneously recorded from both sides of the ganglion closely matched typical patterns of fictive behaviors that have been previously well characterized by electrophysiology and single-sided VSD imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Briggman and Kristan, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kristan et al., 2005</xref>).

We then imaged ganglion M10 with our double-sided microscope and simultaneously recorded intracellularly from selected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). Rhythmic activity associated with swimming was readily observed, and we determined which cells were involved in this rhythm by calculating the phase and magnitude of coherence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Briggman and Kristan, 2006</xref>) for each cell at the frequency with the greatest spectral power in the rhythm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b,c</xref>).

With our newly developed microscope, we simultaneously recorded, for the first time, the activity of the majority of neurons in a leech ganglion. While beyond the scope of this study, the fact that VSD recordings contain both spikes and postsynaptic potentials makes it possible to infer network connectivity among the different individual, identifiable cells. This offers a notable advantage over techniques that only give access to either spike events or intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration.</p><p>The leech has 21 nearly identical segmental ganglia containing approximately 400 neurons that are arranged in a highly conserved geometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kristan et al., 2005</xref>). For 148 of these neurons, functional descriptions have been published. (A gateway to the relevant literature is available online, at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.danielwagenaar.net/ganglion.">http://www.danielwagenaar.net/ganglion.</ext-link>) The ganglionic neurons are distributed in a single layer on the surface of the ganglion, but this layer wraps around both the dorsal and ventral sides, so that at best half of the neurons can be simultaneously imaged with conventional microscopy. Our double-sided microscope, in contrast, has access to all of them, although surface curvature means that not all neurons can simultaneously be in sharp focus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). A single light source was sufficient for illuminating both top and bottom surfaces, because the leech nervous system is sufficiently translucent to permit even lighting onto both sides.</p><p>As typical in monopolar cells in invertebrate central nervous systems, the somata of leech ganglionic neurons have passive membrane properties and action potentials are electrotonically attenuated in the cell body from their origins in the neuropil. The somata of typical interneurons and motor neurons show small, attenuated action potentials. However, some other neurons, including sensory neurons and a few neurosecretory cells, exhibit larger, easily detectable spikes. In some neurons, unitary synaptic potentials are relatively easy to detect from the cell body because those potentials are not greatly attenuated. We could capture discrete unitary EPSPs (approximately 2–4 mV) as optical signals visually detectable even in single sweep of recordings (approximately 0.02–0.04% in ΔF/F). In most neurons, synaptic interactions in the leech central nervous system during fictive behaviors usually result in compound synaptic potentials detectable even in the cell body. Hence, a low-noise imaging system using sensitive voltage sensors enables us to record behaviorally-relevant responses even in small neurons in the leech. In addition, our double-sided microscope is compatible with both intra- and extracellular electrode placement at least from one side, enabling detailed electrophysiological interrogation of selected specific neurons along with optical imaging from the whole population.</p><p>Intriguing features that we observed using our pan-neuronal imaging system are (1) widespread distribution of neurons that are differentially involved in left and right fictive ventral local bending (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c,d</xref>), and (2) involvement in multiple fictive behaviors of a large fraction of identifiable neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4i,j</xref>).</p><p>With respect to (1), we found that not only the local bend interneurons and the motor neurons previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lockery and Kristan, 1990</xref>) discriminated between the stimuli, but so did many other neurons that had not previously been implicated in fictive local bending. It has long been known that the neural mechanism of local bending involves population coding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Lewis and Kristan, 1998a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lewis and Kristan, 1998b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lewis and Kristan, 1998c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lewis, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Thomson and Kristan, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kretzberg et al., 2016</xref>), but its exact algorithm and computation remain unknown. Although the calculation of discriminability here was based on stimulus category (P<sub>V</sub><sup>L</sup> vs. P<sub>V</sub><sup>R</sup>) instead of actual local bend patterns in the leech’s body wall, the population dynamics of the highly discriminative cells we identified putatively underlie the neuronal computation. The discriminability maps from our study can thus be utilized for future investigations of mechanosensory information processing: the maps will work as a guide to selectively record or manipulate by intracellular electrodes during local bend in order to assess the role of individual neurons on the behavior.</p><p>A few neurons can be seen from both sides of the ganglion, and some cells near the lateral edge of the ganglion may be cut off from the imaging. For instance, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e</xref>, the right Leydig cell showed high discriminability and was seen in both dorsal and ventral aspects, but the left one was lost on the ventral side and had weak discriminability on the dorsal side. The main reason of such asymmetrical appearance on the discriminability maps could be explained as follows: We protected P cells from phototoxic effect by leaving sheath around the cell on the ventral side, thus the remaining sheath often covered other cells locating the lateral edge like Leydig cells. Because those cells are stained weakly or not at all especially on the ventral side, the asymmetrical results appeared.</p><p>With respect to (2), we observed that 43% of identifiable neurons on the ventral and dorsal surfaces were involved in at least two of the three behaviors tested (local bending, swimming, and crawling). This result indicates that the neural circuits for those behaviors share many components while generating unique motor patterns for each behavior. The percentage of circuit components shared between swimming and crawling identified in this study differed from previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Briggman and Kristan, 2006</xref>); in particular, the number of cells we identified as involved in crawling (56) was lower than in the previous study (188). The reason is that double-sided desheathing, which is necessary for double-sided imaging, made long and regular episodes of fictive crawling relatively rare. Thus, crawl episodes in our experiments were somewhat shorter (typically only 3–4 cycles) than in the older study, resulting in a weaker coherence signal. In addition, we imaged for 50 s in our crawl trials, 10 s shorter than the previous study, so that we could capture 20 frames per second. This did result in less opportunity of inclusion of extended crawling oscillation cycles.</p><p>Double-sided imaging revealed a previously unappreciated difference between the swim rhythm and local bending: The cell assemblies that are simultaneously active in the former span both sides of the ganglion, whereas in local bending, they are mostly confined to either the dorsal or the ventral side. Whether this difference has any functional significance remains unknown.</p><p>In our study, the limited frame rate of the CCD camera (QuantEM 512SC; Photometrics) restricted imaging of brief action potentials. In the experiment for multiple behaviors, the frame rate for local bend and swimming was 50 Hz (for 15 s in duration), while the frame rate for crawling was 20 Hz (for 50 s), at the 512 × 128 spatial resolution adequate for making ROIs and for cell identification. In VSD imaging at 50 Hz frame rate, long lasting potentials (e.g. spikes in Retzius or Leydig cells) are easy to detect but brief action potentials (millisecond order) like an S-cell spike are hard to detect. When imaging at higher frame rate (e.g. 200 Hz as in the report of dye development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Miller et al., 2012</xref>]), the dye realizes sufficient reconstruction of such brief spikes. It will be necessary, then, to apply a higher frame rate than the current setting for connectivity analysis on detected spikes in future studies. Even in the present study, however, voltage imaging with VoltageFluor dye sufficiently reconstructed relatively large, slow action potentials in several cells (e.g. Leydig cells, Retzius cells and mechanosensory cells). This enabled us to confirm cell identity based on the characteristics of spontaneous firing activity and the shape of action potential and afterhyperpolarization.</p><p>The delay of the optical signal following voltage changes in VoltageFluor is negligible unlike with FRET-based VSDs because the speed of VoltageFluor is nanosecond to microsecond, while that of FRET dyes is millisecond to second (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Miller et al., 2012</xref>). With VoltageFluor dyes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Frady et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Miller et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Moshtagh-Khorasani et al., 2013</xref>) including VF2.1(OMe).H (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Woodford et al., 2015</xref>), we do not have to adjust phase delay which was commonly done to correct for the slow response feature of FRET-based dyes. For instance, in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Briggman and Kristan (2006)</xref>, where they made single-sided coherence maps for fictive locomotory motor patterns, they used the slow dyes (FRET-based dyes) for imaging, using a frame rate of 10 Hz for swimming and 2 Hz for crawling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Briggman and Kristan, 2006</xref>). This likely explained why several cells like AE cells that show swim-related oscillation in our intracellular and VSD recordings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>) were not detected in the their coherence analysis. By using a faster dye, we could obtain higher coherence in those neurons, especially during swimming.</p><p>In this study, we identified imaged cells with known neurons using a semi-automatic mapping algorithm based on cell size and location along with an expert’s assessment based on the physiological properties of cells along with this geometrical information. To gain more insight into the neuronal networks responsible for behavior, it will be necessary to carry out more accurate neurocartography, which we will achieve by combining functional mapping using machine learning methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Frady et al., 2016</xref>) with a connectomic approach using serial block face scanning electron microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Pipkin et al., 2016</xref>). The combination of those techniques with double-sided VSD imaging will pave the way for future investigations on how the activity of all neurons in a central nervous system is recruited to process sensory information and to generate distinctive behaviors from overlapping neuronal circuits.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Optical recording by double-sided microscope</title><p>We acquired fluorescence images simultaneously from two focal planes using a custom double-sided microscope consisting of the fluorescence train of an upright microscope (Olympus BX, Tokyo, Japan) mounted on top of an inverted microscope (Olympus IX). The top microscope was used to image the upper focal plane while the bottom microscope imaged the lower focal plane. We used a 20x, 1.0 numerical aperture (NA) water-immersion objective, reduced to 0.7 NA by way of a custom aperture, for the upright and a 20x, 0.7 NA objective with cover-slip adjustment collar for the inverted microscope (both Olympus). The alignment of those two objectives was fine-adjusted manually so that cameras attached to the top and bottom microscopes saw the same field of view to within about 300 nm when the two focal planes were at the same depth.</p><p>The two objectives served as condenser for each other, so that blue excitation light delivered through the top objective for epifluorescence imaging also served as a transfluorescence light source for the bottom objective. Further, a red LED illuminator attached to the bottom microscope provided wide-field transillumination that enabled us to use the upright objective to visualize intracellular electrodes. Both objectives were mounted on standard turrets so that they could be rotated out of the way to make place for 5x objectives used to visualize extracellular suction electrodes.</p><p>For VSD imaging, we used excitation light (bandpass filtered to 470 ± 15 nm) from a high-power blue LED (LedEngin LZ1-10B200) controlled with optical stabilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Wagenaar, 2012</xref>). In both the upright and inverted microscopes, we used a 490 nm dichroic mirror and 505 nm LP emission filter. Images were acquired with two cooled CCD cameras (QuantEM 512SC; Photometrics, Tucson, AZ) at a resolution of 512 × 128 pixels. The frame rate was set depending on which behavior was recorded: for local bending and swimming, images were acquired at 50 Hz; for crawling, images were acquired at 20 Hz. Imaging data were acquired using custom software VScope (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Wagenaar, 2017</xref>). Optical and electrical recordings were synchronized by connecting frame timing signals from each camera to a data acquisition board that also recorded electrophysiology signals (see below).</p><p>VSD imaging is highly sensitive to even sub-micrometer motions. Because VSDs are located in cell membranes rather than the cytosol, a movement of less than 1% of a cell diameter can cause a signal change of well over 1% due to bright edge pixels moving out of a pre-defined region of interest (ROI). Since typical VSD signals are themselves far less than 1%, this can cause dramatic motion artifacts. To mitigate this problem, we replaced cooling fans inside each CCD camera with external blowers, since we determined that internal fans in cameras caused significant vibrations of the microscope objectives relative to the sample. After removing these fans, the remaining noise in image sequences was dominated by shot noise.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Animal maintenance and sample preparation</title><p>Procedures of dissection and dye loading for VSD imaging are described in more detail at Bio-protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Tomina and Wagenaar, 2018</xref>). Medicinal leeches (<italic>Hirudo verbana</italic>) were obtained from Niagara Leeches (Niagara Falls, NY) and maintained in artificial pond water at 15°C. For each experiment, an adult leech, regardless of its behavioral status at the time, was captured from an aquarium tank to make a preparation. The sample size of experiments of mechanosensory stimulus encoding (N = 8; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) and multiple behavioral generation (N = 6; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>) was determined by referring to the previous study, by Briggman and Kristan, where single-sided VSD imaging was performed to obtain functional maps of the leech ganglion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Briggman and Kristan, 2006</xref>). In experiments where only local bending was the target behavior, we dissected out short chains of ganglia from segments 8 through 12. In experiments involving swimming or crawling, we isolated whole nerve cords, including the head brain, all 21 segmental ganglia, and the tail brain. In all cases, the blood sinus surrounding the nervous system was dissected away around segmental ganglion M10. We removed the sheath from the ventral and dorsal surface of this ganglion before applying voltage-sensitive dyes. To induce swimming, a dorsal posterior (DP) nerve root in one of ganglia M11 through M13 was stimulated through a suction electrode. Brief electrical pulses (3 ms) were delivered at 50 Hz in a 3-s-long train, with an amplitude of 7–8 V. To elicit crawling, several nerves from the tail brain were stimulated using the same stimulus parameters as for DP nerve stimulation. The preparation was put on a disk-shaped plate (diameter: 13 mm, thickness: 0.65 mm) with an open window (1.6 mm x 2.6 mm) on its center, made of PDMS (Sylgard 184, Dow Corning, Midland, MI). The target ganglion for imaging was placed over this window so that the PDMS substrate did not touch the bottom side of the ganglion and did not disturb focusing of the bottom objective. For imaging, we put this PDMS plate together with a preparation on the center of a glass-bottom dish (38 mm in diameter) whose periphery had PDMS substrate.</p><p>Whole nerve cords or short chains of leech ganglia can move slightly because muscle cells are embedded in the nerve cord. We therefore stabilized the ganglion to be imaged by tightly pinning down blood sinus tissue to the PDMS substrate and by sandwiching adjacent connectives between small pieces of medical dressing (Tegaderm, 3M, Maplewood, MN), which was also pinned down, to minimize any motion artifacts. When imaging short chains of ganglia in local bend experiments, we disconnected inter-segmental interactions by pinching and crushing axon bundles inside of anterior/posterior connectives from M10 using forceps to reduce the ganglion’s movement and variability of responsiveness of neurons in the ganglion. Throughout the dissection and during imaging, preparations were maintained in chambers filled with cold leech saline consisting of the following (in mM): 115 NaCl, 4 KCl, 1.8 CaCl2, 2 MgCl2, 10 glucose, and 10 HEPES, at pH 7.4. Only before crawling was induced, we temporarily replaced the cold saline (2–5°C) with room temperature (20–23°C) saline to obtain the most natural crawling rhythm. We bath loaded 800 nM VF2.1(OMe).H (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Woodford et al., 2015</xref>) (provided by Evan Miller) in leech saline containing 1% pluronic acid (PowerloadTM Concentrate 100x, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). To help with dye penetration into the cell membranes, we circulated the solution using a pair of peristaltic pumps (approximately 1.1 mL/min flow rate) with outflows directed at the dorsal and ventral surfaces of the ganglion, for 20 min total. The criteria for inclusion of preparation for data were (1) no obvious damage on neurons or connectives during desheathing or VSD staining was observed, and (2) a sufficient number of fictive behaviors was induced in a preparation for analysis.</p><p>We did not systematically examine when dye rundown occurs under certain level of exposure light brightness, but we could image fictive behavioral pattern with no major loss of imaging quality at least until the total light exposure reached at 250 s. For the left/right local bend experiment, single experiments usually took approximately 40 min of real time from the first trial, of which approximately 100 s was imaging time. For the multiple behaviors experiment, the time varied depending how smoothly all behaviors were successfully induced, but they typically took 30 min from the first trial, of which approximately 250 s was imaging time. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Miller et al. (2012)</xref>, VoltageFluor dyes are less toxic than FRET-based dyes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Miller et al., 2012</xref>). Still, the combination of repetitive high-amplitude current injection (needed to reliably elicit multiple action potentials) and bright light exposure sometimes destroyed dye-stained P cells by causing injury bursting. That is why we protected P cells from phototoxicity by leaving sheath around it. Compared with P cells, dye-stained N cells were found to be relatively resistant to current injection and light exposure.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Electrophysiology</title><p>We recorded intracellularly from up to three neurons simultaneously using 20–50 MΩ glass microelectrodes filled with 3 M potassium acetate and 60 mM potassium chloride, using Neuroprobe amplifiers (Model 1600; A-M systems, Sequim, WA).

We recorded extracellularly using suction electrodes and a four-channel differential amplifier (Model 1700; A-M Systems). All electrical signals were digitized at 10 kHz using a 16-bit analog-to-digital board (NI USB-6221; National Instruments, Austin, TX) and VScope software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Wagenaar, 2017</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Basic data processing</title><p>We outlined the images of individual cell bodies manually as regions of interest using VScope (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Wagenaar, 2017</xref>).

Signals were processed to remove artifacts from micromotion (next section), and to correct for slow reduction of overall fluorescence intensity due to dye bleaching. The latter was achieved by subtracting locally fitted third-order polynomials using the SALPA algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Wagenaar and Potter, 2002</xref>) with a time constant of 1 to 15 s. In addition, brightness averaged across the areas of the ganglion outside of ROIs was subtracted for each frame to reduce global noise due to fluorescent crosstalk among top and bottom images (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lippert et al., 2007</xref>).

To calculate how well each cell ‘predicted’ the stimulus identity (i.e., ‘left’ or ‘right’), we calculated the average ΔF/F during the first 0.5 s of each stimulus relative to the preceding reference phase, separately for each trial. Taking each trial in turn, we then took that trial and its ‘partner’ trial out, and calculated the average ΔF/F for the 9 ‘left’ stimuli out of the remaining 18 trials and also for the ‘right’ stimuli. The ‘partner’ trial was the next trial for odd-numbered trials, and the preceding trial for even-numbered trials. If the ΔF/F in the trial under consideration was closer to the average ΔF/F of the ‘left’ trials in the training set than to the average of the ‘right’ trials, the neuron was considered correct in its ‘prediction’ of stimulus identity if the trial under consideration was in fact a ‘left’ trial, and conversely for ‘right’ trials. The percentage of trials in which a cell correctly predicted stimulus identity in this sense was used as a measure of prediction success.

In order to identify cells seen in the VSD image sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1a</xref>) with neurons in the canonical map, we developed a graphical user interface in GNU Octave (version 4.00) that allows us to proceed as follows. First, we mark all the visible cells as regions of interest on the image (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1b</xref>). Then, we overlay the canonical map over this (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1c</xref>). To the trained eye, the identification of many of the larger cells is immediately obvious, so we register these identities (using a drag-and-drop mechanism in the GUI; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1d</xref>)). Cell identification in this step can be confirmed based on physiological properties observed in its optical signals. This partial mapping of ROIs to identified neurons allows the program to do a coarse alignment between the canonical map and the actual image using affine transformations local to each of the four packets of cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1e</xref>). (The ganglion is divided by giant glial cells into six packets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kristan et al., 2005</xref>), the boundaries of which are indicated on the canonical map.) This preliminary alignment enables us to identify several other neurons with high confidence, after which the computer can perform a local alignment step. Finally, the computer assigns putative identities to the remaining ROIs, leading to a nearly complete mapping between ROIs (orange dots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1f</xref>) and identified neurons (cross marks).

When this would lead to conflicts (e.g., because two canonical neurons are both close to one ROI in the recording), these conflicts are resolved by considering matches between neurons and ROIs with similar sizes as most meritorious and by considering displacements of larger cells as less favorable than displacements of smaller cells.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Determination of which cells are consistently involved in a behavior</title><p>For each neuron in each animal, we determined whether its coherence exceeded the 95% confidence interval of the null hypothesis that a given neuron was not involved in a given behavior. Six preparations with which we successfully induced the full set of behaviors (local bending, swimming and crawling) were collected in approximately 2 months. If a neuron exceeded that threshold for a given behavior in four out of six animals, it was considered to be involved in that behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Briggman and Kristan, 2006</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4i</xref>). Since swimming and crawling are both symmetric behaviors, we included both members of a homologous pair if (and only if) at least one member exceeded the 97.5% C.I.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Clustering and calculation of integration coefficients</title><p>We clustered cells based on the matrix of the correlation coefficients of their activity patterns, separately for each behavior (by constructing a dendrogram based on the correlation distance followed by tree cutting). We then assigned a dorsoventrality index (DVI) to each cell, which was equal to the fraction of dorsally located cells in that cell’s cluster. This is what is shown in the histograms of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>. Cells in clusters with fewer than three members were ignored for this calculation; the results did not change qualitatively if this threshold was changed to two or five. Based on the DVI, we calculated the integration coefficient (CI) of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref> as:<disp-formula id="equ4"><mml:math id="m4"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">C</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">I</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo>⟨</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">|</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">D</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">V</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">I</mml:mi><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mrow><mml:mo>/</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">|</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mo>⟩</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>,</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></disp-formula>where <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf11"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">|</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>⋅</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">|</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> denotes absolute value and ⟨ · ⟩ denotes the average across all cells (except those not in clusters of size three or more).</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All data processing and statistical analysis were performed in GNU Octave, version 4.0.0.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Eve Marder (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Ronald L Calabrese (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Farzan Nadim (Reviewer #2); Astrid A Prinz (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This is an interesting manuscript describing a new a double-sided fluorescence microscope that can image two sides of a thin, relatively-translucent nervous system simultaneously. The microscope is compatible with recording electrodes advanced from the upper surface. The microscope was then applied to image neuronal activity in a single leech ganglion (using either short chains of ganglia or whole isolated nerve cords) using a state of the art VSD (VF2.1(OMe).H) from both surfaces so that potentially all cells are visible with single cell resolution. VSD recordings are supplemented with intracellular and extracellular recording to verify motor patterns and some cell identities; cell identities are largely inferred from soma size and positions from canonical maps. The data gathered in whole nerve cords with fictive local bends, fictive swimming, and fictive crawling were used to determine which of the identified neurons participate in each of the motor patterns and their overlap. They used the small chains of ganglia to determine if the recorded activity can discriminate sensory neurons that were stimulated to generate left vs. right fictive bends. The microscope has potential interest for all those working in thin, relatively-translucent nervous systems.</p><p>The work is carefully done with appropriate numbers of animals and within animal repeats, and the data analyzed appropriately. Necessary data and supplemental data and videos appears in easily accessible form.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) There is some confusion about the data of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and about how ganglia in the illustrations are oriented and right and left are assigned so that surfaces of the ganglia can be put together in a coherent way. Please see reviewer #1's detailed comments.</p><p>2) There is concern that the mapping technique is not adequately described and that it will not be applicable to other preparations in which cell bodies are not so stereotypically arranged. Does this limit the potential use of the microscope?</p><p>3) The advantages of using a fast VSD are emphasized but the advantage is not apparent in the data presented or its interpretation. Moreover, frame rate, dye rundown, and dye toxicity may limit experiments more than is implied. Please see reviewer #1's detailed comments.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>1) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> is critical and I don't really understand it because it is not fully explained in the text or legend. As far as I can understand from Materials and methods etc. you are looking at left-right difference to tell discrimination. Ok, then all cells lit up should be bilateral pairs as the left cell should be different from the right to discriminate PL from PR. Is this correct? What does it mean that only one Leydig cell discriminates? I assume that the Leydig R is visible on both ganglionic faces; but see note below.</p><p>(I am not sure that I understand how the ganglia are oriented and you don't say in the legend. Is the ventral surface shown in true ventral view? I.e., will I rotate the ventral view on its long axis one half rotation to map it onto the dorsal view? For example is that the Leydig cell R on the left side of the ventral view. This is very important and needs to be specified for <italic>all</italic> figures. I thought that it was standard leech practice to call L and R with respect to the animal oriented dorsal side up – this is how humans do it for other humans; on the canonical map of a leech ganglion in the ventral view R is on the left of the illustration and L is on the right or have I been doing it wrong for 35 years? Under this rule then the map of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> is labeled incorrectly and sows confusion about how we are to map the surfaces on to one another. Why don't you just label your ganglia with L and R (absolute, i.e. with respect to a dorsal side up animal) and have done with the confusion?)</p><p>2) You make a big point of using a fast VSD but your phase results (&quot;Using the VF2.1(OMe).H dye, we were able to confirm the oscillatory behavior of neurons previously studied using an earlier-generation dye. In addition, we were able to detect weaker oscillations in many other neurons on both sides of the ganglion.&quot;) were not different from previous findings. Then in Discussion you say &quot;The percentage of circuit components shared between swimming and crawling identified in this study differed from previous work; in particular, the number of cells we identified as involved in crawling was lower than in the previous study (188). The reason is probably that crawl episodes in our experiments were somewhat shorter (typically only 3-4 cycles) than in the older study, resulting in a weaker coherence signal.&quot; You also make claims about being able to decipher connectivity because you use a fast sensitive dye. Then in Materials and methods you give us the video rate as &quot;… for local bending and swimming, images were acquired at 50 Hz; for crawling, images were acquired at 20 Hz.&quot; These inconsistencies raise a number of questions. How have you advanced the field by using a fast VSD? What new have we learned about phase relations or circuit operation for swimming, e.g., because you used a fast VSD? Is connectivity really possible with 50Hz video? Certainly not with 20 Hz video. Did the ability to detect spikes really add to your analyses? Why were crawl episodes shorter in your study, and why did not greater dye sensitivity allow you to make up for the smaller number of cycles? How long can you image in your set up without preparation or dye rundown? How long is a typical imaging run? What is known dye toxicity?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29839.022</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) There is some confusion about the data of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and about how ganglia in the illustrations are oriented and right and left are assigned so that surfaces of the ganglia can be put together in a coherent way.

Regardless of how much variety exists in a certain neuronal preparation (a brain or a ganglion), it will be necessary to prepare and register a canonical map to overlay over an obtained image to match ROIs and canonical cells if a researcher wants to apply the mapping method. If experimenter can visually identify a few cells based on its cell size, position, or shapes and also confirm it by physiological features, the following procedures (course alignment, fine alignment and automatic assignment) would more effectively work for increasing success probability of the canonical mapping. There are more potential applicable ways of the double-sided microscope other than comprehensive canonical cell identification. Even in a preparation in which cell bodies are not well stereotypically arranged, the microscope will be able to work to characterize multiple cells whose function is unknown, or to analyze neural population dynamics, based on subthreshold postsynaptic activities.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The advantages of using a fast VSD are emphasized but the advantage is not apparent in the data presented or its interpretation.

Main reason of such cell missing is that we left sheath on the lateral side around Pv cells not to stain them. Repetitive intracellular current injection and light exposure sometimes killed P cells during imaging trial. To avoid this, we protected the target P cells from dye by leaving ventral sheath around the lateral nerves. This made some cells near to Pv cells occasionally not enough stained or invisible especially from ventral side. Because those cells are often unstained or missing, the asymmetric results easily appears. In fact, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, the right Leydig cell appeared to show high discriminability and the left one is missing in ventral side, while the right same cell showed high discriminability and the left one had weak discriminability on dorsal side. We mentioned it in the revised manuscript (Discussion, seventh paragraph).</p><p>As reviewer#1 pointed out, we agree to label ganglia with R in the absolute manner for all relevant figures and added an explanation of the ganglion’s orientation in the relevant figures. In the old manuscript, the orientation of the dorsal images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>) from the bottom camera is not appropriate because those images are reflections. We fixed those figures by flipping around as mirror image. In figure legend of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, we added an explanation of this left/right issue. Also, in the revised manuscript, we corrected the expression of left/right if that was inappropriate.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) You make a big point of using a fast VSD but your phase results (&quot;Using the VF2.1(OMe).H dye, we were able to confirm the oscillatory behavior of neurons previously studied using an earlier-generation dye.

What new have we learned about phase relations or circuit operation for swimming, e.g., because you used a fast VSD?</p></disp-quote><p>Although there is such limitation of spike detection for analysis due to the lower frame rate, VSD imaging with this fast dye reconstructed relatively large, slow action potential’s trace sufficiently in several cells (e.g. Leydig cells, Retzius cells and mechanosensory cells). It helped us to confirm cell identification based on characteristics of spontaneous firing activity, spike response, and afterhyperpolarization. With VoltageFluor dyes including VF2.1(OMe).H, the delay of optical signal to voltage change is negligible unlike the case of FRET-based VSD with slow speed. The speed scale for VoltageFluor is nanosecond to microsecond, while that of FRET dye is millisecond to second (Miller et al., 2012). Unlike FRET-based dyes, we do not have to adjust phase delay, which is caused by slow response feature of dye, using the fast dye.</p><p>In Briggman &amp; Kristan (2006) where they made coherence maps single-sidedly for fictive swimming and fictive crawling, they used slow dyes (FRET-based dyes) for imaging. The frame rate was 10 Hz for swimming and 2 Hz for crawling. (In 10926 of the previous report, they stated “For swimming, images were acquired at 20 Hz, yielding ratioed signals at 10 Hz. Trials at this frame rate were 10 s in duration. For crawling, 50 ms frames were acquired twice per second, yielding 2 Hz ratioed signals.”). In their results on fictive swimming, several cells like AE cells which show swim-related oscillation in intracellular recording (clearly shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) were not detected in the coherence map. By using the fast dye and imaging at 50 Hz, we could obtain higher coherence in those neurons especially for swimming. We mentioned it in the revised manuscript (Discussion, tenth and eleventh paragraphs).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Is connectivity really possible with 50Hz video? Certainly not with 20 Hz video. Did the ability to detect spikes really add to your analyses?</p></disp-quote><p>We did not apply spike detection and analysis of spikes. In our study, frame rate of imaging is the main limitation for detecting action potentials. If we perform imaging at enough frame rate with the fast VSD (e.g. sampling rate: 200 Hz in Miller et al., 2012), the dye realizes sufficient reconstruction of spike shape even in mammalian cell showing brief action potentials. In our experiment for multi-behaviors analysis, the frame rate for local bend and swimming was 50 Hz for 15 sec in duration, while the frame rate for crawling was 20 Hz for 50 sec. In 512 x 128 spatial resolution, those frame rate settings were the maximum limitations for those recording duration in our CCD cameras (QuantEM 512SC; Photometrics). In VSD imaging at 50 Hz frame rate, a brief action potential (a millisecond order) like S cell spike is hard to detect, while a long lasting action potential like Leydig cell spike (30 millisecond) is easy to detect. Therefore, if we apply spike detection to the VSD imaging data using the current apparatus, we cannot avoid a bias based on the duration of action potentials. It is necessary to apply higher frame rate than the current setting for connectivity analysis based on detected spikes from VSD data in future, and it is difficult to perform such analysis with VSD data obtained by the current setting of our CCD cameras.</p><p>In the previous study using VoltageFluor in single side of the ganglion (Moshtagh-Khorasani et al., 2013), they imaged spontaneous activities (not behavior) and analyzed spike trains detected from the VSD traces to describe spike cross-correlation pattern in 14 neurons for ventral and 27 neurons for dorsal. They performed VSD imaging at a sampling rate from 94 to 110 frame/s and at a spatial resolution of 128 x 128 pixels with Electron Multiplier CCD camera (C9100-13, Hamamatsu). They used 2~5 times faster frame rate than ours so that they could detect more spikes than ours. However, they lost spatial resolution (512 x 128 in our imaging) so that it was not good for drawing ROIs especially for small neurons. We could have performed a similar experiment with the same setting (faster sampling rate, lower spatial resolution) to see spike cross-correlation of spontaneous activities or some behaviors. In such situation, the quality of drawling ROIs and identification of cells would, naturally, be as not good as that in our current study. Therefore, we may have obtained several large identified cells to be included in spike cross-correlation across ventral and dorsal sides.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Why were crawl episodes shorter in your study, and why did not greater dye sensitivity allow you to make up for the smaller number of cycles?</p></disp-quote><p>Coherence degree largely depends on the cycle of fictive behavior under recording time. Even in 15 sec recording, swim cycle is usually sufficient to obtain significant coherence degree because fictive swimming typically continues for several seconds and its frequency is relatively fast (approximately 1-1.5 Hz). Compared with fictive swimming, fictive crawling is slower event (approximately 0.1 Hz) and is relatively difficult to observe as long-lasting regular rhythmic manner at least in the double-desheathed preparation. Double sided desheathing might cause unhealthy effect on the ganglion preparation especially for maintenance of fictive crawling bout. Recording time for crawling was 50 sec (at 20 Hz), which is 10 sec shorter than the previous study, also causing less opportunity of inclusion of crawling oscillation. VoltageFluor dyes are faster than FRET based dyes in response speed, but VoltageFluor’s sensitivity is not greater than that of FRET based dyes. Sensitivity of VF2.1(OMe). H. in the leech ganglion we used was 2.7%, but that of FRET-based dye was 4.3% according to Cacciatore et al. (1999). We mentioned it in the revised manuscript (Discussion, eighth paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>How long can you image in your set up without preparation or dye rundown? How long is a typical imaging run?</p></disp-quote><p>We did not systematically examine when dye rundown caused problematic effect during imaging at certain brightness of exposure light, but we could image fictive behavioral pattern at least even 250 sec after excitation light exposure. The toughness of preparation to imaging experiment largely depends on its health condition of preparation. In order to keep its health condition well, an experimenter needs to finish dissection process quickly and frequently replace saline with cooler one during the process.</p><p>For the left/right local bend experiment, single experiment usually took about 40 min including inter-trial intervals from the first trial. The running time of imaging was about 100 sec in total (5 sec for each trial, 20 trials for each experiment). For the multi-behaviors experiment, the time varied depending how smoothly all behaviors were successfully induced, but it typically took 30 min including inter-trial intervals from the first trial. The running time of imaging was up to about 250 sec. We mentioned it in the revised manuscript (subsection “Animal maintenance and sample preparation”, last paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>What is known dye toxicity?</p></disp-quote><p>We found only single relevant explanation regarding toxicity of this type of dyes in Miller et al. (2012) where the first version of VoltageFluor, VF2.1.Cl was reported. In P.2117, there is a statement that “Tests of the toxicity and bleaching of the PeT-based VSD similar to those performed on the FRET-based dyes show that the PeT-based VSD has a slower rate of bleaching and is less toxic than the FRET-based dyes.”, but they did not show data of its toxicity. As far as we know based on our experience, the combination of repetitive, strong current injection and strong excitation light exposure sometimes destroys especially stained P cells by causing injury bursting. Compared with P cells, N cells are relatively tough to current injection and light exposure under stained condition. We think that its photo-toxicity depends on cells, although we are not sure what properties of individual cells are related to tendency of death to the toxicity. We mentioned it in the revised manuscript (subsection “Animal maintenance and sample preparation”, last paragraph).</p></body></sub-article></article>
