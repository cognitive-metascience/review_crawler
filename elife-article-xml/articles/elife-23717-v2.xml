These plastid-targeted proteins may originate from the endosymbiont, the host, or other sources entirely. Here, we identify and characterise 770 plastid-targeted proteins that are conserved across the ochrophytes, a major group of algae including diatoms, pelagophytes and kelps, that possess plastids derived from red algae. We show that the ancestral ochrophyte plastid proteome was an evolutionary chimera, with 25% of its phylogenetically tractable nucleus-encoded proteins deriving from green algae. We additionally show that functional mixing of host and plastid proteomes, such as through dual-targeting, is an ancestral feature of plastid evolution. Finally, we detect a clear phylogenetic signal from one ochrophyte subgroup, the lineage containing pelagophytes and dictyochophytes, in plastid-targeted proteins from another major algal lineage, the haptophytes. This may represent a possible serial endosymbiosis event deep in eukaryotic evolutionary history.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.23717.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.23717.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23717.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The cells of most plants and algae contain compartments called chloroplasts that enable them to capture energy from sunlight in a process known as photosynthesis. Chloroplasts are the remnants of photosynthetic bacteria that used to live freely in the environment until they were consumed by a larger cell. “Complex” chloroplasts can form if a cell that already has a chloroplast is swallowed by another cell.</p><p>The most abundant algae in the oceans are known as diatoms. These algae belong to a group called the stramenopiles, which also includes giant seaweeds such as kelp. The stramenopiles have a complex chloroplast that they acquired from a red alga (a relative of the seaweed used in sushi). However, some of the proteins in their chloroplasts are from other sources, such as the green algal relatives of plants, and it was not clear how these chloroplast proteins have contributed to the evolution of this group.</p><p>Many of the proteins that chloroplasts need to work properly are produced by the host cell and are then transported into the chloroplasts. Dorrell et al. studied the genetic material of many stramenopile species and identified 770 chloroplast-targeted proteins that are predicted to underpin the origins of this group. Experiments in a diatom called <italic>Phaeodactylum</italic> confirmed these predictions and show that many of these chloroplast-targeted proteins have been recruited from green algae, bacteria, and other compartments within the host cell to support the chloroplast.</p><p>Further experiments suggest that another major group of algae called the haptophytes once had a stramenopile chloroplast. The current haptophyte chloroplast does not come from the stramenopiles so the haptophytes appear to have replaced their chloroplasts at least once in their evolutionary history.</p><p>The findings show that algal chloroplasts are mosaics, supported by proteins from many different species. This helps us understand why certain species succeed in the wild and how they may respond to environmental changes in the oceans. In the future, these findings may help researchers to engineer new species of algae and plants for food and fuel production.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.23717.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.23717.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>HPPG</kwd><kwd>algae</kwd><kwd>diatom</kwd><kwd>chromalveolate</kwd><kwd>plastid protein import</kwd><kwd>shopping bag model</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003043</institution-id><institution>EMBO</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ALTF 1124/2014</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dorrell</surname><given-names>Richard G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Diatomite</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bowler</surname><given-names>Chris</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007369</institution-id><institution>Institut de France</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Louis-D Foundation</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bowler</surname><given-names>Chris</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100011102</institution-id><institution>Seventh Framework Programme</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>615274</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bapteste</surname><given-names>Eric P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000936</institution-id><institution>Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bowler</surname><given-names>Chris</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Paris Sciences et Lettres, Labex-MemoLife</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR- 10-LABX-54</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bowler</surname><given-names>Chris</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-11-IDEX-0001-02</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bowler</surname><given-names>Chris</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-11-BTBR-0008</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Richter</surname><given-names>Daniel J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>An <italic>in silico</italic> reconstruction of a chloroplast that existed hundreds of millions of years ago casts new insights in the evolutionary processes, endosymbioses and chimerism events that shape the origin of plastids.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Since their origin, the eukaryotes have diversified into an extraordinary array of organisms, with different genome contents, physiological properties, and ecological adaptations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Dorrell and Smith, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">de Vargas et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Dorrell and Howe, 2012a</xref>). Perhaps the most profound change that has occurred within individual eukaryotic cells is the acquisition of plastids via endosymbiosis, which has happened at least eleven times across the tree of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Dorrell and Smith, 2011</xref>). All but one characterized group of photosynthetic eukaryotes possess plastids resulting from a single ancient endosymbiosis of a beta-cyanobacterium by an ancestor of the archaeplastid lineage (consisting of green algae and plants, red algae, and glaucophytes) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Dorrell and Smith, 2011</xref>).</p><p>Photosynthesis has subsequently spread outside of the archaeplastids through secondary, tertiary, or more complex endosymbiosis events. By far the most ecologically successful of these lineages are those that possess plastids derived from secondary or more complex endosymbioses of a red alga (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Dorrell and Smith, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Baurain et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib130">Stiller et al., 2014</xref>). These are the ‘CASH lineages’, consisting of photosynthetic members of the cryptomonads, alveolates (such as dinoflagellates), stramenopiles (also referred to as heterokonts) and haptophytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Dorrell and Smith, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Baurain et al., 2010</xref>) (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> for definitions). The most prominent of these are the photosynthetic members of the stramenopiles, termed the ochrophytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">de Vargas et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aleoshin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib133">Ševčíková et al., 2015</xref>). The ochrophytes include the diatoms, which are major primary producers in the ocean (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bowler et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Armbrust et al., 2004</xref>), multicellular kelps, which serve as spawning grounds for marine animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Cock et al., 2010</xref>) and the pelagophytes, microscopic algae of which some are known to form harmful blooms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Gobler et al., 2011</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, panel A; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). The stramenopiles also contain many aplastidic and non-photosynthetic lineages (e.g., oomycetes), which diverge at the base of the ochrophytes and play important roles as pathogens and in microbial food webs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aleoshin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Derelle et al., 2016</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23717.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Procedure for identification of conserved plastid-targeted proteins in ochrophytes.</title><p>(Panel <bold>A</bold>) shows a schematic unrooted ochrophyte tree, with the three major ochrophyte lineages (chrysista, hypogyristea, and diatoms) denoted by different coloured labels. ‘PX’ refers to the combined clade of phaeophytes, xanthophytes and related taxa, and ‘PESC’ to pinguiophytes, eustigmatophytes, synchromophytes, chrysophytes and relatives. A global overview of the eukaryotic tree of life, including the position of ochrophytes relative to other lineages is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>. (Panel <bold>B</bold>) shows the number of inferred positive control HPPGs (i.e., HPPGs encoding proteins with experimentally confirmed plastid localisation, or unambiguously plastid function) and negative control HPPGs (i.e., HPPGs encoding proteins with no obvious plastid-targeted orthologues encoded in ochrophyte genomes, but found in haptophyte and cryptomonad genomes) detected as plastid-targeted in different numbers of ochrophyte lineages using ASAFind (i) and HECTAR (ii). The blue bars show the number of positive controls identified to pass a specific conservation threshold, plotted against the left hand vertical axis of the graph, while the red bars show the number of negative controls that pass the same conservation threshold, plotted against the right hand vertical axis of the graph. The number of different sub-categories included in each conservation threshold is shown in a heatmap below the two graphs, with the specific distribution for each bar in the graph shown in the aligned cells directly beneath it. Each shaded cell corresponds to an identified orthologue in one sub-category of a particular ochrophyte lineage: orange cells indicate presence of chrysistan sub-categories; light brown cells the presence of hypogyristean sub-categories; and dark brown cells the presence of diatom sub-categories. In each graph, black arrows label the conservation thresholds inferred to give the strongest separation (as inferred by chi-squared P-value) between positive and negative control sequences. The table (iii) tabulates the three conservation patterns identified as appropriate for distinguishing probable ancestral HPPGs from false positives. (Panel <bold>C</bold>) shows the complete HPPG assembly, alignment and phylogenetic pathway used to identify conserved plastid-targeted proteins. (Panel <bold>D</bold>) tabulates the number of HPPGs built using ASAFind and HECTAR predictions, and the number of non-redundant HPPGs identified in the final dataset. The final total represents the pooled total of non-redundant HPPGs identified with both ASAFind and HECTAR.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.23717.003">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.23717.003</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="postscript" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-23717-fig1-v2"/></fig><fig id="fig1s1" position="float" specific-use="child-fig"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23717.004</object-id><label>Figure 1—figure supplement 1.</label><caption><title>Overview of eukaryotic diversity.</title><p>This figure, adapted from a previous review (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Dorrell and Howe, 2012a</xref>), profiles the diversity of different eukaryotic nuclear lineages.

These include the transfer of plastid-derived genes to the host nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Dorrell and Howe, 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Ruck et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib128">Stegemann et al., 2003</xref>) and the targeting of proteins encoded within the nucleus to the plastid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Nowack and Grossman, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Kleffmann et al., 2004</xref>). Previous studies have shown that many plastid-targeted proteins are not derived from the genomes of the corresponding endosymbiont lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Curtis et al., 2012</xref>). Proteins encoded by genes acquired from other sources, such as laterally acquired genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Qiu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Morse et al., 1995</xref>) or previous endosymbiotic organelles historically possessed by the host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Dorrell and Howe, 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">2012b</xref>), or proteins that have been repurposed from endogenous host organelles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Fast et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Harper and Keeling, 2003</xref>) have important roles in supporting the biology of plastid lineages. Other gene transfer events, e.g. from food sources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Nowack et al., 2016</xref>), bacterial symbionts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Dunning Hotopp et al., 2007</xref>), viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Gornik et al., 2012</xref>), or diazotrophic non-plastid cyanobacterial endosymbionts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Prechtl et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib138">Thompson et al., 2012</xref>) might have also played major roles in the evolution of the diverse range of plastid proteins observed today. It nonetheless remains largely unknown which proteins had the most fundamental roles in establishing current plastid lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Dorrell and Howe, 2012a</xref>), i.e., which plastid proteins represent the ancestral components of plastid-targeted proteomes.</p><p>Ochrophytes represent an excellent system in which to reconstruct the origins of plastid proteomes. Firstly, plastid-targeting sequences in different ochrophytes are relatively well conserved, enabling <italic>in silico</italic> prediction of plastid-targeted proteins from a wide range of different species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Gruber et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Gschloessl et al., 2008</xref>), in contrast to plastid-targeting sequences within archaeplastid lineages, which are extremely variable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Fuss et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib132">Suzuki and Miyagishima, 2010</xref>). Secondly, compared to other CASH lineages (haptophytes, cryptomonads, and dinoflagellates), ochrophytes represent an extremely well characterised system for experimental and bioinformatic investigation, with (to date) eleven complete genomes, and transcriptome libraries available for over 150 species through MMETSP (the Marine Microeukaryote Transcriptome Sequencing Project) and through other sources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Mock et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Keeling et al., 2014</xref>). Reliable transformation and other manipulation strategies are also available for multiple species, such as the model diatom <italic>Phaeodactylum tricornutum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib123">Siaut et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib134">Takahashi et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Radakovits et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Thirdly, the origin of the ochrophyte plastid is an evolutionarily valuable topic to understand. It is currently not known when the ochrophyte plastid was acquired: whether it originated recently, predates the radiation of aplastidic stramenopile relatives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib130">Stiller et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aleoshin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Derelle et al., 2016</xref>), or was acquired prior to the divergence of stramenopiles from their closest relatives, the alveolates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Janouskovec et al., 2010</xref>). Verifying a late origin for the ochrophyte plastid would thus enable insights into the cellular changes that accompany the transition from a solely heterotrophic to a phototrophic lifestyle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aleoshin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Derelle et al., 2016</xref>), which is currently not possible for archaeplastids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Burki et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cavalier-Smith et al., 2015</xref>), and difficult for haptophytes and cryptomonads, in which these relatives respectively remain unknown or understudied at a genomic level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Burki et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib144">Yabuki et al., 2014</xref>). It has additionally been proposed, based on the presence of large numbers of genes of putative green algal origin in diatom genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Frommolt et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Petersen et al., 2006</xref>), that the ancestor of ochrophytes once possessed a green algal endosymbiont, which was subsequently replaced via the serial endosymbiosis of a red algal-derived plastid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Dorrell and Smith, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Moustafa et al., 2009</xref>). This hypothesis remains controversial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Ku et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib140">Woehle et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Deschamps and Moreira, 2012</xref>), in particular due to issues associated with the distinction of genes of red and green algal origins in ochrophyte genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Matsuzaki et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Collén et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Qiu et al., 2015</xref>). A final evolutionary suggestion regarding ochrophytes is that they have acted as endosymbiotic donors into other CASH lineages. One recent study proposed that haptophytes possess plastids acquired via the endosymbiosis of an ochrophyte (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib130">Stiller et al., 2014</xref>), although the exact identity of this endosymbiotic acquisition remain unresolved. Characterising the ancestral ochrophyte plastid proteome might therefore help answer major questions about the ways in which plastids become established in the host cell, and provide valuable insights into the origins and diversification of other ecologically important algal lineages.</p><p>In this study, we present an experimentally verified <italic>in silico</italic> reconstruction of the proteins targeted to the plastid of the last common ochrophyte ancestor. We show that this ancestral plastid-targeted proteome was an evolutionary mosaic, containing 770 proteins from a range of different sources. Our dataset indicates that the ochrophyte plastid was acquired late in stramenopile evolution, following the divergence of extant aplastidic relatives, that plastid-targeted proteins of green algal origin played a significant role in its origin, and that there has been bidirectional integration of the biology of the ochrophyte host and plastid proteomes, such as the ancient recruitment of proteins from both host and endosymbiont to dually support the biology of the plastid and mitochondria. Finally, we show evidence for an ancient endosymbiosis of a specific ochrophyte lineage, an ancestor of the pelagophytes and dictyochophytes, by a common ancestor of the haptophytes, which we propose- based on discrepancies between the origins of the haptophyte plastid proteome and genome- reveals a possible serial endosymbiosis event early in haptophyte evolution, preceding the origins of the current haptophyte plastid. Our work resolves several long-standing questions of ochrophyte evolution, and provides new insights into the origins and diversification of CASH lineages as a whole.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>In silico reconstruction of an ancestral plastid proteome</title><p>We developed an <italic>in silico</italic> pipeline for identifying putatively ancestral plastid-targeted proteins across the ochrophytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).

Sequences with predicted plastid localisation were binned into eleven taxonomic sub-categories within three major groups (chrysista, hypogyrista, and diatoms) based on recent multigene phylogenies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Derelle et al., 2016</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, panel A; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), then assembled by sequence similarity into homologous plastid-targeted protein groups (HPPGs, Materials and methods).</p><p>We next tested the level of conservation best able to identify truly ancestral HPPGs. We selected three patterns of conservation that identified the largest number of HPPGs from a positive control dataset of proteins with previously identified plastid-associated functions, and minimised the number identified from a negative control dataset of HPPGs generated using seed sequences from three other published CASH lineage genomes, for which no plastid-targeted orthologues were detected in any ochrophyte genome sequence (Materials and methods; Table S2- sheet 2, sections 1–2; Table S3- sheet 2, sections 1–2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Dorrell et al., 2016</xref>]). The selected conservation patterns were: the presence of the protein in a majority (≥2/3) of chrysistan sub-categories and a majority of either diatom (≥3/5) or hypogyristean (≥2/3) sub-categories; or presence in at least one chrysistan sub-category and a majority of both diatoms and hypogyristea (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, panel B). We extracted HPPGs matching the conservation patterns defined above and verified their monophyly within ochrophytes via alignment and single-gene trees (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, panel C; Table S4- sheet 1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Dorrell et al., 2016</xref>]).

This is analogous to results from studies of archaeplastid plastid proteomes, in which approximately half of the plastid-targeted proteins are of endosymbiont origin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Qiu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib132">Suzuki and Miyagishima, 2010</xref>). The remaining 114 HPPGs resolved with other sister-groups, consistent with a mosaic origin of the ochrophyte plastid proteome. The most significant of these lineages was green algae (67 HPPGs, 25%), followed by aplastidic stramenopiles (26 HPPGs, 10%), and prokaryotes (21 HPPGs, 8%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, panel A). None of the HPPGs were clearly assigned to other eukaryotes or to viruses, consistent with previous assertions that these lineages have contributed very little to ochrophyte evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bowler et al., 2008</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, panel A).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3-2"><title>Late origin of ochrophyte plastids</title><p>We wished to determine whether the ochrophyte plastid was acquired by a common ancestor of all stramenopiles or later in ochrophyte evolution. We reasoned that if the ochrophyte plastid was acquired early, i.e., before the divergence of aplastidic relatives, endosymbiotic gene transfer from the red algal symbiont to the host nucleus would have commenced prior to the radiation of the stramenopiles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib129">Stiller et al., 2009</xref>). Based on the primary evolutionary affinities of each ancestral HPPG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, panel A), we would expect approximately half of the aplastidic stramenopile-derived proteins to show a deeper red algal origin. We accordingly profiled the deeper evolutionary affinity of each ancestral HPPG of aplastidic stramenopile origin by a combined phylogenetic and BLAST top hit analysis, as before.</p><p>First, we noted that the majority (20/26) of the ochrophyte HPPGs with aplastidic stramenopile origins specifically resolved as a sister-group to oomycetes, as opposed to the deeper-branching labyrinthulomycetes or slopalinids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, panel B; Table S4- sheet 3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Dorrell et al., 2016</xref>]). Because oomycetes are the sister-group of ochrophytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aleoshin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Derelle et al., 2016</xref>), this suggests that our dataset retains useful phylogenetic signal.</p><p>Next, from the 26 ancestral HPPGs of aplastidic stramenopile origin, we identified a clear sister-group to the stramenopile clade for 16 HPPGs using BLAST, and for 18 HPPGs using single-gene trees (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, panel B). However, only one BLAST top hit and four trees showed a deeper red algal affinity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, panel B). These proportions are significantly smaller than the proportions of ochrophyte proteins of red origin in the entire ancestral HPPG dataset (expected frequencies: 9.54 BLAST top hits, 10.7 sister-groups; chi-squared test, p≤0.01; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, panels A, B). In five cases we identified the same deeper affinity through combined BLAST top hit and tree sister-group analysis, but none of these were of red algal origin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, panel B). We conclude that plastid-targeted proteins in ochrophytes that are related to aplastidic stramenopile proteins are predominantly not of red origin. This is consistent with a late origin for the ochrophyte plastid, following the divergence of the ochrophytes and oomycetes.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3-3"><title>A significant green algal contribution to ochrophyte plastid evolution</title><p>Previous reports of green genes in ochrophyte genomes have been controversial due to a paucity of red algal sequence data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Moustafa et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Deschamps and Moreira, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bowler et al., 2008</xref>).

We tested whether the inferred green algal origin could be due to a protein family’s absence from red algal lineages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, panel A). For the majority of our green HPPGs (40/67), an orthologue was identified in at least four of the five major red algal sub-categories considered (cyanidiales, bangophytes and florideophytes, compsopogonophytes and stylonematophytes, porphyridiophytes, and rhodellophytes; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, panel B; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>; Table S4- sheet 4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Dorrell et al., 2016</xref>]).

Phylogenetic analyses of the HPPGs of verified green origin exhibited a strong bias toward chlorophyte origins. Ochrophytes branched as sister-groups to individual or multiple chlorophyte lineages in 51 of the 67 trees (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, panel C; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). Similarly, we noted a strong predominance of chlorophyte lineages amongst BLAST top hits (56/67) despite the fact that these lineages only correspond to approximately 25% of the green sequences present in our libraries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>; Table S4- sheet 3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Dorrell et al., 2016</xref>]). In contrast, only 16 of the single-gene trees for HPPGs of verified green origin recovered a sister-group relationship between ochrophytes and all green lineages (chlorophytes and streptophytes), none recovered a specific sister-group relationship between ochrophytes and streptophytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, panel C), and only 11 of the BLAST top hits were to streptophyte sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>; Table S4- sheet 3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">[Dorrell et al., 2016</xref>]). This bias is inconsistent with the green ancestral HPPGs being of misidentified red origin, or originating at a deeper position within the green algae, in which case they should show a more stochastic distribution of evolutionary affinities across all green lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib140">Woehle et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Next, we tested whether our data supported a single origin for the green genes within the chlorophytes, or whether the HPPGs of green origin arose through gene transfer events from multiple chlorophyte lineages. We identified all amino acids that were uniquely shared between ochrophytes and chlorophytes in the 31 green HPPGs for which we found no evidence of gene duplication or subsequent lateral gene transfer into green algae, ochrophytes, or other major photosynthetic eukaryotes (Table S6- sheets 1, 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Dorrell et al., 2016</xref>); Materials and methods). We then inferred the most probable origin in the green algal tree for each uniquely shared residue as well as the earliest possible origin, taking into account gapped and missing positions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, panel D; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>; Table S7- sheets 1, 3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Dorrell et al., 2016</xref>]). In both analyses the majority of the uniquely shared residues were inferred to have originated in a common ancestor of all chlorophytes, or of all chlorophyte lineages excluding the basal <italic>Prasinoderma/ Nephroselmis</italic> sub-category (189/289 positions in observed analysis; 100/147 positions in the earliest possible analysis; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, panel D; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>; Table S7- sheets 1, 3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Dorrell et al., 2016</xref>]). All other nodes within the green tree, including all specific green sub-categories, shared much smaller numbers of residues with ochrophytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, panel D; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>; Table S7- sheets 1, 3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Dorrell et al., 2016</xref>]). Thus, our data is congruent with the majority of the ochrophyte green genes originating from deep within the chlorophyte lineage.</p><p>Finally, we considered whether the green genes that function in ochrophyte plastids were more likely to have been acquired through endosymbiosis, or through lateral gene transfers, for example from a food organism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Keeling and Palmer, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Doolittle, 1998</xref>) or other intracellular symbiont (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Dorrell and Howe, 2012a</xref>). We reasoned that if the green genes in ochrophytes were predominantly of endosymbiotic origin, they should encode more plastid-targeted proteins than genes of alternative origin, in the same manner as genes of cyanobacterial origin retained in archaeplastid genomes are biased towards encoding proteins with plastid functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Dorrell and Howe, 2015</xref>). We accordingly constructed a secondary dataset, consisting of 7140 non-redundant gene families that are broadly distributed across the ochrophytes, and tested the targeting preferences of proteins from each HPPG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, panel E; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4—figure supplement 5</xref>; Table S8- sheet 1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Dorrell et al., 2016</xref>]). 871 gene families resolved with the green algae per BLAST top hit analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4—figure supplement 5</xref>; Table S8- sheet 2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Dorrell et al., 2016</xref>]).

It has previously been speculated, for example, that genes acquired by diatoms from green algae might have a specific role in tolerating variable light regimes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Frommolt et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Dittami et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Coesel et al., 2008</xref>) or eliminating toxic substances from diatom plastids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Chan et al., 2011</xref>). We noted that many of the pathways in the ochrophyte plastid utilise a mixture of genes of red, green, host and prokaryotic origin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>), which would suggest a converse scenario: that the mosaic origins of the ochrophyte plastid have led to the functional mixing of enzymes with disparate evolutionary origins.</p><p>Consistent with this latter idea, we found very little evidence that individual categories of HPPG (i.e., red algal, green algal, prokaryotic or host origin) are associated with particular KOG annotations, as inferred by chi-squared testing (p&lt;0.05) against a null hypothesis that all KOG families and classes are homogenously distributed across the ancestral HPPG dataset, independent of evolutionary origin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, panel B; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s7">Figure 5—figure supplement 7</xref>; Table S9- sheet 2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Dorrell et al., 2016</xref>]). The notable exceptions are prokaryotic HPPGs being elevated in information storage and processing proteins, particularly those involved in translation, while HPPGs of host origin were enriched in proteins involved in cellular processes and signalling relative to the ancestral HPPG set as a whole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, panel B; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s7">Figure 5—figure supplement 7</xref>; Table S9- sheet 2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Dorrell et al., 2016</xref>]). In contrast, several KOG categories were more highly represented in the ancestral HPPG set than in HPPGs as a whole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, panel B; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s7">Figure 5—figure supplement 7</xref>; Table S9- sheet 2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Dorrell et al., 2016</xref>]).</p><p>A related question is whether proteins that catalyse adjacent steps of a biochemical pathway tend to have shared or different evolutionary affinities. Multiple sets of non-native proteins might be preferentially utilised by ochrophyte plastids due to performing concerted steps in individual metabolic pathways or cellular processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Dorrell and Smith, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Frommolt et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib148">Yurchenko et al., 2016</xref>). In this instance, pairs of proteins that interact with one another would be more likely to come from the same evolutionary origin than would be expected by random association. Alternatively, early ochrophyte plastids might have had no preference for utilising interacting proteins of the same evolutionary origin, in which case proteins involved in specific metabolic pathways might frequently have different evolutionary origins to adjacent enzymes in the same pathway. Of the 313 pairs of such biochemical neighbours identified in the ancestral HPPGs, only 44 shared the same evolutionary origin, which is no different than that which would be expected by chance (expected number 41.05; chi-squared test, p=0.541; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, panel C; Table S9- sheet 3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Dorrell et al., 2016</xref>]), Thus, interactions between proteins of different evolutionary origin were forged early in the evolution of the ochrophyte plastid.</p><p>Finally, we sought correlations between expression dynamics and evolutionary affinity, taking advantage of microarray data from <italic>P. tricornutum</italic> and <italic>T. pseudonana</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Ashworth et al., 2016</xref>) (Table S10- sheets 1–4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Dorrell et al., 2016</xref>]). We found no evidence that ancestral HPPG genes of any evolutionary origin had more similar expression dynamics to each other than to those of other evolutionary origins (ANOVA, p≤0.05; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, panel D; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s8">Figure 5—figure supplements 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s9">9</xref>; Table S10- sheet 5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Dorrell et al., 2016</xref>]). For example, in both species, genes of green origin show a weaker average positive coregulation with one another than they do to genes from the same species of red or of prokaryotic origin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, panel D).

In one case, a bifunctional protein containing an N-terminal 3,4-dihydroxy-2-butanone 4-phosphate (DHBP) synthase and C-terminal GTP cyclohydrolase II protein, which performs two consecutive steps of riboflavin biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Herz et al., 2000</xref>), has formed through the fusion of a cyclohydrolase domain of probable host origin to a synthase domain of probable red algal or actinobacterial origin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">2</xref>). While bifunctional DHBP synthase/ GTP cyclohydrolase proteins are known in bacteria, red algae and plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Matsuzaki et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Herz et al., 2000</xref>), in these taxa the DHBP synthase domain is located at the protein C-terminus; thus, an analogous but topographically distinct fusion protein has evolved in ochrophytes. In a second, previously reported case (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Méheust et al., 2016</xref>), a C-terminal plastid-targeted Tic20 subunit of red algal origin has become fused to an N-terminal EF-hand motif, for which no clear evolutionary outgroup (to an e value of below 1 × 10<sup>−05</sup>) could be found (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>). Thus, the fusion of proteins of different evolutionary origins has generated new functions in the ochrophyte plastid proteome.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4-4"><title>Ancestral and bidirectional origins of dual-targeting in ochrophytes</title><p>Finally, we considered whether the acquisition of the ochrophyte plastid might have also fundamentally altered the biology of the host cell, by contributing proteins to host processes and structures outside the plastid. As an exemplar system, we considered dual-targeting of proteins to plastids and mitochondria, which is known to occur extensively in plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib143">Xu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Duchêne et al., 2005</xref>), and has recently been documented in diatoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Gile et al., 2015</xref>) and in other complex plastid lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Gile et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Hirakawa et al., 2012</xref>). Previous studies have speculated that dual-targeting may arise early in plastid evolution, for example through the retargeting of proteins from the host mitochondria to the plastid, or equally via the adaptation of proteins of plastid origin to the mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Qiu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib143">Xu et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>We indeed identified proteins that appeared to be dual-targeted to the plastid and a secondary organelle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplements 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">6</xref>), which we verified to be the mitochondria using Mitotracker orange (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> panel A). In at least two cases (histidyl- and prolyl-tRNA synthetase) this dual-targeting is a conserved feature, as we identified the same fluorescence patterns both in <italic>P. tricornutum</italic> and using heterologous expression constructs from <italic>G. foliaceum</italic> and <italic>N. gaditana</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, panel A; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>).

To determine how these dual-targeted HPPGs have altered the biology of the host, we searched for gene families corresponding to aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases within the 7140 non-redundant gene families previously identified to be shared across the ochrophytes (Table S8- sheet 1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Dorrell et al., 2016</xref>]). To enable function of the translational machinery, each genome within the ochrophyte cell (i.e., nucleus, mitochondrion, and plastid) requires aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase activity for each amino acid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Gile et al., 2015</xref>); thus, if any class of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase is represented by fewer than three genes, then individual tRNA synthetases must support the biology of multiple organelles through dual-targeting. We identified seven classes of tRNA synthetase for which there were only two gene families in the ochrophyte ancestor, one corresponding to a cytosolic enzyme, and the other to an enzyme that was probably dual-targeted to both the mitochondria and plastid. These include five cases in which the dual-targeted tRNA synthetase was of apparent red algal, i.e., endosymbiont origin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, panel C). Thus, the acquisition of the ochrophyte plastid also altered the biology of the mitochondria, with dual-targeted proteins of endosymbiont origin functionally replacing endogenous mitochondrial-targeted homologues.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Complex evolutionary origins of CASH lineage plastids</title><sec id="s2-5-1"><title>A pelagophyte/dictyochophyte origin of the haptophyte plastid proteome</title><p>We considered whether our dataset provides evidence for any of the other CASH lineage plastids (cryptomonads, haptophytes, or photosynthetic alveolates) originating within the ochrophytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Dorrell and Smith, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib130">Stiller et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib133">Ševčíková et al., 2015</xref>), or evidence for gene transfer from ochrophytes into lineages with complex plastids of green algal origin (chlorarachniophytes and euglenids) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Maruyama et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Archibald et al., 2003</xref>).

Next, we extracted all of the haptophyte plastid-targeted sequences assembled into each ancestral ochrophyte HPPG, performed BLAST top hit analysis (Table S13- sheets 1–3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Dorrell et al., 2016</xref>]), and identified sequences for which the best hit was from the same ochrophyte lineage (diatoms, hypogyristea, or chrysista) as the tree sister group (Table S13- sheet 4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Dorrell et al., 2016</xref>]). We performed separate analyses for query sequences from each of the three haptophyte sub-categories considered in our analysis (pavlovophytes, prymnesiales, or isochrysidales). In each case, at least 50% of the sequences that produced an evolutionarily consistent series of top hits resolved either with the pelagophytes or dictyochophytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s3">Figure 8—figure supplement 3</xref>; Table S13- sheet 4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Dorrell et al., 2016</xref>]). Thus, these proteins originated within an ancestor of the pelagophyte/dictyochophyte lineage.</p><p>We next tested the probable direction of the gene transfer events. We reasoned that if the genes identified within our study had been transferred from an ancestor of pelagophytes and dictyochophytes into the haptophytes, then we should also see a strong secondary signal linking the haptophytes to earlier ancestors of the pelagophyte/dictyochophyte clade, for example the common ancestor of hypogyristea and diatoms. We inspected the secondary BLAST top hits associated with genes shared between haptophytes and hypogyristea (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s4">Figure 8—figure supplement 4</xref>; Table S13- sheet 5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Dorrell et al., 2016</xref>]), and the next deepest sister-groups to haptophyte proteins that are of probable pelagophyte or dictyochophyte origin in each single-gene tree (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s4">Figure 8—figure supplement 4</xref>; Table S4- sheet 2, section 6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Dorrell et al., 2016</xref>]). The majority of haptophyte proteins of hypogyristean origin in single-gene trees (65/100) clearly resolved within a broader HPPG containing multiple ochrophyte lineages, and this bias was corroborated by the specific sister groups associated with each protein as inferred by heat map analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s4">Figure 8—figure supplement 4</xref>, panel A). Moreover, the majority of haptophyte proteins with hypogyristean BLAST top hits, and hypogyristean proteins with haptophyte BLAST top hits (48/86 sequences total) had next best BLAST hits against diatoms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s4">Figure 8—figure supplement 4</xref>, panel B). We additionally tabulated the earliest and latest possible origin points of amino acid residues that were uniquely shared between haptophytes and some but not all ochrophyte lineages, from a dataset of 37 HPPGs for which there was a clear evolutionary affinity between haptophytes and ochrophytes and strict subsequent vertical inheritance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, panel D; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s5">Figure 8—figure supplement 5</xref>; Table S6- sheets 3, 4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Dorrell et al., 2016</xref>]). A greater number of the uniquely shared residues were conserved between the haptophytes and the common ancestor of hypogyristea and diatoms, than were specifically only shared with pelagophyte and dictyochophyte sequences, both per the latest possible origin (139 residues shared with hypogyristea and diatoms; 99 residues with pelagophytes and dictyochophytes; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, panel D; Table S7- sheets 2, 3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Dorrell et al., 2016</xref>]) and per the earliest possible origin (46 residues shared with hypogyristea and diatoms; 41 residues with pelagophytes and dictyochophytes; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s5">Figure 8—figure supplement 5</xref>; Table S7- sheets 2, 3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Dorrell et al., 2016</xref>]). This specifically supports a transfer of plastid-targeted proteins from an ancestor of the pelagophyte/dictyochophyte clade into the haptophytes, rather than the other way around.</p><p>Finally, we tested whether these proteins were likely to have been acquired through an endosymbiotic event. We reasoned that the genes acquired by haptophytes through endosymbiotic events should encode a greater proportion of plastid-targeted proteins than would be observed with genes of alternative origin. We accordingly constructed a dataset of 12,728 non-redundant gene families that were broadly distributed across the haptophytes (Table S14- sheet 1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Dorrell et al., 2016</xref>]), of which 772 were of probable hypogyristean origin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s6">Figure 8—figure supplement 6</xref>; Table S14- sheet 2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Dorrell et al., 2016</xref>]). A significantly larger proportion of the ancestral haptophyte gene families of hypogyristean origin were predicted by ASAFind to be targeted to the plastid than would be expected by random distribution of the data (observed number 43, expected number 22.8, chi-squared p=2.2×10<sup>−05</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, panel E; Table S14- sheet 3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Dorrell et al., 2016</xref>]), consistent with an endosymbiotic origin. Thus, our data support an endosymbiotic uptake of an ancestor of the pelagophytes and dictyochophytes by an ancestor of the haptophytes.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5-2"><title>Phylogenetic discrepancies between the haptophyte plastid proteome and genome</title><p>The transfer of plastid-targeted proteins from the pelagophyte/dictyochophyte clade into the haptophytes is surprising, as previous studies have indicated that the haptophyte plastid genome originates either as a sister-group to the entire ochrophyte lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib130">Stiller et al., 2014</xref>) or to the cryptomonads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Khan et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Le Corguillé et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Muñoz-Gómez et al., 2017</xref> .

Our dataset accordingly provides windows into the evolutionary origins of the ochrophyte plastid lineage. These include evidence for a green algal contribution to ochrophyte plastid evolution and a late acquisition of the ochrophyte plastid following divergence of the ochrophyte lineage from oomycetes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>). Although each of these findings have been previously suggested by studies of whole stramenopile genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Moustafa et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib129">Stiller et al., 2009</xref>) our data represent to our knowledge the first large-scale verification from studies of plastid targeted proteins for both of these important events in the origins of the ochrophyte plastid.The relatively late origin of the ochrophyte plastid is particularly interesting as molecular divergence estimates place the ochrophytes as diverging from the oomycetes no more than 90 million years prior to the radiation of ochrophyte lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Brown and Sorhannus, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Matari and Blair, 2014</xref>). Assuming that these estimates are reliable, our dataset represents some of the earliest proteins to support the ochrophyte plastid following its endosymbiotic uptake. We also provide evidence for widespread mixing of proteins of different evolutionary origin in the ancestral ochrophyte plastid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), including evidence for the formation of new fusion proteins through the recombination of domains of different evolutionary origins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), and a bidirectional interaction between proteins derived from the endosymbiont with proteins from host organelles via dual-targeting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).

Both the host and the endosymbiont are likely to have been evolutionary chimeras, possessing proteins encoded by genes acquired from endosymbiotic and/or lateral gene transfer events. Both host and symbiont are additionally likely to have possessed chimeric proteins, generated through the fusion of genes of different evolutionary origins, and a large number of mitochondrial-, ER- and (in the case of the red endosymbiont) potentially dual-targeted proteins. Following genetic integration of the red endosymbiont with its stramenopile host, the first ochrophytes (<bold>C</bold>) thus possessed a wide range of proteins of plastid function acquired from different sources, with no apparent functional bias in the types of proteins that were retained from different sources.

First, a common ancestor of the pelagophytes and dictyochophytes was taken up by a common ancestor of the haptophytes (point 1), yielding a permanent plastid that contributed genes for a large number of plastid-targeted proteins in extant haptophytes. This plastid was subsequently replaced via serial endosymbiosis (point 2) yielding the current haptophyte plastid and plastid genome. This serial endosymbiosis event either involved a close relative of extant cryptomonads (2A) or a currently unidentified species that forms a sister-group in plastid gene trees to all extant ochrophytes, but is evolutionarily distinct from the pelagophytes (2B).

It remains to be determined whether the in silico prediction facilitated by programmes such as ASAFind and HECTAR are sufficient to enable the identification of all ochrophyte plastid proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Gruber et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Gschloessl et al., 2008</xref>). This is particularly pertinent in the context of dual-targeted proteins, insofar as the dataset of 34 potentially ancestrally dual-targeted proteins identified in this study may not include proteins that are dual-targeted to the plastid and other cellular organelles, such as the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Porter et al., 2015</xref>), cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Pham et al., 2014</xref>), or nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Krause et al., 2012</xref>). We note also that, based on the fluorescence patterns observed with the exemplar proteins within this study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>), ASAFind and HECTAR may identify proteins targeted to the periplastid compartment, as well as to the plastid stroma. While these periplastid and multipartite proteins probably form an important part of plastid physiology, it will be interesting to dissect the specific signals associated with the targeting of proteins to individual sub-compartments within CASH lineage plastids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib135">Tanaka et al., 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Liu et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Another major question concerns the origins of plastid-targeted proteins of green algal origin in ochrophytes. Overall, our data supports the targeting of a significant complement of proteins of chlorophyte origin to the ochrophyte plastid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). It remains to be determined, however, what the exact chlorophyte donor was, and how these genes may have been acquired. It is possible that the green genes were transferred into the ochrophyte lineage via lateral gene transfer, either from a range of different green algal sources or repeatedly from one lineage (for example, a semi-permanent intracellular symbiont [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Dorrell and Howe, 2012a</xref>]), although neither scenario would explain the bias in green algal genes in ochrophyte genomes towards encoding proteins of plastid function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, panel D). An alternative possibility might be a cryptic green algal endosymbiosis in the evolutionary history of the host, as has been previously suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Dorrell and Smith, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Moustafa et al., 2009</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>), or a more convoluted pattern of acquisition. We note, for example, that the green genes identified in our study are not only plastid-targeted across the ochrophytes, but are apparently shared with haptophytes and cryptomonads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10—figure supplement 1</xref>), which would be equally consistent with them having been present in a common ancestor of the CASH lineage plastid, and relocated to each host nuclear lineage following endosymbiosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). Thus, pinpointing the exact nature and timing of the green gene transfer into ochrophytes rests not only on more extensive sequencing of deep-branching chlorophyte lineages, but also on characterising the genome composition of the closest aplastidic relatives of extant ochrophytes (e.g., <italic>Develorapax, Pirsonia</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aleoshin et al., 2016</xref>]), and the closest red algal relative of CASH lineage plastids, which remains unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Dorrell and Smith, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Baurain et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>We also provide evidence for a chimeric origin of the haptophyte plastid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figures 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9</xref>). A schematic outline of these results is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s2">Figure 10—figure supplement 2</xref>. We have shown that a significant number of plastid-targeted proteins found in haptophytes originate from an ancestor of the pelagophytes and dictyochophytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Although it has previously been suggested from studies of nuclear genomes that ochrophyte and haptophyte plastids share a close evolutionary history, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib130">Stiller et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Miller and Delwiche, 2015</xref>) it has not previously been shown robustly that the haptophyte plastid resolves at a specific position internal to the ochrophyte lineage. This data supports findings from other studies (such as a possible origin for the plastids of dinoflagellates and apicomplexans within a member of the PESC clade; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib133">Ševčíková et al., 2015</xref>) that many of the plastids found within CASH lineages are of tertiary or higher endosymbiotic origin. The at least partial pelagophyte/dictyochophyte origin of the haptophyte plastid is supported by multiple lines of evidence- i.e., uniquely shared proteins, single-gene tree topologies, BLAST top hit analysis, and analysis of synapomorphies in multigene alignments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> and supplements). Alongside the bias of haptophyte genes of hypogyristean origin encoding proteins of plastid function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>- panel E), these observations argue against these genes having been acquired through multiple independent lateral gene transfer events, and instead support an endosymbiosis event. We note that other studies have shown strong evidence for gene transfers between haptophytes and individual members of the hypogyristea: for example, Stiller <italic>et al.</italic> have demonstrated a strong enrichment in BLAST top hits against haptophytes, from the genome of the pelagophyte <italic>Aureococcus anophagefferens,</italic> compared to other ochrophyte genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib130">Stiller et al., 2014</xref>). We additionally note that an ancestral gene transfer from a pelagophyte/dictyochophyte ancestor into the haptophytes is a chronologically realistic scenario: molecular clock estimates place the pelagophytes and dictyochophytes diverging between 300 and 700 million years before present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Brown and Sorhannus, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Parfrey et al., 2011</xref>), which broadly overlaps with the molecular dates estimated for the radiation of the haptophytes in the same studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Brown and Sorhannus, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Parfrey et al., 2011</xref>), and precedes the first haptophyte microfossils, identified ca. 220 million years before the present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bown, 1998</xref>).</p><p>Finally, we verify that the evolutionary links between haptophyte and the pelagophyte/dictyochophyte clade in terms of plastid-targeted proteins are not supported by phylogenies of the haptophyte plastid genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Other multigene phylogenies of red lineage plastid genomes have similarly demonstrated that the haptophyte plastid genome instead resolves as a sister-lineage either to cryptomonads or to all ochrophytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib130">Stiller et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Janouskovec et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Khan et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Le Corguillé et al., 2009</xref>). Furthermore, the structure and content of haptophyte and hypogyristean plastid genomes are dissimilar: for example, haptophyte plastids possess an <italic>rpl36</italic> gene that has been laterally acquired from a bacterial donor and is shared with cryptomonad plastids but absent from ochrophytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Rice and Palmer, 2006</xref>), and ochrophyte plastids no longer retain genes encoding the plastid division machinery proteins <italic>minD</italic> and <italic>minE</italic>, which remain plastid-encoded in haptophytes and cryptomonads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">de Vries and Gould, 2017</xref>). Finally, extant haptophyte plastids have comparatively large plastid genomes and possess a conventional quadripartite structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Green, 2011</xref>), whereas sequenced pelagophyte plastids (the harmful coastal species <italic>Aureococcus anophagefferens</italic> and <italic>Aureoumbra lagunensis</italic>, and an uncultured member of the predominantly open ocean genus <italic>Pelagomonas</italic>) all have a reduced coding content compared to other photosynthetic ochrophytes, cryptomonads and haptophytes, and have secondarily lost the plastid inverted repeat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib142">Worden et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Ong et al., 2010</xref>), although it is not yet known whether the plastid genomes of other pelagophyte genera and of dictyochophytes share this reduced structure.</p><p>The discrepancy between the pelagophyte/dictyochophyte origin of the haptophyte plastid proteome and the clear non-ochrophyte origin of its plastid genome might be explained by several different evolutionary scenarios. One possibility would be a serial endosymbiosis event deep in haptophyte evolutionary history, in which an ancient plastid derived from a pelagophyte/dictyochophyte ancestor was acquired by the haptophyte common ancestor, then replaced subsequently by a plastid of non-ochrophyte origin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s2">Figure 10—figure supplement 2</xref>). This discrepancy, alongside others such as the presence of green algal genes in ochrophytes, bolsters the possibility that serial plastid endosymbiosis has been a widespread component of the evolution of CASH lineage plastids other than the dinoflagellates, in which it is a well established phenomenon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Dorrell and Howe, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib145">Yamada et al., 2017</xref>). Verifying this scenario, or its alternatives (such as lateral gene transfer from pelagophyte or dictyochophyte algae into the algal ancestors of the haptophyte plastid) rests on identifying the exact origin of the current haptophyte plastid genome, and in particular demonstrating that the haptophyte plastid genome originates from within (rather than forms a sister-group to) a major lineage of eukaryotic algae other than ochrophytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s2">Figure 10—figure supplement 2</xref>). For this, sequence data from early-diverging members of the cryptomonads and haptophytes will be particularly important (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib144">Yabuki et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Choi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Kim et al., 2011</xref>). It also remains to be determined whether other CASH lineage plastids, such as the peridinin-type plastids found in most photosynthetic alveolates, originate within the ochrophytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib133">Ševčíková et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Dorrell and Howe, 2015</xref>). Similar plastid proteome reconstructions, using bespoke datasets for these species, will be particularly useful in unravelling their disparate evolutionary origins.</p><p>Overall, our dataset provides valuable and deep insights into the chimeric origins and complex fates of a major group of eukaryotic algae. Further studies using more sensitive pipelines, or using analogous datasets from other major CASH lineages, may elucidate the evolutionary and physiological diversification of plastids across the eukaryote tree of life.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Identification of ancestral plastid-targeted ochrophyte proteins</title><p>Ancestral plastid-targeted proteins in ochrophytes were identified via a composite pathway, consisting of in silico prediction, identification of conserved proteins using BLAST, alignment, and single-gene tree building.

All sequences from lineages with a history of secondary endosymbiosis were first removed from the Uniref library in order to avoid the confounding effects of gene transfer from current and former symbionts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib130">Stiller et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib133">Ševčíková et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Maruyama et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Archibald et al., 2003</xref>). The removed lineages included cryptomonads, centrohelids, telonemids, haptophytes, alveolates, rhizaria, euglenids, and plastid-bearing stramenopiles. All of the ochrophyte genome-derived plastid-targeted proteins were searched against one another by BLAST, and proteins that matched one another with an expect score lower than the first outgroup hit (or were retrieved as a stronger match than the outgroup hit if the expected values of both were zero), and thus likely correspond to different proteins within the same monophyletic plastid protein cluster, were merged. Only one protein was retained as the seed sequence for subsequent growth of each cluster: this was defined first via organism (in order of preference: <italic>P. tricornutum, T. pseudonana, P. multiseries, F. cylindrus, S. acus, A. anophageferrens, E. siliculosus, N. gaditana, N. salina, T. oceanica, F. solaris</italic>) and, where more than one protein was available for a given organism, the protein with the lowest BLAST expect value against the corresponding uniref top hit.</p><p>Next, plastid-targeted protein sequences were sought from all available ochrophyte sequence data. A search database was built from all eleven completed ochrophyte genomes, 147 ochrophyte sequence libraries from the Marine Microeukaryote Transcriptome Sequence Project (MMETSP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Keeling et al., 2014</xref>), eleven further ochrophyte transcriptome sequencing projects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Matasci et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Mangot et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Kessenich et al., 2014</xref>) and uniref. Cross-contamination was removed from MMETSP transcriptomes as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Marron et al., 2016</xref>). Briefly, this procedure compares the nucleotide sequences of contigs assembled from each MMETSP library by pairwise BLAST, and defines a separate cross-contamination threshold for each pair of MMETSP libraries based on their distribution of BLAST percent identities. These distributions should each contain a peak centered on the average nucleotide percent identity of transcripts between the two species. In addition, in the presence of cross-contamination, there should be a second peak at 100% identity. The procedure defines the cross-contamination threshold as the minimum between these two peaks; above the threshold, contigs (and the proteins predicted from them) are considered to be potentially cross-contaminated. In total, 2.5% of the MMETSP contigs were discarded through this method. A summary of the number of contigs discarded is provided in Table S1- sheet 2, section 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Dorrell et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Each decontaminated sequence was trimmed at the N-terminus to the first methionine present, and binned into one of eleven different evolutionary categories, based on recent multigene phylogenetic trees for ochrophytes and diatoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Derelle et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib126">Sorhannus and Fox, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib146">Yang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib137">Theriot et al., 2015</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, panel A; Table S1- sheet 1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Dorrell et al., 2016</xref>]). These consisted of: three chrysistan lineages (the ‘PX clade’ of phaeophytes, xanthophytes and related lineages; raphidophytes; and the ‘PESC clade’ of pinguiophytes, eustigmatophytes, synchromophytes, and synurophytes/chrysophytes), three hypogyristean lineages (pelagophytes; dictyochophytes; and bolidophytes), and five diatom lineages (the basally divergent genus <italic>Corethron</italic>; radial centric lineages such as Coscinodiscophytes and Rhizosoleniaceae; the polar centric Thalassiosirales and Skeletonemataceae, which appear to be relatively distantly related to pennate diatoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib126">Sorhannus and Fox, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib137">Theriot et al., 2015</xref>); polar centric lineages such as Odontellids and Chaetocerotales that appear to be more closely related to pennate diatoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib126">Sorhannus and Fox, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib137">Theriot et al., 2015</xref>); and finally all pennate lineages). These binned sequences were then searched for plastid-targeted proteins by ASAFind and HECTAR as before.</p><p>The seed sequences for the resulting non-redundant HPPGs were searched against the enlarged plastid sequence library using BLASTp. Proteins that matched against seed sequences with a lower expect value than the outgroup best hit (or were retrieved as a stronger match than the outgroup hit if the expected values of both were zero), were added to each HPPG. Next, three custom thresholds were defined that were particularly successful in distinguishing probable proteins of true plastid localisation from false positives (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, panel B). For this, conservation patterns were selected that maximised the relative enrichment in proteins with unambiguous plastid functions (i.e., were annotated to function in photosynthesis, to constitute integral parts of the plastid thylakoid or inner membranes, or corresponded to the expression products of genes that are plastid-encoded in red algae but have been apparently relocated to the ochrophyte nucleus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Green, 2011</xref>] or that corresponded to proteins previously verified experimentally to localise to ochrophyte plastids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Gruber et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Gschloessl et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Huesgen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Grouneva et al., 2011</xref>[), and thus should contain relatively fewer examples of mispredicted proteins within the dataset. At the same time, conservation patterns were selected that minimised the number of HPPGs identified as conserved from a negative control dataset (consisting of HPPGs assembled using seed sequences from the published genome sequences of the cryptomonad <italic>Guillardia theta</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Curtis et al., 2012</xref>) or the haptophytes <italic>Emiliania huxleyi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Read et al., 2013</xref>)</italic> and <italic>Chrysochromulina tobin</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Hovde et al., 2015</xref>), and for which no plastid-targeted orthologues were detected in any of the ochrophyte genome sequences used in this study). The thresholds corresponded to: orthologues in a majority (≥2/3) of chrysistan and a majority (≥3/5) of diatom lineages; a majority of chrysistan and a majority (≥2/3) of hypogyristean lineages; and at least one chrysistan, and a majority of both hypogyristean and diatom lineages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><p>All of the HPPGs that passed at least one threshold were extracted, and homology for each HPPG was confirmed individually (Table S4- sheet 1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Dorrell et al., 2016</xref>]). First, each HPPG was aligned using 20 iterations of MUSCLE v8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Edgar, 2004</xref>), followed by the in-built alignment programme integrated into GeneIOUS v 4.76 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Kearse et al., 2012</xref>), under the default criteria. Each HPPG alignment was manually inspected, and proteins that failed to align with the genomic sequences, clearly terminated within the conserved region of the protein, or were truncated at the N-terminus by a length of greater than 50 amino acids (i.e. the approximate length of an ochrophyte plastid-targeting sequence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Gruber et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Huesgen et al., 2013</xref>]) were removed, following which HPPGs that no longer passed the taxonomic criteria defined for conservation were eliminated (Table S4- sheet 1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Dorrell et al., 2016</xref>]). Next, each HPPG was enriched with the sequences for the top 50 hits obtained when the seed sequence was searched against the modified uniref library as detailed above, alongside the single best hit for composite transcriptome and genome libraries constructed for 36 eukaryotic sub-categories (Table S1- sheet 1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Dorrell et al., 2016</xref>]), and realigned against this reference.

Sequences that failed to align were removed, and HPPGs that failed to meet the criteria for conservation following alignment were eliminated (Table S4- sheet 1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Dorrell et al., 2016</xref>]).</p><p>Finally, each HPPG was trimmed at the N- and C-termini to (respectively) the first residue and last residue visually identified to be conserved in &gt;70% of the sequences in the alignment, corresponding to the probable conserved domain of the protein.

Expression of GFP was visualised using a TCS SP8 confocal microscope (Leica, France), an excitation wavelength of 488 nm and emission wavelength interval of c. 510–540 nm. Chlorophyll fluorescence (using an emission interval of 650–700 nm) and bright field images were simultaneously visualised for each cell. Wild-type cells that did not express GFP were used to identify the maximum exposure length possible without false detection of chlorophyll in the GFP channel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s7">Figure 2—figure supplement 7</xref>).</p><p>Possible mitochondrial localisations of dual-targeted proteins were identified by staining cells with approximately 100 mM Mitotracker orange (Thermo), dissolved in filtered seawater, for 25 min under standard culture conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib135">Tanaka et al., 2015a</xref>). Cells were rinsed and resuspended in fresh filtered seawater prior to visualisation, using the same conditions as stated above for GFP, and a 548 nm excitation laser and 575–585 nm absorbance window for the Mitotracker signal. To ensure that there was no possible crosstalk between the two signals, negative controls consisting of an unstained GFP-expressing wild-type line, and stained wild-type cells, were used respectively to determine the maximum exposure length possible without (respectively) false detection of GFP in the Mitotracker channel, and false detection of Mitotracker in the GFP channel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Reconstruction of evolutionary origins of ancestral plastid-targeted proteins</title><p>The most probable evolutionary origins of individual plastid-targeted proteins were identified via the combined products of BLAST top hit analysis and phylogenetic sister-group inference. First, a composite reference sequence library was generated by appending the uniref outgroup library previously used for BLAST-based assembly of ancestral HPPGs, with twenty-two combined eukaryotic transcriptome and genomic libraries of taxa with no suspected history of serial endosymbiosis, which was previously used to enrich each single-gene tree (Table S1- sheet 1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Dorrell et al., 2016</xref>]). Each sequence within the library was then assigned a taxonomic affinity consisting of one of six lineages (green algae, red algae, aplastidic stramenopiles, all other eukaryotes, prokaryotes, and viruses) and one of 48 sub-categories, (Table S1- sheet 1, section 1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Dorrell et al., 2016</xref>]). Next, each seed protein sequence within each ancestral HPPG was searched by BLASTp against the composite library, with a threshold e-value of 1 × 10<sup>−05</sup>. Sequences were annotated by the lineage and sub-category of the first hit obtained, and by the number of consecutive top hits obtained within the same lineage (Table S4- sheet 2, section 2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Dorrell et al., 2016</xref>]). To minimise misidentification due to any residual contamination in individual sequence libraries, only sequences for which the first three or more BLAST hits resolved within the same lineage were deemed to be unambiguously related to that lineage.</p><p>Sister-group relationships were additionally inferred for each ancestral HPPG from the previously generated single-gene trees (Table S4- sheet 2, section 3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Dorrell et al., 2016</xref>]). To ensure that only true sister-group relationships were recorded, and to avoid potential misidentifications of individual sister-group relationships due to species-specific gene transfer or contaminants that had not previously been excluded by screening individual species libraries, only trees in which ochrophytes were monophyletic, (i.e., not paraphyletic with regard to any one of the five outgroups), for which a single sister-group could be identified (using the most phylogenetically complex node as the outgroup), and for which the sister-group contained at least two monophyletic or paraphyletic sequences, from different sub-categories of the same lineage, were used for subsequent analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Reconstruction of evolutionary relationships between ochrophytes and other CASH lineage plastids</title><p>To identify the probable relationships between ochrophytes and other CASH lineage plastids, each ancestral HPPG tree was enriched with sequences from six different groups of organisms with histories of serial endosymbiosis (cryptomonads, haptophytes, dinotoms, other alveolates, euglenids, and chlorarachniophytes), subdivided into thirteen sub-categories (Table S1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Dorrell et al., 2016</xref>]). For the cryptomonad, haptophyte and dinotom sequences, as plastid-targeted proteins from these lineages may be identified using targeting predictors trained on diatoms such as HECTAR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aleoshin et al., 2016</xref>) and ASAFind (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Gruber et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Gschloessl et al., 2008</xref>), each of the HPPGs initially generated was enriched with plastid-targeted sequences from each cryptomonad, haptophyte and dinotom sub-category identified by in silico prediction with these programmes (Table S2- sheet 1; Table S3- sheet 1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Dorrell et al., 2016</xref>]).</p><p>The position of each group of organisms within the tree was then annotated as falling into one of eight different categories, four of which were internal to the ochrophytes (diatoms; hypogyristea; chrysista; or an ambiguous internal position) and four of which were external to the ochrophytes (as an immediate sister-group to all ochrophytes prior to the first outgroup lineage previously identified; within the red algae; within the green algae; and at any other position external to the ochrophytes; Table S4- sheet 2, sections 5–6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Dorrell et al., 2016</xref>]). To minimise the incorporation of contaminant and non-plastid sequences, tree positions were only recorded if the branch containing sequences from that particular lineage included at least two of the sub-categories considered (for alveolates, cryptomonads, and haptophytes), contained at least one predicted plastid-targeted sequence (for dinotoms, cryptomonads and haptophytes), and for which only one category could be applied (i.e., the tree only contained one evolutionarily distinct group for each lineage, which could be unambiguously allocated one category over all others). Each tree annotation was repeated three times independently, and only tree annotations that were recorded consistently in each case were retained for further analysis.</p><p>To identify plastid-targeted proteins that were uniquely shared between haptophytes and other lineages, every HPPG initially generated was screened for the inclusion of only two of five different lineages (diatoms including dinotoms, hypogyristea, chrysista, haptophytes, and cryptomonads; Table S2- sheet 2, section 3; Table S3- sheet 2, section 3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Dorrell et al., 2016</xref>]). The frequencies of these proteins were then compared to the numbers expected in a random distribution of all uniquely shared HPPGs across the entire dataset: for example, if half of all uniquely shared HPPGs were shared with diatoms and one other lineage, and half were shared with haptophytes and one other lineage, then one-quarter of all uniquely shared HPPGs should be shared between haptophytes and diatoms. The expected numbers were corrected to take account of the expected frequencies calculated through this approach to be uniquely shared within one lineage only: for example, in the above case, one-quarter of the expected frequency would be allocated to HPPGs uniquely present in diatoms; to correct for this, all remaining expected frequencies of uniquely shared HPPGs would therefore be multiplied by four-thirds (i.e. one-third of all uniquely shared HPPGs should be shared between haptophytes and diatoms).</p><p>The specific evolutionary relationships associated with haptophyte plastid-targeted proteins incorporated into ancestral HPPGs were investigated using a modified BLAST top hit technique. Firstly, all of the plastid-targeted proteins assembled into each ancestral HPPG were extracted and separated into each separate sub-category (Table S13- sheet 1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Dorrell et al., 2016</xref>]). Each sub-category list was then reduced to only leave one, randomly selected sequence per HPPG (Table S13- sheet 2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Dorrell et al., 2016</xref>]). Finally, each sequence retained in the reduced list was searched by BLAST against a composite library, consisting of the library previously used for outgroup top hit analysis, enriched with all of the plastid-targeted proteins identified for ochrophytes, haptophytes and cryptomonads, except for those that corresponded to the same particular lineage as the query sequence (Table S13- sheets 1,3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Dorrell et al., 2016</xref>]). For example, in the case of haptophytes, plastid-targeted sequences that had been separated into three individual categories (pavlovophytes, prymnesiales, and isochrysidales [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Simon et al., 2013</xref>]) were searched against a composite library consisting of all outgroup sequences, and plastid-targeted sequences from diatoms, hypogyristea, chrysista, and cryptomonads, but excluding haptophytes. BLAST top hit analysis was then performed as described above (Table S13- sheets 1, 3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Dorrell et al., 2016</xref>]). Finally, to enable the identification of genes with consistent results from multiple analyses, the lineage of the BLAST top hit was compared to the lineage of the haptophyte sister-group in the single-gene tree analysis (Table S4- sheet 2, section 5; Table S13- sheet 4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Dorrell et al., 2016</xref>]).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Identification of uniquely shared residues in multigene HPPG datasets</title><p>To identify residues that are uniquely shared between ochrophytes and other lineages, multigene datasets were constructed of a) ancestral HPPGs of green algal origin, and b) ancestral HPPGs for which haptophytes show origins within the ochrophytes. To minimise the incorporation of sequences of misidentified origin, in each case only the HPPGs for which the proposed evolutionary origin were identified both by BLAST top hit and single-gene tree analysis were included. To avoid introducing artifacts due to lineage-specific gene transfers, paralogy events, or other phylogenetic incongruencies that could otherwise bias the eventual results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Qiu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Leigh et al., 2008</xref>), the single-gene tree generated for each HPPG was manually inspected to exclude any that contain multiple clades (defined as monophyletic groups containing more than one sequence from a particular lineage, separated from one another by at least two sequences from outside that particular lineage) for each of the major lineages of interest within the tree:</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>For the green gene dataset, HPPG trees containing more than one clade of ochrophyte, cryptomonad, haptophyte, red algal, or green algal sequences were excluded.

First, each sequence was searched against a composite library containing all uniref, jgi and MMETSP sequences from every lineage within the tree of life, and the top ten hits were tabulated for each sequence. In each case, only sequences for which at least the first three hits were of the same lineage as that of the query were retained. For the haptophyte multigene alignment, the ochrophytes were separately analysed as each of the three component lineages (chrysista, hypogyristea, and diatoms), which is to say that a query obtained from a member of the hypogyristea would only be retained if the first three BLAST top hits originated from other hypogyristean sequences, rather than other ochrophytes.</p><p>Next, each of the component sequences within each cleaned alignment were searched against all other component sequences within the same alignment using BLASTp, and the top ten hits within the alignment were ranked. In each case, sequences were only approved for incorporation into the multigene dataset if the first non-self hit was to a different sub-category within the same lineage, e.g. if a query sequence from a red alga yielded a top hit against a red algal sequence from a different red sub-category. To allow for possible cases of paraphyly and/or absence of sequences within each alignment, the following modifications were applied:</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Green algal sequences within the confirmed green origin alignments were allowed to yield top hits against ochrophytes, cryptomonads, and haptophytes, but were required to yield a best hit against another green alga with an expect value lower than the top hit against red algal or glaucophyte sequences.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Glaucophyte sequences were deemed to be of correct origin if they yielded a top hit against cyanobacteria, red algae, or green algae, due to the incorporation (in general) of only one glaucophyte sequence in each alignment.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Ochrophyte sequences were deemed to be of correct origin if they yielded a top hit against any other ochrophyte sub-category (regardless of whether this was of diatom, hypogyristean or chrysistan origin).

Briefly, residues were inferred to be uniquely shared between ochrophytes and green algae if they were present in at least 2/3 of the ungapped ochrophyte sequences, one or more green algal sequence, and if none of the red algal or glaucophyte sequences shared the residue in question, but at least one of these sequences had a non-matching (i.e. non-gapped) residue at that position (Table S7- sheet 1, section 2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Dorrell et al., 2016</xref>]).

A second analysis was additionally performed in which all gapped residues were deemed to be matching, to identify the earliest possible origin point for each uniquely shared residue, taking into account secondary loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Ku et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Qiu et al., 2015</xref>) and absence of sequences from each alignment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib140">Woehle et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Deschamps and Moreira, 2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Analysis of targeting preferences of ancestral ochrophyte and haptophyte genes</title><p>Two libraries of non-redundant gene families that were broadly conserved across ochrophytes or haptophytes, and thus might represent gene products of the ancestral genomes of these lineages, were generated using a similar BLAST-based assembly pipeline as used to construct HPPGs (Table S8; Table S14 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Dorrell et al., 2016</xref>]).

Each concatenated alignment was trimmed using trimal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Capella-Gutiérrez et al., 2009</xref>) using the -gt 0.8 option.</p><p>Single-gene alignments for four plastid-targeted proteins predicted to be of polyphyletic origin in ochrophytes (3-dehydroquinate synthase, isopropylmalate dehydratase, sedoheptulose bisphosphatase, and shikimate kinase) were generated using a similar BLAST-based assembly and alignment pipeline as used to verify ancestral plastid-targeted proteins. In this case, all non-redundant (as inferred by BLAST top hit evalue) plastid-targeted sequences for each protein identified from ochrophyte genomes were used as independent queries for the identification of plastid-targeted orthologues, 50 uniref top hits, and top hits from the combined MMETSP and genomic libraries from 36 eukaryotic sub-categories, as before. HPPGs were independently generated, aligned and trimmed for each seed sequence; all HPPGs generated for each protein were then merged, realigned and retrimmed using trimAl to generate a single-gene alignment. Single-gene alignments for each of the constituent genes in each concatenated plastid genome tree were generated by splitting the alignment into its component genes. All alignments have been made publically accessible through the University of Cambridge dSpace server (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/handle/1810/261421">https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/handle/1810/261421</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Dorrell et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Trees were inferred for each concatenated and exemplar single-gene alignment (Table S15- sheet 2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Dorrell et al., 2016</xref>]) using the MrBayes and RAxML programmes in-built into the CIPRES web-server (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib127">Stamatakis, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Miller et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Ronquist et al., 2012</xref>). Bayesian trees were inferred using three substitution models (GTR, Jones, and WAG), a minimum of 600000 generations, and an initial burn-in discard value of 0.5. Trees were only utilised if the final convergence statistic between the two chains run was ≤0.1, and tree calculation was automatically stopped if the convergence statistic fell below 0.01. RAxML trees were inferred using three substitution models (GTR, JTT, and WAG) with automatic bootstopping, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Dorrell et al., 2017</xref>). The best tree topology for each RAxML tree was inferred, and bootstrapping was performed using a burnin value of 0.03. Alternative tree topologies were tested for the RAxML + JTT tree inferred from each concatenated alignment using CONSEL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">Shimodaira and Hasegawa, 2001</xref>), under the default conditions. Tree outputs have been made publically accessible through the University of Cambridge dSpace server (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/handle/1810/261421">https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/handle/1810/261421</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Dorrell et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Modified alignments were generated for both of the plastid concatenated multigene datasets from which individual clades of organisms (diatoms, hypogyristea, chrysista, haptophytes, cryptomonads, red algae, and different combinations of green algae) had been removed (Table S15- sheet 2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Dorrell et al., 2016</xref>]). Fast-site removal was performed using TIGER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Cummins and McInerney, 2011</xref>). Site rate evolution characteristics were calculated for each alignment using the -b 100 option, and modified alignments were constructed from which the rate categories corresponding to the fastest evolving 40–50% of sites were serially removed (Table S15- sheet 2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Dorrell et al., 2016</xref>]). Amino acid composition for each plastid alignment were calculated, and two modified alignments were generated from which glycines (which in all alignments occur at significantly lower frequencies in ochrophytes than in haptophytes or cryptomonads; chi-squared, p≤0.05; Table S16- sheet 3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Dorrell et al., 2016</xref>]), and from which seven amino acids (alanine, aspartate, glycine, histidine, leucine, asparagine, threonine and valine) which were found in at least one alignment to occur at significantly different frequencies in ochrophytes compared to haptophytes or to cryptomonads (p≤0.05; Table S16- sheet 3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Dorrell et al., 2016</xref>]) had been removed.

For the taxon-rich alignment, to take into account gaps and missing characters, residues were tabulated if they were found in a majority of haptophyte sequences, and one other lineage, as before (Table S17- sheet 2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Dorrell et al., 2016</xref>]). The total number of residues shared, and uniquely shared, with each non-haptophyte species and lineage are respectively tabulated in Table S17, sheets 3 and 4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Dorrell et al., 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Data deposition</title><p>All supporting datasets for this study, including supplementary tables predicted plastid-targeted and dual-targeted protein libraries, single gene and multigene alignments, and tree outputs, have been made publically and freely accessible through the University of Cambridge dSpace server (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/handle/1810/261421">https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/handle/1810/261421</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Dorrell et al., 2016</xref>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors would like to thank Achal Rastogi (École Normale Supérieure), Neal Clarke (Yale University), Michael Melkonian (University of Koln), Gane Ka-Shu Wong (University of Alberta) and Jun Yu (Beijing Institute of Genomics) for early access to sequence data used in this study, and Catherine Cantrel, Anne-Flore Deton-Cabanillas, Zhanru Shao, Leïla Tirichine and Javier Paz-Yepes (École Normale Supérieure) for assistance with generation of transgenic expression constructs for <italic>Phaeodactylum tricornutum</italic>.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Diethard Tautz as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Dorrell et al. use combination of genomic and cell biology methods to study the origin and evolution of the plastid proteome in a key group of phytoplankton and protists (i.e., both photosynthetic and aplastidial) that comprise the so-called CASH lineage (photosynthetic members of the cryptomonads, alveolates, stramenopiles, and haptophytes). These taxa are major contributors to oceanic primary production and have a 'checkered past' with respect to how scientists have explained the origin and spread of their plastids through endosymbiosis. Many questions remain about how many endosymbioses explain the origin of CASH plastids and if some lineages have undergone cryptic endosymbioses involving other algae. These latter events leave putative genetic 'footprints' in the nuclear genome that is explained by ancient endosymbiotic gene transfer (EGT). With the arrival of the most recent plastid of a different phylogenetic origin, a subsequent round of EGT is initiated. Therefore, CASH genomes have complex evolutionary histories.</p><p>Specifically, the authors explored the question: which nuclear-encoded plastid-targeted proteins have had the most fundamental roles in plastid establishment? Briefly, they developed an in silico pipeline to characterize the ancestral ochrophyte (photosynthetic stramenopiles) plastid-targeted proteins from 11 ochrophyte genomes and 157 ochrophyte transcriptomes, and verified plastid localization for a few unusual candidate proteins experimentally through GFP fusion constructs. Then, they used the list of presumptive ancestral ochrophyte plastid-targeted proteins to reconstruct metabolic pathways in the ancestral ochrophyte plastid, determined the phylogenetic origins of these plastid-targeted proteins, deduced a late acquisition of the ochrophyte plastid (i.e., independent from other CASH lineages), found support for the previously observed (but debated) green lineage contribution to the ochrophyte plastid proteome, correlated metabolic functions of proteins to their phylogenetic origins, identified phylogenetically chimeric plastid-targeted proteins, explored plastid/mitochondrion interactions in the ochrophytes (including dual-targeting), and observed a strong pelagophyte contribution to the haptophyte plastid proteome which they interpret as remnants from a preceding pelagophyte endosymbiont/plastid. Both reviewers felt that, whereas this comprehensive collection of data and analyses had great merit in explaining key transitions in plastid evolution, that in its current form, the manuscript did not adequately describe some aspects of the work. Improving the focus and clarity, particularly in respect to figures, are critical for anyone from outside the field to understand this good but very complex manuscript.</p><p>These shortcomings are listed below.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Focus: The authors should focus the text to make it clearer for the reader to understand. Emphasis statements are needed so that the reader can evaluate the significance of a piece of information over another. Well-supported sections are interspersed with those that are weak and the authors jump between evolution and metabolism several times, which is quite confusing. For example, the first paragraph in the second section of Results and all of section 4 in the Results are relatively less interesting. Dual-targeting is neither novel nor fundamentally relevant to the scope of this paper, despite the value of the work that was done. Other examples are the first section of results of <italic>rpl36</italic>, which is inconclusive and cannot reject with confidence the possibility of contamination in the data.</p><p>Paper title: A very general and rather unclear title. Perhaps the term &quot;ochrophytes&quot; should be used and the latter part deleted – the authors do not address the fate of other complex plastids except for those in haptophytes, which is a small section of the paper and one that is intimately linked to ochrophytes.</p><p>Concatenated datasets (nuclear): This referee was skeptical about concatenating single gene trees with &quot;similar&quot; signals, such as &quot;green&quot; and &quot;red&quot; trees (subsection “A significant green algal contribution to ochrophyte plastid evolution”, third paragraph) and haptophyte genes (see below). The evolutionary signal in nuclear plastid-targeted genes is notoriously complex. This is one reason why one has to be stringent when it comes to selecting genes that are interpretable in this context. By concatenation, the assumption is that the topologies are congruent across all genes. This is unlikely and if it is the case then tests for topology congruence should be done, also using manual inspection of the data.</p><p>Contamination: First, the fact that this was done should be more clearly presented (in Results) because the extent of contamination is quite serious, particularly in MMETSP. Second, removing 100% identical pairwise hits is not stringent enough, strictly speaking. No mismatches above 95% or 97% should be used when comparing distantly related groups (this would not work for closely related species) because errors and un-removed sequencing adapters often show up as differences. Also, the screen for contaminations should ideally have been done at the nucleotide level. The authors do not need to redo the analysis, however it is important that it is clearly stated in the text that further controls downstream (e.g., careful manual evaluation of each single tree) would have identified any remaining contamination and not bias the results.</p><p>Cryptic endosymbioses: The foreign gene signals (green prasinophyte and haptophyte/pelagophyte) that were identified are likely to be genuine. These results are viewed as being most consistent with cryptic endosymbioses, which is controversial primarily because the assumptions rely on weakly supported precedents (extent of EGT in secondary endosymbiosis) or assumptions where essentially no evidence exists (e.g., strong HGT from a single source is unlikely). Therefore, please keep the discussion about cryptic endosymbioses as provisional.</p><p>Figures and figure references: The figure references are unclear and not in a uniform format.

We have restricted the functional analysis to techniques where we have experimental confirmation (dual-targeting), parallel data from multiple species (coregulation of different evolutionary categories of plastid genes), or particularly clear or striking evidence of differences between datasets (e.g. ochrophyte-specific fusion proteins, and multiple differences in the proportions of different KOG annotations in the ancestral HPPG dataset versus the full dataset). We have excluded discussions of GO annotations (which are dependent on rather small effective sample sizes), coregulation of Phaeodactylum genes to the mitochondrial genome (as this is based on data from only one species), and phylogenies of genes with predicted overlapping functions (which really requires experimental validation of the expression dynamics and kinetics of each gene family) from the revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>Dual targeting is neither novel nor fundamentally relevant to the scope of this paper, despite the value of the work that was done.</italic></p><p>We feel that dual-targeting provides valuable insights into plastid establishment. The incoming plastid proteome clearly acquires proteins from various genetic sources, but did it also modify the proteome of other organelles? In our opinion both perspectives are essential for a holistic view of plastid establishment. We have clarified this directly in the text that the aim of this section is to assess &quot;whether the acquisition of the ochrophyte plastid might have also fundamentally altered the biology of the host cell&quot;. As we are purely presenting this as an evolutionary, rather than functional, question we have removed all discussion of protein function (e.g. KOG annotation) from this section.</p><p><italic>Other examples are the first section of results of rpl36, which is inconclusive and cannot reject with confidence the possibility of contamination in the data.</italic></p><p>Indeed, because the <italic>rpl36</italic> data that we presented is merely confirmatory to the results presented by Rice and Palmer in 2006 (i.e. we can find no additional conclusive evidence that any ochrophyte plastid genome contains a haptophyte-type <italic>rpl36</italic> gene), and because we cannot be sure that the <italic>rpl36</italic> sequences present in MMETSP are of plastome origin (as opposed to being from bacterial contaminants in each library), we have removed <italic>rpl36</italic> from the Results section. We have chosen instead to briefly state in the Discussion that the data presented by Rice and Palmer confirms the dissimilarity of ochrophyte and haptophyte plastid genomes, alongside other previously published synapomorphies and differences that support the results in this study (Discussion, fifth paragraph).</p><p><italic>Paper title: A very general and rather unclear title. Perhaps the term &quot;ochrophytes&quot; should be used and the latter part deleted – the authors do not address the fate of other complex plastids except for those in haptophytes, which is a small section of the paper and one that is intimately linked to ochrophytes.</italic></p><p>We have accordingly modified the title to &quot;chimeric origins of ochrophytes and haptophytes revealed through an ancient plastid proteome&quot;, which places the focus on lineages explored.</p><p><italic>Concatenated datasets (nuclear): This referee was skeptical about concatenating single gene trees with &quot;similar&quot; signals, such as &quot;green&quot; and &quot;red&quot; trees (subsection “A significant green algal contribution to ochrophyte plastid evolution”, third paragraph) and haptophyte genes (see below). The evolutionary signal in nuclear plastid-targeted genes is notoriously complex. This is one reason why one has to be stringent when it comes to selecting genes that are interpretable in this context. By concatenation, the assumption is that the topologies are congruent across all genes. This is unlikely and if it is the case then tests for topology congruence should be done, also using manual inspection of the data.</italic></p><p>We have removed both the concatenated analyses from the manuscript. Instead, to place the evolutionary origins of the green genes in ochrophytes, and the ochrophyte genes in haptophytes in a broader phylogenetic context, we perform two additional analyses that resolve the deeper phylogenetic affinities of each set of genes without reliance on concatenated analysis. These analyses have been designed to overcome the limitations of reliance on individual gene trees and BLAST top hits to recover evolutionary origins – namely that the signal from individual gene trees is likely to be unreliable and biased by instances of secondary gene loss and lateral gene transfer, and without profiling the deeper phylogenetic affinities associated with each sister-group relationship it is not possible to determine the directions in which each gene transfer occurred.</p><p>First, we compare the specific sister-groups associated with the ochrophyte genes of green origin, and the haptophyte genes of ochrophyte origin to published phylogenies of green algae (Leliaert et al. 2011) and ochrophytes (the topology presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). We present these data as heatmap analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2</xref>) with overviews within the main text (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, panel C; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, panel C). These analyses clearly support an origin for the ochrophyte green genes within the chlorophytes (rather than as a sister to all green genes), and for the haptophyte proteins with the pelagophyte/dictyochophyte clade. We additionally verify this latter position via a combined BLAST and tree sister-group analysis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s3">Figure 8—figure supplement 3</xref>, and have revised the text surrounding this accordingly.</p><p>We additionally present an analysis of residues that are uniquely shared between ochrophytes and green algae, and between haptophytes and ochrophytes, in a new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, panel D, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, panel D, and Table S7). These analyses carry advantages over concatenated trees in that they neither require congruence in unrelated branches within the tree (as they trace the evolutionary relationships between two groups only, rather than considering global relationships between multiple groups), nor do they seek to ascribe a single origin point for a particular transfer (but rather tests whether multiple transfer events from different lineages have occurred). To avoid any possible artifacts within the analysis resulting from lateral gene transfer, paralogy or contamination, we have erected &quot;best sets&quot; consisting of 32 ochrophyte proteins of green origin, and 37 haptophyte proteins of ochrophyte origin that appear to have been subsequently entirely vertically inherited by all major groups of eukaryotic algae considered. We additionally clean each dataset of any residual contamination using a compound BLAST pipeline, where we profile the evolutionary affinities of each sequence within the alignment to a complete uniref + MMETSP database, and to every other sequence in the alignment. We present both these analyses, and the rationale for employing them, in a new section in the Materials and methods (&quot;Identification of uniquely shared residues in multigene HPPG alignments&quot;), and a new supplementary Table S6.</p><p>The analyses of uniquely shared residues clearly demonstrate that the majority of the green signal in ochrophytes is from an ancestral lineage within the chlorophytes (as opposed to resulting from multiple gene transfer events from individual green lineages), and that there has been a transfer of proteins from the ochrophytes into the haptophytes (as the majority of the uniquely shared residues detected are found in pelagophytes, dictyochophytes and diatoms, hence originated in a common ancestor of this lineage and were then transferred into haptophytes, rather than originating in haptophytes and being transferred later into pelagophytes and dictyochophytes).</p><p><italic>Contamination: First, the fact that this was done should be more clearly presented (in Results) because the extent of contamination is quite serious, particularly in MMETSP.</italic></p><p>We have revised the manuscript to state the manifold ways in which contamination has been removed, e.g. in the initial evolutionary analysis &quot;To minimise misidentification due to any residual contamination in individual sequence libraries, only sequences for which the first three or more BLAST hits resolved within the same lineage were deemed to be unambiguously related to that lineage&quot;.</p><p><italic>Second, removing 100% identical pairwise hits is not stringent enough, strictly speaking.

We note that repeated lateral gene transfer from a single source, while explaining the phylogenetic congruence of the gene transfers, would not necessarily explain the bias in transferred genes towards encoding proteins of plastid function, and have noted this in the Discussion (third paragraph). We have also by the same logic discussed the possibility of a chimeric endosymbiont (e.g. a red alga containing genes of green algal origin), which would be another equally plausible explanation to the data observed other than cryptic endosymbiosis.</p><p><italic>Figures and figure references: The figure references are unclear and not in a uniform format.
