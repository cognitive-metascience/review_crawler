What is missing is how these different domains of motor control become coordinated over the course of development. We investigated how postural-locomotor behaviors may influence vocal development, and the role played by physiological arousal during their interactions. Using infant marmoset monkeys, we densely sampled vocal, postural and locomotor behaviors and estimated arousal fluctuations from electrocardiographic measures of heart rate. We found that vocalizations matured sooner than postural and locomotor skills, and that vocal-locomotor coordination improved with age and during elevated arousal levels. These results suggest that postural-locomotor maturity is not required for vocal development to occur, and that infants gradually improve coordination between vocalizations and body movement through a process that may be facilitated by arousal level changes.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>marmoset monkey</kwd><kwd>vocal ontogeny</kwd><kwd>energetics</kwd><kwd>motor development</kwd><kwd>locomotion</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32 MH065214</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gustison</surname><given-names>Morgan L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 NS054898</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ghazanfar</surname><given-names>Asif A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Borjon</surname><given-names>Jeremy I</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Marmoset monkeys develop their vocal behavior prior to their postural and locomotor skills, but the coordination of these two motor systems emerges gradually via changes in arousal level.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Vocal development is typically thought of as the adaptive coordination of the vocal apparatus (i.e., the lungs, larynx and the mouth) and the associated muscles and neural systems that influence its activity. In adult animals, however, vocal behavior does not occur in isolation of the operations of other motor systems. Studies investigating the real-time coordination between vocal and locomotor outputs show that some vocalizations can be produced concurrently with locomotor activity and/or postural changes, while others cannot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Suthers et al., 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Blumberg, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fusani et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Williams, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wong and Waters, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Holderied and von Helversen, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Branchi et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cooper and Goller, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Berg et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dalziell et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hoepfner and Goller, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ota et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Alves et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Laplagne and Elías Costa, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Ullrich et al., 2016</xref>). For example, the ‘A’, ‘B’ and ‘D’ song types of the lyrebird (<italic>Menura novaehollandiae</italic>) co-occur with courtship dance wing flaps, while the ‘C’ type occurs when wings are still (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dalziell et al., 2013</xref>). In rats (<italic>Rattus norvegicus</italic>), 50 kHz ultrasonic vocalizations are produced during locomotor activity, while 20 kHz vocalizations occur when rats are immobile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Laplagne and Elías Costa, 2016</xref>). Similarly, bats in flight coordinate the production of echolocation sounds with particular phases of their wing beats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Suthers et al., 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wong and Waters, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Holderied and von Helversen, 2003</xref>). Thus, the adaptive coordination achieved during vocal development must also include other developing motor systems as important factors, notably those related to posture and locomotion. How this ‘vocal-locomotor’ coordination is accomplished over the course of development is not well understood.</p><p>In humans, current theoretical frameworks posit that the different motor systems are interactive over the course of development; one system can influence another in ways that change as a function of time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Thelen, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adolph, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Iverson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Adolph and Robinson, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Libertus and Hauf, 2017</xref>). In support of this, there is evidence that locomotor skills at one time point predict speech ability months or even years later (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">LeBarton and Iverson, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Walle and Campos, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Wang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">He et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">LeBarton and Iverson, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Libertus and Violi, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Walle, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Garrido et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Libertus and Hauf, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Salavati et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">West et al., 2019</xref>). However, only a handful of empirical studies investigated human infant vocal-locomotor coordination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ejiri and Masataka, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fagan and Iverson, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abney et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Berger et al., 2017</xref>). These studies showed that infant production of pre-linguistic vocalization is highly sensitive to body movement. For example, infants who are beginning to transverse their environment (i.e., crawling) are less likely to vocalize during locomotion than while they are sitting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ejiri and Masataka, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fagan and Iverson, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abney et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Berger et al., 2017</xref>). What is missing is an understanding of <italic>how</italic> vocal and locomotor outputs are coordinated in real-time in infants and how this coordination may change over the course of development.</p><p>Key to understanding these developmental dynamics is to also identify physiological conditions that may promote (or potentially inhibit) coordination between different motor outputs. One candidate is the state of arousal, a product of the autonomic nervous system and relevant for a range of behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pfaff, 2006</xref>). An animal would be said to exhibit a high arousal state if it is more alert to sensory stimuli, more motorically active and more reactive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pfaff, 2006</xref>). The role of arousal is essentially to allocate metabolic energy (i.e., to prepare the body for action). As it relates to vocal production, arousal modulates respiration, which in turn provides the power for vocal output. Humans, for example, exhibit an increase in arousal--as measured by heart rate--prior to speaking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lynch et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Linden, 1987</xref>). In developing individuals, variable and spontaneous behaviors are ubiquitous, providing the scaffolding for more complex and organized behaviors later in life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Blumberg et al., 2013</xref>). These early behaviors, including vocal output and other bodily movements, primarily reflect the interplay between the infants’ arousal states, sensorimotor coordination and biomechanical conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Robinson et al., 2000</xref>). Thus, investigating the relationship between arousal fluctuations and the development of vocal and locomotor behaviors may prove to be illuminating.</p><p>Using marmoset monkeys as a model, here we investigate the relationship between vocal and locomotor systems and arousal levels during postnatal development. In the vocal domain, infant marmosets spontaneously produce sequences of immature and mature vocalizations, and these are linked to real-time changes in arousal levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Zhang and Ghazanfar, 2016</xref>). Over the course of approximately two months, infants exhibit changes in the acoustic properties of their vocalizations that reflect a transition from producing mostly immature-sounding contact calls (e.g., cries) to mature-sounding contact calls (e.g., phees) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Takahashi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Zhang and Ghazanfar, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Teramoto et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Zhang and Ghazanfar, 2018</xref>). As in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Goldstein and Ja, 2008</xref>), this transition is facilitated by, and dependent upon, social reinforcement from parents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Takahashi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gultekin and Hage, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Takahashi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gultekin and Hage, 2018</xref>). Moreover, these parallels with human prelinguistic development occur in the same life history stage (early infancy) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ghazanfar and Liao, 2018</xref>). In the postural and locomotor domains, marmoset monkey development transitions from immature to mature forms in a pattern that is also similar to human development (e.g., righting reflex before sitting, and crawling before walking) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Wang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Braun et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Schultz-Darken et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>We address three fundamental questions: (1) Does one motor system – vocal or postural-locomotor – mature first or do they follow an overlapping trajectory? (2) How are vocal-postural-locomotor systems coordinated and do these coordination dynamics shift across development? (3) How do real-time fluctuations in arousal relate to vocal production, locomotion and their coordination?</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>During their first two months of postnatal life, we measured infant marmoset behavior in a controlled context for 10 minutes approximately every 2 days. In each session, individuals were placed in a testing box in an experiment room that was outside visual and auditory range of their family groups. This brief ‘isolation’ context is a standard testing paradigm used to elicit vocalizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Takahashi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Zhang and Ghazanfar, 2016</xref>) and to study the postures and locomotion of marmoset infants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Wang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Braun et al., 2015</xref>).

Values below 0.5 indicate that immature behavior is more common, and values above 0.5 indicate that mature behavior is more common. The population-level developmental trajectories of all three motor systems (vocal = 192 observation days, postural = 201 observation days, locomotor = 191 observation days) followed <italic>s</italic>-shape patterns that ended in maturity indices around one, which represents adult-like motor outputs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).</p><p>We tested whether the developmental time courses of the vocal system and postural-locomotor systems overlap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). The null hypothesis is that vocal and postural-locomotor systems transition from immature to mature forms around the same time. This would suggest that the development of the different motor systems reflect a global process of neural or physiological maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gesell, 1929</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">McGraw, 1943</xref>).

If postural-locomotor behaviors were to mature first, it would suggest that a developed post-cranial body is a prerequisite for producing mature contact calls.</p><p>Supporting the ‘vocal behavior develops first’ hypothesis, contact calls transitioned to a more mature form around 10 postnatal days, while postural and locomotor behavior transitioned around postnatal days 19 and 21, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). A generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) showed that the relationship between maturity indices and postnatal day fits a logistic regression, with maturity indices increasing with age (n = 519 observation days, β ±SE = 0.21±0.03, <italic>z</italic> = 6.33, p&lt;0.0001; Appendix 1.4).

In other words, vocal development occurred earlier than postural and locomotor development. However, simply because vocal-postural-locomotor systems follow different trajectories does not mean that they do not interact in real-time. The question of whether vocal-locomotor coordination changes over the course of development is addressed next.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Mature contact call production and locomotor activity become increasingly coordinated during development</title><p>Infant marmosets require considerable muscular effort to produce mature contact calls (phees) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Takahashi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Zhang and Ghazanfar, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Zhang and Ghazanfar, 2018</xref>), and adult marmosets tend to produce mature contact calls during periods of reduced locomotor activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Borjon et al., 2016</xref>).

We know that by 1–2 months of age, marmosets only produce mature sounding contact calls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Takahashi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Zhang and Ghazanfar, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Zhang and Ghazanfar, 2018</xref>). One hypothesis is that they simply learn to stop moving when they need to produce a contact call. Doing so would eschew any potential physiological constraints on the production of mature sounding contact calls. In such a scenario, we would predict the number of contact calls produced during movement would decrease, while those produced during periods of immobility would increase. An alternative hypothesis is that as marmosets grow bigger, they become more capable of producing mature sounding contact calls while moving. This outcome would suggest that infants overcome any potential physiological constraints on vocal-locomotor coordination. In such a scenario, we would predict that the number of contact calls produced during movement would increase, while those produced during periods of immobility would decrease.</p><p>To test the above hypotheses, we first needed to estimate locomotor activity on a continuous scale. These estimates were extracted from frame-by-frame pixel differences in the video footage of the sessions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). We first summarized the temporal real-time dynamics of locomotor activity surrounding vocal production events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). We found that locomotor activity started to <italic>increase</italic> above the 95% threshold of the bootstrap significance test ~5 s before the immature call onsets and then decrease back to inside the 95% threshold ~10 s after call offsets. In contrast, locomotor activity started to <italic>decrease</italic> below the 95% threshold of the bootstrap significance test ~8 s before mature contact call onsets and then increase back to inside the 95% threshold ~10 s after call offsets. A LMM confirmed that the average locomotor activity was higher during immature contact calls as compared to mature contact calls (n = 9609 calls, β ±SE = −0.07±0.01, <italic>t</italic> = 5.19, p&lt;0.0001; Appendix 1.7). When these temporal dynamics were mapped across postnatal days, we found that locomotor activity during immature contact call production remained around or above the randomized expected levels of locomotor activity. In contrast, early in postnatal life, mature contact call production occurred when locomotor activity was below the 95% threshold of the bootstrap significance test; however, their production gradually became coordinated with increased levels of locomotor activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Locomotor activity during mature contact calls was higher during late development (PND 52–61) as compared to early development (PND 1–10) (Early = 914 calls; Late = 932 calls; β ±SE = 0.04±0.01, <italic>t</italic> = 3.05, p=0.0056; Appendix 1.8).</p><p>These data therefore support the alternative hypothesis, that the potential constraints of producing mature contact calls during movements are mitigated as the infants get older. Thus, even though postural-locomotor maturity does not appear to be a prerequisite for vocal development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), vocal-locomotor coordination is still an important component of marmoset monkey motor development. This finding then raises the question of how real-time fluctuations in physiological condition may predict call production and locomotor activity in developing infants. Presumably, infants in elevated states of arousal are more likely to engage in these motor behaviors. The question of whether temporal associations between motor output and arousal levels change over the course of development is addressed next.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Mature call production and locomotion occurs during elevated arousal levels</title><p>We first tested hypotheses about the developmental dynamics of arousal state during marmoset contact call production. One very basic hypothesis is that the production of mature contact calls requires elevated arousal levels more than does the production of immature contact calls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Teramoto et al., 2017</xref>). Being in an elevated arousal state also means that individuals may have more respiratory power needed to generate mature sounding calls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Borjon et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Zhang and Ghazanfar, 2016</xref>). Another hypothesis (that doesn’t preclude the first one) is that mature contact calls are more likely to occur during elevated arousal levels earlier in development. This would be consistent with computational models that suggest that younger infants are unable to effectively coordinate the elements of their vocal apparatus to produce mature contact calls and may require enhanced respiratory power to do so (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Takahashi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Teramoto et al., 2017</xref>); indeed, there is now empirical support for the link between respiratory power and mature contact call production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Zhang and Ghazanfar, 2018</xref>). Conversely, a third hypothesis is that mature contact calls are more likely to occur during elevated arousal states later in development than earlier. This could occur if, as the infants get older, their overall motivation changes (i.e., less stressed by isolation) and so higher arousal levels are needed to motivate vocal production. An elevated arousal state may also enable respiratory power and laryngeal tension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Zhang and Ghazanfar, 2016</xref>); this could lead to better coordination between vocal production and locomotion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C,D</xref>).</p><p>We found that mature contact calls occurred during elevated levels of arousal, a pattern that become more pronounced as development proceeded. A summary of the real-time dynamics of heart rate fluctuations in the 10 s before to 10 s after vocal production revealed that marmosets produced immature contact calls when heart rate percentiles dropped below the 95% threshold of the bootstrap significance test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Production of mature contact calls, on the other hand, occurred when heart rate percentiles went above the 95% threshold of the bootstrap significance test. In both cases, changes in arousal levels were ‘global’, meaning that the change in arousal occurred well before (at least 10 s) the start of the call. A LMM confirmed that heart rate percentiles were higher during mature contact calls than during immature contact calls (n = 6215 calls, β ±SE = 3.38±1.45, <italic>t</italic> = 2.32, p=0.0276; Appendix 1.9). The developmental dynamics of arousal levels during vocal production further supported this main effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Early in postnatal life, heart rate percentiles during immature contact calls were inside the 95% threshold of the bootstrap significance test, but at around two weeks, heart rates during immature contact calls started to decrease below the 95% threshold. In contrast, mature contact calls were produced when heart rate percentiles were at, or above, the 95% threshold of the bootstrap significance test during the first two months of postnatal life. There was a marginal increase in heart rate percentiles during mature contact calls during late development (PND 52–61) as compared to early development (PND 1–10) (Early = 490 calls; Late = 780 calls; β ±SE = 6.28±3.48, <italic>t</italic> = 1.81, p=0.0795; Appendix 1.10).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.41853.007</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Mature contact calls and locomotor activity are more likely to occur during elevated arousal levels later in development.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Arousal fluctuations from 10 s before to 10 s after contact call production.

Another hypothesis (that is not mutually exclusive of the first one) is that locomotor activity is more likely to occur during elevated arousal levels earlier in development. One interpretation of this result is that, as with vocal production, younger infants are less able to coordinate their body movements and require enhanced respiratory power to do so. Conversely, a third hypothesis is that locomotor activity is more likely to occur during elevated arousal levels later in development than earlier. As with vocal production, this could occur if, as the infants get older, their overall motivation changes (i.e., less stressed by isolation) and so higher arousal levels are needed to motivate movement. An elevated arousal state may also enable respiratory power and laryngeal tension to enable better coordination between vocal production and locomotion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C,D</xref>).</p><p>Like vocal production, we found that locomotor activity occurred during elevated arousal levels, a pattern that appeared to become more pronounced later in development.

As with vocal production, this change in arousal was ‘global’, meaning that the change in arousal happened well before (at least 10 s) the start of movement. The developmental dynamics of arousal levels during locomotor activity further supported this main effect result (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Early in postnatal life, heart rate percentiles during locomotor activity were within the 95% threshold of the bootstrap significance test, but continued to increase throughout the first two months of postnatal life. There was a marginal increase in heart rate percentiles during locomotor events during late development (PND 52–61) as compared to early development (PND 1–10) (Early = 752 calls; Late = 566 calls; β ±SE = 8.12±4.04, <italic>t</italic> = 2.01, p=0.0580; Appendix 1.11).</p><p>Our data suggest that mature contact call production and locomotor activity are both associated with elevated levels of arousal, an association that becomes more pronounced with age.

We tested this idea next.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Coordination of mature contact call production with locomotor activity occurs during elevated levels of arousal</title><p>Over the course of infant marmoset development, both locomotor activity and arousal levels predicted whether an infant produces a mature contact call over an immature call. Low levels of locomotor activity support mature contact call production early in development, and elevated arousal levels support mature contact call production later in development. The missing piece of the puzzle is whether there is a connection between vocal-locomotor coordination and arousal state. Here, we test, and find support for, the hypothesis that arousal levels during mature contact call production are elevated when marmosets are moving around (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Locomotor activity during mature contact call production was positively associated with heart rate percentiles (n = 3966 calls, β ±SE = 9.66±4.05, <italic>t</italic> = 2.39, p=0.0208; Appendix 1.12; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). In other words, this result suggests that individuals in an elevated arousal state are better able to coordinate mature vocal production with locomotion. Specifically, this positive association characterized infants that were one month old (1–30 days; n = 1705 calls, β ±SE = 16.32±6.60, <italic>t</italic> = 2.47, Bonferroni-Holm adjusted p=0.0382; Appendix 1.12), but not two months old (31–61 days; n = 2261 calls, β ±SE = 2.63±5.24, <italic>t</italic> = 0.50, Bonferroni-Holm adjusted p=0.6220; Appendix 1.12). This means that a positive association between locomotor activity and heart rate percentiles was not simply a by-product of age. Instead, there may be a particularly robust relationship between locomotor activity and heart rate during early infanthood when individuals are transitioning from producing immature to mature contact calls.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.41853.009</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Coordination of mature contact calls with locomotor activity occurs during elevated arousal levels.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Plots of locomotor activity and heart rate percentiles during contact calls in one infant.

Second, we examined the putative temporal coordination of vocal production with locomotor activity, and whether such coordination changes over the course of development. Finally, we investigated whether fluctuating arousal levels (estimated from heart rate) predicts vocal and locomotor output. We found that marmoset monkey vocalizations develop sooner than postural-locomotor skills, that locomotor activity gradually becomes coordinated with the production of mature-sounding contact calls, and that this vocal-locomotor coordination occurs during elevated levels of arousal.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Head-to-tail sequence of development</title><p>The development of the vocal and postural-locomotor systems in marmoset monkeys, at a first approximation, seems to follow similar trajectories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Wang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Takahashi et al., 2015</xref>).

This finding implies that the ability to produce adult-like sounds is not contingent upon advanced postural and locomotor control.

One explanation is that an initial investment in the vocal system allows infants to elicit caregiver attention (e.g., carrying and food sharing) more effectively, thereby prolonging the amount of time they need to develop their locomotor autonomy. This explanation makes sense given the developmental strategy (i.e., altricial) and social system (i.e., cooperative breeding) of humans and marmosets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Snowdon, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hrdy, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Solomon and French, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Burkart et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lukas and Clutton-Brock, 2012</xref>). For altricial species like marmoset monkeys (relative to other nonhuman primates), early development is an energetically costly period because individuals are unable to fully regulate their body temperature, and yet, altricial infants must invest energy to grow at a high rate and refine their motor skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rosenblatt, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Case, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Derrickson, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Blumberg and Sokoloff, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Starck and Ricklefs, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Muir, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Blumberg, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Schilling, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Price and Dzialowski, 2018</xref>). In marmosets and humans, locomotor and physiological constraints (such as control of arousal levels) may be overcome by receiving care and physical contact from both maternal and non-maternal adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Case, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Snowdon, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hrdy, 2007</xref>); infants elicit such contact and care by producing vocalizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Locke, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Zuberbühler, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ghazanfar and Takahashi, 2017</xref>). And yet, not all vocalizations are created equal. Previous work in marmosets and humans suggests that more adult-like sounds elicit caregiver attention better than do immature sounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gros-Louis et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Takahashi et al., 2016</xref>). By investing first in developing mature-sounding contact calls, infants may be ‘buying the time’ they need to learn how to move about independently in their environment.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Locomotion as a potential constraint on vocal development</title><p>The ability to coordinate biomechanical features of the vocal system – breathing, thoracic pressure and vocal fold tension – is critical for producing species-typical vocalizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">MacLarnon and Hewitt, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Maclarnon and Hewitt, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Takahashi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Zhang and Ghazanfar, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Teramoto et al., 2017</xref>). In developing marmosets, a mismatch between biomechanical dynamics of the vocal system is thought to generate immature cries instead of mature contact calls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Teramoto et al., 2017</xref>). Our study indicates that locomotor activity is one force that can potentially disrupt vocal production. Higher levels of body movements co-occurred with the production of immature-sounding contact calls (i.e., those with a short duration and high entropy), while lower levels of movement co-occurred with mature-sounding contact calls with long durations and lower entropy. These results are consistent with what is known about how movement affects respiration. Vigorous motor activities, like running, speed up breathing cycles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Wasserman et al., 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bramble and Carrier, 1983</xref>), resulting in articulation deficits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sundberg et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Price et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baker et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Orlikoff, 2008</xref>). The finding that calls produced during movement were shorter and noisier indicates that very young marmosets lacked adequate respiratory power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Zhang and Ghazanfar, 2018</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Arousal levels during vocal-locomotor coordination</title><p>A unique aspect of our study design is that we could test how real-time fluctuations in arousal related to vocal production, locomotion, and the coordination of these different motor outputs. Infant marmosets produced mature-sounding contact calls during elevated arousal levels and immature ones during low arousal levels, a finding that is consistent with previous work on infant and adult marmosets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Borjon et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Zhang and Ghazanfar, 2016</xref>). Similar to mature-sounding contact calls, infant marmosets also tended to engage in locomotion during elevated arousal states. Moreover, real-time variability in arousal state indicated whether mature-sounding contact calls co-occurred with locomotor activity. Infant marmosets exhibited elevated arousal levels when mature-sounding contact calls were produced during movement, and decreased arousal levels when such calls were produced during periods of immobility. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that elevated arousal may help to overcome physiological demands (e.g., respiratory power) of producing vocalizations while moving. Similar associations have been observed in humans engaged in physically demanding tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Rotstein et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baker et al., 2008</xref>). For example, heart rate increases at a faster rate during sustained exercise in adults who are engaged in a speech task than in adults engaged in a non-speech task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baker et al., 2008</xref>). Our study design precludes testing causality but does suggest that arousal state is a key player in the coordination between vocal and locomotor systems during development.</p><p>The inhibition of motor activity during mature contact call production shifted over the course of development. That is, by the time that infant marmoset monkeys stopped producing immature-sounding calls, they no longer showed decreased movement during mature contact call productions. This developmental shift suggests that marmosets gradually improved their ability to coordinate locomotor behaviors with vocal production. From a biomechanical perspective, this improvement suggests that marmosets acquired the ability to better control the vocal apparatus during movement. From a neural perspective, this improvement suggests that more experience with vocal behaviors and/or locomotion leads to better coordination between these motor systems. In either case, arousal state appears to be the common currency by which vocal-motor coordination emerges. One intriguing possibility is that these shifting dynamics of the autonomic nervous system create the scaffolding by which mature social behavior can emerge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Porges and Furman, 2011</xref>).</p><p>Despite being identified as a critical line of inquiry over 30 years ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Tipps et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Yingling, 1981</xref>), to date, only a handful of empirical studies investigated infant vocal-locomotor coordination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ejiri and Masataka, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fagan and Iverson, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abney et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Berger et al., 2017</xref>). Our study using marmoset monkeys as a model for developmental processes represents one of the first to integrate longitudinal and second-by-second timescales to investigate vocal development from a ‘whole-body’ perspective. We believe that this timescale integration is key to characterizing the fine-grained dynamics that dictate how mature vocalizations emerge. Trade-offs in vocal-locomotor coordination is a potential dynamic that needs to be reckoned with as individuals grow up. By concurrently measuring heart rate, we show that processes related to autonomic arousal may enable individuals to cope with this trade-off.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Subjects and housing</title><p>The subjects used in this study were seven (three females) infant common marmosets (<italic>Callithrix jacchus</italic>) from three different parental pairs (two sets of twins and one set of triplets,&lt;2 months old). Subjects were born in captivity and lived with their family groups (mother, father and siblings). The colony room was maintained at a temperature of approximately 27° C with 50–60% relative humidity, and a 12:12 hr light-dark cycle. All subjects had ad libitum access to water and were supplied daily with standard commercial chow supplemented with fruit and vegetables.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Experimental design</title><p>The experimental protocol follow methods previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Borjon et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Zhang and Ghazanfar, 2016</xref>). Infant marmosets were separated from their parents and placed in a testing box in an experiment room. The triangular, prism-shaped testing boxes were made of Plexiglas and wire (0.30 m x 0.30 m x 0.35 m). All observation sessions were conducted during daylight hours between postnatal day 1 to 61, and each observation session lasted 10 minutes. Subjects participated in a total of 220 observation sessions across the first two months of life (Subjects 1–7: 29, 29, 34, 34, 31, 31, 32). All experimental procedures were performed in compliance with the guidelines of the Princeton University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Vocal behavior data collection</title><p>Undirected vocalizations (i.e., socially isolated) were recorded using a Sennheiser MKH416-P48 microphone suspended 0.9 m above the testing box. The microphone signal was sent to a Mackie 402-VLZ3 line mixer whose output was relayed to a Plexon Omniplex and PC computer. We used the same custom MATLAB software established in previous research for computationally defining and segmenting infant marmoset vocalizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Takahashi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Zhang and Ghazanfar, 2016</xref>). A researcher manually verified which calls were one of two types of contact calls – cries and phees (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). As described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Takahashi et al., 2015</xref>), cries are contact calls that have a short duration and noisy spectral properties (i.e., high Wiener entropy); phees are contact calls that have a longer duration and tonal spectral properties (i.e., low Wiener entropy). We recorded audio for 192 of the 220 observation sessions (Subjects 1–7: 28, 29, 21, 20, 31, 31, 32) for a total of 10,956 calls (Subjects 1–7: 1,100, 801, 1,604, 1,021, 1,657, 2,199, 2,574). A custom-made MATLAB routine calculated two main acoustic properties for each call, the duration and Wiener entropy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Takahashi et al., 2016</xref>). Wiener entropy is a non-positive number that is calculated by taking the logarithm of the ratio between the geometric and arithmetic means of the values of the power spectrum for different frequencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Tchernichovski et al., 2000</xref>). Wiener entropy represents the broadband properties of a signal’s power spectrum in which the closer the signal is to white noise, the higher (closer to zero) the entropy value.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Postural and locomotor behavior data collection</title><p>Postural-locomotor behavior was video recorded at 30 fps with a Plexon Cineplex. We recorded video for 215 of the 220 observation sessions and identified a total of 3195 instances of specific postural-locomotor behaviors (Subjects 1–7: 662, 635, 414, 574, 207, 427, 276). We manually scored the recorded videos to identify the onset and offset of behaviors using BORIS, an open-source event-logging software for video coding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Friard and Gamba, 2016</xref>). As the video frame rate is at 30 Hz, the onset and offset of behaviors had a maximum resolution of 1/30 s. Our definitions of postural-locomotor behaviors were based on prior literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). During video coding, frames without a clear posture or locomotion described in our ethogram were not assigned a behavior.</p><p>Postural behaviors were defined as instances that infants spent repositioning itself: forelimb support, hanging, hindlimb support, raising head, and righting reflex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The righting reflex is when infants re-establish their body orientation so that their hands and feet are on the ground; head raising is when infants lift their head off the ground and look forward or up; forelimb support is when infants sit on the ground with their hands touching the ground (or cage); hindlimb support is when infants sit on the ground with their hands off the ground (or cage); hanging is when infants grasp the cage so that their hands and feet do not touch the ground. Locomotor behaviors were defined as instances when infants traversed the testing box: crawling, digging, jumping, climbing, and walking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Crawling is when infants move forward on the ground with their stomach touching the ground; digging is when infants move their hands back and forth across the ground; jumping is when infants push themselves off the ground or cage to move from one location to another; climbing is when infants traverse across the cage; walking is when infants traverse across the ground in a standing orientation.</p><p>Continuous variability in locomotor activity (i.e., body movement) was assessed by investigating pixel differences in the video data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), following methods used in earlier research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Borjon et al., 2016</xref>). Each video recording was split into segments of 30 frames (each 640 vs 400 pixels). We took the absolute difference of RGB values between the first and last frame of every second and divided by the total number of pixels. This value corresponded to the average difference in luminescence per pixel per second. A higher value indicates more pixel difference, signifying movement. Because absolute levels of locomotion differ across individuals and ages (e.g., movement of larger individuals causes larger pixel differences), it was necessary to re-scale locomotor activity levels. To do this, we converted all 1 s movement values to binary values with a 90<sup>th</sup> percentile threshold. Then, we use csaps in MATLAB to fit a cubic spline (smoothing parameter of 0.10) to the binary values in each 10 min observation session. In other words, locomotor activity ranged between zero (immobile) and one (mobile) so that comparisons could be made across individuals and ages.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Electrocardiography data collection</title><p>To quantify arousal fluctuations, we recorded heart rate for 149 of the 220 observation sessions (Subjects 1–7: 16, 14, 21, 19, 26, 25, 28). To record electrocardiographic (ECG) signal, we used two pairs of Ag-AgCl surface electrodes (Grass Technology) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Tethered electrodes were sewn into a soft elastic band, which was clasped around the animal’s thorax. One pair of electrodes was positioned on the dorsal thorax, and the other pair was positioned on the ventral thorax. We applied ECL gel on the surface of each electrode to improved signal-to-noise ratio. Infants were shaved around the thorax if needed. Each pair of electrodes was differentially amplified (x250) with the resulting signal sent to the Plexon Omniplex, where it was digitized at 40 kHz and sent to a personal computer for data acquisition. The strength of heart rate signals varies throughout observation sessions as animal movement alters the positioning of surface electrodes. As such, we chose the channel with the largest signal-to-noise ratio on a session-by-session basis. We manually identified and isolated motion artifacts or signal cutoffs. To minimize bias, we did the following for each observation session: signals from both ECG channels were divided into 10 s segments and signal pairs were presented in random order for visual inspection. Regions exhibiting signal loss were replaced with NaNs.</p><p>Following the visual screening, we down-sampled data from 40 kHz to 1,500 Hz to extract the cardiac signals. These signals were high-pass filtered at 15 Hz to preserve the rapid waveform of the heartbeat. The resulting signal was notch filtered at 60 Hz. Heart beats were detected using an adaptive threshold of 1 s duration to find cardiac spikes greater than the 95<sup>th</sup> percentile of the amplitude at each second of the signal. Occasionally, an artificial spike close to the actual heartbeat would be detected or a heartbeat would be missed. As such, we set inter-spike interval thresholds of 100 ms (600 beats/min) to 400 ms (150 beats/min), which are thresholds used in a previous study of marmoset autonomic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Borjon et al., 2016</xref>). If an inter-spike interval was less than 100 ms, the two spikes were substituted with a single spike located at the midpoint. If an inter-spike interval exceeded 400 ms, we replaced the signal with a NaN. To calculate heart rate, we constructed a binary series of heartbeat counts and convolved the resulting series with a 1 s Gaussian window. We only used heart rate data from observation sessions during which heart rate could be detected at least 50% of the time. Because heart rate can differ across individuals and ages, it was necessary to re-scale heart rate fluctuations so that comparisons could be made across individuals and ages. To do so, we converted all 1 s heart rate values to percentiles for each 10 min observation session (i.e., heart beat fluctuations were centered around the 50<sup>th</sup> percentile). In other words, heart rate percentile values ranged from zero (lowest heart rate level) to 100 (highest heart rate level) within each 10 min observation session.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Data analysis</title><p>All analyses were carried out in MATLAB (version R2019a) and R (version 3.5.3). To determine which motor behaviors were categorized as ‘immature’ and ‘mature’, we calculated the proportion of vocal, postural, or locomotor time engaged in specific behaviors. We used a series of linear mixed effect models (LMM, ‘lmer’ of the R package ‘lme4’; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bates et al., 2015</xref>) to test whether the proportion of time engaged in these behaviors changed based on postnatal day. We used the ‘lmerTest’ R package to determine the significance of the coefficients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kuznetsova et al., 2017</xref>). In the LMMs to examine how vocal behavior changes across development, the dependent variable was the proportion of total vocal time (per daily observation session) engaged in a specific vocalization (cry or phee), the fixed effect was postnatal day, and the random effect was the infant subject (LMM equation: proportion of time ~day + (day|subject)). In the LMMs to examine how postural behavior changes across development, the dependent variable was the proportion of total postural time (per daily observation session) engaged in a specific posture (forelimb support, hanging, hindlimb support, raising head, or righting reflex), the fixed effect was postnatal day, and the random effect was infant subject (LMM equation: proportion of time ~day + (day|subject)). In the LMMs to examine how locomotor behavior changes across development, the dependent variable was the proportion of total locomotor time (per daily observation session) engaged in a specific posture (climbing, crawling, digging, jumping, or walking), the fixed effect was postnatal day, and the random effect was infant subject (LMM equation: proportion of time ~day + (day|subject)). We applied the Bonferroni-Holm method to correct for issues of multiplicity within each behavior type (vocal, postural, or locomotor behaviors), resulting in adjusted p-values with an alpha threshold level of 0.05. We report detailed outcomes of these regression models (e.g., model formulas, random effect variance, regression coefficients, standard errors, t-values, and p-values) in Appendix 1.1-1.3. Immature behaviors were those whose use decreased across development, and mature behaviors were those whose use increased across development. We used these immature-mature categories to calculate ‘maturity indices’ per session. This index ranged from 0 to 1 and was calculated as follows,<disp-formula id="equ1"><mml:math id="m1"><mml:mi>M</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>u</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>y</mml:mi> <mml:mi/><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo> <mml:mi/><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi>m</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>m</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:math></disp-formula>where <italic>m</italic> represents the percent of time spent engaged in mature behavior and <italic>im</italic> represents the percent of time engaged in immature behavior. A maturity index value less than 0.5 means that an individual produced more immature behavior, and a value greater than 0.5 means that an individual produced more mature behavior. Cubic splines (MATLAB csaps function) were fit to individual data (smoothing parameter of 0.03) and population data (smoothing parameter of 0.01) to determine the developmental trajectories of vocal, postural and locomotor maturity indices. Then, we used a logistic generalized linear mixed effect model (GLMM, ‘glmer’ of the R package ‘lme4’; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bates et al., 2015</xref>) to test whether maturation time courses differed between vocal and postural-locomotor behaviors. We used the ‘lmerTest’ R package to determine the significance of the coefficients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kuznetsova et al., 2017</xref>). In this GLMM, the dependent variable was maturity index (per daily observation session, per behavior type—vocal, postural, locomotor), the fixed effect was postnatal day, and the random effect was infant subject (GLMM equation: maturity index ~behavior type+day + (behavior type|subject) + (day|subject)). In Appendix 1.4, we report detailed outcomes of this regression model (e.g., model formulas, random effect variance, regression coefficients, standard errors, t-values, and p-values), as well as the outcomes of this model per infant subject.</p><p>We sought to understand the real-time and developmental dynamics between vocal production and locomotor activity, as well as between arousal fluctuations and vocal-locomotor behavior. Then, to visualize the real-time dynamics of locomotion during call production, we extracted locomotor activity from −20 to 5 s surrounding call onsets and −5 to 20 s surrounding call offsets. To visualize the real-time dynamics of arousal fluctuations surrounding vocal-locomotor events, we extracted heart rate percentiles from −10 to 5 s surrounding call (or locomotor activity) onsets and −5 to 10 s surrounding call (or locomotor activity) offsets. To summarize the real-time dynamics for individual sessions, we fit a cubic spline to the session data (MATLAB csaps, smoothing parameter of 0.1), and then we fit a population spline to all session splines (smoothing parameter of 0.3). To visualize developmental dynamics, we used the average locomotor activity (or heart rate percentile) during each call (or locomotor activity event) to calculate the mean locomotor activity (or heart rate percentile) per individual session. Then, we fit cubic splines (smoothing parameter of 0.0001) to individual sessions to model the change in the population data across postnatal days.</p><p>To test the statistical significance of real-time and developmental dynamics, confidence intervals for the population splines were generated by randomly resampling (10 samples per session) from the signals used to generate individual session splines (real-time dynamics) or session averages (developmental dynamics). We fit a cubic spline to the resampled data to generate a population spline, and repeated the process 1000 times. The 95% confidence interval corresponds to the 2.5<sup>th</sup> and the 97.5<sup>th</sup> percentiles of the resampled population splines. To determine whether the real-time or developmental dynamics of locomotor activity and arousal fluctuations were significantly different from null expectations, we performed bootstrapped significance tests. For each session, we scrambled the order of call durations and inter-call interval durations. This allowed us to choose random segments equivalent in the number and length to the calls produced in that session while maintaining naturalistic spacing between the calls. We fit a cubic spline to session splines (for temporal analysis) or session averages (for developmental analysis) to generate bootstrapped population splines. We repeated this process 1000 times. The 95% threshold for significance corresponds to the 2.5<sup>th</sup> and 97.5<sup>th</sup> percentiles of the bootstrapped population splines. With this bootstrap procedure, we are taking into account data variability due to day, subject and call timing on the statistical estimates.</p><p>To complement our bootstrap procedure, we used a series of linear mixed effect models (LMM, ‘lmer’ of the R package ‘lme4’; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bates et al., 2015</xref>) to investigate associations between call production, locomotor activity, and arousal fluctuations. We used the ‘lmerTest’ R package to determine the significance of the coefficients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kuznetsova et al., 2017</xref>). We used LMMs to investigate how average locomotor activity during a call predicted call duration and Wiener entropy. In these LMMs, the dependent variable was contact call acoustic parameter (call duration or Wiener entropy), the fixed effects was average locomotor activity (per call), and the random effect was infant subject nested within postnatal day (LMM equation: acoustic parameter ~locomotor activity + (locomotor activity|day/subject)). We applied the Bonferroni-Holmes method to correct for multiplicity issues associated with testing two acoustic parameters, resulting in adjusted p-values with an alpha threshold level of 0.05. In Appendix 1.5-1.6, we report detailed outcomes of these regression models (e.g., model formulas, random effect variance, regression coefficients, standard errors, t-values, and p-values), as well as the outcomes of these models per postnatal day and infant subject. To complement the real-time dynamic analyses, we used LMMs to compare locomotor activity and ANS activity between contact call types. For the LMM examining locomotor activity, the dependent variable was the average locomotor activity (per contact call), the fixed effect was contact call type (immature vs. mature), and the random effect was infant subject nested within postnatal day (LMM equation: locomotor activity ~call type + (call type|day/subject)). For the LMM examining ANS activity, the dependent variable was the average heart rate percentile (per contact call), the fixed effect was contact call type (immature vs. mature), and the random effect was infant subject nested within postnatal day (LMM equation: heart rate ~call type + (call type|day/subject)). In Appendices 1.7 and 1.9. we report detailed outcomes of these regression models for example model formulas, random effect variance, regression coefficients, standard errors, t-values, and p-values), as well as outcomes of the models per postnatal day and infant subject.</p><p>We also used LMMs to complement the developmental dynamics analyses. We ran an LMM to examine developmental changes in locomotor activity during mature contact calls, in which the dependent variable was the average locomotor activity (per contact call), the fixed effect was age group, and the random effect was infant subject nested within postnatal day (LMM equation: locomotor activity ~age group + (age group|day/subject)). Age group was split into early development (PND 1–10; infant contact calls transition to sounding more adult-like around PND 10) and late development (PND 52–61). In Appendix 1.8, we report detailed outcomes of this regression model, as well as outcomes for each infant subject separately. We ran an LMM to examine developmental changes in ANS activity during mature contact calls, in which the dependent variable was the average heart rate percentile (per contact call), the fixed effect was age group, and the random effect was infant subject nested within postnatal day (LMM equation: heart rate ~age group + (age group|day/subject)). In Appendix 1.10, we report detailed outcomes of this regression model, as well as outcomes for each infant subject separately. We also ran an LMM to examine developmental changes in ANS activity during locomotor activity events, in which the dependent variable was the average heart rate percentile (per locomotor event) the fixed effect was age group, and the random effect was infant subject nested within postnatal day (LMM equation: heart rate ~age group + (age group|day/subject)). In Appendix 1.11, we report detailed outcomes of this regression model, as well as outcomes for each infant subject separately.</p><p>Finally, we used a LMM to investigate how ANS activity during mature contact calls is associated with vocal-locomotor coordination. The dependent variable of this LMM was average heart rate percentile (per mature contact call), the fixed effect was average locomotor activity (per mature contact call), and the random effect was infant subject nested within postnatal day (LMM equation: heart rate ~locomotor activity + (locomotor activity|day/subject)). We also ran this model on two separate subsets of the data, the first month of development (postnatal day 1–30) and the second month of development (postnatal day 31–61). We applied a Bonferroni-Holmes method to correct for issues of multiplicity due to testing different time frames separately, resulting in adjusted p-values with an alpha threshold level of 0.05. In Appendix 1.12, we report detailed outcomes of these regression models (e.g., model formula, random effect variance, regression coefficients, standard errors, t-values, and p-values), as well as the outcomes for each postnatal day and subject separately.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Lauren Kelly for her help with experiments and careful reading and editing of an earlier version of this manuscript.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Energetic costs and locomotor constraints on vocal development&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom as a guest Reviewing Editor, and the evaluation has been overseen by Ronald Calabrese as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Franz Goller (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Gustison and colleagues recorded and analyzed the development of coordination between vocal and locomotor behaviors in the marmoset monkey. Results show that mature vocalizations develop earlier than locomotion. Further, coordination between vocalization and locomotion develop gradually. Younger infants produce mature-sounding vocalizations only while not moving. Older infants, on the other hand, coordinated their vocalization with movements. Recording heart rate suggest that energetics constraints could potentially explain the late development of coordinated behavior across modalities. However, the reviewers found some substantive concerns, as elaborated below.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>There are two very major concerns that should be fully addressed before resubmission can be considered:</p><p>First, all reviewers concluded (during discussion) that data do not support the major claims authors make about energetic constraints on the development of vocal-locomotor coordination. Therefore, authors should drop out heart rate as a measure of metabolic cost of vocalization. Instead, the revised manuscript should be focused on describing the developmental trajectories with more details, and compare them to relevant literature in other species (which should be presented in Introduction).</p><p>Second, authors used sessions (and sometimes even calls) as independent measurements to make statistical inferences. In the revised version, statistics should be redone using each animal as a statistic (i.e., with df = number of monkeys -1). It is essential to test if the phenomenon of different maturation rate can hold using simple paired comparisons. Further, performing the statistics on the fitted spline curves makes it hard to assess if conclusions are sufficiently supported. The dynamic analysis of calls/locomotion coordination should also be supported with similar statistics.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>This is an important longitudinal study that compare maturation rate of vocalization to movement and postures. Authors discoveries, if correct, are of general theoretical and practical interest. Of particular interest is the dynamic analysis of movements and calls coordination, showing reversal of patterns over development. Before this manuscript can be published, several concerns about the statistical approach and about conclusions should be addressed:</p><p>A) Statistical approach:</p><p>1) Using each call as independent statistic is problematic, and (to my knowledge) not an acceptable practice in acoustic analysis. At least for the most critical tests, the n must be the number of monkeys studied, namely 7.</p><p>2) Authors should be more careful with their statistical modeling, and take a simple, direct approach whenever possible. In particular, when comparing time courses of calls and movement maturity indexes, author should simply test if those time courses are different. That is, the null hypothesis should be that those are the same. Here all we need is a pairwise comparison within each subject: is the zero crossing the same or not? Such pairwise comparison with n=7 using paired Wilcoxon, or even paired t or just binomial test would be (one can safely reject the null hypothesis (with p=1/2^7) and conclude that the maturation time course of vocalization is indeed faster.</p><p>3) The way authors did the test is inappropriate in several ways. First, raising 3 distinct hypotheses (H1= more, H2=same, H3=less) is not necessary, it suffice to look for a significant difference from null. Second, and most critical – where do 124 degrees of freedom comes from? This looks like an obvious pseudo-replication, which resulted with illegitimate power of W = 3936 (!) and an erroneously huge significance (p &lt; 0.0001). Such p values are rarely correct in biology, certainly not with the sample size of the current study.</p><p>4) Similarly, the analysis of movement vs. Wiener entropy should be done with each monkey as a statistic, and again, paired comparisons should be done within each animal.</p><p>5) The only place where I find it reasonable to use calls as statistics is in the dynamic analysis shown in Figures 4 and 5. In such a fine grain developmental analysis, and after the major effects where established, it makes sense to look at time courses of call movements interactions, considering each event as statistically independent.</p><p>B) Conclusions:</p><p>This is an important, but still a correlational study – we don't know cause and effect. For example, the statement &quot;infants must overcome the energetic costs of coordinating their vocalizations with body movement&quot; is not fully supported by the data. For example, the marmoset is likely to vocalize while already agitated and this effect might be age related. Further, one might suspect that vocalization might be used to communicate high energy/agitation state.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>In this very interesting and well-written manuscript Gustison et al. address the maturation of two motor systems (vocal and locomotor) in marmosets and test a string of clearly defined hypotheses. The authors quantify vocal, postural and locomotory behaviors over complete postnatal development and the resulting datasets are impressive. They use these observations to compute maturity indices for the three behavioral classes, allowing comparison of maturity onsets for the systems separately. The authors convincingly show that young infants only produce adult like calls when not moving and older ones can move while calling. The paper includes several novelties: i) concurrent analyses of both the developmental timescale as well as the real-time (seconds) timescale to investigate energetic tradeoffs during vocalizations. ii) which allows to them study coupling for the first time. The authors show that this coupling exists at the second scale suggesting higher energy investment in calling behavior is required for producing mature calls. The data is well presented with clear figures.</p><p>Major comments:</p><p>1) The data is used to support the hypothesis that mature contact call production requires an energy investment that increases with age. In the light of energy expenditure during vocalizations this can be explained if the calls get louder. Increasing respiratory effort and thus lung pressure increases predominantly sound amplitude in laryngeally produced sounds. Fundamental frequency only changes slightly with pressure. Wiener entropy as a measure for noisiness is not regularly used outside of the birdsong field, but will increase most likely in chaotic regimes when pressures are very high.</p><p>It would be rather straightforward for the authors to quantify the source levels of the vocalizations. The low-frequency cry is not directional but the wave-number can be used to coarsely estimate the directionality of the phee call. (ka = 2pi/λ * a (, where λ is wavelength (v/f) and a is emitter size radius – guessing 2 cm for a marmoset. with k=2pi/(340/7000) and a = 0.02) ka=2.5, which is above 1. Thus the phee call is directional, which makes it more complicated to compute source levels without microphone array. However luckily the microphone was located in the far-field 90 cm above the cage directing down, making vocalization's aimed in the horizontal plane directly comparable.</p><p>2) The authors list four empirical data papers in the last paragraph of the discussion that investigated human infant vocal-locomotor coordination. At least Berger et al. and Abney et al. present similar datasets of concurrent posture and vocalization (not at the second timescale). These papers should be acknowledged and placed in perspective up front in the Introduction.</p><p>3) The locomotor behavior was basically scored as difference images. Did the authors observe any structural changes in locomotory patterns, such as certain accompanying displays (vocal postures) that matured over development?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>General comments:</p><p>This manuscript describes a research effort, in which development of locomotor and vocal skills as well as, importantly, their coordination have been studied quantitatively and have been related to energetic aspects. This is a very interesting study that tries to fill a gap in our understanding of the ontogeny of motor system coordination and its energetic background. The presented data partly meet the goals set out in the Introduction (questions 1-3), but especially for questions 2 and 3 fall somewhat short and require clarification.</p><p>1) The various sets of hypotheses listed in the results present sets that leave out potential alternatives. Specific suggestions are mentioned below.</p><p>2) The assessment of the energetic cost of call production is problematic at multiple levels, from the premises to the estimate and the interpretation. Specifically, the following general points should be considered:</p><p>2.1) Several assumptions had to be made to convert heart rate to metabolic activity. We know from critical assessments of the technique that careful calibrations are needed to achieve reliable estimates. That means that the applied conversion factors may not be valid across development within an individual and certainly are problematic when applied across individuals. Whereas this is a general difficulty with the technique that cannot be solved in this study, it should be acknowledged and should lead to more careful conclusions.</p><p>2.2) It is not clear to me how baseline levels of heart rate have been determined for call production episodes with and without locomotor activity. Because heart rate changes are very dynamic, this is one of the critical methodological issues, which we face. Are observed changes due to actual changes or differences in baseline levels?</p><p>2.3) Rapid changes in heart rate can be caused by motivational and other modulatory factors that have no direct link to energy expenditure of a behavior. This is a major shortcoming of using heart rate to assess the metabolic cost for short-duration behaviors.</p><p>2.4) It is not clear to me how the cost of locomotion, which is expected to be several-fold greater than that for vocalization has been disentangled to conclude that production of phee calls imposes a high metabolic cost.</p><p>3) The presentation of the results is interwoven by methods (somewhat necessitated by the fact that the method section is at the end) and lots of introductory material and posing of hypotheses. The actual results are then described very briefly, and statistical as well as descriptive presentation is quickly reduced to very derived spline curves. At least to me this generates the feeling that I do not know the results sufficiently to assess whether or not the later conclusions are supported sufficiently.</p><p>Specific comments:</p><p>Abstract: Is the intended meaning that locomotion uses resources that would otherwise be available for call production? I cannot see that such an energetic bottleneck exists. If a constraint exists, it is more likely that locomotion and call production require either muscle efforts that are difficult to generate simultaneously or some other coordination-related trade-off. The absolute energy level is very unlikely to be the bottle neck here.</p><p>Introduction paragraph one: Of course, there are always energetic costs to vocal production. How much energy is required may vary, but as discussed above it is hardly so high that energy levels prohibit vocalization.</p><p>Subsection “The vocal system matures before postural and locomotor systems” paragraph two: This description of hypotheses is almost &quot;trivial&quot; and thus does not need to be so elaborate.</p><p>Subsection “Mature contact call production and locomotor activity become increasingly coordinated during development”: These hypotheses are based on the same notion that absolute energy levels at the time of vocalization could dictate whether or not calls can be produced. I do not see that such an energy shortage could exist. It is more likely (as alluded to above) that other factors dictate whether or not a call can be produced (e.g., can a particular respiratory muscle generate sufficient force if it also is engaged in locomotion, etc.). Another matter is whether or not an animal engages in a particular behavior because of general energetic condition. These conceptual issues are at the heart of this paper, and, in my opinion, the current reasoning is not realistic in regard to the physiological understanding of metabolic cost and movement.</p><p>Subsection “Mature contact call production and locomotor activity become increasingly coordinated during development”: This discussion would read very differently if the constraint were seen more like discussed above.</p><p>Final sentence of subsection “Mature contact call production and locomotor activity become increasingly coordinated during development”: This statement may have to be revised if calibrations at different ages were available.</p><p>Materials and methods: It is not clear how baseline heart rate was determined. Because metabolic cost of locomotion is not restricted in time to the actual duration of movement, but elevated metabolism continues after the movement, the timing of call production relative to locomotion is very important. This issue is very critical, if the costs of locomotion and vocalization are to be disentangled. It is also not clear how z-scores were calculated to make data comparable over developmental time.</p><p>[Editors' note: comments from the first round of re-review follow.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Coordination of vocal and locomotor behavior emerges in development as a function of arousal state&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below.</p><p>In particular:</p><p>1) Statistics need improvement. Please provide cross validation by doing shuffle statistics (shuffling subjects across groups). Also, if you choose to continue with the GLM please provide detailed statistical results including within and between subjects results.</p><p>2) As reviewer 3 noted, the problem of disentangling metabolism related to locomotion from emotional influences is not fully resolved by using the term 'arousal'. A weaker interpretation of the results could help (in addition to clarifying terminology as suggested).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>Authors addressed my comments and the manuscript is much improved but I am still worried about the statistics. Authors now use GLM throughout but they did not specify how dependent repeated observations are treated in the model. judged by the p values, which are all lower than 0.0001, I suspect that p values are based on the dependent call events and movement events as the statistics, rather than the animal. This is a problem. I will need to see the breakdown of within and between subject results, and how p values were computed to confirm, but looking at the raw data, I am almost sure that p values are wrong. Authors should keep in mind that as opposed to R, Matlab is not a statistical software, and it is very easy to get the model wrong. One should use Matlab statistical packages carefully, particularly when extracting p values from complex models, to make sure all assumptions are correct. I still believe it would be much safer to shuffle statistics here: simply shuffle subjects across groups and extract direct p values. Simple is better than sophisticated.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>After carefully reviewing the response to reviewers and the new manuscript, I do not have any substantial concerns and recommend the paper for publication.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>The manuscript has been improved following the suggestions. The metabolic data and associated argumentation have been taken out. In its place, the heart rate data were used to assess &quot;arousal&quot;. &quot;Arousal&quot; is a vague concept and is not defined very well in this manuscript. Whereas I do not see the issues as critical as in the case of metabolism, I am not clear on whether or not the problem of disentangling metabolism related to locomotion from emotional influences has been solved any better here. Perhaps I still do not understand it correctly, but the issue of baseline data has in my opinion also not been resolved satisfactorily. Namely, the interpretation of whether or not and how much heart rate increased depends on the period of baseline measurement. I am not sure I understand what a session is (letter) for which the normalized data are taken. Is it the period before and after as outlined in the manuscript? Certainly, different locomotor activity during these periods will make comparisons very difficult. Because locomotor behavior increases with maturity level, so will the associated heart rates. To what degree it is a change in arousal, can therefore only be said with confidence if the two influences on heart rate can be disentangled.</p><p>[Editors' note: comments from the second round of re-review follow.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Coordination of vocalization and locomotion emerges in development in association with arousal state&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Ronald Calabrese (Senior Editor), a Reviewing Editor, and a statistician expert. Unfortunately, there are still very serious issues with statistics that preclude publication of your manuscript in <italic>eLife</italic> at its present form.</p><p>Following your disagreement with the reviewers’ criticism about statistics, we sent your manuscript to a statistician expert. The expert concerns are similar to those raised earlier, but are even more substantial. We are worried about the p-values you reported, which seem inconsistent with your sample size and with the raw measures. Therefore, we cannot accept your manuscript, unless we can validate and replicate your results, according to the guidelines provided by the statistician expert.</p><p>We would like to clarify that as much as we find your study interesting and potentially valuable, unless the revised version can fully convince the expert that the stats and p-values are correct and easily replicated, we will have no choice but to reject your manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #4:</italic> </p><p>Major concerns:</p><p>1) Authors use LMM which is fine. They say they have infants as random effect and that is fine too, but I wonder how could authors get with 7 monkeys p&lt;0.0001? I looked at the tables with per-animal results. The variability is high in the coefficients per monkey, sometimes with results of opposite directions. Treating them as a sample does not yield the precision near to that claimed.</p><p>2) I cannot exclude the possibility that authors may be right, BUT when submitting such an analysis reproducible computing is a must. The statistical model itself should be specified and the entire code made available. I think that giving this information is minimal requirement, but making the code and the data available at this stage so that reproducibility could be checked is already a requirement made by leading journals and here it is crucial.</p><p>3) In particular in this case, it is important to know whether the model considered sessions as nested within monkeys or not. It will have great impact, and you cannot tell it from the information authors provided.</p><p>4) In the correlation analysis authors use all observations as if they are independent and that is wrong, but since it is used only for creation of scale it does not matter much.</p><p>5) Authors also present too many figures only with no data, only summaries: all of 4 and 5B.</p><p>6) <italic>eLife</italic> requires treatment of multiplicity issues; none of that was done.</p><p>[Editors' note: comments from the third round of re-review follow.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Vocal and locomotor coordination develops in association with arousal state&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

We wanted to make use of our complex developmental dataset that varies not just by behavioral category, but also by postnatal day and subject. We realize that our original testing regime was inappropriate because it treated each data point as an independent observation. To correct this error in the revised manuscript, we chose to use a sophisticated statistical technique – generalized linear mixed effect models (GLMM) – to make our comparisons. GLMMs are excellent for complex datasets, enabling the user to test for population-level fixed effects while controlling for random effect variables operating on the individual level. Below, we describe the GLMM model that we used and its outcome.</p><p>In the GLMM, we include behavior type (vocal vs. postural, and vocal vs. locomotor) as the fixed effect, with postnatal day and subject id as random effects. We used a ‘logistic’ regression function for this GLMM, as it is most appropriate for fitting sigmoid-shaped curves. We had to adapt our maturity index slightly in order to use a logistic GLMM. A logistic regression requires proportion data (i.e., falls within [0,1]). The maturity index in the original manuscript was scaled between -1 and 1. In the revised manuscript, we calculate the maturity index as the proportion of time spent engaged in adult-like behaviors. Thus, the data structure is still the same as before, just shifted to range between 0 and 1.</p><p>The outcome of the GLMM is in line with the outcome reported in the original manuscript. The vocal maturation occurs sooner than maturation of postural and locomotor behavior. Because the logistic GLMM analysis requires proportional data, the plots in Figures 2B,D and E have been rescaled. We also updated the significance indicators in plot E.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The way authors did the test is inappropriate in several ways. First, raising 3 distinct hypotheses (H1= more, H2=same, H3=less) is not necessary, it suffice to look for a significant difference from null. Second, and most critical – where do 124 degrees of freedom comes from? This looks like an obvious pseudo-replication, which resulted with illegitimate power of W = 3936 (!) and an erroneously huge significance (p &lt; 0.0001). Such p values are rarely correct in biology, certainly not with the sample size of the current study.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that our original analysis technique was fraught with pseudo-replication and therefore inappropriate. We apologize for this. To correct this problem in the revised manuscript, we used a generalized linear mixed effects model. Please see response 2 for a detailed description of our rationale, the model, and changes made to the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Similarly, the analysis of movement vs. Wiener entropy should be done with each monkey as a statistic, and again, paired comparisons should be done within each animal.</p></disp-quote><p>Extending the rationale described above (response 2), we applied generalized linear models to analyses of movement vs. call duration and movement vs. Wiener entropy. We describe these two models in the Materials and methods. Briefly, we include both locomotor activity and postnatal day as fixed effects and infant identity as a random effect. We updated the Results and Figure 3B accordingly. The outcome of the new analyses has the same main outcomes as before -- locomotor activity is negatively associated with call duration and positively associated with Wiener entropy. These models also show that postnatal day is positively associated with call duration and negatively associated with Wiener entropy, which are findings that replicate previous studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The only place where I find it reasonable to use calls as statistics is in the dynamic analysis shown in Figures 4 and 5. In such a fine grain developmental analysis, and after the major effects where established, it makes sense to look at time courses of call movements interactions, considering each event as statistically independent.</p></disp-quote><p>We now use generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) for most analyses. Please see responses 2-4 for details.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>B) Conclusions:</p><p>This is an important, but still a correlational study – we don't know cause and effect. For example, the statement &quot;infants must overcome the energetic costs of coordinating their vocalizations with body movement&quot; is not fully supported by the data. For example, the marmoset is likely to vocalize while already agitated and this effect might be age related. Further, one might suspect that vocalization might be used to communicate high energy/agitation state.</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised manuscript, we use heart rate as a measure of arousal fluctuations rather than attempting to convert it to “energetic cost”. In addition, we removed causal statements when discussing the results. We agree with the reviewer that these statements are misleading given that our study design is observational. For example, we have re-written the Abstract statement mentioned above to “infants gradually improve coordination between vocalizations and body movement through a process that may be facilitated arousal level changes”. We also include a cautionary statement in the Discussion that “However, it is important to note that we are unable to test causal claims directly due to the observational design of this study”.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[…] The paper includes several novelties: i) concurrent analyses of both the developmental timescale as well as the real-time (seconds) timescale to investigate energetic tradeoffs during vocalizations. ii) which allows to them study coupling for the first time. The authors show that this coupling exists at the second scale suggesting higher energy investment in calling behavior is required for producing mature calls. The data is well presented with clear figures.</p><p>Major comments:</p><p>1) The data is used to support the hypothesis that mature contact call production requires an energy investment that increases with age. In the light of energy expenditure during vocalizations this can be explained if the calls get louder. Increasing respiratory effort and thus lung pressure increases predominantly sound amplitude in laryngeally produced sounds. Fundamental frequency only changes slightly with pressure. Wiener entropy as a measure for noisiness is not regularly used outside of the birdsong field, but will increase most likely in chaotic regimes when pressures are very high.</p><p>It would be rather straightforward for the authors to quantify the source levels of the vocalizations. The low-frequency cry is not directional but the wave-number can be used to coarsely estimate the directionality of the phee call. (ka = 2pi/λ * a (, where λ is wavelength (v/f) and a is emitter size radius – guessing 2 cm for a marmoset. with k=2pi/(340/7000) and a = 0.02) ka=2.5, which is above 1. Thus the phee call is directional, which makes it more complicated to compute source levels without microphone array. However luckily the microphone was located in the far-field 90 cm above the cage directing down, making vocalization's aimed in the horizontal plane directly comparable.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate these insights and we did not consider this approach to measuring sound amplitude as a more robust indicator of respiratory effort. We hope to use it in the future. The current revision, however, adheres to the requirement outlined in the decision letter that was to remove the entire energy expenditure line of argument/analyses. Thus, this comment, while very much appreciated, is no longer applicable to the revised manuscript. If you would still like us to do the analysis, nevertheless, then we’d be happy to give it try. Do let us know.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors list four empirical data papers in the last paragraph of the discussion that investigated human infant vocal-locomotor coordination. At least Berger et al. and Abney et al. present similar datasets of concurrent posture and vocalization (not at the second timescale). These papers should be acknowledged and placed in perspective up front in the Introduction.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for these references. We have added these papers to the Introduction in the paragraph where other human-focused studies are now discussed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The locomotor behavior was basically scored as difference images. Did the authors observe any structural changes in locomotory patterns, such as certain accompanying displays (vocal postures) that matured over development?</p></disp-quote><p>We did not observe structural changes in the co-occurrence of specific postural-locomotor behaviors with vocalization across development. In an exploratory data analysis, we tested whether phees (mature contact call) were more likely to co-occur with mature forms of posture-locomotion than with immature forms. These analyses were focused on days in which monkeys produced phees and both immature and mature forms of posture (n = 23 sessions) or both immature and mature forms of locomotion (n = 27 sessions). The results suggested that Phee production did not depend on the maturity level of posture (p = 0.70) or locomotion (p = 0.84). Instead, it appeared that phee production in younger infants depended on whether infants were immobile.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>General comments:</p><p>This manuscript describes a research effort, in which development of locomotor and vocal skills as well as, importantly, their coordination have been studied quantitatively and have been related to energetic aspects. This is a very interesting study that tries to fill a gap in our understanding of the ontogeny of motor system coordination and its energetic background. The presented data partly meet the goals set out in the Introduction (questions 1-3), but especially for questions 2 and 3 fall somewhat short and require clarification.</p><p>1) The various sets of hypotheses listed in the results present sets that leave out potential alternatives. Specific suggestions are mentioned below.</p></disp-quote><p>To address several of these comments, we chose to drop the “energy expenditure” part of the manuscript. Instead, we focus on heart rate as an estimate of arousal dynamics.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The assessment of the energetic cost of call production is problematic at multiple levels, from the premises to the estimate and the interpretation. Specifically, the following general points should be considered:</p><p>2.1) Several assumptions had to be made to convert heart rate to metabolic activity. We know from critical assessments of the technique that careful calibrations are needed to achieve reliable estimates. That means that the applied conversion factors may not be valid across development within an individual and certainly are problematic when applied across individuals. Whereas this is a general difficulty with the technique that cannot be solved in this study, it should be acknowledged and should lead to more careful conclusions.</p></disp-quote><p>We addressed this comment by using heart rate directly as an indicator of arousal rather than converting it to an estimate of energy expenditure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.2) It is not clear to me how baseline levels of heart rate have been determined for call production episodes with and without locomotor activity. Because heart rate changes are very dynamic, this is one of the critical methodological issues, which we face. Are observed changes due to actual changes or differences in baseline levels?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this insight. In our study, we normalize heart rate by converting beats/min to percentiles. This normalization method preserves the heart rate changes within a session but allows the dynamic traces to be scaled around the same median (50<sup>th</sup> percentile) between observation sessions. This is the same method used in a study of arousal dynamics and vocal production in adult marmosets (Borjon et al., 2016). Thus, we aren’t really comparing “baseline” levels of heart rate, we are comparing deviations of heart rate from session “medians”. In the revised manuscript, we describe this better in the Materials and methods and we refer to “median levels” instead of “baseline levels” in the Results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.3) Rapid changes in heart rate can be caused by motivational and other modulatory factors that have no direct link to energy expenditure of a behavior. This is a major shortcoming of using heart rate to assess the metabolic cost for short-duration behaviors.</p></disp-quote><p>We understand. In the revised manuscript, we used heart rate as an estimate of fluctuating arousal levels rather than of energy expenditure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.4) It is not clear to me how the cost of locomotion, which is expected to be several-fold greater than that for vocalization has been disentangled to conclude that production of phee calls imposes a high metabolic cost.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the comment. Loud calls such as the marmoset contact call are likely to be very energetically costly for such a small animal (~300 grams in weight) in the same way that it is for other very small animals. Whether it is several fold less than locomotion depends on the duration and mode of locomotion. In any case, for the revised manuscript, the point is moot. We used heart rate as an estimate of fluctuating arousal levels rather than of energy expenditure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The presentation of the results is interwoven by methods (somewhat necessitated by the fact that the method section is at the end) and lots of introductory material and posing of hypotheses. The actual results are then described very briefly, and statistical as well as descriptive presentation is quickly reduced to very derived spline curves. At least to me this generates the feeling that I do not know the results sufficiently to assess whether or not the later conclusions are supported sufficiently.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing this out. We have removed the original energetic analysis from the revised manuscript, so part of this comment is no longer relevant. In the revised manuscript, we included more mainstream statistical analyses (generalized linear mixed models) so that readers can better understand the results. Some of these models are described above in responses 2-4. In addition to the models described in responses 2-4, we also use GLMMs to supplement the fine-grained dynamic analyses (described in Materials and methods). We believe these models provide more substance to the revised Results sections on the real-time and developmental dynamics between call production, locomotor activity, and arousal levels.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Specific comments:</p><p>Abstract: Is the intended meaning that locomotion uses resources that would otherwise be available for call production? I cannot see that such an energetic bottleneck exists. If a constraint exists, it is more likely that locomotion and call production require either muscle efforts that are difficult to generate simultaneously or some other coordination-related trade-off. The absolute energy level is very unlikely to be the bottle neck here.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a great point that we did not consider. Indeed, we were focused on the idea that energy was the bottleneck. Sorry to repeat this over and over again but to be complete: In the revised manuscript, we used heart rate as an estimate of fluctuating arousal levels rather than of energy expenditure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Introduction paragraph one: Of course, there are always energetic costs to vocal production. How much energy is required may vary, but as discussed above it is hardly so high that energy levels prohibit vocalization.</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised manuscript, we used heart rate as an estimate of fluctuating arousal levels rather than of energy expenditure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Subsection “The vocal system matures before postural and locomotor systems” paragraph two: This description of hypotheses is almost &quot;trivial&quot; and thus does not need to be so elaborate.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the suggestions. We simplified this section to describe briefly the “null” (overlapping) and “alternative” (non-overlapping) hypotheses. We deleted several redundant phrases (~50 words).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Subsection “Mature contact call production and locomotor activity become increasingly coordinated during development”: These hypotheses are based on the same notion that absolute energy levels at the time of vocalization could dictate whether or not calls can be produced. I do not see that such an energy shortage could exist. It is more likely (as alluded to above) that other factors dictate whether or not a call can be produced (e.g., can a particular respiratory muscle generate sufficient force if it also is engaged in locomotion, etc.). Another matter is whether or not an animal engages in a particular behavior because of general energetic condition. These conceptual issues are at the heart of this paper, and, in my opinion, the current reasoning is not realistic in regard to the physiological understanding of metabolic cost and movement.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, we were wrong (or at least incomplete) in our thinking. We sincerely appreciate you pointing this out. Your insights not only affect the current manuscript (and the elimination of energetics from it) but also how we are thinking about on-going studies in our lab. In the revised manuscript, our interpretations are now focused more on how fluctuating levels of arousal predict motor output and coordination. We refrain from making strong causal statements in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Subsection “Mature contact call production and locomotor activity become increasingly coordinated during development”: This discussion would read very differently if the constraint were seen more like discussed above.</p></disp-quote><p>This discussion is now focused around using fluctuating arousal levels to predict motor output.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Final sentence of subsection “Mature contact call production and locomotor activity become increasingly coordinated during development”: This statement may have to be revised if calibrations at different ages were available.</p></disp-quote><p>Analyses on changes of “energy expenditure” across development have been removed from the revised analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Materials and methods: It is not clear how baseline heart rate was determined. Because metabolic cost of locomotion is not restricted in time to the actual duration of movement, but elevated metabolism continues after the movement, the timing of call production relative to locomotion is very important. This issue is very critical, if the costs of locomotion and vocalization are to be disentangled. It is also not clear how z-scores were calculated to make data comparable over developmental time.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see response above for a discussion of what we meant by “baseline” and how we used heart rate percentiles to standardize arousal dynamics across sessions. We agree that dynamic changes in physiological condition are important. For this reason, we continue to include a version of Figure 4, which shows arousal fluctuations surrounding call production and locomotor activity (this analysis is new and described in the Results). Our data suggest that vocal-locomotor behaviors occur during arousal states that have shifted well before (&gt; 10 s) the behaviors occur, and so averages should help to capture these more drastic changes. Given that the manuscript is no longer focused on trying to disentangle the energy costs of behaviors, the nuisances of timing should be less of a concern.</p><p>[Editors' note: responses to the first round of re-review follow.]</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>We respectfully but wholly disagree with this reviewer’s assessment of our statistical approach but we appreciate the opportunity to clarify what we did.

Therefore, the reviewer's inference that the small (in his/her opinion) p-value is automatically a consequence of the &quot;wrong&quot; sample size is not correct. For example, if you have a sample of dependent variable that is [1,2,3] and a corresponding sample of a predictors that is [2,3,4] the correlation value is 1 and p-value is smaller than 0.00000001, although the sample size is only 3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>This is a problem. I will need to see the breakdown of within and between subject results, and how p values were computed to confirm, but looking at the raw data, I am almost sure that p values are wrong.

To mitigate against this possibility, we repeated the regressions for individual subjects separately and found similar results.

The metabolic data and associated argumentation have been taken out. In its place, the heart rate data were used to assess &quot;arousal&quot;. &quot;Arousal&quot; is a vague concept and is not defined very well in this manuscript. Whereas I do not see the issues as critical as in the case of metabolism, I am not clear on whether or not the problem of disentangling metabolism related to locomotion from emotional influences has been solved any better here.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for not explicitly defining “arousal” in the manuscript. It is in fact a very clearly defined concept even to the degree that investigators can study the genetics of arousal (see the work of Donald Pfaff of Rockefeller University). We have used “arousal” as a focus in three of our recent manuscripts without incident (Zhang and Ghazanfar, 2016; Borjon et al., 2016; Liao et al., 2018 PNAS).</p><p>In the revised Introduction, we define “arousal” in the following manner: “An animal would be said to exhibit a high arousal state if it is more alert to sensory stimuli, more motorically active and more reactive (Pfaff, 2006). The role of arousal is essentially a means of allocating metabolic energy (i.e., preparing the body for action).”</p><p>It is worth noting that “arousal” is separate from “emotions” or “affect”. Both positive and negative affects could be associated with the same level of arousal.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Perhaps I still do not understand it correctly, but the issue of baseline data has in my opinion also not been resolved satisfactorily. Namely, the interpretation of whether or not and how much heart rate increased depends on the period of baseline measurement.</p></disp-quote><p>With apologies, we see that our use of the word “baseline” in the revised manuscript is still quite misleading. What we meant in those areas of the manuscript is that the observed real-time and developmental fluctuations in heart rate are outside the 95% threshold of bootstrapped significance tests (i.e., shuffled permutations of the data). In the revised manuscript, we have taken out the word “baseline” completely and now refer specifically to how observed data changes relative to the 95% threshold of the bootstrap significance tests.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I am not sure I understand what a session is (letter) for which the normalized data are taken. Is it the period before and after as outlined in the manuscript?</p></disp-quote><p>“Sessions” are 10-minute observations (taken every ~1-3 days) of infants. All behavioral and physiological data presented in this manuscript were collected during these observation sessions and not from before and/or after the observation sessions. In the revised manuscript, we are more careful to refer to sessions specifically as “observation sessions” so that the intended meaning is clearer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Certainly, different locomotor activity during these periods will make comparisons very difficult. Because locomotor behavior increases with maturity level, so will the associated heart rates. To what degree it is a change in arousal, can therefore only be said with confidence if the two influences on heart rate can be disentangled.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this comment. We believe we created some confusion regarding how we re-scaled the heart rate data so that fluctuations can be compared within and across observation sessions. We describe this process in more detail in the Materials and methods section.</p><p>Locomotor activity also goes through a re-scaling process within observation sessions, which we describe in more detail in the Materials and methods. It is important to stress here that we are not attempting to compare absolute levels of heart rate and locomotion but rather relative levels of heart rate (percentiles ranging from 0 to 100) and locomotion (smoothed binary ranging from 0 to 1) fluctuations (Appendix 1). In other words, if the heart rate percentile during a contact call is a 100 and the locomotor activity is a 1, that would mean that an infant was mobile with a high heart rate relative to the all data from the same 10-minute observation session.</p><p>Another concern this reviewer may have is that any associations between heart rate and locomotor activity during contact calls are a mere by-product of age. To mitigate this possibility, we tested associations between heart rate and locomotion (during phee calls) for one- and two-month old infants separately. We found a positive association for both age groups and report these findings in the revised manuscript:</p><p>“Moreover, this positive association characterized infants that were both one month old (1-30 days; n = 1,705 calls, β ± SE = 14.84 ± 4.62, t = 3.21, p = 0.0013) and two months old (31-61 days; n = 2,261 calls, β ± SE = 7.19 ± 3.51, t = 2.05, p = 0.0407). This means that a positive association between locomotor activity and heart rate percentiles was not simply a by-product of age.”</p><p>[Editors' note: responses to the second round of re-review follow.]</p><p>Reviewer #4:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major concerns:</p><p>1) Authors use LMM which is fine. They say they have infants as random effect and that is fine too, but I wonder how could authors get with 7 monkeys p&lt;0.0001? I looked at the tables with per-animal results. The variability is high in the coefficients per monkey, sometimes with results of opposite directions. Treating them as a sample does not yield the precision near to that claimed.</p></disp-quote><p>We understand this reviewer’s concern and we made effort to make the analysis and code more transparent and reproducible. We think that making the data, code, and the model assumptions clear should solve this issue. The reader can now easily check our statistical results and be convinced (or not) by our evidence. The complete answer is in the response to the next comment.</p><p>Because this issue with the interpretation of the p-value came out in the previous reviewing round too, and we failed to explain it adequately (partly because we failed to provide the code to the reviewer), we wanted to clarify some points that we think are relevant. Treating each monkey regression coefficient as a sample makes the analysis underpowered. The reason is because the coefficient is not a “single data point”, but the result of a regression line fitted to several data points. As an extreme example, if we have two regression lines and wanted to test whether the coefficients were different or not, we would not say that the sample size is one in each group, because that would preclude any reasonable statistical inference. Obviously, our situation is more complex as we would like to make a generalization to the population. That is why we considered a mixed effect model to increase the statistical power (type II error) of our models. Maybe at more fundamental level, the p-value is not a measure of precision nor of the strength for evidence of the claims. It is simply the probability that we observe a value as extreme as in the data given that the null hypothesis of no effect is correct. The value will depend on the distribution of the alternative hypothesis that is unknown.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) I cannot exclude the possibility that authors may be right, BUT when submitting such an analysis reproducible computing is a must. The statistical model itself should be specified and the entire code made available. I think that giving this information is minimal requirement, but making the code and the data available at this stage so that reproducibility could be checked is already a requirement made by leading journals and here it is crucial.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that it is crucial that the analyses are more transparent and reproducible. We have addressed this concern in three ways. First, we describe the linear regression models in greater detail in the Data Analysis section. We explicitly state every component of the models (dependent variables, fixed effects, and random effects) and include the model equations used to generate the results in the R script. Second, in Appendix 1, we provide detailed R software output from the population-level regression models (formulas, random effect variance, fixed effect and intercept estimates, standard errors, t values and p values), as well as the output from models run on individual monkeys. Having this appendix will allow interested readers to examine several aspects of the regression models without having to download the datasets and R/Matlab scripts. Third, with the current submission we provide via dryad all data and code needed to run the regression models (R script and.csv data files) and generate the figures (Matlab script and.mat data files).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) In particular in this case, it is important to know whether the model considered sessions as nested within monkeys or not. It will have great impact, and you cannot tell it from the information authors provided.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that the treatment of random effects as nested or not could have great impact. To avoid any doubt, we followed the recommendation to keep the mixed effect structure maximal (Barr et al., 2013). This means in particular that, whenever possible, we have the variables as both fixed and random effect, keeping the nesting. We re-formulated the majority of regression models to include postnatal day (i.e., sessions) nested within infant subjects (i.e., monkeys) as the random effect. We now include more detailed descriptions of the regression models and their formulas so that it is clear that the nested random effects are used (see response 2). The new regression models had a subtle influence on the statistical outcomes (updated estimates, t-values, and p-values are presented). However, these changes were not large enough to sway the statistical significance at the p &lt; 0.05 level or our interpretation of the models.</p><p>Barr DJ, Levy R, Scheepers C, Tilye HJ (2013) Random effects structure for confirmatory hypothesis testing: Keep it maximal. <italic>J Mem Lang</italic> 68: 255-278.

In order to enhance replicability of their results, when the experiment will be conducted on another set of monkeys the random slopes inference is important (Then the models should be ~Day + Day/Subject)</p><p>The analyses for individuals is appropriate so it lets assess how serious this flaw is.</p><p>Sometimes it is very inappropriate: HeartRatePercentileMean~CallType_Cry0Phee1</p><p>The estimated same slope is is 3.6 and StanError.96</p><p>The individual ones are 1.09, -4.9, 6.4, 3.4, -0.9, 10.8, 7.7 and from these 7 values the standard errors about 2.</p><p>Sometimes it will be more reasonable and the conclusion will probably remain unchanged.</p><p>The estimated same slope is is.25 and StanError.06</p><p>The individual ones are.25,.39,.11,.25,.2,.11,.11, and from these 7 values the standard errors about.04</p></disp-quote><p>Following the reviewer’s recommendation, we changed the generalized and linear mixed model formulas to include random slopes (described in detail in Material and Methods – Data Analysis). These changes to the model formulas resulted in more conservative estimates, standard errors, t-values, and p-values. The main conclusions of our study did not change.</p><p>a) The vocal behavior develops faster than posture/locomotion behaviors.</p><p>b) Locomotor activity is reduced during mature calls; vocal-locomotor coordination improves across development.</p><p>c) Mature calls are produced at elevated arousal; arousal levels are higher during vocal-locomotor coordination.</p><p>We are now confident that our statistical output is an accurate representation of the data structure and is fully reproducible.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) When modelling individual events within the day (from Analysis 1.5 on) all observations within a day (up to 50) are assumed independent.</p><p>In such longitudinal data within the day correlations from observation to the next one are expected to be high.</p><p>This hampers analyses of individuals as well producing to optimistic standard errors and small p-values.</p><p>A simple way out is to construct a daily summary.</p></disp-quote><p>Following the reviewer’s advice, we constructed daily summaries and included them in the Appendix. These summary tables include per Day results where appropriate (i.e., for models with Day as a random effect term). The previous version of the manuscript only emphasized Subjects as a random effect term, whereas both Day and Subject are emphasized in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Adjusting for multiplicity is needed also when trying different models for heart rate, namely its dependency on different variables and in different subsets (1 month 2nd month etc)</p><p>With the current p-values not much will change in the conclusion, with new ones I do not know.</p></disp-quote><p>Following the reviewer’s recommendation, we’ve adjusted p-values to account for multiplicity issues in models involving heart rate. We still find an association between locomotor activity and arousal level during first month of development.</p></body></sub-article></article>
