these regions in decisions driven by accumulation of evidence have yet to be determined. Here, in rats performing an auditory evidence accumulation task, we inactivated the frontal orienting fields (FOF) and posterior parietal cortex (PPC), two rat cortical regions that have neural correlates of accumulating evidence and that have been proposed as central to decision-making. We used a detailed model of the decision process to analyze the effect of inactivations. Inactivation of the FOF induced substantial performance impairments that were quantitatively best described as an impairment in the output pathway of an evidence accumulator with a long integration time constant (&gt;240 ms). In contrast, we found a minimal role for PPC in decisions guided by accumulating auditory evidence, even while finding a strong role for PPC in internally-guided decisions.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05457.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05457.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05457.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Imagine that you have to buy a computer before the start of the school year. You have a few options, such as a laptop or a desktop, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. A laptop is relatively light and portable, whereas a desktop has more memory and is cheaper. You will gradually accumulate evidence for and against each option, but before school starts, you have to make a decision.</p><p>This gradual accumulation of evidence is an important element in many forms of decision making. It is known that the activity of many regions within the brain seem to represent accumulation of evidence, but relatively little is known about the causal role played by each region in the decision-making process. Now, by performing a series of experiments on rats, Erlich et al. have clarified the precise roles of two of these regions: the frontal orienting fields in prefrontal cortex and the posterior parietal cortex. In the experiments the rats listened to a series of clicks from two speakers, one to the left and one to the right, and then had to decide if more clicks came from the left or the right speaker.</p><p>The rats normally used all of the accumulated evidence (up to 1 second) for their decision. When the posterior parietal cortex was silenced (using a drug called muscimol), the rats continued to use all of the evidence available to them. However, when the frontal orienting fields were silenced (again using muscimol), decisions were driven only by evidence accumulated over the most recent past (just a few hundred milliseconds). So in the computer example, without the help of the frontal orienting fields, you would choose the laptop if the most recent piece of evidence was for the laptop, even if older evidence argued strongly for the desktop.</p><p>These results show that the frontal orienting fields are necessary for making decisions based on accumulated evidence, but further experiments suggested that the accumulation process itself seems to happen elsewhere in the brain. Another set of related experiments showed that the posterior parietal cortex is involved in a different type of decision making, namely ‘free choice’ decisions in which the rat decides between two options when there is no correct answer, such as picking a cookie from a pile of identical cookies.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05457.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05457.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>decision-making</kwd><kwd>accumulation</kwd><kwd>inactivation</kwd><kwd>modeling</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>International Student Research fellow</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Duan</surname><given-names>Chunyu A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Investigator</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brody</surname><given-names>Carlos D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F32MH098572</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hanks</surname><given-names>Timothy D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Quantitative modeling of inactivations shows the prefrontal cortex (but not parietal cortex) of the rat is obligatory for decisions guided by evidence accumulating longer than 240 ms.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Gradual accumulation of evidence for or against different choices has been implicated in many types of decision-making, including value-based decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Basten et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Milosavljevic et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cavanagh et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hunt et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Solway and Botvinick, 2012</xref>), social decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Krajbich and Rangel, 2011</xref>), economic decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gluth et al., 2012</xref>), gambling decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Busemeyer and Townsend, 1993</xref>), memory-based decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Ratcliff, 1978</xref>), numerical comparison decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Sigman and Dehaene, 2005</xref>), visual search decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Purcell et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Heitz and Schall, 2012</xref>), and perceptual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gold and Shadlen, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Ratcliff et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mante et al., 2013</xref>) decisions.

In separate work from our laboratory using the Poisson Clicks task, electrophysiological recordings in rat PPC and Frontal Orienting Fields (FOF; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Erlich et al., 2011</xref>) revealed classic neural correlates of evidence accumulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hanks et al., 2015</xref>). Specifically, we found neurons in these rat regions that ramp up their activity during the stimulus, and the slope of that ramp is correlated with the strength of the momentary evidence just as one would expect from neurons whose firing rates represent the accumulation of evidence over time, and just as previously reported in monkey regions that have been suggested as analogous to the rat PPC and FOF (primate PPC: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Shadlen and Newsome, 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Roitman and Shadlen, 2002</xref>; and monkey FEF: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ding and Gold, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mante et al., 2013</xref>; for PPC analogy, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Whitlock et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Reep and Corwin, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Wilber et al., 2014</xref>; for FOF/FEF analogy see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Erlich et al., 2011</xref>).<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05457.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Poisson clicks accumulation task trials and interleaved side LED trials.</title><p>Each accumulation task trial begins with the onset of the center LED, which signals to the rat to enter the center port. The subject holds his nose in the center port for 2 s, until the center LED offset, which is the go cue. The majority of trials (90%) are accumulation trials. On accumulation trials, clicks play from the right and left speakers (right + left click rate = 40 clicks/s), terminating with the go cue. After the go cue reward is available at the side port associated with the greater number of clicks. The stimulus duration on each trial is set by the experimenter to be in the range 0.1–1 s. On Side LED trials, no sound is played during the fixation period and one of the side ports is illuminated once the rat withdraws from the center port to indicate that reward is available there.

Accumulation of evidence involves both maintaining a memory of evidence accrued so far and addition of new evidence to the memory, and is therefore linked to short-term memory processes. The rat FOF has delay activity that correlates with short-term memory, and plays a causal role in short-term memory for future orienting responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Erlich et al., 2011</xref>). Furthermore, the rat FOF is well-situated to play an important role in perceptual decision-making, since it receives inputs from multiple sensory cortices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Condé et al., 1995</xref>), and it projects to the superior colliculus (SC; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Stuesse and Newman, 1990</xref>), a subcortical region that, in both rodents and primates, is involved in controlling orienting motions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Isa and Sasaki, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Felsen and Mainen, 2008</xref>) and is thought to be involved in decisions reported through such orienting motions. Moreover, the rat FOF is reciprocally connected with the rat PPC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Reep et al., 1987</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">1994</xref>), which is currently considered a critical, central node in rodent perceptual decision-making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Carandini and Churchland, 2013</xref>). The rodent PPC itself also has neural correlates of accumulating evidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hanks et al., 2015</xref>), and it shares with the FOF some of the key properties that suggest a causal role in decisions driven by accumulation of evidence. The rodent PPC has delay activity that correlates with performance on short-term memory tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Nakamura, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Harvey et al., 2012</xref>), and, as shown through inactivations, plays a causal role in short-term memory for orienting acts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Harvey et al., 2012</xref>) and like FOF receives input from many sensory cortices as well as top-down input from prefrontal cortex, including FOF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Wilber et al., 2014</xref>). For these reasons, the FOF and the PPC are the most prominent candidate regions in rodent association cortex for being important nodes in orienting decisions guided by accumulation of evidence. We focus on these two areas here.</p><p>We implanted bilateral cannula in both FOF and PPC of rats trained to perform the Poisson Clicks task, and inactivated these regions with the GABA-A agonist muscimol while the rats performed the task. Consistent with expectations drawn from neural correlates in the rat FOF, inactivation of the FOF impaired performance in the task. We used quantitative modeling to characterize which aspect of the accumulation and decision process was impacted by inactivation of the FOF. The results of these analyses revealed a specific location for the FOF in the causal circuit underlying the Poisson Clicks behavior: the behavioral impairment caused by FOF infusions could be parsimoniously and quantitatively explained as an impairment in the premotor output pathway of an evidence accumulator with a long accumulation time constant (240 ms or more). It is possible that the decision itself (i.e., the categorization of the graded accumulator value into a discrete choice, which is a process subsequent to graded evidence accumulation) could occur in the FOF.</p><p>In contrast, we found that PPC inactivations had a relatively minor effect on the Poisson Clicks task. This was true even while the same PPC inactivations had strong effects on interleaved ‘free-choice’ trials, in which no sensory evidence was provided and rats were rewarded regardless of their choice of response. Our data thus suggest that the PPC plays a minimal causal role in decisions guided by accumulation of auditory evidence, while playing an important role in internally-guided decisions.</p><p>Together, our findings from inactivations of the PPC and the FOF provide important constraints on the neural circuitry underlying decisions guided by accumulation of auditory evidence in the rat.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Behavior</title><p>We trained male Long-Evans rats (n = 14 rats) on the Poisson Clicks accumulation task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brunton et al., 2013</xref>). On each trial of this task, illumination of the center LED indicated that the rat should place its nose in the center port and remain there while click trains with Poisson-generated inter-click-intervals were played from the left and right speakers.

On side LED trials no sounds were played during fixation. Immediately after the end of fixation, one of the two side ports was illuminated, indicating availability of reward at the lit port (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The right and left side LED trials, together, comprised ≈10% of the total trials.</p><p>To demonstrate that subjects accumulated the sensory evidence provided by the auditory clicks, we fit an accumulator model using the individual click times and the rats' choices on each trial (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brunton et al., 2013</xref>). Different parameter value regimes of this model can implement many different strategies, such as responding based on the first few clicks, or last few clicks, or to a burst of clicks, and many others. Consistent with previous results, maximum likelihood fits resulted in best-fit parameters associated with a gradual evidence accumulation strategy. Most importantly for this study, this strategy was characterized by a long accumulator time-constant, just under 1 s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>), which is the duration of the longest stimuli used here. As expected for a gradual accumulation strategy in which clicks from the entire stimulus are weighted equally, performance improved for longer stimuli with the same underlying click rates (<xref

For the first bilateral FOF inactivation session we infused 300 ng of muscimol per side, for a total of 600 ng. After these infusions rats did not perform the task. We subsequently used a smaller dose of 75 ng per side (Note: this is half the dose used in the bilateral PPC experiment described below). This resulted in a significant 10.3% decrement on performance on accumulation trials (p = 0.018, GLMM test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).

Averaged across all unilateral FOF infusion sessions, the ipsilateral bias (defined as ipsilateral % correct − contralateral % correct), was 52 ± 7% (mean ± s.e.) for accumulation trials (<italic>t</italic>-test across 12 rats <italic>t</italic><sub>11</sub> = 7.27, p &lt; 10<sup>−4</sup>; two rats in group 3 failed to perform sufficient numbers of trials during FOF inactivations to be included in this analysis).

The ipsilateral bias induced by FOF inactivation was highly reproducible: 87% (26/30) of individual infusion sessions resulted in a positive ipsilateral bias (sign-test, p &lt; 0.001), and in every single rat there were more rightward responses after rightward infusions than leftward infusions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3B</xref>).</p><p>Importantly, as in the bilateral inactivations, there was no significant effect on side LED trials (<italic>t</italic>-test <italic>t</italic><sub>5</sub> = 1.55, p &gt; 0.15; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, side LED Trials), nor did unilateral FOF inactivations have an effect on the response time on side LED trials (repeated-measures ANOVA, F(1,3) = 0.65, p &gt; 0.4). This indicates that the effect of FOF inactivation was not simply an overall motor effect. Furthermore, the inactivations produced no observable effects outside of the behavioral task. Infused animals appeared normal in their home cages both immediately after the infusion and after the behavioral session. Our localized inactivations thus contrast with previous literature, in which large permanent unilateral lesions of the rat prefrontal cortex (including but extending well beyond the FOF), produced persistent, ipsiversive circling in the lesioned animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Crowne and Pathria, 1982</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Bilateral FOF inactivations reduce the subjects' accumulation time constant</title><p>Which aspects of the evidence accumulation and decision process were impaired by the FOF inactivations? To address this question, we took advantage of the accumulator model of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brunton et al. (2013)</xref>, which uses the knowledge the precise time of each click in each individual trial, as well as the rat's decision on each trial, to estimate 9 parameters that characterize the accumulation and decision processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Each parameter quantifies a specific aspect of the decision process. For example, <italic>τ</italic>, the time constant of the accumulator (also described by the parameter <italic>λ</italic> = 1/<italic>τ</italic>), characterizes the time period over which the subject accumulates evidence. A negative value of <italic>λ</italic> indicates a leaky accumulator, a positive value of <italic>λ</italic> indicates an unstable accumulator, and perfect accumulation would have <italic>τ</italic> = ∞ (i.e., <italic>λ</italic> = 0). Another example parameter is the lapse rate, which quantifies the fraction of trials in which the subject behaves as if it had ignored the clicks that were played and had instead made its decision randomly. Deviations from the perfect values (<italic>λ</italic> = 0, lapse = 0) in either of these parameters can give rise to psychometric curves with shallow slopes, and both types of imperfections can produce curves qualitatively similar to the experimental curve obtained after bilateral FOF inactivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). But the similarity between the psychometric curves for the two imperfections is partly due to the fact that these psychometric curves ignore the specific timing of individual clicks. In contrast, because the two imperfections would have very different signatures in terms of how clicks at different times affect the rats' decisions, and click timing is fully taken into account in the behavioral model, the model can clearly distinguish the two imperfections. Using the control data, the best-fitting parameter values for the behavioral model had <italic>τ</italic> ≈ 0.8 s–indicating that subjects accumulated information over almost the entire stimulus duration but were on average slightly unstable–and a lapse rate of ≈0.1 (black cross, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). For data from bilateral inactivation sessions, the maximum likelihood parameter values (center of blue likelihood peak, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) changed significantly. The inactivation data now had a dramatically different and much shorter accumulation time constant of the opposite sign to the control data, <italic>τ</italic> ≈ −0.24 s (leaky accumulation over only a quarter of a second). In contrast, the best-fitting lapse rate remained essentially unchanged from control. As described above, attempting to fit the inactivation data by keeping the time constant unchanged and increasing the lapse rate could qualitatively match the psychometric curve (magenta line, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), but it produced an extremely poor fit relative to the full behavioral model (magenta cross in low likelihood region, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Thus, after bilateral FOF inactivation, the subjects behaved as if their lapse rate was unchanged, and their accumulator had become much leakier (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>).<fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05457.011</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Bilateral FOF inactivation is best fit as a reduction in the time-constant of accumulation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) When analyzed in terms of the psychometric function, changes to either lapse rate alone or accumulation time constant alone can match the bilateral FOF inactivation data.

Based on this analysis, only two parameters shifted significantly from the control data: <italic>λ</italic> (95% C.I. = [−7.91 −1.31]; control value was 1.22) and Þ (95% C.I. = [0.10 1.50]; control value was 0.065). The change in <italic>λ</italic> is both significant and substantial, and accounts for most of the change in performance. The change in decision boundary, Þ (pronounced ‘sho’) is significant but very small, corresponding a horizontal shift in the psychometric curve of only one click. It is largely due to the difficulty of performing a perfectly balanced bilateral infusion. In particular, one rat, A077, was strongly biased during the bilateral FOF inactivations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3A</xref>). On average, the noise and lapse parameters also increased but due to large covariance between these parameters, it is not possible to say which of them was significantly shifted (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>).</p><p>To further examine the relative contributions of the <italic>λ</italic> and Þ changes we fit two 1-parameter models. First, we fit the bilateral FOF data with a 1-parameter Þ model where only the decision boundary could change and the other 8 parameters were fixed at their best control data values. The log likelihood of the best Þ model was −1221.6, substantially worse than the model in which all 9 parameters were allowed to vary (−1102.5). Using Bayesian or Akaike Information Criteria (BIC or AIC; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Burnham and Anderson, 2004</xref>), we find that the extra parameters are indeed justified (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). Second, we fit the bilateral FOF data to a 1-parameter <italic>λ</italic> model where only the accumulation time-constant could change. For this model, the best-fit value of <italic>λ</italic> was −12.4 and the log likelihood of the model was −1121.1 compared to −1102.5 for the best 9-parameter model, a difference of only 18.5. According to BIC, the 1-parameter model is the more likely model, supporting the idea that the major effect of bilateral FOF inactivation was a change in the time constant of accumulation (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>).<table-wrap id="tbl2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05457.013</object-id><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Bilateral FOF model comparison</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05457.013">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05457.013</ext-link></p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Model</th><th># of param.</th><th>Log likelihood</th><th>BIC</th><th>AIC</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>full model</td><td>9</td><td>−1102.5</td><td>2272.5</td><td>2223<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="tblfn3">†</xref></td></tr><tr><td>Þ model</td><td>1</td><td>−1221.6</td><td>2450.7</td><td>2445.2</td></tr><tr><td><italic>λ</italic> model</td><td>1</td><td>−1121.1</td><td>2249.7<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="tblfn2">*</xref></td><td>2244.2</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>This table shows the three models fit to the bilateral FOF data (n = 1809 trials).</p></fn><fn id="tblfn2"><label>*</label><p>indicates the model with the lowest (the most likely) Bayesian information criterion (BIC).</p></fn><fn id="tblfn3"><label>†</label><p>indicates the model with the lowest (most informative) Akaike information criterion (AIC).</p></fn><fn><p>In this case, the AIC and BIC select different models, suggesting a better model may be somewhere in between.

Leaky accumulation with a time constant <italic>τ</italic> ≈ −0.24 s would result in short trials (with a stimulus duration less than a quarter of a second) being essentially unimpaired, while long duration trials would be more strongly impaired. This was indeed observed in the data, with a tight correspondence between the quantitative model and experimental data (chronometric curves, shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). A further property of a leaky accumulator is that the more recent the clicks are, with respect to the end of the stimulus, the bigger their impact on the subject's decision. This was also observed in the data, again with a tight correspondence between quantitative model and experimental data (reverse correlation analysis, shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>).</p><p>These results indicate that the FOF is either (a) itself directly involved in the process of accumulating evidence, and the inactivations made the accumulator leaky; or (b) the FOF is a requisite component in the output pathway of an accumulator with a long time constant, that is, the FOF is part of the chain of regions that transform evidence accumulated with a time-constant longer than 0.24 s into an orienting decision.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Unilateral FOF inactivations produce a post-categorization bias</title><p>We also used an accumulator model to analyze the strong ipsilateral bias induced by unilateral FOF inactivations. The original model of Brunton et al. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>) contains only one parameter, the decision boundary Þ, that can generate a left/right bias. We therefore extended the model with three additional parameters, each of which represented a possible imperfection that could generate a side bias. Simultaneously fitting all 12 parameters substantially increased the computational difficulty of the fitting process. In particular, efficiently fitting the original model was made possible by analytical computation of the gradient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brunton et al., 2013</xref>). Determining the gradient for 12 parameter model was outside the scope of this manuscript. We consequently took the strategy of first fitting the original 9-parameter model to the control data from 1 day before infusion sessions, and then, starting from those best-fitting parameter values, asking which of the bias-inducing single-parameter changes would best fit the data from the unilateral FOF inactivations (other parameters were held fixed at the control data best-fit values). In other words, we asked, ‘if we changed only one parameter, which one would it be to best fit the data?’ Finding the maximum likelihood value was made practical by the fact that each of the four fits performed was a single-parameter fit.</p><p>The four single-parameter changes we considered corresponded to hypotheses regarding possible functions of the FOF, and are conceptually illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>. (a) First, we considered the possibility that the FOF is part of the output pathway of the accumulator, perhaps part of computing or representing the animal's discrete choice after having categorized the accumulator value (into ‘Go Right’ vs ‘Go Left’ categories) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hanks et al., 2015</xref>), potentially in the service of preparing a motor action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Erlich et al., 2011</xref>). Unilaterally perturbing the FOF might then bias this post-categorization representation. To implement this idea in the model, we added a parameter that biased outcomes after the R/L decision was made on each trial. Independently of the stimulus that led to the decision, we let a randomly-chosen fraction, <italic>κ</italic><sub><italic>R</italic></sub>, of right decisions and a randomly-chosen fraction <italic>κ</italic><sub><italic>L</italic></sub> of left decisions be reversed (i.e., R → L and L → R; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). These reversals scale the vertical endpoints of the psychometric curve towards the Went Right = 50% level. The scaling is biased when <italic>κ</italic><sub><italic>R</italic></sub> ≠ <italic>κ</italic><sub><italic>L</italic></sub>. (b) Next, we considered the possibility that since the FOF has been suggested as analogous to primate FEF, perturbing it might affect attentional processes, perhaps causing a lateralized sensory neglect that would bias the perceptual impact of auditory clicks from the two different sides. In other words, during unilateral inactivation, right and left clicks could have different magnitudes of their impact on the accumulating evidence (<italic>C</italic><sub><italic>R</italic></sub> and <italic>C</italic><sub><italic>L</italic></sub>, instead of the single common <italic>C</italic> of <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ4">Equation 1</xref> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). We described this as a ‘unbalanced input gain’ (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). (c) We next considered the possibility that the FOF plays a role in the accumulation process itself, and quantified biases in accumulation through an ‘accumulation shift’ that shifts the value of the accumulator, <italic>a</italic>, at the end of the stimulus (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, equivalent to Þ in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Changes in this parameter will cause horizontal shifts in the psychometric curve. (d) In the fourth and final model, we considered a second possible form of lateralized sensory neglect, in the form of ‘unbalanced input noise’ (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). In this version of the model, right and left clicks could have different signal-to-noise ratios by having different values of the sensory noise parameter (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf4"><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>σ</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>R</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msubsup></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf5"><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>σ</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>L</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msubsup></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>, instead of the single common <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf6"><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>σ</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msubsup></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). For each of models (a), (b), and (d), the original fit to the control data was constrained to be balanced. To fit the bias generated by unilateral FOF inactivation, that constraint was relaxed. For each model, we kept the corresponding ipsilateral parameter fixed, and let the contralateral parameter be free to best fit the data. The difference between the best-fitting contralateral parameter minus the ipsilateral parameter was then defined as the bias for that model.<fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05457.014</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Conceptual illustration of four model parameters, used to quantify different sources of a lateralized bias.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Post-categorization bias: after categorizing the accumulator value into ‘Go Left’ or ‘Go Right’ decisions, a fraction, <italic>κ</italic><sub><italic>L</italic></sub>, of Left decisions are reversed into Right decisions, and a fraction, <italic>κ</italic><sub><italic>R</italic></sub>, are reversed from Right to Left.

For each of the 30 unilateral FOF infusion sessions, we fit the 4 models to the 29 other sessions and then evaluated the likelihood of the fit on the left-out session. Using this approach we found a significant main effect of model on likelihood/trial (repeated-measures ANOVA F(3,87) = 10.76, p &lt; 10<sup>−5</sup>) and Bonferroni-Holm corrected post-hoc <italic>t</italic>-tests reveal that all models were significantly different from each other (p &lt; 0.005) except the noise and accumulator shift models (p &gt; 0.4).</p><p>To ask whether a combination of changes to two parameters could provide a significantly better description of the data than our single-parameter fits, we estimated the 2-dimensional likelihood surface for the two best models. This surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>) clearly demonstrated that fitting the data requires a large shift away from the balanced control value in the post-categorization bias, but not in input gain. Thus, the dominant effect of unilateral FOF inactivation could be parsimoniously explained by a post-categorization bias, consistent with the known role of the FOF in movement planning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Erlich et al., 2011</xref>). As described above, a feature of the post-categorization model is that the psychometric curve after unilateral inactivations should be a vertical scaling of the control psychometric curve. This scaling was found in the data, with a tight correspondence between the curve generated by the quantitative model and the experimental psychometric curve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). A similar tight correspondence between model and data were also found for the chronometric curves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>) and the reverse correlation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>).</p><p>Although computationally challenging, we have also explored whether higher dimensional models might reveal a different set of results. Using the Metropolis–Hastings algorithm, we estimated the best-fit posterior distribution for an 8-parameter model.

For computational tractability, the remaining 4 parameters (initial noise, bounds, and the two click adaptation parameters) were fixed at the values of the best-fit control model. With 40,000 samples of this 8 dimensional distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>), we estimate that four parameters changed significantly from their control values. First, accumulator noise increased from 5 × 10<sup>−4</sup> to 0.746 (95% C.I. = [0.125 12.123], p = 10<sup>−4</sup>), which is still a small value and would have a negligible impact on behavioral performance. Second, accumulator shift changed from 0.065 to 0.323 ([0.136 0.890], p = 0.013), which would also have a minimal effect on overall reward rate. Third, <italic>κ</italic><sub><italic>I</italic></sub>, the changes from ipsi to contra choices decreased from 0.102 to 0.029 ([0.002 0.071], p = 10<sup>−4</sup>). Finally, supporting our earlier analysis, <italic>κ</italic><sub><italic>C</italic></sub>, increased from 0 to 0.498 ([0.176 0.536], p &lt; 10<sup>−3</sup>) which results in a very substantial behavioral impact, since this sets the asymptotic performance on the easiest contralateral trials to ≈50%. As in the 2D model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>) the gain of contralateral clicks increased (although not significantly). The likelihood of the best 8-parameter model was only marginally higher than the best 1-parameter post-categorization model (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>), consistent with the small shifts in the other parameters (log likelihood of the 8-D model: −1957.52; log likelihood of the 1-D model: −1963.08). Using AIC and BIC we find that the increase in likelihood is too small to justify the increase in number of parameters.<table-wrap id="tbl3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05457.018</object-id><label>Table 3.</label><caption><p>Unilateral FOF model comparison</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05457.018">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05457.018</ext-link></p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Model</th><th># of parameters</th><th>Log likelihood</th><th>BIC</th><th>AIC</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Post-categorization bias</td><td>1</td><td>−1963.1</td><td>3934.4<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="tblfn4">*</xref></td><td>3928.2<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="tblfn5">†</xref></td></tr><tr><td>Unbalanced input gain</td><td>1</td><td>−2013.1</td><td>4034.4</td><td>4028.2</td></tr><tr><td>Accumulator shift</td><td>1</td><td>−2217.4</td><td>4443.0</td><td>4436.8</td></tr><tr><td>Unbalanced input noise</td><td>1</td><td>−2272.7</td><td>4553.7</td><td>4547.4</td></tr><tr><td>8-parameter model</td><td>8</td><td>−1957.5</td><td>3981.1</td><td>3949.9</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>This table shows the three models fit to the unilateral FOF data (n = 3836 trials).</p></fn><fn id="tblfn4"><label>*</label><p>indicates the model with the lowest Bayesian information criteria (BIC), that is, the most likely model.</p></fn><fn id="tblfn5"><label>†</label><p>indicates the model with the lowest Akaike information criteria (AIC), that is, the most informative model.</p></fn><fn><p>The 1-parameter post-categorization model has the lowest AIC and BIC, supporting the view that the major effect of unilateral FOF inactivation is not related to the accumulation process per se.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></p><p>One of the characteristics of a post-categorization bias model is that since the biasing process occurs after the accumulated evidence has been categorized into ‘Go Right’ or ‘Go Left’, the bias is independent of whether trials are easy (large value of |#<italic>R</italic> − #<italic>L clicks</italic>|) or difficult (small value of |#<italic>R</italic> − #<italic>L clicks</italic>|). To further probe this hypothesis, we randomly intermixed regular accumulation trials with a new set of unusually easy ‘single-sided’ trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). In these trials the speaker from only one side produced clicks at 100 clicks/s (noticeably higher than the 40 Hz rate on accumulation trials), lasting until the ‘Go’ signal indicating the end of center port fixation. Consistent with the post-categorization bias hypothesis, the unilateral FOF inactivations produced a vertically-scaled ipsilateral bias in these single-sided trials that was similar to that seen during the accumulation trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>, compare to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref> data): that is, the bias was independent of how easy or how difficult the trials were.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Unilateral PPC inactivations and comparison to unilateral FOF inactivations</title><p>Given that unilateral PPC lesions in rats lead to contralateral neglect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Crowne et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Reep et al., 2004</xref>), that PPC has been posited as central to rodent perceptual decision-making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Harvey et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Carandini and Churchland, 2013</xref>), and that neural correlates of the gradually accumulating evidence are found in PPC in our task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hanks et al., 2015</xref>), we predicted that unilateral PPC inactivations would cause a strong contralateral impairment (or, in other words, in the context of our binary forced-choice task, an ipsilateral bias, similar to that seen with the FOF inactivations). Surprisingly, our unilateral PPC inactivations resulted in a small effect that was ≈10× smaller than the effect in the FOF. The average ipsilateral bias was 4.2 ± 2.4% (mean ± s.e.)

However, no significant effect was found in any of the PPC infusion sessions in group 2 rats even on the first day of infusion (GLMM test, p = 0.92; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Notably, even extremely high doses (up to 2500 ng) of muscimol in PPC, were ineffective at biasing the rats on accumulation trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Thus, our data from group 2 suggest that the bias on the first day in group 1 occurred by chance.</p><p>Our PPC coordinates for group 1 and 2 (At 3.8 mm posterior and ≈3 mm lateral to Bregma) were based on the Paxinos and Watson rat atlas, the neural correlates of accumulation found at this location (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hanks et al., 2015</xref>) and several published studies of rat PPC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Paxinos and Watson, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Nitz, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Whitlock et al., 2012</xref>). Nevertheless, some authors have suggested that PPC is slightly more posterior: 4–6 mm posterior to Bregma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kolb and Walkey, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Wilber et al., 2014</xref>). We therefore repeated the PPC experiments with a third group of rats, this time implanting cannulae at 4.5 mm posterior to Bregma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Once again, as in group 2, there was no ipsilateral bias due to muscimol (at 300 ng) in the PPC (GLMM test, p = 0.47), nor was there a detectable effect on the first inactivation session.</p><p>Performance of side LED trials at regular muscimol doses (150 or 300 ng) was not significantly affected by PPC infusions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>; <italic>t</italic>-test <italic>t</italic><sub>7</sub> = 1.0, p &gt; 0.35), and the response times on these trials were also unaffected (repeated-measures ANOVA, F(1,6) = 2.48, p &gt; 0.15).

Given the very large muscimol doses used, and the fact that visual cortical areas lie immediately posterior to PPC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Paxinos and Watson, 2004</xref>), this weak correlation on side LED trials may be a result of spread of muscimol to the adjacent visual cortex.<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05457.021</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Summary of dose-bias relationship for all unilateral infusions.</title><p>Infusions into the FOF are in magenta and into the PPC are in yellow.

Based on the large doses used we suspected that the lack of effect was not due to a failure to inactivate PPC. There was no correlation between dose and bias magnitude in our PPC infusions on accumulation trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, yellow squares; p &gt; 0.09), strongly contrasting with the significant correlation between dose of muscimol infused into the FOF and bias on accumulation trials (accumulation trials <italic>r</italic> = 0.85, p &lt; 10<sup>−9</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, magenta squares). The correlation in the FOF data was specific to accumulation trials (p &gt; 0.5 for side LED trials; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, magenta circles).</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Bilateral PPC inactivations</title><p>It is possible that during unilateral inactivations, the silenced PPC may be compensated for by the PPC of the opposite hemisphere. In this case, bilateral inactivations of the PPC should produce a behavioral impairment markedly larger than any small impairment found after unilateral inactivations. To probe this hypothesis, we initially used a high dose (300 ng per side) for bilateral PPC infusions in group 1 rats, but only 2 of 6 rats completed trials, with inconsistent results. The maximum dose at which subjects still performed substantial numbers of trials was 150 ng per side, double the dose per side for the bilateral FOF inactivations described above. During the bilateral PPC inactivation sessions there was a very small but significant 3.6% decrease in performance on accumulation trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>, p &lt; 0.02 vs isoflurane, GLMM test). This effect was not individually significant in any rat (0/4). Critically, the effect size we found was not bigger–in fact, it was slightly smaller–than the average unilateral PPC effect, and thus does not provide support for the hypothesis of hemispheric compensation. Performance on side LED trials was not significantly different between bilateral PPC infusion and control sessions (<italic>t</italic>-test, p &gt; 0.4; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Fitting the accumulator model to the bilateral PPC data, we find that the only parameter to change was the lapse (but the confidence intervals overlapped with the control value), suggesting that the effects on performance were unrelated to any specific aspect of the accumulation process.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Free-choice trials</title><p>Our results from PPC contrasted with previous studies that found a strong effect of PPC inactivations in a mouse memory-guided navigation task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Harvey et al., 2012</xref>) and a strong effect of permanent unilateral PPC lesions in inducing contralateral neglect in rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Crowne et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Reep et al., 2004</xref>). This motivated us to seek a positive control task. The primate literature suggested an internally-guided decision task whose trials could be readily intermixed with our evidence accumulation task. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Wilke et al. (2012)</xref> interspersed regular memory-guided saccade trials (‘instructed’ trials), in which a single saccade target was presented on each trial, with internally-guided ‘free choice’ trials, in which both an ipsilateral and a contralateral target were presented, and the monkey was rewarded regardless of its response choice. By design, subjects were free to respond as they pleased in free choice trials, and they typically displayed a bias towards one side or another in these trials. Wilke et al. found that muscimol inactivation of area LIP within PPC produced no effect on choices in the instructed memory-guided saccade trials, but produced a profound ipsilateral bias during intermixed free choice trials. Inspired by Wilke et al.'s results, we modified the task for seven of our group 2 and group 3 cannulated rats (The six group 1 rats and one group 3 rat had been already sacrificed for histology). We randomly intermixed 25% free choice trials with 65% accumulation trials and 10% Side LED trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>). Free-choice trials were indicated by a lack of auditory click stimuli, and by illumination of both side LEDs after the animals had withdrawn from the center port. We refer to sessions with interleaved accumulation, side LED, and free-choice trials as ‘free-choice’ sessions. After a few free-choice sessions with no infusions, rats performed the mix of trials reliably, and expressed a consistent bias on free choice trials but no detectable bias on accumulation trials.<fig-group><fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05457.022</object-id><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Unilateral PPC inactivations induce a strong ipsilateral bias during internally guided decisions, and can induce a strong bias on accumulation trials if the FOF is bilaterally inactivated.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>–<bold>D</bold>) Effect of unilateral PPC or FOF inactivations on free choice trials intermixed with regular accumulation trials.

The free-choice bias was highly reproducible: 85% (23/27, sign-test, p &lt; 0.001) individual rat PPC inactivation sessions produced an increased fraction of ipsilateral free choices when compared to free choices on immediately preceding control days (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref> for an example of PPC infusions that were selected to ‘push’ the rats away from their innate preference seen on the day before and the day after the infusion). The effect on free choice trials was thus similar in its robustness and reproducibility to the effect of unilateral FOF inactivation on accumulation trials. These free choice trial inactivation results provide a clear positive control for our PPC inactivations. Moreover, they are consistent with the parietal neglect literature in both rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Crowne et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Reep et al., 2004</xref>) and primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mesulam, 1999</xref>).</p><p>Inactivation of FOF, like the PPC, also induced an ipsilateral bias on free choice trials (<italic>t</italic>-test, <italic>t</italic><sub>24</sub> = 3.86, p = 0.001).

To probe whether inactivation of the FOF could reveal an effect of PPC inactivation, we bilaterally inactivated the FOF while simultaneously infusing 300 ng of muscimol unilaterally into the PPC. This combination of infusions produced a significant 15.1% bias ipsilateral to the side of the PPC infusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9E</xref>, p &lt; 0.0012, GLMM test). These data constitute a second positive control for our unilateral PPC inactivations. The data furthermore suggest that during auditory evidence accumulation the PPC may have a real but weak influence on choice that is normally overridden by a stronger signal from the FOF.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In two-alternative forced choice tasks driven by accumulation of sensory evidence, such as the random dots task used with primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Newsome et al., 1989</xref>) or the Poisson Clicks task used here with rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brunton et al., 2013</xref>), subjects gradually accumulate evidence over time; make a decision by categorizing the graded value of the accumulated evidence into a binary choice; use their decision to prepare a movement; and finally execute their decision-reporting motor act (these different components could potentially overlap). In primates, five recurrently interconnected brain regions have been associated with the overall process (superior colliculus, striatum, PPC, FEF, and dlPFC; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Horwitz and Newsome, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kim and Shadlen, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Shadlen and Newsome, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Roitman and Shadlen, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Ratcliff et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ding and Gold, 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Heitz and Schall, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mante et al., 2013</xref>), but despite some theoretical suggestions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lo and Wang, 2006</xref>), the specific contributions of each brain region to the different aspects of the overall process, and the circuit logic of the network, remain unclear. Here we focused on the role of two rat cortical areas, posterior parietal cortex (PPC) and frontal orienting fields (FOF), that are considered critical for rodent decision-making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Erlich et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Sul et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Harvey et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Carandini and Churchland, 2013</xref>), and that display neural correlates of gradually accumulating auditory evidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hanks et al., 2015</xref>). As in primates, the specific roles of each of these rat areas within the overall evidence accumulation and decision process remain undetermined.</p><p>Using a within-subject design, we implanted cannulae in both of these areas, and carried out pharmacological inactivations, quantifying the impairments by fitting to the data detailed models of the decision-making process for the Poisson Clicks task. Different parameters of the models quantified different possible variations from control behavior. We also compared inactivation effects on the Poisson Clicks task (‘accumulation trials’) to three types of control trials: free-choice (in which the animal was free to choose either of two visual stimuli to obtain a reward); single-sided (in which decisions were guided by a simple auditory stimulus that did not require gradual evidence accumulation, and rats had to withhold their response for several hundred milliseconds after receiving enough information to make their decision); and side LED trials (in which decisions were guided by a simple visual stimulus that did not require gradual evidence accumulation, and rats were free to report their decision as soon as they made it).</p><p>In other studies with the same behavioral task, we have used optogenetic inactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hanks et al., 2015</xref>). Although optogenetics allows high temporal resolution inactivation, its radius of effect in our hands is only ≈750 μm (see Extended Data <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hanks et al., 2015</xref>). In contrast, inactivating larger regions is much more readily achieved with muscimol, for which the radius of inactivation can be increased simply by increasing the infusion dose. In addition, muscimol directly inactivates all neurons within its radius of effect, not only infected neurons. Moreover, in some tasks, including the Poisson Clicks task, we find that the behavioral effect of optogenetic silencing begins to decay after a few weeks, while the effect of muscimol is stable. This stability in particular was essential for the current study, which used within-subject manipulations over hundreds of days. Optogenetic and pharmacological silencing therefore have complementary advantages and disadvantages. Here we focused on pharmacological inactivation.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Role of FOF</title><p>Our results demonstrate that the FOF is an essential part of the circuit for decisions driven by accumulating evidence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Unilateral FOF inactivations had a strong effect on both accumulation trials, signaled by auditory clicks, and on free choice trials, signaled by a bilateral visual stimulus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>), indicating that the effects are not specific to a single sensory modality. Critically, the model-based analyses suggested a specific location for the FOF within the functional process chain required by our accumulation of evidence task. The specific suggestion is that the FOF is not part of the accumulator but is instead part of the premotor output pathway that leads from the graded evidence accumulator to the decision-reporting motor act. This suggestion is derived from (a) the sharp reduction in the accumulation time constant induced by bilateral FOF inactivations (from slightly unstable <italic>τ</italic> ≈ +0.8, to very leaky <italic>τ</italic> ≈ −0.24 s), which demonstrates that the FOF is either involved in the accumulation process itself, or is part of the output pathway of the accumulator (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>); (b) the effects induced by unilateral inactivation of the FOF, which are captured in quantitative detail, for both accumulation trials and single-side trials, as having induced a post-categorization bias that is subsequent to the accumulation process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>); and (c) the lack of an effect of FOF inactivations on side LED trials, which rules out a simple motor role for the FOF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). A parsimonious explanation of this set of results is thus that the FOF is a requisite premotor component of the output pathway of an evidence accumulator with a long time constant (&gt;0.24 s). This suggestion is different from, but consistent with, the FOF's known role in short-term memory, as well as the FOF's greater importance in memory-guided (i.e., long time constant) vs sensory-guided (short time constant) orienting decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Erlich et al., 2011</xref>). In decisions driven by gradual accumulation of evidence, the gradual accumulation process occurs prior to the binary decision. An intriguing possibility suggested by our results that the decision process itself–that is, the categorization of the gradually accumulated evidence into a binary choice–might be performed in the FOF, perhaps in conjunction with the superior colliculus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lo and Wang, 2006</xref>).</p><p>It is possible that unilateral FOF inactivations would induce a hemispheric imbalance so strong that a real but nuanced role for the FOF in gradual accumulation might have been obscured by a strong post-categorization bias. We nevertheless currently favor the interpretation of the FOF's role as subsequent to, not part of, the graded accumulator. We favor this interpretation first, because of its parsimony; second, because parallel electrophysiological work from our laboratory found that the representation of the accumulated evidence in the FOF could be approximately described as the answer to the categorical question ‘if the GO signal came now, which side port should I choose?’; third, using AAV-CaMKII-eNpHR3.0 for optogenetic inactivation we found that transient unilateral silencing of the FOF was unable to cause an effect on behavior if it occurred during the evidence accumulation period, sufficiently prior to the GO signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hanks et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Those results, in combination with the pharmacological data, three control trial types, and model-based analyses reported here, all consistently support the interpretation of the FOF as a requisite component of the output pathway of an evidence accumulator with a long time constant (&gt;0.24 s). This view is consistent with the fact that side LED trials, which involve decisions that do not require gradual evidence accumulation or storing a motor plan in short-term memory, are not impacted by FOF inactivations. Such decisions, including perhaps decisions that require auditory evidence accumulation over only short times (&lt;0.24 s), may depend on pathways that bypass the FOF, perhaps involving direct connections from auditory cortex to the striatum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Znamenskiy and Zador, 2013</xref>).</p><p>With pharmacological infusions, one concern is spread of inactivation to other structures. We based the volume and concentration of our infusions on previous literature to achieve inactivation volumes of 1 mm radius for our small doses and 3 mm radius for our largest doses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Martin, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Krupa et al., 1999</xref>). This spread is within the anterior-posterior bounds of FOF, but could have spread medially to cingulate cortex (CG1) or laterally to M1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Paxinos and Watson, 2004</xref>). The white matter below FOF prevent spread ventrally into the basal ganglia. In a previous study, we directly tested the effects of M1 inactivation and found them to be weaker than FOF inactivations and also they affected sensory-guided and single-sided trials equally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Erlich et al., 2011</xref>). As such, it is unlikely that the effects we are attributing to FOF are due to M1 inactivation. We targeted our inactivations to 2 mm anterior and 1.25 mm lateral to Bregma. According to the Rat Atlas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Paxinos and Watson, 2004</xref>) CG1 may be within the spread of the drug. However, according to a recent cell-based mapping technique the medial boundary of FOF has been underestimated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brecht et al., 2004</xref>), suggesting that most of spread of drug would be within FOF. Moreover, the CG1 is thought to play a role in cost-benefit decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hillman and Bilkey, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Holec et al., 2014</xref>), cognitive flexibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Ragozzino and Rozman, 2007</xref>), or emotional reactivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bissière et al., 2008</xref>), not in movement planning. Therefore, the effects observed are more likely due to changes in FOF rather than an adjacent cortical region.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Role of PPC</title><p>Given the view that the PPC plays a key causal role in rodent perceptual decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Harvey et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Carandini and Churchland, 2013</xref>) and that neural activity in PPC displays correlates of accumulating auditory evidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hanks et al., 2015</xref>), we were surprised to find that unilateral inactivation of the PPC did not cause a side bias on accumulation, side LED, or single-sided trials. Compensation from the unperturbed hemisphere did not explain the lack of an effect, because bilateral inactivation of the PPC caused a minimal decrease in performance (3.6%) that was not significantly different from unilateral inactivations. Thus, the PPC seems to play a far more subtle role than the FOF in choice behavior during decisions guided by auditory evidence accumulation.</p><p>Unilateral PPC inactivations did cause a strong ipsilateral bias under two conditions: in internally-guided decisions (free choice trials, signaled by a visual stimulus, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A–C</xref>), and when the FOF was simultaneously bilaterally inactivated in accumulation trials (auditory stimulus, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9E</xref>). These results suggest that in the intact brain, weak but real side choice signals from the PPC may be overridden by stronger signals from the FOF. They also suggest that the PPC's role may not be specific to a particular sensory modality.</p><p>The PPC is relatively extended in the medial-lateral direction (≈4 mm) but it is thin (≈0.75 mm) in the anterior-posterior direction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Paxinos and Watson, 2004</xref>; but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Wilber et al., 2014</xref>). The anatomical characteristics of the PPC pose two possible confounds: insufficient inactivation of the PPC in the medial-lateral direction and potential spread to adjacent regions in the anterior-posterior direction. If we assume the spread of muscimol across the cortical is isotropic (white matter acts as a physical barrier, so we assume that the ventral spread is restricted), then an individual injection, due to the wide and thin shape of PPC, will either fail to inactivate all of PPC or spread to adjacent regions. Based on the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Martin, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Krupa et al., 1999</xref>) we expect our smallest infusion to have a ≈1 mm radius and our largest to have a &gt;3 mm radius. This technical limitation would have posed a serious challenge for our results if we observed very different effects of our small and large infusions. However, despite using a wide range of doses, we observed no significant dose–response effect with unilateral PPC infusions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). A clear dose–response relationship (as we found in the FOF) would indicate that bigger infusions were silencing more and more PPC neurons required for behavior in the task. Instead, the fraction of inactivated PPC neurons had no impact on the magnitude of the behavioral effect, which is what we would expect if PPC neurons were not required for choice behavior in the task. Nonetheless, further experiments would be required to completely rule out the possibility that a small number of PPC neurons, in the most medial or lateral edge of the PPC, were spared and that these few neurons were sufficient to support intact behavioral performance on the Clicks task.</p><p>Spread of muscimol into areas immediately anterior or posterior to the PPC was inevitable with our largest doses, and, in the two cases where positive effects were observed, this raises concerns about region specificity. Immediately anterior to the PPC is the somatosensory cortex (for the trunk). Particularly in light of the intact motor capacities, as indicated by the intact side LED trials, the somatosensory cortex is not expected to have caused any of the observed effects. Immediately posterior to the PPC are a set of individually small visual areas, collectively referred to as secondary visual cortex (V2; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Coogan and Burkhalter, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Montero, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wang and Burkhalter, 2007</xref>). These visual areas are unlikely to be involved in auditory click accumulation trials, and are therefore not expected to have caused the effects we saw after simultaneous unilateral PPC and bilateral FOF inactivations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9E</xref>). However, the bias we observed on free-choice trials may have been partly due to an effect in one or more of these small secondary visual areas. Nevertheless, ipsilateral biases in untrained orienting responses (potentially analogous to the free-choice task) due to PPC lesions have been observed in the rat even when those choices were to tactile or auditory stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Corwin et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Burcham et al., 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">1998</xref>). We also note that our free choice results closely parallel the results from primate PPC free choice experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Wilke et al., 2012</xref>), which do not suffer from this spillover concern.</p><p>A minimal effect following PPC inactivation in our rat auditory click accumulation task is reminiscent of Guo et al.'s, finding of no effect after PPC inactivation in a mouse somatosensory-cued, memory-guided task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Guo et al., 2014</xref>). But it contrasts with Harvey et al.'s finding of a severe performance impairment after PPC inactivation in a mouse visually-cued, memory-guided navigation task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Harvey et al., 2012</xref>). Following our own preliminary reports of PPC inactivations in the Poisson Clicks task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Erlich et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">2014</xref>), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63a">Raposo et al. (2014)</xref> reported an impairment after rat PPC inactivations in a visual, but not in an auditory, version of a closely related task. This contrasts with a preliminary report from Yates et al. that suggested no effect from primate PPC inactivation in a visual accumulation of evidence task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Yates et al., 2014</xref>), as well as with multiple reports of no effect from primate PPC inactivation in visual memory-guided saccade tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chafee and Goldman-Rakic, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wardak et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Liu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Wilke et al., 2012</xref>). The Raposo et al. results therefore suggest that rodent PPC may be unlike primate PPC in being required for accumulation of evidence for a specific modality, vision. Nevertheless, the precise location of the border between rodent PPC and visual cortex, as well as the amount of inter-animal variability in this location, remain active research questions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Wilber et al., 2014</xref>; see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Reep et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Corwin and Reep, 1998</xref> for definitions from the same authors, based on the same data, that alternately describe the border as located at −5.0 mm from Bregma or −4.4 mm from Bregma). The uncertainty in the location of the PPC/visual cortex border raises an alternative possibility, which is that the impairments in memory-guided visual tasks observed by Harvey et al. and Raposo et al. (and potentially the free-choice effects seen here) could have been due to inactivation spillover into one of the immediately adjacent small secondary visual areas, as described above, rather than inactivation of the PPC itself. This would make all the inactivation results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Harvey et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Guo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63a">Raposo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Yates et al., 2014</xref>; and the results presented here.), including mouse, rat, and primate, fully consistent with each other. While such a reconciliation of results across multiple species may have some intellectual appeal, we emphasize that experiments that would either clearly support or rule out this possibility remain to be done.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Comparison to primates</title><p>To date, the accumulation of evidence literature is mostly composed of electrophysiological experiments with primates. Based on a number of criteria, the rat PPC and FOF have been suggested as analogous to the primate PPC and FEF, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kolb and Walkey, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Reep and Corwin, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Erlich et al., 2011</xref>), and accumulation of evidence signals very similar to those in primates have been found in these two rat areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hanks et al., 2015</xref>). It is therefore tempting to speculate that our results in rat might also hold in primate, and to consider potential interpretations that would be consistent across mammalian model systems.</p><p>There have been no published inactivation experiments in primate PPC or FEF during accumulation of evidence tasks. There have, however, been inactivation experiments in related tasks, which in general are in agreement with our findings: prefrontal perturbations strongly bias behavior while posterior parietal perturbations do not. In memory-guided saccade tasks, LIP inactivations have no effect on the choice of saccading either towards or away from the correct hemifield (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chafee and Goldman-Rakic, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wardak et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Liu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Wilke et al., 2012</xref>), while FEF and prefrontal inactivations reliably generate profound ipsilateral choice biases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Sommer and Tehovnik, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dias and Segraves, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chafee and Goldman-Rakic, 2000</xref>). Similarly, in a covert visual search task, LIP inactivation has no effect on error rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wardak et al., 2002</xref>), while inactivation of the FEF generates significant increase in error rates for contralateral targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Wardak et al., 2006</xref>). Again similarly, in a memory-guided task with distractors, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Suzuki and Gottlieb, (2013)</xref> found no errors after LIP inactivations while finding significant contralateral errors after prefrontal cortex inactivations.</p><p>We are aware of only a few studies where LIP inactivation produces choice biases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wardak et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Balan and Gottlieb, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Wilke et al., 2012</xref>). One of these studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Wilke et al., 2012</xref>) inspired our intermixing free choice trials with accumulation trials. Consistent with a good analogy between rat PPC and primate PPC, our results in rats closely paralleled Wilke et al.'s results in primates, with our accumulation of evidence trials playing the role of their memory-guided saccade trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Also consistent with our rat data and with a good analogy between rat and primate PPC, a preliminary report has suggested that unilateral primate PPC inactivations have no effect on accumulation of evidence trials, while causing an ipsilateral bias on free choice trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Yates et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>There has been one perturbation study in the primate FEF during an accumulation of evidence task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gold and Shadlen, 2000</xref>). This microstimulation study concluded that ‘developing oculomotor commands may reflect the formation of the monkey's direction judgement’ (i.e., its decision). Our results in rat FOF are consistent with those of Gold and Shadlen, but go considerably further in specifically suggesting the FOF as a requisite premotor component of the output pathway of a long time constant (&gt;0.24 s) evidence accumulator.</p><p>There has been one perturbation study in the primate PPC during an accumulation of evidence task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hanks et al., 2006</xref>). This microstimulation study used a reaction time version of the Random Dots task, and found a pattern of results following LIP microstimulation that could be quantitatively explained in an accumulation-to-bound model if the microstimulation added a small constant offset to the value of the accumulator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hanks et al., 2006</xref>). Unlike the task used by Hanks et al., our task (and that of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Yates et al., 2014</xref>) was not a reaction time task, which could explain the difference in results. An alternative possibility, noted in their discussion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hanks et al., 2006</xref>), and which would reconcile our results with theirs, is that microstimulation may activate axon terminals or fibers of passage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Histed et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">2013</xref>; but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Tehovnik and Slocum, 2013</xref>). The behavioral effects produced by microstimulation of LIP may thus have been due to activation of neurons with somata not in LIP, but in regions of the brain that project to LIP. Since muscimol does not affect axons or fibers of passage, this possibility would be consistent with our data.</p><p>If the PPC plays a causal role in internally-guided decisions, but does not play a causal role in choice behavior during accumulation of evidence tasks, what role is then played by the firing rate correlates of evidence accumulation signals observed in PPC, in both rats and primates? Accumulation signals are also correlated with confidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kiani and Shadlen, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Komura et al., 2013</xref>). One possibility is that, instead of being used to drive choice behavior, the accumulation signals observed in the PPC are used for computing choice confidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kiani and Shadlen, 2009</xref>). Confidence could be part of a process for optimizing behavior over many trials, or, in a reaction time version of the task, confidence could be part of determining when the subject chooses to commit to a decision.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In the rat, our data now suggests a specific functional role for the FOF in decisions driven by accumulation of evidence: the FOF appears to be a requisite component of the output pathway of an evidence accumulator with a long time constant (&gt;0.24 s). Decisions with shorter processing times may involve circuits that bypass the FOF. It is possible that categorizing the graded accumulator's value into a discrete choice–the final decision itself–could occur in the FOF. In contrast, the PPC seems to play a surprisingly minimal, or subtle, role in choice behavior during decisions guided by accumulation of evidence, even while it plays an important role in internally-guided decisions. Neither region appears likely to play a major causal role in the gradual evidence accumulation process per se.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Subjects</title><p>Animal use procedures were approved by the Princeton University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and carried out in accordance with National Institutes of Health standards. All subjects were male Long-Evans rats (Taconic, NY). Rats were placed on a restricted water schedule to motivate them to work for water reward. Rats were kept on a reversed 12 hr light–dark cycle and were trained in their dark cycle.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Behavior</title><p>We trained 14 male Long-Evans rats on the Poisson Clicks accumulation task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Training took place in a behavior box with three nose ports (left, center and right), and with two speakers, placed above the right and left nose ports. Each accumulation trial began with a visible light-emitting diode (LED) turning on in the center port. This cued the trained rat to place its nose in the center port, and keep it there until the LED was turned off. We refer to this period as the ‘nose in center’ or ‘fixation’ period. The duration of fixation was 2 s for all accumulation trials. During the fixation period a variable duration auditory stimulus (0.1–1 s, experimenter controlled) would play, consisting of two randomly timed trains of clicks, playing simultaneously, one from the left and one from the right speaker. At the end of the auditory stimulus, the LED in the center port would extinguish, which was the signal to the rat to make their response by poking into one of the side ports. The timing of the clicks from each speaker was generated by two independent Poisson processes. The total generative click rate (left + right rate) was held constant at 40 clicks/s, and trial difficulty was controlled by adjusting the relative left vs right rates, as well as the duration of the stimulus. Trials where rats exited the center port during the fixation period were considered violation trials, aborted, and a new trial was started. These trials are not included in any analyses.</p><p>To test whether the apparent vertical scaling of the psychometric curve after unilateral FOF inactivations was due to a lack of asymptotically easy trials, we interleaved ‘single-sided’ trials with accumulation trials (and side LED trials in some sessions). A single-sided trial was much like an accumulation trial, but all the clicks came from one speaker and were played at a Poisson rate of 100 Hz. Since the 100 Hz stimuli were easily distinguished from 40 Hz stimuli and these trials did not require accumulation (all clicks on one side), rats probably made their decision quickly. However, they were still required to wait until the go cue. These trials comprised ≈8% of a trials in a session.</p><p>In order to control for motor effects of inactivations, in group 2 and 3 rats, we included, randomly interleaved with other trial-types, ‘side LED’ trials. On side LED trials no sounds were played during fixation, which lasted 1 s. Immediately after the end of fixation, one of the two side ports was illuminated, indicating availability of reward at the lit port (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The right and left side LED trials, together, comprised ≈10% of the total trials.</p><p>In order to find a task that was sensitive to inactivation of the PPC, we randomly interleaved ‘free-choice’ trials with the other trial-types. Free-choice trials were similar to side LED trials except at the end of fixation both side LEDs were illuminated and rats were rewarded regardless of whether they poked in the right or left nose port. These sessions took place after all of the experiments presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3 fig4 fig5 fig6 fig7 fig8">Figures 3–7, 8E</xref>.</p><p>Control non-infusion sessions (used to generate <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>) with poor performance (&lt;70% correct overall or fewer than eight correct trials on each side without fixation violations) were excluded from analyses. These sessions were rare and were usually caused by problems with the hardware (e.g., a clogged water-reward valve or a dirty IR-photodetector). We collected ≈145,000 control trials (range [57692 265332]) over ≈450 (range [291640]) sessions from each rat (n = 14) from sessions without intracranial infusions or pre-session anesthesia for a total of 2,057,074 control trials.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Surgery</title><p>Surgical methods were identical to those described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Erlich et al., 2011</xref>). Briefly, rats were anesthetized with isoflurane and placed in a stereotax. The scalp was deflected and the skull was cleaned of tissue and blood. The stereotax was used to mark the locations of craniotomies for the FOF and PPC on the skull. Craniotomies and durotomies were performed and then the skull was coated with a thin coat of C&amp;B Metabond (Parkell Inc., NY). Guide cannula (Plastics One, VA) were lowered to brain surface with dummy cannula extending 0.5 mm into the brain. The guide cannula were placed and secured to the skull one at a time with a small amount of Absolute Dentin (Parkell Inc., NY). After the three guide cannula were in place (One bilateral FOF cannula and one cannula for each PPC) dental acrylic (Duralay, Reliance Dental Mfg. Co, IL) was then used to cover the skull and further secure the cannula. Rats were given 5 days to recover on free water before resuming training.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Cannula</title><p>Group 1 rats (n = 6) were implanted bilaterally in FOF (+2 AP, ±1.25 ML mm from Bregma) with 22 AWG guide cannula (C232G-2.5, Plastics One, VA) and the medial (3.8 mm posterior, 2.2 mm lateral to Bregma) and lateral (3.8 mm posterior, 3.4 mm lateral to Bregma) PPC with 26 AWG guide cannula (6 cannula per rat total). Group 2 rats (n = 4) were implanted in FOF and in PPC (3.8 mm posterior, ±2.8 mm lateral to Bregma; a total of 4 cannulae per animal) with bilateral 22 AWG guide cannula. Group 3 rats (n = 4) were implanted with bilateral 22 AWG guide cannula in FOF and in PPC (4.5 mm posterior, ±3.0 mm lateral to Bregma; 4 cannulae per animal).</p><p>The tip of the guide sat at brain surface and the dummy extended 0.5 mm into cortex. The injector for the 22 AWG guide cannula was a 28 AWG cannula that extended 1.5 mm below the bottom of the guide cannula. The injector for the 26 AWG guide cannula was a 33 AWG cannula that extended 1.5 mm below the bottom of the guide cannula.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Infusions</title><p>In general, infusions were performed once a week with control training days taking place on all other days of the week in order to minimize adaptation to the effects of the muscimol and to have good stable performance in the sessions immediately before infusion sessions. On an infusion day, the rat was placed into an induction chamber with 2% isoflurane, and then transferred to a nose cone with 2% isoflurane for the infusion procedure. Caps and dummy cannula were removed and cleaned. Injectors were placed into the relevant guide cannula and extended 1.5 mm past the end of the guide, into cortex. We used a hamilton syringe connected via tubing filled with mineral oil to the injector to infuse 0.3 µl of muscimol (of various concentrations–see ‘Results’ and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>) into cortex. After injection, we left the injector in the brain for 4 min to allow diffusion before removal. After 4 min, cleaned dummies were placed into the guide cannula and capped and the rat was removed from isoflurane. After 30 min of recovery from isoflurane the rat was placed into a behavior box as usual. See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref> for the complete list of all infusion doses, regions, and order for each rat. Previous experiments in rat cortex, performing autoradiographic estimates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Martin, 1991</xref>), as well as simultaneous muscimol inactivation and recordings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Krupa et al., 1999</xref>), suggest that at the doses of muscimol we used, the expected area of inactivation would have an approximately ≈1 mm radius for the smallest doses and &gt;3 mm radius for the largest doses.</p><p>Since the only difference between left and right infusions (and FOF and PPC infusions) are the location of the infusion any differences in behavior can only be attributed to the infusion and not to handling. For bilateral infusions, we were interested in non-lateralized impairments compared to baseline performance. To rule out the possibility that the handling of rats for the infusion procedure could affect performance we did isoflurane-only sessions where rats were handled as they would be for an infusion (taken to the infusion room, placed into an induction chamber with 2% isoflurane, dummies removed, cleaned and replaced, etc) but given no infusion. These isoflurane-only sessions were used as a baseline to compare with the bilateral infusion sessions.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Analysis and statistics</title><p>All analysis and statistics were computed either in Matlab (version 7 or better, The Mathworks, MA) or R (version 2.15.2, R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). Sessions where there were too few trials, or otherwise had problems during the infusions were excluded. We only included the first 250 trials of a session because the effect of muscimol can decrease after a few hours, although the results are robust to including all trials.</p><p>The accumulator model uses 9-parameters (described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>) to transform the stimulus on each trial (input to the model as the left and right click times) into a probability distribution about the choice of the rat. For example, if for a given set of parameter, the model predicts that trial 1 will result in 75% chance of the rat going right, and the rat in fact went right, that trial would be assigned a likelihood of 0.75. In the case that the rat went left, the trial would be assigned a likelihood of 0.25. We fit the model assuming that the trials are independent. Therefore, for a model with parameters <italic>θ</italic> for all decisions D, the likelihood is given by:<disp-formula id="equ1"><mml:math id="m1"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mo>|</mml:mo><mml:mi>θ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:munder><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true"><mml:mo>∏</mml:mo></mml:mstyle><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:munder><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>|</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>R</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>L</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>θ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>,</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula>the product of the likelihoods of the decisions on trial <italic>i</italic>, <italic>d</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>, given the times of the right clicks <italic>t</italic><sub><italic>i</italic>,<italic>R</italic></sub>, times of the left clicks <italic>t</italic><sub><italic>i</italic>,<italic>L</italic></sub>, and the set of 9 parameters, <italic>θ</italic>. A detailed description of the procedure for fitting the accumulator model can be found in the Modeling Methods section of the supplement of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brunton et al. (2013)</xref>. For panels A, C, and D in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> we first concatenated 47,580 trials across sessions and rats from sessions 1 day before an infusion session. The values of the parameters that maximized <italic>P</italic>(<italic>D</italic>|<italic>θ</italic>) for these concatenated data are described as ‘Meta-Rat’ in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>. Since the model is fit to the individual trials, we emphasize that the psychometric, chronometric and reverse correlations plot for a given model are not generated using a curve-fitting procedure for each panel. We also fit each rat individually and show the best-fit parameters for each rat in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>.</p><p>Even at the very easiest trials, rat behavior in our task often asymptotes at ≈90% correct. To fit this, the model includes a ‘lapse’ parameter, which represents a fraction of trials in which subjects will ignore the stimulus and choose randomly. The presence of the lapse parameter also puts a lower bound on the likelihood of any individual trial, and thus no individual trial can dominate the results and the consequent fits of the model.</p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3 fig4 fig6 fig8">Figures 3, 4E, 6, 8E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref> the psychometric curves were generated by concatenating trial data across sessions for each rat and fitting (using Matlab's nlinfit) a 4-parameter sigmoid as follows:<disp-formula id="equ2"><mml:math id="m2"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mi>b</mml:mi></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>.</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>For these fits, <italic>x</italic> is the click difference on each trial (#Right Clicks − #Left Clicks), <italic>y</italic> is ‘P(Went Right)’, and the four parameters to be fit are: <italic>x</italic><sub>0</sub>, the inflection point of the sigmoid; <italic>b</italic>, the slope of the sigmoid; <italic>y</italic><sub>0</sub>, the minimum ‘P(Went Right)’; and <italic>a</italic> + <italic>y</italic><sub>0</sub> is the maximum ‘P(Went Right)’. These fits are for visualization only.</p><p>For chronometric analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C</xref>), we concatenated trials for each rat across sessions and binned trials into easy, medium and hard quantiles with equal number of trials based on the relative generative left-right click rate. For each of these three difficulty levels we binned trials by stimulus duration.</p><p>The detailed methods of generating the psychophysical reverse correlations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2 fig4 fig5">Figures 2D, 4D, 5D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>) can be found in the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brunton et al. (2013)</xref>. For this analysis separation of right (red lines) and left (green lines) trials at each time in the trial indicates that there was a difference in local click rate at that time for trials in which the rat responded to the right vs to the left. If rats only used the early clicks for their decision (a primacy strategy), the lines would begin separated and come together. Likewise, if they only used the clicks at the end of the stimulus (a recency strategy) the lines would start together and separate towards the end of the trial. To generate the accumulator model's reverse correlation, each trial was assigned as the left and right trial, according to the model's prediction for that trial. For example, if the model predicted that a trial had a 67% chance of a rightward choice, this trial would contribute 0.67 to the right trials and 0.33 to the left trials psychophysical kernel.</p><p>The unilateral infusion experiments are designed specifically to test for lateralized effects. On left and right infusion days animals are handled in the exact same way: taken into the room where the infusions happen, placed under light isoflurane anesthesia, etc (described in detail in the Infusions section of the ‘Materials and methods’). The only difference is the side of the infusion. As such, this within-subject design is effective at testing biases to respond toward or away from the side of the infusion. The simplest way to estimate bias resulting from unilateral inactivations is to subtract the contralateral % correct from the ipsilateral % correct for each infusion session. To compute the overall bias we averaged the bias across sessions for each rat and then tested using a <italic>t</italic>-test whether the bias across rats was significantly different from 0. However, this statistical test is conservative, since it collapses across all trials of differing difficulty levels and different sessions. As well, this overall bias measure was inappropriate for testing the effects within each group, since the n per group was low.</p><p>To avoid false negative results (type II error), as a more sensitive measure of inactivation effects we used a Generalized Linear Mixed-Model (GLMM) as implemented in the function ‘lmer’ in package ‘lme4’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bates and Sarkar, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bates et al., 2007</xref>). For unilateral infusions we specified a mixed-effects model where the rats' choice on each trial was a logistic function of #Right − #Left Clicks (Δ Clicks), infusion side and their interaction as fixed effects. The rat and an interaction of rat, infusion side, and Δ Clicks were modeled as within-subject random effects. The statistic reported in the text for unilateral infusions was the p value for the infusion side fixed effect. The plots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref> (FOF) and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref> (PPC) show that the model fits for each rat are quite good, and reflect how the random effects of the model allow for each rats' data to be fit, while also finding significant fixed effects. The logistic fit sometimes misses the end point performance, which, for the FOF inactivations, was generally worse than the GLMM fit.</p><p>For bilateral infusions we specified a similar model comparing bilateral infusions to isoflurane-only sessions. For these models the relevant statistic was the significance of the interaction between infusion and Δ Clicks, that is, a change in the slope of the logistic. Details of the data and code used to generate and compare the models is described in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 1</xref> ‘Using the lme4 package to fit generalized-linear mixed models in R’.</p><p>To test whether there were effects of unilateral infusions on response times (RT) on side LED trials, measured as time from go cue to side port response, we took the mean RT for each rat for left and right choices on left and right infusion days. We separated leftward and rightward responses because there can be large differences from rat to rat in the left vs right response times. We then did a repeated-measures ANOVA (Rat X [Left vs Right] X [Ipsi vs Contra]) to test whether there was an effect of muscimol on RTs. Since ANOVA must be balanced, only 4 rats (out of a possible 8 group 2 and 3 rats) performed enough side LED trials from FOF infusions for this analysis. For the PPC infusions 7 of 8 rats performed enough trials to be included.</p><p>For the analyses of biases during free-choice sessions we compared the bias (ipsilateral − contralateral % correct) on the infusion day with the control session 1 day before and performed <italic>t</italic>-tests across sessions for each region (PPC or FOF) and trial-type (free-choice, accumulation or side LED). Some free-choice sessions had no side LED trials which is why there are fewer sessions in the <italic>t</italic>-tests for that trial-type. Side LED trials were also not analyzed for sessions if the bias in the side LED trials during the preceding control day was greater than 20%.</p><p>To fit the 9-parameter accumulator model to the bilateral FOF infusion data we concatenated all 1809 trials across all rats. We validated the error in these fits by bootstrapping. Specifically, we generated 300 sets of 1809 trials data by randomly sampling with replacement from the original data set. We then fit the 9-parameter model to each of these 300 data sets, generating 300 sets of 9 best-fit parameters. We used this distribution of fits to generate confidence intervals for each of the parameters. In order for a parameter to be considered as significantly different from the control value, the control value from the meta-rat fit had to be outside of the 95% confidence interval of the bootstrapped marginal distribution for that parameter.</p><p>To better understand what aspect of the task was impaired by unilateral FOF inactivation we took advantage of the knowledge of the times of all the clicks and the rats' choices using our previous modeling work (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brunton et al., 2013</xref>) to fit four constrained Accumulator Models to the unilateral FOF infusion data. For all of these analyses we relabeled the trials for left/right trials to ipsi/contra trials based on the side of the infusion. For the infusion meta-rat we combined all 3836 trials from unilateral FOF sessions. Second, to avoid computing the gradient for a 12-parameter model, we fit constrained Accumulator Models that had one parameter free and the other parameters fixed to the best-fit parameters from the control meta-rat Accumulator Model. The details of the free parameter of each model are described in the results section.</p><p>We used MALTAB's built-in Metropolis–Hastings sampler (mhsample.m in the Statistics Toolbox) to sample from the 8-parameter distribution (described in the ‘Results’). We generated 4 separate Markov chains of 10,000 samples each, starting from the best-fit control parameters with a burnin of 100. For the proposal distribution we used a uniform distribution with the range selected for each parameter (e.g., a smaller range for input gain than for input noise). We used a thin of 4, based on test runs with known gaussian distributions. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref> shows the samples generated by this sampling process.</p><p>To compare models with different numbers of parameters we used two commonly used metrics, the Bayesian and Akaike information criterion (BIC and AIC). The BIC is defined as, <italic>BIC</italic> = −2 × <italic>LL</italic> + <italic>k</italic> × <italic>ln</italic>(<italic>n</italic>). Where LL is the maximum log likelihood of a model with <italic>k</italic> free parameters on n data points. The AIC is similarly defined, <italic>AIC</italic> = −2 × <italic>LL</italic> + 2 × <italic>k</italic>. The main difference being that AIC is not a function of the size of the data set. Since the cost of additional parameters in AIC is only 2<italic>k</italic>, the AIC favors more complicated models compared to BIC.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank A Begelfer, K Osorio and J Teran for animal and laboratory support.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Eve Marder (Senior editor) and 4 reviewers, one of whom, Matteo Carandini, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This is a timely report on a topic of great interest, with impressive behavioral data and analysis. It stands to make a significant contribution to the decision-making literature. The manuscript investigates the causal contributions of rat prefrontal cortex (PFC) and posterior parietal cortex (PPC) in accumulation-based decision making. It provides a strong synthesis of many kinds of inactivations (bilateral vs unilateral, PFC vs PPC, and some combinations) with a detailed computational model of the decision making process. Despite some important caveats (described below) with the inactivation experiments and with their modeling, the experiments make up a very useful data set. Moreover, the follow-up manipulations to test predictions from the results of the analyses (single-sided trials, free choice trials) demonstrate the success of the method and the depth of understanding of the role of these structures.</p><p>This approach maximizes what one can learn from the rodent relative to the primate – flexible and creative application of causal techniques, coupled with detailed modeling of the behavior that allows them to transcend some concerns about rodent psychophysics, for example, the high lapse rates. In many regards, this work leads the primate research and will be an important reference point as corresponding investigations of primate PPC and PFC catch up.</p><p>The main finding is quite compelling: large effects of PFC inactivation on decision-making, little or no effect of PPC inactivation. These results are not entirely surprising given what we know about the roles of FOF from the Brody lab and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Erlich et al., 2011</xref>; Guo et al., 2013; Hanks et al), and given the results seen in PPC with binary decision tasks (Guo et al., 2013). However, the nuances and follow-ups raise the rigor of the work and unpack the mechanism in a satisfying way.</p><p>Specifically, the modeling suggests that inactivation of the Frontal Orienting Field (FOF) largely changes the integration time constant, which is a central aspect of the accumulation mechanism – and which is a strong contrast from less-central effects, such as, say, the lapse rate.</p><p>The apparent lack of effect in PPC during the evidence accumulation task is intriguing, since PPC has been at the center of research on evidence accumulation in primates. The suggestion that it may not be necessary for performing evidence accumulation is important. However, given the prominence of this finding, one would need to see a bit more characterization of PPC infusions before being confident of these claims. Moreover, as discussed below, these findings need to be better described in the context of the literature, as PPC inactivation does have major effects during different kind of perceptual decisions: those based on vision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63a">Raposo et al, 2014</xref>).</p><p><italic>1) Use of muscimol</italic></p><p>The manuscript should explain the advantages of using muscimol inactivation over the better-characterized optogenetic approach used in the same lab (Hanks et al.). Muscimol infusion has much poorer spatial and temporal resolution, and given the depth of these injections (1.5 mm below the cortical surface), one worries that muscimol could be affecting basal ganglia in the FOF infusions (e.g., the single example provided in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1 fig3s2 fig3s3">Figure 3–figure supplements 3-1</xref> seems to show some subcortical spread). These limitations should be discussed.</p><p><italic>2) Incomplete PPC inactivations?</italic></p><p>The paper discusses the lack of consensus regarding the stereotaxic location of PPC, and addresses this by infusing multiple locations in different groups of animals. This is unconvincing, especially given the importance of the negative results in PPC to the main points of the paper. It would be useful to see more anatomical characterization to show that what is being called PPC has the appropriate input characteristics. This could be done fairly easily in a few naïve animals using retrograde tracers showing that their identified region receives inputs from multiple sensory regions, lateral posterior thalamus, prefrontal cortex, and contralateral PPC.</p><p>Indeed, a major concern is that PPC inactivations may be only partial, given the large medial-lateral extent of rat PPC (as the paper notes, ∼4mm), the muscimol infusions are likely only partially inactivating PPC, and the lack of effect could be due to compensation by the spared neurons. It is nice that there is a positive control in the 'free choice' experiments, but it is not clear that one can rule out a more subtle influence of PPC in the evidence accumulation task. The experiment one would really like to see is a characterization of the extent of PPC using anatomical tracers, followed by inactivation of the entire region. This would require significantly more work, and may be beyond the scope of a reasonable revision of this paper, but at the very least the paper should address this issue in the Discussion and reduce the strength of the claims accordingly.</p><p><italic>3) Relationship with visual study</italic></p><p>In its current version, the paper states that PPC plays no role in perceptual decisions. A revision should clarify that this applies to ”auditory” perceptual decisions. The recent paper by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63a">Raposo et al. (2014)</xref> shows similar lack of effects on an auditory task, but profound effects in a visual task. The manuscript relates to this study in one paragraph (eighth paragraph of Discussion) to suggest that PPC may be mostly visual rather than auditory, but seems to prefer the rather harsh interpretation that other investigators had results in visual tasks due to experimental error. It is dangerous to criticize others for possible technical errors (muscimol spreading unintentionally far) when one's paper may suffer from the same limitations. It would be interesting to see a more balanced discussion of those results, perhaps starting in the Introduction. For instance, there may be some tension about whether those results point to an evidence accumulation deficit for visual information, or just a visual deficit. More generally, this paper should make sure not to overreach in its conclusions about the role of PPC in all sorts of perceptual decisions, and limit itself to auditory ones.</p><p><italic>4) Fitting unilateral FOF infusion data</italic></p><p>When fitting the unilateral FOF infusion data, the current approach seems to be to allow only the bias parameters to vary, while constraining the remaining parameters to the values obtained when fitting control data. However, bilateral FOF inactivation had a large effect on several of those fixed parameters (accumulation time constant, sensory noise, etc.). These parameters (particularly accumulation time constant) could reasonably be expected to change during unilateral FOF inactivation. Thus, assuming incorrect “control” values for these parameters could lead to incorrect fitting of the bias parameters.</p><p>It seems that any parameters likely to be affected by unilateral FOF inactivation (e.g., those strongly affected by bilateral inactivation) should be free to vary. This could be done through nested model fits, and given that the model fits are based on likelihoods, statistical nested-model comparison could be performed (e.g., likelihood ratio test) in addition to direct visualization of the likelihood surfaces.</p><p>An additional suggestion is to repeat the analysis (testing four versions of bias parameters) but do it multiple times, each time leaving eight of the nine original parameters fixed and one unconstrained. If indeed each of these nine tests shows that the unconstrained original parameter took the same value as in the control data, then the method of fixing the nine would be more justified.</p><p>Finally, when comparing four alternative explanations for unilateral FOF results, is there any way to be sure that a local maximum has not been found in the parameter space? For instance, perhaps given one solution for the original 9 model parameters, the Post-Cat-Bias manipulation accounts for unilateral FOF inactivations best, but given another solution the Input Gain would fit best. In the original paper about the model the authors stated that the model is not proven concave, so in a case like this it seems like one must worry that a local maximum may have been found (or, even if a global maximum was found, one may consider that another peak of comparable likelihood exists).</p><p><italic>5) Distinguishing effects on lapse rate and accumulation time</italic></p><p>Another concern regards the possibility of bolstering the model-based inferences from the behavioral data. The ability to distinguish between effects on lapse rate and accumulation time constant is critical to this paper. There are two related components one would like to see strengthened. First, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> would be bolstered by an elaboration of the analysis shown in panel D. The reverse-correlation analysis compares the data and the model (the latter, relying on an effect on the time-constant of accumulation). Consideration of how the rev-co kernel would look for the alternate model (lapse rate) may provide a complementary perspective on why this model is insufficient, perhaps broadening the support beyond the likelihood-based metric.</p><p>A related concern regards likelihood-based fits. These are of course statistically principled, but in practice the metric can explode at the extremes: the most common instance is for binomial data with 0% or 100% accuracy (i.e., the extremes of a nice psychometric function). Now, these extremes may not be at play in the key analysis here, so the concern is not particularly strong, and in general the notion of showing the likelihood space as a function of parameters is powerful and richer than the usual reliance on p-values. But fleshing out whether (and if so, how), extremes were handled would be helpful.</p><p><italic>6) Unclear results of the side LED experiments</italic></p><p>There seems to be a disagreement between the average data obtained in the side LED experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), and the data in individual trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3–figure supplement 3</xref>). This is hard to tell, because <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3–figure supplement 3</xref> is insufficiently labelled. Specifically, are the two end points in these curves the side LED trials? This in unlabeled but seems to be true since there are eight points per plot, matching the six click differences + two side LED types from main <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. If so, then one can hardly understand how the side LED trials are unaffected in the average (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>) because it's clear from looking at individuals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3–figure supplement 3B</xref>) that in almost all cases these trials are massively shifted. If the data plotted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3–figure supplement 3</xref> are only click trials, then plotting the side LED trials as well would be helpful, and also it would be helpful to explain why eight click-rate-differences are plotted for each individual in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3–figure supplement 3</xref> but only six in main <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. It is important to clarify this because much of the interpretation rests on the result that unilateral FOF inactivations do not influence performance on side LED trials (to rule out a motor explanation).</p><p><italic>7) Unsatisfactory model comparison</italic></p><p>In the comparison of Input Gain and Post-Categorization-Bias models, a look at the data suggest the paper dismisses the input gain model too quickly. First, it seems to fit the reverse correlation plots slightly better (while fitting the psychometric functions slightly worse); <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6-figure supplement 1</xref>. Second, there is no metric for interpreting how impactful (on behavioral performance and/or fit quality) a shift of 0.4 in post-cat-bias relative to a shift of 0.3 in input gain might be (visually estimating 0.3 from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Similarly, the statement that post-cat-bias is “50 log-units better” than input gain sounds impressive but is difficult to interpret. Is it possible to do a cross-validation test? Using the parameters fit [with the post-cat-bias, input gain, or both] from 90% of the trials, predict behavior on the other 10% (or leave-one-out, or however one wishes to do this)? This would be clearer to interpret and would also allow for the comparison of the model including both parameter shifts to the models including only one. Finally, if each model is fit to each animal (or session), then it seems that <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> can have error bars, which would be further helpful. Somewhat related to this: Can the post-cat-bias be understood in the same way as the bilateral effects, namely as a shortened memory? That is, even in the single-sided trials, perhaps the rat forgets his choice in the quarter second between the go cue and the start of his movement? I.e. even this massive click train still decays with tau=-0.24 s.</p><p><italic>8) Unclear design of the free-choice trials</italic></p><p>On the free-choice trials, it is unclear whether muscimol was injected into a side of the brain specifically chosen to be contralateral to the bias from the previous day, or whether it was injected into a random side. If random, why is there such a strong contralateral bias in control? If chosen based on previous day's bias, this effect could reflect regression to the mean; indeed the muscimol points in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref> appear to have somewhat close to zero mean. An appropriate control would be to make the same selection of which side is defined as ipsilateral, but then do a control (“isoflurane”) injection session instead of muscimol. (The legend seems to indicate that the points labeled ”Control“ in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref> are not control injections but rather data from the previous day relative to the muscimol points; if this was an incorrect understanding then the legend could be clarified.)</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05457.026</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>We believe we have sufficiently addressed all the issues brought up by the reviewers. First, we have edited the text of the manuscript to better reflect the conclusions and limitations of our results. Second, we have updated figures and captions to avoid confusion and address the potential confounds that reviewers addressed. Finally, we did extensive additional analyses to support our model-based conclusions about the role of the FOF. All of our additional analyses support our original claims, and we are grateful to the reviewers for helping us to make the paper stronger.</p><p>1) Use of muscimol</p><p><italic>The manuscript should explain the advantages of using muscimol inactivation over the better-characterized optogenetic approach used in the same lab (Hanks et al.). Muscimol infusion has much poorer spatial and temporal resolution, and given the depth of these injections (1.5 mm below the cortical surface), one worries that muscimol could be affecting basal ganglia in the FOF infusions (e.g., the single example provided in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1 fig3s2 fig3s3"><italic>Figure 3–figure supplements 3-1</italic></xref> <italic>seems to show some subcortical spread). These limitations should be discussed</italic>.</p><p>Muscimol versus halorhodopsin: Thank you for the excellent question. We should have described the rationale for our choice in the manuscript. When we began using halorhodopsin in the lab, we thought it would entirely replace our use of muscimol. However, we came to understand that instead of one technique replacing the other, the two complement each other. The reviewers’ question made us further realize that other labs facing a similar choice between inactivation techniques might find our rationale to be of interest. We thus now write in the manuscript:</p><p>“Although optogenetics allows high temporal resolution inactivation, its radius of effect in our hands is only ∼750 um (Hanks, Kopec, et al. 2015). In contrast, inactivating larger regions is much more readily achieved with muscimol, for which the radius of inactivation can be increased simply by increasing the infusion dose. In addition, muscimol directly inactivates all neurons within its radius of effect, not only infected neurons. Moreover, in some tasks, including the Poisson Clicks task, we find that the behavioral effect of optogenetic silencing begins to decay after a few weeks, while the effect of muscimol is stable. This stability in particular was essential for the current study, which used within-subject manipulations over hundreds of days. Optogenetic and pharmacological silencing therefore have complementary advantages and disadvantages. Here we focused on pharmacological inactivation.”</p><p>Subcortical spread of muscimol: There is little risk of muscimol spread from the FOF into the basal ganglia. We should point out that the thick white matter bundle (∼ 1 mm) separating FOF from the striatum below provides an effective barrier to the spread of muscimol in the ventral direction. We should also emphasize that <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1 fig3s2 fig3s3">Figure 3–figure supplements 3-1</xref>, referred to by the reviewers, is not an image of muscimol spread, but of an anatomical tracer infused into the FOF cannula of one animal. This tracer (cholera-toxin-B conjugated to a fluorophore) is mostly retrograde but also has some anterograde transport. Thus, in contrast to muscimol, which will be blocked by greasy white matter, the CTB will follow axons projecting into the white matter. What is seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1 fig3s2 fig3s3">Figure 3–figure supplements 3-1</xref> is CTB going into the most superficial part of the white matter bundle. We apologize for making it easy to confuse CTB spread with muscimol spread, and we have now made sure to clarify and emphasize the difference in both <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1 fig3s2 fig3s3">Figure 3–figure supplements 3-1</xref> and its caption.</p><p>Other spread of muscimol: We wholly agree that spread of muscimol is important to discuss. We discuss spread from FOF to adjacent cortical regions in the Discussion (from second paragraph of subsection headed “Role of FOF”); we have now added a sentence to that section explaining that the white matter blocks spread ventrally into the basal ganglia. We also discussed issues of spread of muscimol from PPC in subsection headed “Role of PPC”(and see response below).</p><p>2) Incomplete PPC inactivations?</p><p><italic>The paper discusses the lack of consensus regarding the stereotaxic location of PPC, and addresses this by infusing multiple locations in different groups of animals. This is unconvincing, especially given the importance of the negative results in PPC to the main points of the paper. It would be useful to see more anatomical characterization to show that what is being called PPC has the appropriate input characteristics. This could be done fairly easily in a few naïve animals using retrograde tracers showing that their identified region receives inputs from multiple sensory regions, lateral posterior thalamus, prefrontal cortex, and contralateral PPC</italic>.</p><p>Our bregma coordinates receive input from regions that match those expected from PPC. Although we used bregma coordinates routinely described as “PPC” in the rat literature (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Nitz, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63a">Raposo et al, 2014</xref>), we agree that that anatomical data demonstrating that these coordinates have the connectivity one would expect from PPC would be very appropriate. A recent study from the McNaghuton lab provides these data (Wilber, A. A., Clark, B. J. et al., Cortical connectivity maps reveal anatomically distinct areas in the parietal cortex of the rat. Frontiers in Neural Circuits<italic>,</italic> January 2015). The authors used several tracing techniques to examine the inputs to the rat PPC, and report that the bregma coordinates we used receive input from the expected regions, including the lateral posterior thalamus, multiple sensory cortices, prefrontal cortex, contralateral PPC, and FOF (which is a subregion of M2). Interestingly, in their <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, they should that only the region that we have targeted as PPC (which they consider “rostral” parietal cortex) has input from FOF. We have updated the manuscript in several places to include this important reference.</p><p><italic>Indeed, a major concern is that PPC inactivations may be only partial, given the large medial-lateral extent of rat PPC (as the paper notes, ∼4mm), the muscimol infusions are likely only partially inactivating PPC, and the lack of effect could be due to compensation by the spared neurons. It is nice that there is a positive control in the 'free choice' experiments, but it is not clear that one can rule out a more subtle influence of PPC in the evidence accumulation task</italic>.</p><p>Even our largest inactivations may be only partial. Based on our largest doses and the existing literature that has examined the spread of muscimol in rat cortex (Krupa, 1999) we believe that our largest doses should cover the entire PPC. But as the reviewers point out, it nevertheless remains possible that there might be some spared neurons in the PPC that compensate for the inactivated neurons. However, even if this were true, we would expect a dose-response relationship for unilateral muscimol PPC and bias magnitude. No such relationship is seen for accumulation trials (square yellow data points, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Furthermore, the accumulation task contains trials that are at psychophysical threshold (i.e. 50% performance). If unilateral PPC inactivations had a behavioral effect, we would have expected it to be revealed on those trials. On balance, then, we feel the evidence leans towards a lack of effect from unilateral PPC inactivations alone. But we acknowledge in the Discussion that we cannot completely rule out the possibility that unilateral inactivations could produce an effect. Note that lack of an effect after unilateral PPC inactivations alone is different, as we discuss in the next paragraph, from a subtle role for PPC in the accumulation task.</p><p>We agree, and the data indeed show, that PPC has a subtle but real effect on the accumulation task. The reviewers suggest that we acknowledge that there may be a subtle influence of the PPC in the accumulation task. We very much agree, and that is what we would have liked to portray. In the abstract, we use the term “minimal” for the role of PPC, which seems close in spirit to “subtle”. Nevertheless, we fear that our original writing may have been too strong, and may have instead conveyed a “no PPC effect whatsoever” message. If so, that was our mistake, and we thank the reviewers for pushing us into making sure to correct it.</p><p>The evidence, included in the original submission, for a subtle but significant effect of PPC inactivations on the accumulation task comes from two findings: (1) there was a weak, but statistically significant effect of 150ng of muscimol bilaterally infused into PPC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). (2) unilateral inactivation of 300ng of muscimol into the PPC during simultaneous bilateral inactivation of the FOF produced a small, but clear and measurable bias (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9E</xref>). We note that both of these effects were produced at doses of muscimol substantially lower than the higher 600ng and 2500ng doses used in the unilateral PPC experiments. This suggests to us that the lack of effects that we saw in the unilateral PPC experiments were not due to spared neurons. Nonetheless, we have softened our language in the Discussion ( paragraph three of subsection headed “Role of PPC”).</p><p><italic>The experiment one would really like to see is a characterization of the extent of PPC using anatomical tracers, followed by inactivation of the entire region. This would require significantly more work, and may be beyond the scope of a reasonable revision of this paper, but at the very least the paper should address this issue in the Discussion and reduce the strength of the claims accordingly</italic>.</p><p>We agree that that would indeed require far more work than would fit within a revision, and we thank the reviewers for the opportunity to address the issue in the Discussion and reduce the strength of the claims appropriately. See subsection headed “Role of PPC”.</p><p>3) Relationship with visual study</p><p><italic>In its current version, the paper states that PPC plays no role in perceptual decisions. A revision should clarify that this applies to ”auditory” perceptual decisions. The recent paper by</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63a">Raposo et al. (2014)</xref> <italic>shows similar lack of effects on an auditory task, but profound effects in a visual task. The manuscript relates to this study in one paragraph (eighth paragraph of Discussion) to suggest that PPC may be mostly visual rather than auditory, but seems to prefer the rather harsh interpretation that other investigators had results in visual tasks due to experimental error. It is dangerous to criticize others for possible technical errors (muscimol spreading unintentionally far) when one's paper may suffer from the same limitations. It would be interesting to see a more balanced discussion of those results, perhaps starting in the Introduction. For instance, there may be some tension about whether those results point to an evidence accumulation deficit for visual information, or just a visual deficit. More generally, this paper should make sure not to overreach in its conclusions about the role of PPC in all sorts of perceptual decisions, and limit itself to auditory ones</italic>.</p><p>We agree that the bulk of our data, from an auditory accumulation of evidence task, provides evidence only about accumulation of auditory evidence, and that we should correct our writing wherever it gives a misleading impression. Consequently, throughout the manuscript, beginning with and including the abstract, we have endeavored to replace statements about “evidence accumulation” with statements about “auditory evidence accumulation”. We hope this will clarify the issue, and thank the reviewers for pointing out the problem.</p><p>We also fully agree that issues of muscimol spillover could apply to our own study. In our original submission we tried to discuss these issues directly, and specifically with respect to our own data and conclusions. We have kept all those sections in this resubmission. If the reviewers think that those sections are insufficient, and that a more in-depth discussion of how the issue affects our own data is necessary, we would be happy to expand those sections.</p><p>With respect to the Raposo et al. visual+auditory study, our concerns regarding spillover are a reflection of concerns that we have with data from our own lab: we have recently begun using a visual variant of the Poisson Clicks task (Scott et al., SFN 2014, Constantinople et al., SFN 2014), and following Raposo et al., we find, as they did, that infusing muscimol into “standard” PPC coordinates impairs rats performing the visual task even while it leaves rats performing the auditory task intact (Scott et al., unpublished preliminary data). Nevertheless, the literature regarding the location of PPC seems to us unclear with respect to the PPC/visual cortex border. This has made us very reluctant to firmly conclude that our inactivation at PPC coordinates avoids inactivation of visual cortex, and our concerns with our own data seem to us to also apply to the data in Raposo et al.</p><p>Raposo et al. cited a single study (Reep at al. 1994) to define the posterior border of PPC at -5.0 mm from Bregma. This definition was critical to their conclusion that their inactivations, which were centered at – 3.8mm from Bregma, had not gone past -5.0, and had thus not invaded visual cortex. However, based on and specifically citing the very same data (originally reported in Chandler, King, Corwin, and Reep 1992) that led <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Reep et al. 1994</xref> to define PPC as extending to -5.0mm from Bregma, Corwin and Reep, the very same authors, four years later defined PPC as extending only to -4.4mm from Bregma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Corwin and Reep, 1998</xref>, page 90). In other words, there is substantial uncertainty in the location of the border even within a single data set from a single set of authors. Using a -4.4mm definition, the Raposo et al. inactivations would have extended well into visual cortex. Our point is not that the Raposo et al. inactivations necessarily extended into visual cortex. Our point is that our reading of the current state of the literature, suggests that it is very difficult to rule out the possibility that they did.</p><p>Another, less direct, example of the lack of consensus or precision in the literature regarding the PPC/visual cortex border is that the standard rat atlas (Paxinos and Watson, 6th edition), places the PPC/V2 border even <italic>more</italic> anterior, at ∼-4.14mm from Bregma, making the problem even more acute.</p><p>This problem is much less of a concern for the auditory tasks, since we do not expect visual cortex to play a major role in those.</p><p>We also believe that it is interesting to maintain a comparison and a dialogue with results from similar primate research. That motivates us to consider possible interpretations that reconcile results across species, which is what the spillover hypothesis would achieve. All this said, we certainly do not intend to be “harsh” with respect to the Raposo et al. study (to quote the word used by the reviewers). We are strong supporters of that lab’s line of work, and we thank the reviewers for pointing out that our writing came across as harsh, thus giving us the opportunity to correct that. We have now tried, in that discussion section, to both clarify our thinking about the uncertainty in the location of the border, and to soften our language, clearly labeling the spillover possibility as intellectually appealing because it reconciles results across species, but nevertheless undoubtedly speculative. That section now reads</p><p>“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63a">Raposo et al. (2014)</xref> reported an impairment after rat PPC inactivations in a visual, but not in an auditory, version of a closely related task. This contrasts with a preliminary report from Yates et al. that suggested no effect from primate PPC inactivation in a visual accumulation of evidence task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Yates et al., 2014</xref>), as well as with multiple reports of no effect from primate PPC inactivation in visual memory-guided saccade tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chafee and Goldman-Rakic, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wardak et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Liu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Wilke et al., 2012</xref>). […] While such a reconciliation of results across multiple species could have some intellectual appeal, we emphasize that experiments that would either clearly support or rule out this possibility remain to be done.”</p><p>We hope this sounds much less harsh, while still laying out all the issues for discussion. We also hope that highlighting the uncertainty in the PPC/visual cortex border may help motivate further studies to pin down its location, which could have significant impact on future studies that attempt to target PPC specifically.</p><p>4) Fitting unilateral FOF infusion data</p><p><italic>When fitting the unilateral FOF infusion data, the current approach seems to be to allow only the bias parameters to vary, while constraining the remaining parameters to the values obtained when fitting control data. However, bilateral FOF inactivation had a large effect on several of those fixed parameters (accumulation time constant, sensory noise, etc.). These parameters (particularly accumulation time constant) could reasonably be expected to change during unilateral FOF inactivation. Thus, assuming incorrect “control” values for these parameters could lead to incorrect fitting of the bias parameters</italic>.</p><p>Motivated to address the reviewers concerns we used the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm to sample from an 8-parameter model that included the 4 bias parameters, as well as 4-parameters of interest from the original model (accumulation time constant, accumulator noise, sensory noise and lapse). This technique is computationally expensive and not guaranteed to find the global optimum. Nonetheless, allowing all 8 parameters to vary simultaneously, the post-categorization parameter still had the biggest change, small changes in other parameters that gave a higher likelihood than the 1-parameter post-categorization model. However, the improvement was small and using bayesian information criteria we conclude that the 1-parameter model is better. Please see the section on modeling the unilateral FOF data for more details.</p><p><italic>Finally, when comparing four alternative explanations for unilateral FOF results, is there any way to be sure that a local maximum has not been found in the parameter space?</italic></p><p>We had the same concern as the reviewer and had previously examined the shape of the likelihood distribution for each of the 1-parameter models. As it turns out, there is a single maximum for each of the 1-parameter models. We now include those plots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6–figure supplement 1</xref>.</p><p>5) Distinguishing effects on lapse rate and accumulation time</p><p><italic>Another concern regards the possibility of bolstering the model-based inferences from the behavioral data. The ability to distinguish between effects on lapse rate and accumulation time constant is critical to this paper. There are two related components one would like to see strengthened. First,</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><italic>Figure 4</italic></xref> <italic>would be bolstered by an elaboration of the analysis shown in panel D. The reverse-correlation analysis compares the data and the model (the latter, relying on an effect on the time-constant of accumulation). Consideration of how the rev-co kernel would look for the alternate model (lapse rate) may provide a complementary perspective on why this model is insufficient, perhaps broadening the support beyond the likelihood-based metric</italic>.</p><p>The lapse model is used as an example of how the psychometric curve is a narrow lens which which to examine deficits, compared to the full model. We could also have used increases in accumulator noise, sensory noise, or initial noise to generate a similar psychometric curve. As such, and motivated by the concerns of the reviewer regarding the reliability of the bilateral FOF fits, we have added several extra model comparison analyses to the paper. We have estimated the confidence intervals of the parameters by resampling the bilateral FOF trials and fitting the model to this resampled data. Given our current computational resources we have managed to fit the model to 300 resamples. This analysis supported our existing conclusion - the time-constant of accumulation became significantly leaky after bilateral FOF inactivation. Please see the Results section on bilateral FOF modeling for more details (subsection headed “Bilateral FOF inactivations reduce the subject’s accumulation time constant”) and the results of the resampling (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 4–source data 1</xref>).</p><p><italic>A related concern regards likelihood-based fits. These are of course statistically principled, but in practice the metric can explode at the extremes: the most common instance is for binomial data with 0% or 100% accuracy (i.e., the extremes of a nice psychometric function). Now, these extremes may not be at play in the key analysis here, so the concern is not particularly strong, and in general the notion of showing the likelihood space as a function of parameters is powerful and richer than the usual reliance on p-values. But fleshing out whether (and if so, how), extremes were handled would be helpful</italic>.</p><p>Indeed, we encountered this very issue of fitting extremes when developing what later became the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brunton et al. 2013</xref> model, which we use heavily in the current manuscript. As the reviewer points out, if the model predicts that a particular choice in one trial will occur with near 100% certainty, and the rat makes the opposite choice, that the single trial will have an infinite negative log likelihood. That single trial could thus, on its own, completely skew the results. To address this issue, the model includes a “lapse” parameter, a fraction of trials in which the animal appears to ignore the stimuli and performs randomly. At the very easiest trials, rat behavior in our task seems to asymptote at 90% correct, so the lapse parameter typically has values of ∼ 0.1. This puts a bound on how low the likelihood of a trial can be. For example, with a lapse parameter of 0.1, the log likelihood will never be less than log(0.1), and thus no single trial can dominate the results.</p><p>We now write, in the “Analysis and Statistics” section of the Methods,</p><p>Even at the very easiest trials, rat behavior in our task often asymptotes at ∼90% correct. To fit this, the model includes a “lapse” parameter, which represents a fraction of trials in which subjects will ignore the stimulus and choose randomly. The presence of the lapse parameter also puts a lower bound on the likelihood of any individual trial, and thus no individual trial can dominate the results and the consequent fits of the model.</p><p>6) Unclear results of the side LED experiments</p><p><italic>There seems to be a disagreement between the average data obtained in the side LED experiments (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3C</italic></xref><italic>), and the data in individual trials (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3"><italic>Figure 3–figure supplement 3</italic></xref><italic>). This is hard to tell, because</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3"><italic>Figure 3–figure supplement 3</italic></xref> <italic>is insufficiently labelled. Specifically, are the two end points in these curves the side LED trials? This in unlabeled but seems to be true since there are eight points per plot, matching the six click differences + two side LED types from main</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3</italic></xref><italic>. If so, then one can hardly understand how the side LED trials are unaffected in the average (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3C</italic></xref><italic>) because it's clear from looking at individuals (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3"><italic>Figure 3–figure supplement 3B</italic></xref><italic>) that in almost all cases these trials are massively shifted. If the data plotted in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3"><italic>Figure 3–figure supplement 3</italic></xref> <italic>are only click trials, then plotting the side LED trials as well would be helpful, and also it would be helpful to explain why eight click-rate-differences are plotted for each individual in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3"><italic>Figure 3–figure supplement 3</italic></xref> <italic>but only six in main</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3</italic></xref><italic>. It is important to clarify this because much of the interpretation rests on the result that unilateral FOF inactivations do not influence performance on side LED trials (to rule out a motor explanation)</italic>.</p><p>We apologize to the reviewer for the confusion. There are no side LED trials in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Fig 3-figure supplement 3</xref> (or any of the supplements showing the GLMM fits). We have edited the figure caption to make this more clear. These supplemental figures serve two purposes. 1) They show the reliability of the muscimol inactivation across rats on the Clicks task. 2) They show the logistic GLMM fits. Because those plots show data and also the logistic “fit” which visualized the GLMM we think having the side LED trials there would be confusing. The choice of eight vs. six points is not important since those points are for visualization and all statistics were done on unbinned data.</p><p>7) Unsatisfactory model comparison</p><p><italic>In the comparison of Input Gain and Post-Categorization-Bias models, a look at the data suggest the paper dismisses the input gain model too quickly. First, it seems to fit the reverse correlation plots slightly better (while fitting the psychometric functions slightly worse);</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1"><italic>Figure 6-figure supplement 1</italic></xref><italic>. Second, there is no metric for interpreting how impactful (on behavioral performance and/or fit quality) a shift of 0.4 in post-cat-bias relative to a shift of 0.3 in input gain might be (visually estimating 0.3 from</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6"><italic>Figure 6B</italic></xref><italic>). Similarly, the statement that post-cat-bias is “50 log-units better” than input gain sounds impressive but is difficult to interpret. Is it possible to do a cross-validation test? Using the parameters fit [with the post-cat-bias, input gain, or both] from 90% of the trials, predict behavior on the other 10% (or leave-one-out, or however one wishes to do this)? This would be clearer to interpret and would also allow for the comparison of the model including both parameter shifts to the models including only one. Finally, if each model is fit to each animal (or session), then it seems that</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6"><italic>Figure 6A</italic></xref> <italic>can have error bars, which would be further helpful. Somewhat related to this: Can the post-cat-bias be understood in the same way as the bilateral effects, namely as a shortened memory? That is, even in the single-sided trials, perhaps the rat forgets his choice in the quarter second between the go cue and the start of his movement? I.e. even this massive click train still decays with tau=-0.24 s</italic>.</p><p>We performed cross-validation, leaving out individual sessions. We described this in the caption of a figure, which we realize was easy to miss. We have moved the description of the cross-validation to the main text. In addition, in response to this comment and also major comment #4 we have performed new analyses using the Metropolis-Hastings sampler to further examine the unilateral FOF model fits. Although there was a shift toward negative taus, this was not significant. This new analysis is described starting in the fifth paragraph of the subsection headed “Unilateral FOF inactivations produce a post-categorization bias”.</p><p>8) Unclear design of the free-choice trials</p><p><italic>On the free-choice trials, it is unclear whether muscimol was injected into a side of the brain specifically chosen to be contralateral to the bias from the previous day, or whether it was injected into a random side. If random, why is there such a strong contralateral bias in control? If chosen based on previous day's bias, this effect could reflect regression to the mean; indeed the muscimol points in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9"><italic>Figure 9B</italic></xref> <italic>appear to have somewhat close to zero mean. An appropriate control would be to make the same selection of which side is defined as ipsilateral, but then do a control (“isoflurane”) injection session instead of muscimol. (The legend seems to indicate that the points labeled ”Control“ in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9"><italic>Figure 9B</italic></xref> <italic>are not control injections but rather data from the previous day relative to the muscimol points; if this was an incorrect understanding then the legend could be clarified</italic>.<italic>)</italic></p><p>We apologize to the reviewers for the confusion. Infusions were done on both sides, but a session where all the infusions were done to “push” the subjects away from their biases was shown as an extreme example. Since the innate biases are quite large, it is hard to push subjects much in the direction of their existing biases. However, the population panels are based on infusions on both sides and the results are consistent. In order to show this more clearly we have added the day after the infusion to the example session. The infusion day is significantly different from both the day before and the day after. If the finding were simply regressing toward the mean, the bias on the following day would not be expected to return to the control levels of bias.</p></body></sub-article></article>
