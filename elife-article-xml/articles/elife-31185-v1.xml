Why? We combined behavioral computational modeling and multivariate decoding of fMRI responses to identify neural loci of regulation-related shifts in value representations across goals and domains (dietary or altruistic choice). Surprisingly, regulatory goals did not alter integrative value representations in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, which represented all choice-relevant attributes across goals and domains. Instead, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) flexibly encoded goal-consistent values and predicted regulatory success for the majority of choice-relevant attributes, using attribute-specific neural codes. We also identified domain-specific exceptions: goal-dependent encoding of prosocial attributes localized to precuneus and temporo-parietal junction (not DLPFC). Our results suggest that cognitive regulation operated by changing specific attribute representations (not integrated values). Evidence of domain-general and domain-specific neural loci reveals important divisions of labor, explaining when and why regulatory success generalizes (or doesn’t) across contexts and domains.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>self-control</kwd><kwd>decision-making</kwd><kwd>altruism</kwd><kwd>dietary success</kwd><kwd>drift diffusion model</kwd><kwd>multivariate pattern analysis</kwd><kwd>fMRI</kwd><kwd>social cognition</kwd><kwd>value representations</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NIMH Conte Center 2P50 MH094258</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hutcherson</surname><given-names>Cendri A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This research was supported by funding from NIMH Conte Center 2P50 MH094258.

Does a decadent piece of cake merit the pounds we’ll put on afterwards? Should the pleas of a homeless person trump our own selfish needs? Empirical evidence suggests that the answer to these questions depends in part on a decision maker’s goals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bettman et al., 1998</xref>) and can be affected by intentional control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hare et al., 2011a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hutcherson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sokol-Hessner et al., 2013</xref>). Cognitive regulation of decision making thus serves an important function in goal-directed behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Magar et al., 2008</xref>), relying on attention, working memory, and executive control to promote particular, goal-congruent choices (e.g., eat healthier, be kinder). Cognitive regulation of decision making is an important technique in therapeutic interventions for problematic behaviors, including obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Shaw et al., 2005</xref>), addiction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Carroll and Onken, 2005</xref>), and other decision making disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sylvain et al., 1997</xref>). Previous findings have significantly advanced our understanding of the psychological and neural bases of cognitive regulation of decision making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hare et al., 2011a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hutcherson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hare et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kober et al., 2010</xref>), yet important questions about its computational underpinnings remain. At what level of the processing stream does goal-dependent cognitive regulation change the typical trajectory of choice? Does it operate in the same manner in different contexts, or does it depend on the domain? Answering these questions has important ramifications for understanding when people succeed or fail to implement their regulatory goals during decision making, why some people seem to succeed more often than others, and whether there are neural targets for treatment or biomarkers to identify at-risk individuals.</p><p>In studies of basic choice, weighted additive utility models have been used successfully to capture patterns in human behavior across a variety of domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Charness and Rabin, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Schoemaker and Waid, 1982</xref>). In these models, decision makers compute the decision value (DV) of each option as the weighted sum of its choice-relevant attributes <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mi>V</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:munder><mml:mo>∑</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:munder><mml:msub><mml:mi>w</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>b</mml:mi><mml:mi>u</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Keeney and Raiffa, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anderson et al., 1971</xref>) and compare them to make a choice. Recent neuroscience work provides evidence in favor of this model, observing signals related to the value of specific attributes in distinct cortical and subcortical areas, for both social (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hutcherson et al., 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hutcherson et al., 2015b</xref>) and non-social choices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lim et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Basten et al., 2010</xref>). In turn, signals correlated with the overall, integrated decision value of an option have been observed in multiple regions, such as the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC) and ventral striatum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hutcherson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Plassmann et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kable and Glimcher, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Knutson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Grueschow et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bartra et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Clithero and Rangel, 2014</xref>). A key goal of neuroeconomics is to describe how these attribute and decision value computations change as a function of regulatory goals and contexts, and to link such changes to regulatory success. Here, we sought to address three important questions about this process.</p><p>First, at what level does cognitive regulation operate to change value representations? Based on the neuroeconomic model outlined above, we hypothesized two possibilities. The <italic>attribute-level</italic> hypothesis suggests that cognitive regulation of decision making could alter value representations at a relatively low level, by amplifying or diminishing attribute representations directly in a distributed set of specific, dedicated attribute-coding areas, similar to attentional effects on visual object encoding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Egner and Hirsch, 2005</xref>). Alternatively, the <italic>integration-level</italic> hypothesis suggests that cognitive regulation of decision making might operate at comparatively higher levels in centralized, domain-general value integration areas such as the VMPFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hare et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hare et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Second, we aimed to explicitly test whether cognitive regulation alters value representations at the <italic>same</italic> level regardless of domain, or whether it differs as a function of attributes, goals or choice domain. For example, some attributes (such as taste) may be innate and prepotent, while other attributes (such as health or social considerations) may be more abstract or effortful to construct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sullivan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Metcalfe and Mischel, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Loewenstein and Small, 2007</xref>). We sought to test whether these distinctions might affect where and how cognitive regulation operates to alter value representations during decision making. We also sought to determine whether this translates into distinct regulatory capacities as a function of regulatory goal or choice domain.</p><p>Finally, we sought to shed light on whether information represented in VMPFC and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) supports either attribute-level or integration-level changes in value during cognitive regulation of decision making. For example, some experimental evidence supports the idea that the DLPFC might represent more abstract attributes like health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hare et al., 2011b2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bhanji and Beer, 2012</xref>), and that regulatory control could modulate interactions between the DLPFC and VMPFC to change attribute weights in integrative decision value computations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hare et al., 2011a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sokol-Hessner et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kober et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bhanji and Beer, 2012</xref>). However, several failures to observe changes in the VMPFC during cognitive regulation of decision making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hutcherson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hollmann et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yokum and Stice, 2013</xref>) suggest the need to either measure value computation in a more sensitive way, or to identify alternate routes to behavioral change.</p><p>Addressing these issues requires investigating regulatory control across multiple attributes and domains, using a sophisticated array of approaches for identifying changes in the representations of both specific attributes and integrated value signals. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to measure brain responses while subjects completed two choice tasks, separated in time by up to 24 months (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). Choices involved foods varying in healthiness and tastiness (food task) or monetary proposals varying in payoffs for subjects and an anonymous partner (altruism task). To mimic the kinds of cognitive reframing approaches that are often used in therapy for decision making disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Shaw et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Carroll and Onken, 2005</xref>), both tasks asked subjects to adopt distinct regulatory goals designed to highlight different choice attributes (e.g., ‘focus on the food’s healthiness’, ‘focus on your partner’s feelings’). To pinpoint whether and how regulation altered specific attribute representations or integrative value computations at the behavioral and neural level, we combined a multi-attribute extension of the drift diffusion model (DDM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ratcliff and McKoon, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Smith and Ratcliff, 2004</xref>) with multivariate pattern analyses (MVPA) of neural responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kriegeskorte et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Haynes and Rees, 2006</xref>). MVPA approaches to fMRI data exploit information encoded across multiple voxels and have been suggested to detect information that would be missed by conventional univariate analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kriegeskorte and Bandettini, 2007</xref>). Past research on cognitive regulation has relied primarily on mass univariate approaches, which could account for some of the inconsistencies observed in the literature. Our study used MVPA to examine whether and how directed attention to specific goals affects the neural information content (i.e., decoding accuracies) for attribute values in different social and non-social decision contexts. We hypothesized that goal-dependent changes in neural decoding accuracies would match predictions on altered attribute weights from the behavioral computational model. We investigated where such changes occurred, whether they operate in generic or domain-specific manner, and whether they predicted specific aspects of regulatory success across individuals.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31185.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>fMRI Paradigms and Choices.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Food Task.

Choices (yes/no) are made when the sequential accumulation of noisy value information that unfolds over time crosses the predefined upper or lower threshold for choice. The relative decision value (RDV) at a point in time (t) is computed as the weighted sum of choice relevant attributes plus noise (ε) (i.e., RDV<sub>t</sub> = RDV<sub>t-1 </sub>+ w<sub>Tastiness</sub> * Tastiness + w<sub>Healthiness</sub> * Healthiness + ε<sub>t</sub>). In the example displayed here, the value of a candy bar will tend to accumulate in a positive direction if the weight on Tastiness is high (blue line), yielding a choice in favor of a tasty but unhealthy item. However, the value of the food item is more likely to accumulate in a negative direction if the weight on Healthiness is high (brown line).

First, on the behavioral level, we confirmed that regulatory goals resulted in altered choice behavior. We also used our computational behavioral models (multi-attribute drift diffusion models, DDMs) to link these alterations to amplification or suppression of the influence of specific choice-relevant attributes on choices.</p><sec id="s2-1-1"><title>Choice behavior</title><p>Choices in both tasks varied considerably by regulatory goal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>). In the food task, subjects made choices in three conditions: Respond Naturally [NC] (‘respond as you naturally would’), Focus on Health [HC] (‘focus on the healthiness of the food when making the choice’), and Focus on Taste [TC] (‘focus on the tastiness of the food when making the choice’), implemented in interleaved blocks (see Appendix 1 – Instructions for regulatory conditions in both choice tasks for instructions). We defined a healthy choice as accepting the on-screen food if it was healthier than the default food (based on subject-specific healthiness ratings obtained outside of the scanner, see Materials and methods), and rejecting it otherwise. As expected, subjects made significantly healthier choices during HC (M ± SD: 78.83% ± 18.46) compared to both NC (44.31% ± 10.71) and TC (41.99% ± 11.46; paired t-tests: p’s &lt; 0.001, Bonferroni corrected unless stated otherwise). They also made marginally less healthy choices during TC than NC (p = 0.043, uncorrected; repeated measures ANOVA across all conditions: F(2,35) = 97.01, p &lt; 0.001).</p><p>In the altruism task, subjects were instructed either to Respond Naturally [NC] (‘respond as you naturally would’), Focus on Ethics [EC] (‘focus on doing the right thing and consider the ethical or moral implications of your choice’), or Focus on Partner [PC] (‘focus on your partner’s feelings and how the other person is affected by your choice’) (see Appendix 1 – Instructions for regulatory conditions in both choice tasks for instructions). We defined an altruistic choice as accepting an on-screen proposal whose outcome (relative to the default) benefitted the other at a cost to the self, or rejecting one in which the subject stood to benefit but their partner did not. As expected, subjects made altruistic choices significantly less often under NC (28.71% ± 15.48) compared to EC (49.94% ± 16.22) or PC (66.97% ± 24.35; p’s &lt; 0.001; F(2,35) = 65.96, p &lt; 0.001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Altruistic choices were also significantly higher in PC than EC (p &lt; 0.001), suggesting that directing attention to another persons’ feelings generally increased altruism more effectively than considering social and moral norms. Overall, these findings confirmed that regulatory goals resulted in altered choice behavior in the food task and the altruism task.</p></sec><sec id="s2-1-2"><title>Regulatory success</title><p>Given the considerable individual heterogeneity in the extent of these changes, we also sought to understand whether this heterogeneity might be consistent across tasks and regulatory instructions. Regulatory success – defined as goal-consistent changes in percent healthy or altruistic choices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hare et al., 2011a</xref>) (e.g., the increase in healthy choices during HC compared to NC) – covaried across tasks (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). People who chose healthy foods more often when attending to a food’s healthiness also behaved more altruistically when focusing on pro-social attributes. These results did not depend on the delay between tasks (partial correlations controlling for delay of up to 24 months, M ± SD: 16.42 ± 8.66, range: 1 to 24) or differences in baseline responding <italic>within</italic> a particular condition: the percentage of healthy and altruistic choices during NC blocks of both tasks did not correlate (all p’s &gt; 0.05, uncorrected).

Overall, these findings indicate that an individuals’ regulatory success generalized across choice domains.

Considering only the subset of subjects that also participated in the food task (N = 36) yielded comparable weights for attributes in altruistic choices (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). Overall, the results suggest that regulatory goals changed choice behavior by both increasing weighting of goal-consistent attributes (e.g. healthiness in HC) and decreasing weighting of goal-inconsistent attributes (e.g. tastiness in HC).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Neural encoding of choice attributes and effects of regulation</title><p>Next, we examined neural underpinnings of goal-consistent increases/decreases in the influence of attributes on altered choices in both tasks. This analysis step was designed to provide evidence for the effects of regulation at the attribute-level or integration-level. Both hypotheses suggest that changes in the influence of distinct attributes on choice should correspond to changes in neural encoding of those attributes. However, they make different predictions about <italic>where</italic> these changes should be observed. The attribute-level hypothesis predicts that attributes are encoded in attribute-specific brain areas and that regulation should result in changes to these local representations. By contrast, the integration-level hypothesis suggests that attribute-specific areas should encode attributes similarly <italic>regardless</italic> of the regulatory goal. Instead, altered representations should appear only within centralized brain regions associated with value-integration, such as the VMPFC, and should be detectable in a common signal associated with integrated values. We tested these distinct predictions by examining where attribute values were represented in the brain, and how these representations varied as a function of regulatory focus. We also explicitly tested whether the locus of effect differed across attributes (e.g. tastiness/healthiness, $Self/$Other/Fairness) or choice domain (e.g. social, non-social).</p><sec id="s2-2-1"><title>Neural encoding of choice attributes and decision values across conditions</title><p>Our behavioral results suggest that a weighted combination of different choice-relevant attributes captures behavior in both choice tasks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), implying that attribute information should be represented in the brain. However, the generality and specificity of this encoding has important implications both for theories about how different attributes are constructed, and how regulation operates to modulate their influence. We first sought to determine which brain regions reliably encoded trial-by-trial variation in a given attribute across experimental conditions and goals. Thus, this first set of decoding analyses tested <italic>if</italic> neural activation patterns encode attribute values, irrespective of whether one or several conditions drive this predictive information. To this end, we averaged the condition-specific decoding maps of an attribute for each subject and tested for brain regions that reliably predict values of the attribute at the group level. Consistent with predictions, information about each attribute could be decoded significantly above chance in multiple brain regions (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>), including the VMPFC, and, for some attributes, the DLPFC.

We hypothesized that altered behavioral weights of an attribute should be mirrored by changes in the neural encoding of that attribute as expressed in varying predictive accuracies. Crucially, these analyses allowed us to test whether goal-dependent change in neural encoding of attribute values occurs in attribute-specific regions or at a common neural locus regardless of attribute or domain. For each attribute, we used a repeated measures ANOVA implemented in SPM together with condition-specific decoding accuracy maps to test for changes in neural information on attribute values across conditions (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).

Test data consisted of data of the ninth run (10 trials) for which we predicted the trial-wise attribute values solely based on neural response patterns of these trials. The decoding accuracy (average of 9-fold cross-validation) was assigned to the central voxel of the sphere from which we extracted the neural data (right upper panel). This procedure was repeated for every measured voxel (left panel, dotted red line), yielding a whole brain accuracy map for an attribute, separately for each task condition and participant.

But what does this convergence in the DLPFC signify? On the one hand, the DLPFC might encode a <italic>unitary decision value signal</italic> that is sensitive to current goals. While limited to a specific set of attributes, this would support the integration-level hypothesis. If this was the case, the same code that represents a food’s tastiness in the food task (e.g. when focusing on taste) should also permit decoding of other attribute values used in other contexts (i.e., healthiness when focused on health, $Self in natural settings of altruistic choice). On the other hand, the DLPFC might compute attribute-specific representations in a goal-sensitive manner. This hypothesis is more consistent with attribute-level modulation. In this case, encoding of attribute values in this region should be unique to each specific attribute (i.e. codes for one attribute should not permit decoding of other attributes). We tested these competing predictions in a post-hoc ROI-based analysis examining the extent to which neural codes for one attribute in one context (e.g. tastiness in TC) generalize across attributes and contexts (e.g. healthiness in HC). These post-hoc decoding analyses differ from the previous set of analyses: more specifically, to probe for shared neural code in the DLPFC, we trained the SVM regression model on data of one attribute in one condition and see if it allows predicting trial-wise values of <italic>another</italic> attribute in the same or different regulatory condition (and vice versa, 2-fold cross-validation). We also tested for common neural codes for the same attribute across regulatory contexts.</p><p>Results most clearly supported the attribute-level hypothesis.

Notably, our analyses on the whole brain level did not reveal any significant variation of attribute value encoding in this area as a function of the regulatory goal. However, in light of previous evidence, we conducted a number of post-hoc ROI-analyses to probe in a more sensitive manner for goal-dependent value coding in the VMPFC (see Appendix 1 – ROI-based post-hoc tests to identify goal-consistent value coding in the VMPFC).

Thus, to determine whether regulatory success operates through common channels across attributes and domains, we first tested using behavior whether subjects’ ability to modulate specific attribute weights (estimated in separate DDMs) was correlated across the two tasks. Consistent with the notion of a common neural mechanism (in DLPFC), successful reduction in the weight on selfish considerations (Δw $Self) in altruistic choices was correlated with successfully amplifying the weight on health considerations in food choices (e.g., r = 0.50, for Δw $Self [NC - PC] and Δw Healthiness [HC - NC], p &lt; 0.05, corrected) and suppressing the weight of taste considerations in food choices (e.g., r = 0.45, Δw $Self [NC - PC] and Δw Tastiness [NC - TC], p &lt; 0.05, corrected).

This idea may explain the specific pattern of correlations we observed in behavioral measures of regulatory success and makes a further prediction: if the integrity and flexibility of the DLPFC is only necessary for representing certain attributes in a goal-consistent manner, then responses in this region should predict regulatory success only for those attributes that converge in this area, while regulatory success for other attributes (e.g., $Other) should be predicted by other regions (e.g., TPJ or precuneus). We tested this hypothesis using a cross-subject decoding approach: in a nutshell, this decoding analysis tested whether multi-voxel activation patterns in an ROI (e.g. DLPFC) allowed predicting an individuals regulatory success in a choice task, solely based on the participants regulation-related neural activation patterns (see Materials and methods and Appendix 1 – Multivariate regression of individual differences in regulatory success for details). The analyses focused on an ROI in DLPFC (with supplemental tests for TPJ, precuneus, and VMPFC) and regulatory success scores defined both by changes in attribute weights and by percentage of goal-consistent choices.</p><p>As hypothesized, regulation-related neural activation patterns in the right DLPFC conjunction area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>) during the food task reliably predicted how well a subject decreased taste weights and increased health weights in food choices (Δw Tastiness [(NC, TC) - HC]: r = 0.51, p &lt; 0.014, permutation test; Δw Healthiness [HC - (NC, TC)]: r = 0.42, p &lt; 0.041).

Similar results were found when we predicted subject-specific changes in regulation success based on improved dietary choices (ΔHealthy Choices [HC - (NC, TC)]: r = 0.50, p = 0.016; ΔHealthy Choices [HC - TC]: r = 0.46, p = 0.027), demonstrating that regulation-related neural predictions extend to actual behavior with real consequences.</p><p>Next, we asked whether neural activation patterns in the right DLPFC also predict individual differences in regulation success in the altruism task. Remarkably, neural patterns in DLPFC during <italic>food</italic> choices predicted subjects’ ability to reduce the weighting of their own monetary payoffs during <italic>altruistic</italic> choices separated in time by an average of 16 months from the food task (Δw $Self [NC - (EC, PC)]: r = 0.50, p = 0.015; Δw Self [NC - PC]: r = 0.55, p = 0.005; permutation tests).

Supplemental analyses suggest that predictive information on altered generosity was driven by neural information on changes in the attribute encoded in the DLPFC ($Self) and not by other attributes of the altruistic choice task (e.g., $Other, fairness) (see Appendix 1 – DLPFC-based prediction of goal-consistent changes of generosity is driven by goal-consistent changes in attribute representations of $Self (but not $Other or Fairness)). We also confirmed that decoding accuracies were not correlated with the delay between both choice tasks (all p’s &gt; 0.05, uncorrected), indicating that predictions of individual difference scores of regulatory success were unrelated to temporal delays between tasks.

Unexpectedly, cognitive regulation of decision making did <italic>not</italic> reliably modulate value signals within the VMPFC. Instead, regulatory effects converged to modulate a subset of distinct attribute representations in both the social and non-social domain within a region of the DLPFC that has previously been implicated in value-based choice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hutcherson et al., 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Plassmann et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Plassmann et al., 2010</xref>).

Our results provide important and novel insights into the domain generality and specificity of cognitive regulation of decision making, explain when and why regulatory success generalizes across contexts and domains, and raise exciting new questions for exploration.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Attribute-level vs. integration-level effects of cognitive regulation of decision making</title><p>Do goals (e.g. eat healthier, be kinder) influence construction of value by operating on distinct attribute representations, or by changing integration of these values in centralized, common-value regions of the brain?

First, although the VMPFC contained reliable information on the values of <italic>all</italic> attributes and encoded overall decision values across social and non-social contexts, these signals showed <italic>no</italic> modulation by regulatory goal for any attribute or decision value and did not predict individual differences in regulatory success. Moreover, no other area showed a complete correspondence between behavioral and neural effects of regulation, arguing against a single, centralized locus for effects of cognitive regulation on decision making. Second, we observed goal-dependent representations of some attributes (i.e., others’ benefits) in distinct, specialized brain regions like the TPJ and precuneus. Third, although we observed converging effects of regulation for a subset of attributes in the DLPFC (including tastiness, healthiness, and self-related benefits), representations of these attributes utilized distinct, differentiated codes. Taken together, although our results do not preclude the possibility that in other contexts cognitive regulation of decision making might operate on a single, centralized value integration mechanism, they suggest that it may often operate by changing distinct attribute representations.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Domain-general vs. domain-specific effects of cognitive regulation</title><p>If cognitive regulation of decision making is mediated by changes in distinct attribute representations, when might we expect regulatory success – or failure – to generalize across contexts and domains? Our results indicate that although the DLPFC used distinct codes to represent different attributes, it may nevertheless be a common denominator in regulatory success across domains. Behaviorally, goal-consistent shifts toward ‘virtuous’ behavior in one domain (i.e. healthier food choice) correlated with shifts in the other (i.e. more generosity). This covariation was driven by correlated changes in the behavioral weighting of <italic>precisely</italic> those attributes represented in the DLPFC (i.e., tastiness, healthiness, and self-related benefits), but not in attributes encoded elsewhere (i.e. other-related benefits, fairness). These findings are even more remarkable given delays of up to 24 months separating the two choice tasks (average 16 months), ruling out alternative explanations like memory, mood, or priming effects. Thus, the DLPFC may represent a stable individual resource permitting flexible representation of specific attributes according to current goals.</p><p>At the same time, goal-consistent changes in pro-social attributes (e.g. others benefits) appeared in areas like the TPJ and precuneus, especially when focused on the partner’s thoughts and feelings. This accords with growing evidence linking these regions to <italic>domain-specific</italic> computations related to Theory of Mind (ToM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Van Overwalle, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bzdok et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Schurz et al., 2014</xref>) and representing others’ mental states and needs during social choice: for instance, activation patterns in the rTPJ were recently shown to encode individual differences in the level of ToM during altruistic choice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tusche et al., 2016</xref>). Notably, activity in these regions did not encode other social attributes (e.g., fairness) or their goal-consistent changes. Moreover, focusing on ethical and normative reasons for giving (which may require less focus on others’ specific thoughts and feelings) increased altruistic choice, but actually <italic>decreased</italic> representations of the other’s payoffs in these regions. Thus, the TPJ and precuneus appear to encode features specifically related to representing others’ outcomes in a goal-sensitive manner, pointing to specialized loci of cognitive regulation in social choice domains.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>The role of VMPFC and DLPFC in valuation and cognitive regulation</title><p>Our study adds to a growing body of experimental work finding that behavioral effects of regulation can occur in the absence of corresponding changes to either overall levels of VMPFC response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hutcherson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hollmann et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yokum and Stice, 2013</xref>), or VMPFC representation of specific attributes like taste (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hare et al., 2011a</xref>). They also raise the intriguing possibility that the flexibility of DLPFC attribute representations may be particularly important for compensating when regulation of the VMPFC fails, a finding also observed in other studies of cognitive regulation of decision making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hutcherson et al., 2012</xref>). This raises an important question: what determines the capacity of the DLPFC to properly represent these different attributes? Intriguingly, exploratory connectivity results suggested that this may actually derive, at least in part, from functional interactions with the VMPFC area that represented all choice-relevant attributes, with the strength of connectivity between DLPFC and VMPFC correlating with regulatory success. Although speculative, this finding is consistent with research in both animals and humans suggesting that the VMPFC may modulate affective attribute representations in other areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Quirk and Beer, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Etkin et al., 2006</xref>). These results could also suggest that VMPFC represents an earlier stage in the value construction process, with DLPFC representations emerging more closely to response. Future work including the use of measures with higher temporal precision may help to elucidate when and how interactions between the VMPFC and DLPFC determine regulatory success in different contexts.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Explaining individual differences in regulatory success and failure</title><p>Our study is the first to document goal-consistent changes for <italic>all</italic> choice-relevant attributes, across diverse choice domains, both within and across individuals, shedding light on when and why regulatory efforts may succeed or fail. Our findings point to important divisions in regulatory success as a function of choice attributes and domain: an individual who struggles both to resist cheesecake and ignore their own self-interest may nevertheless have little difficulty in harnessing regulation to represent others’ needs and use this as input into social choices. This has important implications in treatment for decision making disorders: if therapeutic interventions fail when focused on one attribute (e.g., be less selfish), a switch to strategies focused on other attributes (e.g., think more about others) might be more effective. Future work will need to explore the full range of domains and attributes in which regulation could play an important role (e.g., risk, intertemporal choice, etc.) in order to determine the extent to which regulatory effects vary or converge across attributes and domains.</p><p>It is also worth noting that goal-consistent changes in attribute representations were generally exceptions rather than the rule. <italic>Most</italic> regions permitting attribute decoding showed <italic>no</italic> discernable change in representation of attributes as a function of goal. This may explain why regulatory success often feels so difficult: unregulated attribute representations in some areas (including the VMPFC) may continue to leak into choices, complicating regulatory success. It also argues against a trivial interpretation of our results that the changes we observed are simply uninteresting reflections of behavior: we observed highly specific and localized success-related changes in regions like DLPFC, TPJ, and precuneus, but not in other areas. This suggests that these regions may perform a special role in mediating the impact of regulatory goals on behavior.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Limitations and future directions</title><p>We cannot completely rule out that regulatory affects on behavior and attribute representations might partly reflect differences in motivation to satisfy expectations of the experimenter. However, we note that the specific patterns of convergence and divergence in regulatory success argue against this interpretation of our results: we suspect that if this were the case, we would not have observed either the distinct profile of within-subject correlations in regulatory success for different attributes, or differences in their neural correlates. Nevertheless, further research will be needed to fully resolve the extent to which individual differences in regulatory success result from limits in motivation or limits on capacity. Work examining whether gray matter volume in either the DLPFC and VMPFC predicts regulatory success across individuals might help to resolve such issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Schmidt et al., 2018</xref>). Tying laboratory measures of regulation to real-world consequences also remains a necessary future step in understanding the significance of these findings.</p><p>Our results also point to a number of other open questions and future directions. The implementation of a strictly data driven approach confirmed that several <italic>a priori</italic> hypothesized regions of interest such as the VMPFC or the DLPFC are crucial for implementing cognitive control of goal-directed choice. However, we cannot rule out that other brain regions not identified by the current analyses (e.g. the ventral striatum) also contribute to decision making during regulation. Indeed, we observed changes in attribute decoding in restricted, non-overlapping areas of visual and motor cortex for some but not all attributes, which might reflect non-causal changes in visual attention or motor preparation, but could also be important precursors to downstream changes in areas like the DLPFC, TPJ and precuneus.</p><p>The close correspondence between neural patterns and model-estimated changes in behavioral weighting suggests that our information-based neural measure captured a critical aspect of changes in neural computations during goal-dependent behavior. However, further investigation is necessary to understand what separates attributes whose representations converged in DLPFC from those that did not. One exciting avenue for future research will be to identify the precise factors that determine whether and when the DLPFC acts as the site for cognitive regulation of value. Understanding this distinction may help to predict when an individual will show more global deficits in regulatory success and when those deficits will tend to stand apart from success or failure in other domains or contexts.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Participants</title><p>Fifty-five healthy volunteers (25 female, M ± SD: 28 years ± 5.02) participated in the altruism task.

They also received a randomly selected food item at the end of the food experiment that had to be consumed in the lab. The altruism data of five subjects and the food data of one subject were excluded from further analyses due to excessive movement (&gt;3 mm/3degree).

On every trial, subjects chose between one of 90 food items presented on-screen (4 s) and a default food chosen prior to scanning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Subjects responded by pressing one of four buttons corresponding to ‘strong yes’, ‘yes’, ‘no’, ‘strong no’ (displayed at the bottom of the screen), using a button box placed in their right hand. The assignment of choice preferences to buttons was fixed throughout the task and the right-left orientation of the scale was counterbalanced across subjects. Inter-trial intervals varied from 1 to 4 s (average of 2 s), during which a white fixation cross was presented against a black background. After scanning, one trial was randomly drawn to determine what the subject would eat before leaving the lab. If subjects failed to respond within the 4 s of the selected trial either the on-screen or the default option was randomly chosen.</p><p>Subjects made food choices under three conditions: <italic>Respond Naturally</italic> (‘respond as you naturally would’, [NC]), <italic>Focus on Health</italic> (‘focus on the healthiness of the food when making the choice’, [HC]), or <italic>Focus on Taste</italic> (‘focus on the tastiness of the food when making the choice’, [TC]) (see Appendix 1 – Instructions for regulatory conditions in both choice tasks for instructions). Importantly, subjects were explicitly instructed to always make the decision based on their preference, regardless of the condition. Every condition comprised nine blocks (with 10 trials per block), resulting in a total of 90 trials per condition. Prior to every block, detailed instructions appeared for 4 s. In addition, during food display, a short description (‘Respond Naturally’, ‘Focus on Health’, ‘Focus on Taste’) appeared at the top of the screen to remind participants of the current instruction. Each of the nine functional scanning runs contained one block of every condition (i.e., three task blocks per run), with the order of conditions randomized across runs and subjects. The only exception was the first task block, which was pre-assigned to ‘natural’ for every subject. Practice trials as well as a short quiz prior to scanning ensured that subjects understood the instructions for each condition and were comfortable with the timing of the task.</p><p>Food items varied in their perceived tastiness and healthiness and included healthy snacks (e.g., apples, broccoli) and junk foods (e.g., candy bars, chips). Items were selected based on subjects ratings in a self-paced computerized task prior to scanning that assessed perceived tastiness (5-point Likert scale, ‘very untasty’ to ‘very tasty’) and healthiness (5-point Likert scale, ‘very unhealthy’ to ‘very healthy’) of 200 food items (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hare et al., 2011a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hutcherson et al., 2012</xref>). Ninety food items were selected from this larger set to cover the range of health and taste ratings in a roughly uniform manner. In addition, for each subject we chose one default food that was perceived as neutral for taste and health. Each food item was presented once in each of three choice conditions, with presentation order randomized across blocks, functional runs, and subjects. To ensure the motivational saliency of the food items, subjects were asked to refrain from eating 4 hr prior to testing. Stimulus presentation was implemented using high-resolution color pictures (72 dpi) and Psychophysics Toolbox Version 3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brainard, 1997</xref>) together with Matlab (2014a).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-2"><title>Altruism task</title><p>The altruism task was an fMRI compatible version of the dictator game modified from (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hutcherson et al., 2015b</xref>). On every trial, subjects were presented with a monetary proposal that affected their own ($Self) and another persons’ ($Other) monetary payoff (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Subjects had 4 s to chose between the on-screen proposal and a constant default allocation ($20 to both) by pressing one of the four response buttons (‘strong yes’, ‘yes’, ‘no’, ‘strong no’; direction counter-balanced across subjects). Payouts for self and other ranged from $0 to $40 and always involved a tradeoff between self and other (i.e. prizes for one individual were equal or less than the default, while prizes for the other individual exceeded the default). Thus, subjects always had to choose between acting altruistically (benefitting the other at a cost to oneself) or selfishly (benefitting oneself at a cost to the other) on every trial. At the end of the experiment, one trial was randomly selected and implemented according to the subjects’ choice. If subjects failed to respond within 4 s for this trial, both individuals received $0.</p><p>Similar to the food task, subjects performed the task under three different conditions: <italic>Respond Naturally</italic> (‘respond as you naturally would’, [NC]), <italic>Focus on Ethics</italic> (‘focus on doing the right thing and consider the ethical or moral implications of your choice’, [EC]), or <italic>Focus on Partner</italic> (‘focus on your partner’s feelings and how the other person is affected by your choice’, [PC]). Subjects were reminded to always make their choice based on their preference, regardless of the condition. Conditions were implemented in separate blocks of 10 trials each, with the beginning of a new block signaled by a short reminder instruction (4 s). Matching the food task, subjects performed 9 blocks of each condition (i.e., 90 trials per condition and a total of 270 trials), with the block order counter-balanced across subjects and functional runs, with the exception that the first two blocks were always natural choice trials. Choices in these NC blocks were used to estimate a logistic regression [Choice = w<sub>Self</sub> * $Self + w<sub>Other</sub> * $Other] and used for a subject-specific selection of 30% of proposals most likely to elicit generous behavior and 30% of proposals likely to elicit selfish behavior. The remaining 40% of trials were randomly chosen from the full proposal space. Practice trials and a quiz prior to scanning verified that subjects were capable and comfortable to make the choice within 4 s.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-3"><title>Probabilistic choices</title><p>To decrease experimental demand and to ensure anonymity in the altruism task, subjects were informed that implementation of their choices was probabilistic and that in 40% of trials their choices would be reversed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hutcherson et al., 2015b</xref>). Subjects were informed that their partner would only know the proposal and the outcome of the randomly chosen trial, but not their decision (i.e., if the outcome was due to the subjects’ choice or a choice reversal). The implementation was as follows: After each choice (jittered delay of 2–4 s), an outcome screen (4 s) informed subjects of the implementation of choices (implemented/choice reversal), followed by a jittered inter-trial interval of 1–4 s (average of 2 s) before the next choice screen appeared. Computerized control questions during training confirmed that subjects understood the probabilistic nature of the task and that it was still in their best interest to choose according to their individual preferences. In the food task, we matched the probabilistic implantation in the altruism task, and informed participants prior to scanning that their choices would be implemented with 60% probability.</p><p>Data from an independent behavioral pilot study (N = 17, 11 female, M ± SD: 24.12 years ± 5.83) confirmed that choices under almost perfect implementation (90%) closely matched those observed under 60% implementation conditions (within-subject design, all p’s &gt; 0.37, uncorrected, for paired t-tests of RTs, percentage of generous and healthy choices). These findings strongly suggest that the probabilistic nature of the task did not systematically alter preference-based choices in both tasks.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Behavioral computational model (DDM)</title><p>We used a multi-attribute extension of the standard drift diffusion model (DDM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ratcliff and McKoon, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Smith and Ratcliff, 2004</xref>) to capture behavior in both the food and altruism task, using a maximum-likelihood procedure similar to that described in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hutcherson et al., 2015b</xref>) to find the best-fitting parameters (see Appendix 1 – Drift diffusion model for details). For capturing behavior in the food task, we fit a model using five parameters: two parameters for the weights on tastiness and healthiness, a parameter for non-decision time (NDT) representing perceptual and motor processes, and two parameters specifying the initial height of the choice-determining threshold (b) as well as the exponential decay rate of this threshold toward zero (d) as the time limit for responding approached. For capturing behavior in the altruism task, we fit a model using six parameters: three parameters related to the weights on $Self, $Other, and fairness (−1*|$Self - $Other|), as well as parameters related to NDT, b, and d (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1A</xref> for details).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Functional image acquisition</title><p>Functional imaging was performed on a 3T MRI scanner (Magnetom Trio, Tim System, Siemens Medical Systems, Erlangen) equipped with a 32-channel head coil.

For every subject, we estimated several general linear models (GLMs), using a canonical hemodynamic response function (hrf), and a 128 s high-pass cutoff filter to eliminate low-frequency drifts in the data.</p><sec id="s4-5-1"><title>Trial-wise estimates of choice phases: GLM1 (food task) and GLM2 (altruism task)</title><p>These GLMs aimed to identify brain responses that encode trial-by-trial variations in attributes (i.e., foods’ healthiness or tastiness in the food task; payoffs for subjects and confederate and the fairness of the offer in the altruism task) and decision-values (four-point response from ‘strong no’ to ‘strong yes’) during choice periods. To this end, these models obtained a trial-wise measure of BOLD responses during food (GLM1) and altruistic choices (GLM2) at the time of the choice. For each subject, GLM1 included a regressor for each choice period (R1-R270) in the food task, lasting from the onset of a food presentation to the button press that represented the choice for the trial. In addition, the model estimated a separate regressor for the outcome phases for each functional run, movement parameters, and run-wise session constants as regressors of no interest. GLM2 mirrored GLM1 and estimated regressors of interest for every altruistic choice (R1-R270), lasting from the onset of the monetary proposal to the button press that signified the choice in this trial. GLM2 also estimated regressors of no interest including outcome phases, movement parameters, and session constants. Estimated responses for the regressors of interest – the choice periods of each task (R1-R270 from GLM1 and 2, respectively) – were then used as inputs for the multivariate decoding analyses (support vector regressions, SVRs) described below.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5-2"><title>Neural computational model: within-subject decoding of choice attributes</title><p>This multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) aimed to identify brain regions that encode trial-by-trial fluctuations of choice-relevant attributes (e.g. foods healthiness, payoff to self) or decision values (four-point response from ‘strong no’ to ‘strong yes’), and to assess how current goals affect neural information on the attribute level.

For every subject, we defined a sphere with a radius of 4 voxels around a given voxel v<sub>i</sub> of the measured brain volume (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tusche et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wisniewski et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kahnt et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Heinzle et al., 2012</xref>) For each of the N voxels within this sphere, we extracted trial-wise parameter estimates of a particular condition (i.e., 90 of the 270 trial-wise regressors of choice periods from GLM1 (food task) or GLM2 (altruism task)). N-dimensional pattern vectors were created separately for each of the 90 trials of the respective fMRI task. Neural pattern vectors for 8 of the 9 task blocks (‘training data’) served as input features, with trial-wise values of the attribute (e.g., healthiness rating) as labels of the prediction. The prediction was realized using a linear kernel support vector machine regression (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm">http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm</ext-link>) (ν-SVR) with a fixed cost parameter c = 0.01 that was preselected based on previous implementations of this decoding approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tusche et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kahnt et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kahnt et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gross et al., 2014</xref>). The resulting model provided the basis for the prediction of the trial-wise values of an attribute (e.g. healthiness ratings) of the 10 trials of the remaining task block (‘test data’) based on their neural response patterns. This procedure was repeated nine times, always using pattern vectors of a different task block as test data, yielding a 9-fold cross-validation. Predictive information about the choice attribute was defined as the average Fisher’s z-transformed correlation coefficient between the value predicted by the SVR model and the actual values of an attribute in these trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tusche et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kahnt et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kahnt et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gross et al., 2014</xref>). This decoding accuracy value was assigned to the central voxel of the searchlight. The procedure was repeated for every voxel of the measured brain volume, yielding a three-dimensional decoding accuracy map for every subject, separately for each choice attribute and each condition. Decoding maps were smoothed (6 mm full width at half maximum, FWHM) and submitted to two different random-effects group analyses.</p><p>First, to establish that neural response patterns encode the current value of a choice-relevant attribute during choices, we averaged subjects’ decoding accuracy maps for a particular attribute obtained in the three conditions (e.g., separate SVRs for healthiness in NC, HC, and TC). Subject-specific average information maps were than used in a random effect second level analysis (single t-test as implemented in SPM) and tested against chance level at a statistical threshold of p &lt; 0.05 (FWE cluster-corrected, height threshold of p &lt; 0.001). Note that if resulting cluster sizes at this statistical threshold prevented effective functional localization (i.e., clusters that exceeded 6000 voxels), we report results at p &lt; 0.05, FWE corrected at voxel-level. Second, to examine if predictive neural information on a choice attribute varied systematically across the three conditions of the respective task, we used a repeated measures ANOVA as implemented in SPM. Only regions that passed the statistical threshold of p &lt; 0.05 (FWE corrected at cluster-level, height threshold of p &lt; 0.001) are reported.</p><p>We also compared the results of the multivariate SVRs with those of a conventional univariate analysis (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1E</xref>, and Appendix 1 – Univariate Analysis of fMRI Data). However, note that multivariate decoding approaches have been prosed to be more sensitive than traditional mass-univariate approaches: because multivariate pattern classifiers take advantage of information encoded across multiple voxels and exploit systematic differences in voxel selectivity within a specific brain region, they have been suggested to detect information that would be missed by conventional analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kriegeskorte and Bandettini, 2007</xref>).</p><p>There is a potential concern that the some intervals of the response scales for choice attributes (e.g. tastiness) or decision values (‘strong no’, ‘no’, ‘yes’, ‘strong yes’) might be subjectively larger than other intervals.

A cross-subject decoding approach was used to test for information on the <italic>degree</italic> to which cognitive regulation affected attribute weights and choices. Clusters identified in the repeated measures ANOVA (see above) were defined as regions of interest (ROIs). Importantly, a main goal of our study was to test for potential common neural substrates underlying context-sensitive weighting of choice-attributes across choice-domains. Hence, these decoding analyses focused on voxels identified in a formal conjunction of the significant clusters for flexible representations of Healthiness, Tastiness, and $Self (at p &lt; 0.05, FWE corrected at cluster-level, height threshold of p &lt; 0.001; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). First, we tested if neural activation in this ROI obtained during food choices encodes subject-specific regulation success in the food task, but also in an independent social altruism task. To this end, we extracted parameter estimates for all voxels in the ROI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>) from subjects first-level GLM1 (food choices) using the contrast image [HC &gt; (NC, TC)] (based on DDM results suggesting differential attribute representations for this comparison, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,C</xref>). Resulting pattern vectors (one per subject) were used as input features for the prediction and individual difference scores in regulation success served as labels. Regulation success was defined using difference scores in DDM parameters (e.g., Δw Tastiness [HC – (NC, TC)]) and in observed choice behavior (e.g., ΔHealthy choices [HC – (NC, TC)]). Predictions used a linear ν-SVR (libSVM) with a fixed cost parameter c = 0.01 (similar to within-subject decoding) and a leave-one-subject out approach (yielding a 36-fold cross-validation). Decoding accuracies reflect correlations of the observed and predicted regulation score. Statistical significance was assessed by comparisons to empirical null-distribution (realized by randomly permuting the pairing of subjects’ neural pattern vectors and behavioral regulation scores 1000 times). Only decoding accuracies above the 95th percentile of null-distributions were considered statistically significant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Corradi-Dell'Acqua et al., 2016</xref>). As a sanity check, analyses were repeated training on data obtained during altruistic choices (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1D</xref>).</p><p>Note that <italic>ROI-based cross-subject</italic> decoding analyses used permutation tests to assess the statistical significance of the predictions instead of simple t-tests (as implemented in SPM) applied to the <italic>whole-brain within-subject</italic> searchlight decoding maps. Regarding the latter, computational costs for estimating empirical null-distributions for several tens of thousands of searchlight analyses - implemented separately for every attribute, decision-value, condition, and subject - prevented us from using permutation tests for whole-brain decoding analyses. However, supplemental analyses that used t-tests to statistically assess ROI-based results yielded similar results as permutation tests, demonstrating that both statistical approaches generate comparable interpretations for the present data. Notably, empirical permutation-based null-distributions for ROIs also confirmed the theoretical chance level of the prediction that underlies statistical inferences for the whole-brain searchlight results (t-tests as implemented in SPM). Nevertheless, statistical tests based on empirical null-distributions can be viewed as superior insofar as they address the potential concern that means and distribution of predictions based on chance alone might vary across brain regions.</p><p>Note also that the ROI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>) used for this analysis was defined based on a fully independent and orthogonal set of tests for altered decoding accuracies across task conditions at the group level. Thus, ROI-selection was not subject to double dipping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kriegeskorte et al., 2009</xref>).</p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This research was supported by funding from NIMH Conte Center 2P50 MH094258.

Results for goal-independent encoding of DVs (Main effect for DV, averaged information content across three conditions in each task) are reported at a statistical threshold of p &lt; 0.05, FWE corrected at voxel-level; <sup>†</sup> indicates results for goal-dependent variations in DV (repeated measures ANOVAs across three conditions in each task) reported at p &lt; 0.001, FWE cluster-corrected at p &lt; 0.05, k = 10 voxels; only peak activations of clusters are reported; L = left hemisphere, R = right hemisphere, k = cluster size in voxels, MNI = Montreal Neurological Institute.</p><p>(<bold>C</bold>) Correlation of regulatory success in goal-dependent attribute weighting across choice domains. Correlation coefficients for change scores in attribute weights (w) in food choices and altruistic choices estimated in two separate DDMs. Successful reduction in the weight on selfish considerations (Δw $Self) in altruistic choices was correlated with successfully amplifying the weight on health considerations (Δw Healthiness) suppressing the weight of taste considerations (Δw Tastiness) in food choices. Changes in the ability to increase social considerations (Δw Other) were not correlated to goal-consistent changes in food attributes. Δw Tastiness [NC - TC] is not displayed, as estimated attribute weights did not significantly differ between conditions. Note also that differences scores in Δw Healthiness [NC - TC] (last column) were minimal, limiting the interpretability of the respective correlation analyses. </p><p>(<bold>D</bold>) Decoding of individual differences in regulatory success in DLPFC (altruism task). Decoding of individual differences in regulation success based on response patterns in right DLPFC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>) obtained in the altruism task. Response patterns reliably predicted the extent of increased generous choice behavior. Consistent with key results reported in the main text, neural activation patterns also predicted individual’s increased healthy choices in a separate food task. Regarding altered attributes weights, predictive information in DLPFC was selective for subjects’ inhibition of $Self weights, but did not extend to altered weights on $Other or Fairness, confirming results reported in the main text. Higher-than-chance predictions are reported when decoding accuracy values exceeded the 95th percentile of empirical null-distribution (cutoff), obtained with 1000 replications of the analysis on permuted data sets. </p><p>(<bold>E</bold>) Univariate encoding of attributes in food task and altruism task. Regions reported as significant if they passed a cluster-corrected threshold p &lt; 0.05, with a voxel-defining threshold of p &lt; 0.001, uncorrected, unless otherwise noted. * Illustrates results significant at p &lt; 0.001, uncorrected, reported for completeness: subgenual area did not overlap with the area of vmPFC that displayed overlapping representations of all attributes; only peak activations of clusters are reported; L = left hemisphere, R = right hemisphere, MNI = Montreal Neurological Institute, k = cluster size in voxels.</p></caption><media mime-subtype="docx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-31185-supp1-v1.docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="transrepform"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31185.016</object-id><label>Transparent reporting form</label><media mime-subtype="docx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-31185-transrepform-v1.docx"/></supplementary-material><sec id="s15" sec-type="data-availability"><title>Data availability</title><p>Functional imaging and behavioral data is deposited at the project's Open Science Framework (OSF) page (osf.io/wa4cs).

In brief, we began with a range of discrete possible values for each parameter, which defined an N-dimensional grid for the full combination of all N parameters. To measure attributes for food and altruistic choices on a common scale, food attribute ratings were converted into the same range as monetary proposals for self and other (i.e., −20 to +20), using the linear transformation<disp-formula id="equ4"><mml:math id="m4"><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>g</mml:mi><mml:mi>’</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>5</mml:mn><mml:mi>*</mml:mi><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>g</mml:mi><mml:mo>–</mml:mo><mml:mn>15</mml:mn><mml:mo>.</mml:mo></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>This allowed us to explore a common set of parameter values for the two tasks: <bold><italic>w</italic></bold><italic><sub>health</sub> = <bold>w</bold><sub>taste</sub> = <bold>w</bold><sub>self </sub>= <bold>w</bold><sub>other</sub> = <bold>w</bold><sub>fairness</sub> =</italic> [−0.012, −0.01, … −0.002, −0.001, 0, 0.001, 0.002, 0.004, ….024], <bold><italic>NDT</italic></bold> = [0.25, 0.5, … 1.25], <bold><italic>b</italic></bold> = [0.1, 0.11, 0.12, …. 38, 0.39, 0.4] and <bold><italic>d</italic></bold> = [0, 0.00025, 0.0005, 0.001, 0.00125, 0.0015, 0.00175, 0.002]. We determined all unique RDVs resulting from the combination of trial-level attribute values (e.g., $Self, $Other, and Fairness; or Taste and Health) and distinct attribute weights, and then simulated distributions of choices and RTs for all unique combinations of values, barrier parameters, and non-decision times.</p><p>In addition, to speed up computation time while generating more complete simulations of choice and RT, we used an approximation of the DDM in which we divided the space between the two thresholds into 50 contiguous bins representing possible locations of the accumulated RDV signal. Next, we specified a transition matrix representing the probability of transitioning from bin <italic>i</italic> to bin <italic>j</italic>, given a specified mean drift rate. This was calculated by assuming that the transition probability could be described as a Normal distribution with mean = RDV, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf6"><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi>σ</mml:mi><mml:msqrt><mml:mo>.</mml:mo><mml:mn>001</mml:mn></mml:msqrt></mml:math></inline-formula>. In other words, the likelihood of transitioning from bin <italic>i</italic> to bin <italic>j</italic> depends on the relative positions of their centers, with transitions of size and direction RDV being more likely. To compute the probability density function representing the possible locations of the DDM at time <italic>t</italic>, we multiplied a vector representing the current probability density of DDM locations over all 50 bins by the transition matrix. We assumed that at time <italic>t</italic> = 0, 100% of the DDMs started at the point halfway between the two thresholds. In addition, we assumed that the two barriers represent absorbing states, such that the probability of transitioning out of bins with centers beyond <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf7"><mml:mo>±</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>B</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> is equal to 0. To compute the probability of a DDM terminating at time <italic>t</italic>, we subtracted the cumulative probabilities of evidence having accumulated past <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf8"><mml:mo>±</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>B</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> at time <italic>t</italic> from that same quantity at time t+1. Although this method is an approximation to the DDM, it is consistent with recent approaches to fitting drift diffusion models to behavioral evidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brunton et al., 2013</xref>), and allows us to compute a smoother estimate of the probability of observing a particular choice at time <italic>t.</italic> Our previous work using individual simulations required us to compute the likelihood of an RT falling into 250ms bins. The current approach allows us to compute this probability for each millisecond from choice onset to the response time limit for a given set of parameters. Matlab code for this approximation is available upon request.</p><p>We used these simulated likelihoods to estimate the best-fitting combination of parameter values, separately for each subject in each condition, using a modified version of maximum likelihood estimation. Based on the simulated likelihood distributions, we calculated the likelihood of the observed combinations of choice and RT on every trial for every subject under a given combination of parameters. We then identified the set of parameters that minimized the negative log likelihood of the selected trials in a two-step process. To minimize exploding computational costs, we first performed a grid search to identify the combination of parameter values that maximized the data likelihood over a courser combination of parameter values. We then performed a finer grid search on a range of parameter values centered on these values, in order to estimate parameters at a finer resolution. Although this strategy has the disadvantage that it may miss the true minimum among all 1.29*10e<sup>2</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Shaw et al., 2005</xref> combinations, it substantially reduces computational costs, provides satisfactory fits to the data, and is consistent with previous approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Krajbich et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>One concern is that regulation may introduce additional cognitive complexity into a task that makes the DDM ill suited to capture behavior. To address this concern, and to determine whether the DDM models were able to accurately capture differences in behavior across conditions, we computed the mean squared error (MSE) between the predicted likelihood of accepting a proposal and the observed choice, separately for each subject in each condition of the altruism task. These analyses suggested that the DDM was slightly but significantly <italic>better</italic> at predicting choices in the two regulation conditions (mean MSE<sub>PC</sub> = 0.108 ± 0.052, mean MSE<sub>EC</sub> = 0.102 ± 0.052, mean MSE<sub>NC</sub> = 0.120 ± 0.043, both p’s &lt; 0.05), but that the two regulation conditions did not differ from each other (p = 0.32). We performed a similar analysis examining MSE for behavior in the food task. We observed no difference in predictive accuracy between the Natural and Health conditions (MSE<sub>NC</sub> = 0.100 ± 0.050, MSE<sub>HC</sub> = 0.102 ± 0.060, p = 0.31), and observed a small but significant improvement in predictive accuracy for the Taste condition (MSE<sub>TC</sub> = 0.088 ± 0.045). These results suggest that the DDM provided a reasonable description of behavior in all three conditions of tasks.</p></boxed-text></sec><sec id="s9" sec-type="appendix"><title>ROI-based post-hoc tests to identify goal-consistent value coding in the VMPFC</title><boxed-text><p>We explicitly tested whether the VMPFC encodes attribute values as a function of their current relevance to choice. Notably, our analyses on the whole brain level did not reveal any significant variation of attribute value encoding in this area as a function of the regulatory goal. However, in light of previous evidence, we conducted a number of post-hoc ROI-analyses to probe in a more sensitive manner for goal-dependent value coding in the VMPFC. The ROI consisted of voxels in the VMPFC identified in the conjunction analyses (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> for illustration). We tested this question in three different sets of analyses:</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>For the first approach, we examined average predictive information in the VMPFC-ROI identified by the whole brain searchlight decoding analyses described in the paper: For each participant and each condition, we extracted decoding accuracies for each voxel in the VMPFC-ROI and estimated an ROI-based average for each choice-attribute. Next, for each attribute, we ran a repeated-measures ANOVA to explicitly test for altered information content. Confirming results from whole-brain analyses, average neural information about the values of choice attributes (as measured by decoding accuracies) was not significantly modulated by the regulatory goal (all p’s &gt; 0.13, uncorrected). This finding is in line with our whole-brain results (implemented in SPM), and suggests that the lack of results was not due to overly stringent statistical thresholds. This provides further support for our interpretation that value representations in the VMPFC on the attribute level are unaffected at a group level by our implemented regulatory goals.</p></list-item><list-item><p>However, this analysis leaves open the possibility that local response patterns in the VMPFC (rather than average decoding accuracies) might differentiate attributes by regulatory goal. Thus, we ran supplemental within-subject decoding analyses to predict trial-wise values of an attribute based on local response patterns in the VMPFC. These analyses were similar to the searchlight decoding approach with the difference that ROI-wise response patterns in VMPFC served as neural features for the predictions (i.e., instead of extracting multi-voxel patterns from a sphere around individual voxels in the ROI, we use one response pattern consisting of all voxels of the ROI). For each attribute separately, we estimated how well a subject’s multi-voxel response patterns encoded attribute values in a particular task condition. Next, on a group level, we used repeated measures ANOVA to examine whether neural information on an attribute varied depending on the behavioral goal. Consistent with the searchlight decoding approach, predictive information encoded in the VMPFC did not significantly vary cross task conditions (all p’s &gt; 0.29).</p></list-item><list-item><p>Finally, we examined if response patterns in the VMPFC encoded goal-dependent changes <italic>across</italic> participants. Such a pattern might suggest that even though we did not observe main effects, VMPFC attribute representations still contribute in some way to regulatory success. Thus, in addition to the within-subject analyses described above (1-2), we also ran cross-subject decoding analyses with an approach that was identical to the decoding analyses of individual regulatory success from neural response patterns of the DLPFC, with the exception that response patterns were extracted from the VMPFC cluster identified in the conjunction analysis. Consistent with the lack of main effects for the supplemental analyses reported above, cross-subject decoding analyses did not yield significant predictions of participants’ regulatory success for any attribute or for choice behavior (i.e. healthy or generous choices) in the food task or altruism task (all p’s &gt; 0.31).</p></list-item></list><p>To address potential concerns that the selected ROI might have been too small for the multi-voxel analyses approach, we also repeated these analyses (1-3) using a slightly larger ROI. Results of the analyses (1-3) matched those for the original VMPFC ROI, suggesting that null-findings in supplemental analyses are not merely driven by the comparatively small number of voxels identified in the conjunction analyses (Tastiness, Healthiness, $Self, $ Other, Fairness).</p><p>Taken together, these more sensitive and fine-grained ROI analyses confirm our conclusion that, in this task, our VMPFC ROI encodes the values of each of the individual attributes, but not in a manner that is sensitive to regulatory goals.</p></boxed-text></sec><sec id="s10" sec-type="appendix"><title>Multivariate regression of individual differences in regulatory success</title><boxed-text><p>We used a multivariate cross-subject decoding approach to examine whether neural activation patterns in the DLPFC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>) predict individual differences in the <italic>degree</italic> to which regulatory manipulations affected attribute weights and choices. Results for this decoding analysis reported in the main text refer to an analysis based on neural responses in the DLPFC obtained during <italic>food</italic> choices (extracted from subject-specific contrast images for [HC &gt; (NC, TC)]). We found that these neural activation patterns predict individual differences in regulatory success not only for the food task, but also for regulation success in a completely independent altruism task.</p><p>For the sake of completeness, we repeated this analysis using DLPFC response patterns obtained during <italic>altruistic</italic> choices. The cross-subject decoding approach mirrored the one for the analysis described in the main text: First, we tested if neural activation in the DLPFC obtained during <italic>altruistic</italic> choices encodes subject-specific regulation success in the <italic>altruism</italic> task. Next, we tested if predictive information would generalize to a completely independent (non-social) food task separated in time by an average of 16 months. To this end, we extracted parameter estimates for all voxels in the ROI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, similar to the ROI used for analysis based on food choice data) from participants first-level GLM2 (altruism task) using the contrast image [NC &gt; (EC, PC)] (based on differential attribute representation for $Self for this comparison). Resulting pattern vectors (one per subject) were used as input features for the prediction, and individual difference scores in regulatory success served as labels. Regulation success was defined using difference scores in observed choice behavior (e.g., ΔGenerous choices [NC - (EC, PC)]) and in DDM parameters (e.g., Δw Self [NC - (EC, PC)]). Predictions used a linear ν-SVR (libSVM) with a fixed cost parameter c = 0.01 (similar to within-subject decoding) and a leave-one-subject out approach (yielding a 36-fold cross-validation). Decoding accuracies reflect correlations of the observed and predicted scores of individuals’ regulatory success. Statistical significance was assessed by comparisons of decoding accuracies to empirical null-distributions (realized by randomly permuting the pairing of participants’ neural pattern vectors and behavioral regulation scores 1000 times). Only decoding accuracies above the 95th percentile of null-distributions were considered statistically significant. See Supplemental Table 5 for results.</p></boxed-text></sec><sec id="s11" sec-type="appendix"><title>DLPFC-based prediction of goal-consistent changes of generosity is driven by goal-consistent changes in attribute representations of $Self (but not $Other or Fairness)</title><boxed-text><p>On the one hand, neural activation patterns in the DLPFC flexibly encoded values of tastiness, healthiness, and $Self, but not $Other or $Fairness. On the other hand, the DLPFC strongly predicted goal-consistent change in altruistic choices. Is the DLPFC prediction of altruistic choices then mediated especially by the change in $Self during altruistic choices, but not by the change to $Other or $Fairness?</p><p>We addressed this idea in the following way. First, at the behavioral level, we regressed changes in generosity (ΔGenerous Choices [(PC, EC) - NC]) on changes in model-based weights for subject’s own benefits (Δw $Self [NC - (EC, PC)]), and calculated the residuals. This gave us a measure of change in generosity after controlling for change in weight on $Self. Next, we repeated the cross-subject decoding analysis (SVR) using neural response patterns in the DLPFC as features and the estimated residuals as labels for the prediction. This tells us whether the DLPFC continues to predict altered generosity after controlling for change in the input of $Self on choices. Our results are consistent with the idea that the DLPFC predicts change in generosity because it encodes changes in weight on $Self: activation patterns in the DLPFC no longer predicted individuals’ goal-consistent changes in generosity when we controlled for changes in the weight of self-related benefits on choices (r = 0.11, p = 0.317, permutation test, [CI: −0.41, 0.41]). We next sought to show that this effect is <italic>specific</italic> to changes in self-related considerations. To do this, we repeated this supplemental analysis for each of the other choice attributes (i.e., regressing out change in weight on $Other or change in weight on Fairness, and then asking whether DLPFC predicts residual changes in generosity). We found that DLPFC prediction of altered generosity remained highly significant when we controlled for altered inputs of other’s benefits (r = 0.51, p = 0.016, [CI −0.41, 0.40]) or fairness considerations (r = 0.56, p = 0.007, [CI −0.39, 0.39]) on choices. Taken together, these findings indicate that predictions of goal-consistent changes in generosity in the DLPFC are mediated specifically by altered weighs of subjects’ own monetary benefits on choices (Δw $Self). This finding is also consistent with evidence of a specific functional role of the DLPFC for altered representations for self-related considerations, while changes in attributes of $Other and Fairness are encoded elsewhere.</p></boxed-text></sec><sec id="s12" sec-type="appendix"><title>Changes in functional connectivity with the VMPFC correlate with regulatory success</title><boxed-text><p>Results reported in the main text pose an important question: if attribute encoding within certain brain regions changes as a function of regulatory goals, how are such changes accomplished? We speculated one of two possibilities. First, we observed changes in attribute encoding not only within the DLPFC and social-cognitive brain areas (e.g. Precuneus, TPJ), but also within areas of visual cortex for some contrasts. This suggests that altered functional coupling between goal-sensitive areas and visual cortex could be producing some of the changes observed in attribute encoding. Alternatively, given that the VMPFC encoded all choice-relevant information, but showed no modulation as a function of goal, we speculated that the VMPFC might be differentially connected to these goal-sensitive areas as a function of regulatory success. To test these different hypotheses, we examined regulation-associated changes in connectivity patterns of the DLPFC conjunction area, as well as the TPJ and Precuneus, focusing specifically on evidence for changes in connectivity within functionally-defined masks of the occipital or motor cortices and the VMPFC. We also performed the reverse analysis, examining changes in functional connectivity of the VMPFC with other areas.</p><p>We used a beta series approach to functional connectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rissman et al., 2004</xref>). In brief, this method uses a GLM to estimate the BOLD response in a region, separately for each trial in a condition of interest, and after controlling for other variables of non-interest (e.g., response on other trial, response in other conditions, motion, etc.). The resulting beta coefficients represent the estimated neural response in that region on each trial. These values are then included as a parametric modulator in a new GLM, to identify brain regions where response systematically covaries with the trial-by-trial fluctuations in the ROI. We can extract these ‘beta-series’ for each condition of interest (e.g., Health Focus, Taste Focus, Natural Response) and then compare whether neural correlates of trial-by-trial fluctuations in an ROI’s response vary as a function of condition. We used this approach rather than more traditional psychophysiological interaction (PPI) analyses, because recent work suggests that this method may be more sensitive to contextual differences in functional connectivity than more traditional PPI approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rissman et al., 2004</xref>). We provide greater details of this analysis below.</p><sec id="s12-1"><title>Methods: Exploratory functional connectivity analyses</title><sec id="s12-1-1"><title>Beta series estimation</title><p>The first step in a beta series analysis is to extract estimates of trial-by-trial response in an ROI for conditions of interest, controlling for other experimental factors.</p><p>Thus, we estimated trial-by-trial responses in each regulation condition for four different regions-of-interest: 1) the VMPFC area demonstrating a conjunction in coding of all attributes regardless of regulatory goal; 2) the DLPFC area showing a conjunction in regulation effects for Tastiness, Healthiness, and $Self attributes; 3) and 4) the TPJ and Precuneus ROIs showing changes in response to $Other in Partner vs. Ethics trials. To do this, we conducted a GLM consisting of the following regressors: R1-R90: Indicator functions delineating the choice period on each separate trial for one of the regulation conditions (e.g. Natural trials); R91 and R92) Indicator functions indicating the choice period for the two non-target regulation conditions (e.g., Focus on Health, Focus on Taste); R93-R96) Parametric modulators of R91-92 consisting of health and taste ratings for the food shown on each trial; R97) An indicator function for missed response trials. This model allowed us to extract trial-specific estimates of neural response in an ROI for a specific regulatory condition, controlling for activation related to other trials and conditions. These estimates were created by averaging the beta-coefficient for each trial (R1-R90) across all voxels for each of the four target ROIs listed above, which served as our signal of interest.

In the tasks, subjects chose or rejected different foods or different monetary offers. Instructions to choose healthy or to make generous choices modulated the behavior in both tasks and also affected neural activity patterns measured using fMRI.

They are basically testing how changes in goals affect behavior. This is similar to the use of devaluation in animal learning theory tasks, but here they are using simple instructions in the course of training with humans. I think this is a creative way to integrate economic decision making, which focuses on a unitary utility as guiding choices, with work from experimental psychology and computational neuroscience, which typically distinguishes different sources of information by its associative basis or computational basis. This is excellent.</p><p>However, beyond that I had difficulty following the authors framing, predictions and understanding the outcomes of the neural activity analysis. The DLPFC is the key &quot;regulatory&quot; area. But what does that mean? It seems to me that I would expect some areas to represent value independent of goals and some areas to represent that value only when goal relevant. Is this what is meant by regulatory? Does the DLPFC represents value relevant to goals and some other area does not – VMPFC?</p><p>Generally I think the question is very interesting and the approach is attractive, but I simply could not follow how the authors framed and then conducted their analysis. I will be interested to see what the other reviewers say. I might grasp things better if it were more clear how the theoretical concepts were operationalized for the analyses – precisely what is &quot;regulatory&quot; for example and how is it distinguished from non-regulatory versus just not involved by the task and then in the data analysis.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>Tusche and Hutcherson present a thought-provoking and methodologically impressive study on cognitive regulation of dietary and altruistic choices, a topic of broad interest. The analyses, which combine a drift diffusion computational model of attribute-weighted choice and trial-by-trial MVPA decoding, are sophisticated, appropriate, and comprehensive. They show that while attribute values across choice and regulatory goal contexts can be decoded in VMPFC, they do not appear to be modulated by regulatory goal. Conversely, attribute values in DLPFC are modulated consistently with model-derived behavioral weights across regulatory goals that emphasize either healthiness or tastiness during dietary choice, and personal gain in altruistic choice contexts. Regulatory goals that emphasize another's benefits (e.g. feelings), however, could instead be decoded from right TPJ and precuneus, but not DLPFC, suggesting representations of others' wellbeing is modulated according to the prosocial regulatory goal but only when it requires theory of mind. These findings speak to both the domain-generality and domain-selectivity of cognitive regulation of decision making and importantly advance our understanding of the neural systems important for cognitive control and decision making more generally. In general I am supportive of this paper but think some outstanding issues could be better addressed to confirm some of their interpretations and rule out others.</p><p>It is notable that DLPFC flexibly encoded values of tastiness, healthiness, and $Self but not $Other or $Fairness on the one hand but strongly predicted altruistic choices on the other hand. Is the DLPFC prediction of altruistic choices then mediated especially by the change in $Self during altruistic choices, but not the change to $Other or $Fairness?</p><p>A related question: Do the rTPJ and precuneus group effects predict individual differences in regulatory success during altruistic choices when goals depended on another's thoughts or feelings? Such evidence would tie together their argument that these latter regions &quot;assume responsibility&quot; for regulatory success when DLPFC does not because of the component process required to meet that goal.</p><p>Given the prior literature on this topic, and in order to rule out a model whereby VMPFC value representations are modulated in an attribute-specific manner that depends on regulatory goals, it would be informative to see an ROI-based analysis of VMPFC. I may have missed something but I could not find one. The ROI from the conjunction presented in Figure 3 could be used or prior literature could be used.</p><p>One question which is unclear from the conjunction analyses is whether it is the same neural code (e.g. in DLPFC) that is used across task contexts, or whether the code is distinct (context-dependent) but found in the same brain region. What do the authors find if the SVR is trained on one attribute (e.g. tastiness) and tested on the other two (e.g. healthiness and $self)? Can the overlap between representations be better visualized?</p><p>It would be informative to visualize the feature weights for the key areas (e.g. VMPFC, DLPFC) across voxel space in every subject. This procedure should help to assess to what extent any decoding effects are due to hard anatomical boundaries between subareas (e.g. dorsal and ventral aspects of DLPFC) or to distributed patterns within areas.</p><p>How do the authors interpret the altered representations in some primary sensory and motor areas, e.g. less strong decoding of tastiness values for NC than HC and TC? Have the authors considered a model whereby coupling between DLPFC and distinct regions of sensory cortex is modulated according to the regulatory goal? The DLPFC must get its attribute representations from someplace.</p><p>The one comparison in which a match with the behavioral analyses failed to emerge was for ethical considerations compared to normal or personal considerations. I do not view this null finding as problematic, but out of curiosity do the authors have any thoughts as to what is going on when regulatory success depended on changes to fairness due to the goal of complying with social norms? This null finding should be addressed in the Discussion.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>In this manuscript, Tusche and Hutcherson report an fMRI study on how cognitive regulation affects the neural representation of choice-relevant attributes. They look for mechanisms that may generalize across two types of choices, one involving conflict between healthiness and tastiness of food items, the other involving conflict between self-interests and altruistic concerns. In different conditions, participants are asked to focus on one or the other attribute, which regulates the weights assigned to the targeted attributes, as shown via computational modeling of choice data. The key findings are the links between these changes in attribute weights and the decoding accuracy obtained for these attributes using multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) in various cortical regions. The results are quite convincing, with successful decoding across tasks and individuals. There is no clear conclusion about whether the regulation is centralized or distributed though, since changes in decoding accuracy are observed in the DLPFC for most of the attributes but not all.</p><p>The role of cognitive control in economic choice is poorly understood and this study brings valuable insights by applying MVPA to standard choice paradigms. My main concern is the absence of a mechanistic account linking brain activity to behavioral output. In a sense, the results seem a bit trivial: when participants pay attention to a particular type of information (by instruction), this information is easier to decode from their brain activity. This effect should be seen as the outcome (and not the process) of cognitive regulation. How cognitive regulation is implemented, and how better decoding translates into biased choices, still need to be explained.</p><p>For the latter point, it would be important to show that the decoded value (i.e., the decoder output) correlates with the behavioral weights. The alternative would be that changes in decoding accuracy correspond to changes in precision (i.e., signal-to-noise ratio) and not changes in the signal itself. If correct, this would mean that a region downstream to the DLPFC could just read this value, add it to other values corresponding to other attributes, and feed the aggregate value to a selection process that makes the decision. Perhaps functional connectivity could be used to test for such a transfer of information. Thus, the neural model would parallel the behavioral model.</p><p>Other points:</p><p>- The correlation across individuals could reflect compliance to the instructions rather than self-regulation capacity. The arguments taken from subjective report and from body-mass index are quite weak. For subjective report it could be that the rating scale is not reflecting the propensity to comply with the instructions. For body-mass index the opposite correlation could be expected: those who regulates food intake in real life should not need instructions in the lab.</p><p>- The observation that all attributes are represented in the VMPFC but inaccessible to cognitive regulation is super interesting (and novel, to my knowledge). The dissociation with DLPFC should be more emphasized and discussed. Would this mean that VMPFC representations are closer to stimuli and DLPFC to responses?</p><p>- To compare the pattern of attribute weights and the pattern of decoding accuracy across conditions, the authors intend to reproduce significance of pair-wise comparisons. As they know this approach heavily depends on the statistical threshold, which may be matter of debate when multiple comparisons are made. I would favor a straight regression of decoding accuracy against weight (across conditions).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31185.030</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>One reviewer, not someone doing fMRI work, had significant difficulty simply following how the concepts of value versus regulation were operationalized in the task and analysis.

We agree with reviewer 1 that we were not as clear as we could have been in the previous instantiation of the manuscript about the focus of our paper, and on the distinctions between value and regulation. We have substantially revised the Introduction (as described in greater detail below, see our first response to reviewer 1) to make this clearer. In brief, we have more clearly specified that we are focused on disentangling different hypotheses about what stage of the processing stream regulation acts on to modify value computations and have explicitly spelled out different possibilities along with the predictions they make at the neural level. Moreover, we have substantially revised the Results section of the manuscript to orient the reader to how different analyses address these different questions. Finally, we added a figure to illustrate the decoding analysis that aimed to identify brain regions that encode value in a goal-dependent manner (Figure 4) as well as a panel in Figure 1 to illustrate the behavioral computational modeling approach (Figure 1D). We feel that these revisions have significantly strengthened the clarity of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>This was related to the overarching concern of the other reviewers as well, which was the distinction between the authors conceptualization versus a more trivial interpretation – namely that when participants pay attention to a particular type of information (by instruction), this information is easier to decode from their brain activity.

Nevertheless, as we make clear in the revised Introduction and Discussion sections, extant research has actually not consistently found such patterns despite clear changes in behavior, raising an important puzzle to be explained. Our results are the first to identify a clear representation of all choice-relevant attributes across multiple contexts, and to show clear modulation of these choice-relevant attributes in a manner consistent with regulatory goals.</p><p>We also think our specific pattern of results clearly speak against the trivial interpretation that one would have to observe changes in attribute coding in the brain, and that this is an uninteresting reflection of changes in behavior that gives no insight into mechanism. We observe a highly specific pattern of altered and unaltered representations of attribute values, which reveals important dissociations across different kinds of attributes and different individuals. This is anything but trivial, and, we believe opens up crucially important lines of questioning that will be the basis for a better understanding of cognitive regulation and its mechanistic implementation. We have substantially revised the Introduction and Discussion to highlight these important points (see our specific responses to reviewers and our next response below).</p><p>Regarding the second point (that this should be seen as the outcome and not the process, and that this does not reveal mechanism), we respectfully disagree that no information about mechanism can be derived from a detailed description of where such changes are observed. We have tried to make this clearer in the following ways:</p><p>1) We have now further clarified in the new version of the paper in the Introduction, Results, and Discussion how identifying where attribute encoding changes occur may allow us to distinguish between different theories about computational process and mechanisms. Specifically, we make clearer that regulation could occur via two mechanisms: modulation at the level of specific attribute representations in non-overlapping, attribute-specific regions, or at the level of weighting in the value integration process.</p><p>2) We also make clearer that there are important outstanding questions about the domain-generality or domain-specificity of regulation effects. On the one hand, if different attributes are computed in different regions with different computational properties, regulation could operate through different channels in different domains. If, instead, regulation operates at a more domain-general level, then regulation might influence attribute representations in a common region across multiple different attributes and multiple choice contexts. Understanding whether regulation operates in a domain-general or domain-specific way can help reveal both the targets of regulation, as well as the mechanism of action.</p><p>3) In the Discussion, we highlight how these questions are not of purely theoretical importance: the locus of action (attribute level or integration level, domain specific or domain general) predicts non-trivial differences in patterns of regulatory success, which we observe in our own data. For attributes where regulation influences representation in a common region (i.e., DLPFC) regulatory success tracks together, but for attributes represented elsewhere (i.e., $Other in TPJ and precuneus), regulatory success appears to operate independently. Our results also may help to explain when and why regulatory success might feel difficult: if, as we observe, there are many regions of the brain where attribute representations are not altered by regulation, then these altered representations may continue to leak into the choice process and interfere with regulatory success.</p><p>4) We have also included several supplementary analyses, including functional connectivity results, which shed some light on mechanistic processes.</p><p>For these reasons, we believe this paper will be of considerable interest to the readership of <italic>eLife</italic>, and have tried to articulate this reasoning better in the paper. We hope the reviewers and editor will agree.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Suggestions are given in reviews below. For example &quot;it would be important to show that the decoded value (i.e., the decoder output) correlates with the behavioral weights. The alternative would be that changes in decoding accuracy correspond to changes in precision (i.e., signal-to-noise ratio) and not changes in the signal itself. If correct, this would mean that a region downstream to the DLPFC could just read this value, add it to other values corresponding to other attributes, and feed the aggregate value to a selection process that makes the decision. Perhaps functional connectivity could be used to test for such a transfer of information. Thus, the neural model would parallel the behavioral model.&quot;</p><p>Another suggestion was that some sort of functional connectivity analysis could clarify how DLPFC (and potentially rTPJ) enables successful regulation mechanistically, possibly using additional ROI analyses on VMPFC to ensure this is indeed the case.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the editor and reviewer that each of these issues is incredibly important, and have sought to address them in a series of supplementary analyses.</p><p>1) First, we used regression of decoding accuracies against behavioral weights (as suggested by reviewer 3). We show that results corroborate findings from the ANOVAs and paint essentially the same picture in our regions of interest. Specifically, we find goal-consistent coding of attributes that match predictions of the behavioral model. We therefore believe that these results are not simply a reflection of changes in signal-to-noise. However, we also believe that the ANOVAs actually give us greater power to detect effects, particularly in the altruistic choice task, where it seems clear that our behavioral weights (particularly for a construct like other’s welfare) reflect different considerations in the different regulatory focus conditions. These ANOVAs reveal, for instance, that TPJ and Precuneus seem to code for others’ welfare when focused on partner feelings, but not when focused on ethical reasons for giving, despite increased behavioral weighting on $Other in both. This is an important result in its own right, and sheds light on the computational function of these regions. This result would not have been clear using the regression analysis proposed by the reviewer. We have thus opted to retain the original analyses, but provide a detailed description of the regression analyses in our point-by-point response, to corroborate and extend the conclusions that we come to using the ANOVAs. We opted for this course to maintain a clear and streamlined set of results, and to avoid over-taxing the reader’s working memory, since the paper is already rich in terms of methodological approaches and results. If the editor or reviewers deem it appropriate and necessary, we can of course include the regression analyses in the main body of the paper.</p><p>2) Second, we have now performed a detailed set of functional connectivity analyses to test for different theories about the role of information transfer in producing the observed pattern of results. Although we believe that functional connectivity analyses are somewhat complicated to interpret in the context of multivariate rather than univariate analysis (see our more detailed response to reviewer 3), we have also taken to heart the reviewers’ suggestions to dig deeper into our data. Thus, we have now conducted exploratory functional connectivity analyses to test whether and how changes in patterns of functional connectivity between regions are linked to regulatory success. To do this, we used a beta series approach (Rissman et al., 2004), which research suggests may be more sensitive to modulation of functional connectivity by context in studies like ours that use an event-related design with many trial repetitions (Cisler et al., 2014).</p><p>In brief, we extracted trial-by-trial fluctuations of BOLD response in regions of interest (i.e., DLPFC, precuneus, TPJ, and VMPFC) and then looked for areas of the brain where correlation with this trial-by-trial variation (after controlling for whole-brain response) varied as a function of regulatory goal. We looked both for main effects at the group level, as well as effects that correlated with regulatory success (e.g. identifying functional connectivity differences in HC vs. NC that correlated with change in behavioral weights of the healthiness attribute in HC vs. NC). At the suggestion of reviewer 2, we also specifically focused on two possibilities in terms of altered functional connectivity. First we tested the hypothesis that DLPFC, TPJ, and/or precuneus show altered connectivity with visual and/or or motor areas, and that this explains observed differences in regulation success. Second, we tested the hypothesis that DLPFC, TPJ and/or precuneus show altered connectivity with the VMPFC.</p><p>Our results most clearly support the latter hypothesis. At admittedly-somewhat-liberal thresholds, we find hints that connectivity patterns between VMPFC and DLPFC as well as between VMPFC and Precuneus correlate with changes in behavioral weighting of choice attributes in a manner that is consistent with predictions of our behavioral computational model. Using the DLPFC as a seed region, we find that increased connectivity with VMPFC correlates with greater weighting of the healthiness attribute when focused on health during food choice, and lower weighting of the self outcomes when focused on pro-social motives in the altruism task. Using the precuneus as a seed region, we find that increased connectivity with the VMPFC correlates with greater weighting of partner outcomes in the contrast of Partner vs. Ethics focus (which is also the contrast that most clearly differentiates encoded neural information on partner outcomes ($Other) in precuneus). A similar analysis using the VMPFC as a seed region revealed similar results.</p><p>What might these results mean in terms of mechanism? Despite the functional coupling with the VMPFC, representations of these attributes values within the VMPFC did not change (as confirmed by three supplemental analyses, see our fourth response to reviewer 2). This finding suggests that altered functional connectivity did not result in altered goal-consistent attribute representations in the VMPFC. Instead, our results raise an intriguing (albeit speculative) possibility as an alternative mechanism: signals from the VMPFC may actually be used to alter computations within DLPFC and Precuneus to amplify or diminish attribute values computed in these areas. Although this is not the modal view of the function of the VMPFC, it is actually consistent with some early work on emotional conflict resolution suggesting that the VMPFC may be involved in modulating affective representations in lower-level areas such as the amygdala in a goal-consistent way (Etkin et al., 2006; Quirk and Beer, 2006).</p><p>Because these results were observed only at relatively liberal thresholds, we have opted not to make them a primary focus of the main paper. However, we have included them in the Appendix and refer the interested reader to them in the appropriate portions of the manuscript. We hope that this approach balances our twin goals of keeping the main paper streamlined and informative, while also providing full disclosure about analyses that may be of interest.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>These are the essentially revisions or problems identified in our discussion – clarify the approach and provide a more mechanistic account of the proposed interaction to rule out trivial explanations of the findings.</p></disp-quote><p>As outlined above, we have thoroughly revised the manuscript to further clarify our approach. We have also added several new analyses to provide a more mechanistic account of the proposed interaction of identified brain regions, and to rule out other explanations of the findings. We believe that these revisions have substantially improved the manuscript and we truly appreciate the editors’ and reviewers’ constructive and thoughtful suggestions. Please find below the point-by-point reply to each comment of the reviewers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>I think the general question is of interest and the authors approach is quite novel to me. They are basically testing how changes in goals affect behavior. This is similar to the use of devaluation in animal learning theory tasks, but here they are using simple instructions in the course of training with humans. I think this is a creative way to integrate economic decision making, which focuses on a unitary utility as guiding choices, with work from experimental psychology and computational neuroscience, which typically distinguishes different sources of information by its associative basis or computational basis. This is excellent.</p><p>However, beyond that I had difficulty following the authors framing, predictions and understanding the outcomes of the neural activity analysis. The DLPFC is the key &quot;regulatory&quot; area. But what does that mean? It seems to me that I would expect some areas to represent value independent of goals and some areas to represent that value only when goal relevant. Is this what is meant by regulatory? Does the DLPFC represents value relevant to goals and some other area does not – VMPFC?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for his/her positive comments and enthusiasm for the approach! We apologize for the lack of clarity in the previous version of the manuscript and appreciate that the reviewer brought this to our attention. In order to fully address the comments, we have broken down our responses into three separate but related issues: framing, predictions, and understanding of outcomes.</p><p>A) Framing.</p><p>Our usage of the term “regulatory” in the original version of our manuscript needed further clarification. In any study of cognitive regulation (e.g. in the context of research on emotion, or decision making, or perceptual tasks), it is important to distinguish between an effector and an effect of regulation. The former refers to the causal driver of changes, while the latter is in essence the result of regulatory efforts. Revealing the neural effectors and effects of regulation are related but separate goals in neuroeconomics. Our analyses were designed specifically to focus on the latter: how do value representations (either at the level of individual choice-relevant attributes or at the level of integrated decision values) change as a function of regulatory goals?</p><p>We have substantially revised and reframed the introduction to the paper to clarify this point and to highlight what we might learn by understanding how regulation changes value representation. More specifically, we now spell out in greater detail two different hypotheses about the effects of regulation:</p><p>The attribute-level hypothesis suggests that regulatory goals operate by altering computations in brain areas specialized for processing specific attributes. For example in the food task, there might be specific regions that represent the current value of a food’s tastiness and other regions that represent the value of its healthiness. If regulation operates at this attribute level, then each of these specific regions would be independently modulated depending on goals. This view suggests that we should see alterations in attribute-specific areas. On the other hand, the integration-level hypothesis suggests that regulatory goals operate by altering weighting of those attributes only in an area (or areas) representing decision values. If regulation operates only at the integration-level, then goal-consistent alterations in attribute representation should be observed only within centralized, domain-general regions associated with value integration and decision value computations (i.e., VMPFC). This hypothesis thus predicts that attribute-specific areas should represent attributes regardless of regulation, while value integration regions might shift to flexibly represent attribute in a goal-consistent manner.</p><p>We have now worked to re-frame the Introduction, focusing on this distinction, as well as two corollary questions: 1) Does the level at which regulation operates (i.e., attribute-or integration-level) depend on the specific attribute and/or domain? 2) What role do the VMPFC and DLPFC play in these processes? We believe that these revisions have substantially improved the clarity and focus of the manuscript, as well as highlighting its major contribution to the literature on regulation.</p><p>The relevant section of the revised manuscript now reads:</p><p>“A key goal of neuroeconomics is to describe how these attribute and decision value computations change as a function of regulatory goals and contexts, and to link such changes to regulatory success. Here, we sought to address three important questions about this process […] However, several failures to observe changes in the VMPFC during cognitive regulation of decision making (Hollmann et al., 2012; Hutcherson et al., 2012; Yokum and Stice, 2013) suggest the need to either measure value computation in a more sensitive way, or to identify alternate routes to behavioral change.”</p><p>We have also revised the title of the manuscript and the Abstract to further clarify that the study is interested in the effect of cognitive regulation on value representations.</p><p>The revised title is:</p><p>“Cognitive regulation alters social and dietary choice by changing attribute representations in domain-general and domain-specific brain circuits”</p><p>B) Predictions.</p><p>We have substantially revised the manuscript to better link the analyses and our hypotheses. Both the attribute-level and integration-level theories predict that goal-dependent value signals will be represented more strongly when participants’ regulatory goals emphasize those attributes. The critical question is where this modulation is observed, as this allows us to distinguish between the two hypotheses outlined above. We have added three overview paragraphs to the revised Results section that emphasize the overall aim of the subsequent set of analyses and the predictions more clearly.</p><p>“Behavior</p><p>To identify how value computations change to accommodate regulatory goals, our analysis strategy proceeded in the several steps. […] We also used our computational behavioral models (multi-attribute drift diffusion models, DDMs) to link these alterations to amplification or suppression of the influence of specific choice-relevant attributes on choices.”</p><p>“Neural encoding of choice attributes and effects of regulation</p><p>Next, we examined neural underpinnings of goal-consistent increases/decreases in the influence of attributes on altered choices in both tasks. […] We also explicitly tested whether the locus of effect differed across attributes (e.g. tastiness/healthiness, $Self/$Other/Fairness) or choice domain (e.g. social, non-social).”</p><p>“Individual differences in regulatory success</p><p>Are some people generally more successful using cognitive regulation of decision making or does it depend on the choice domain? […] It should also be predicted by neural activation in distinct, non-overlapping brain regions.”</p><p>C) Understanding of Outcomes.</p><p>We hope that the greater clarity of our framing and predictions now make clearer the implications of our results for understanding how regulation affects value representations at a mechanistic level. We have substantially revised the Discussion section to address the three questions we raise in the Introduction: 1) does cognitive regulation of decision making operate by changing attribute-level or integration-level representations? 2) Does the level at which it operates vary by domain? 3) What role do VMPFC and DLPFC play in this process?</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Generally I think the question is very interesting and the approach is attractive, but I simply could not follow how the authors framed and then conducted their analysis. I will be interested to see what the other reviewers say. I might grasp things better if it were more clear how the theoretical concepts were operationalized for the analyses – precisely what is &quot;regulatory&quot; for example and how is it distinguished from non-regulatory versus just not involved by the task and then in the data analysis.</p></disp-quote><p>Again, we thank the reviewer for the positive assessment of the importance and interest value of this question. Please see our second response (above) for a more detailed discussion of the ways in which we have changed the framing, as well as discussion of the hypotheses and results, to make it clearer what we predicted and what we found, as well as how this relates questions of regulatory vs. non-regulatory regions.</p><p>We also thank the reviewer for bringing to our attention the lack of clarity in the description of our analyses (as did reviewer #2). In addition to revisions of the Results section, we have now also included a figure that further illustrates the key aspects of the multi-voxel decoding approach that we used to identify brain regions that differentially encode attribute values (or decision values) across goals/task conditions (Figure 4). We hope that this will make it easier for the broad and heterogeneous readership of <italic>eLife</italic> to follow the logic of this central analysis of our paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>Tusche and Hutcherson present a thought-provoking and methodologically impressive study on cognitive regulation of dietary and altruistic choices, a topic of broad interest. The analyses, which combine a drift diffusion computational model of attribute-weighted choice and trial-by-trial MVPA decoding, are sophisticated, appropriate, and comprehensive. They show that while attribute values across choice and regulatory goal contexts can be decoded in VMPFC, they do not appear to be modulated by regulatory goal. Conversely, attribute values in DLPFC are modulated consistently with model-derived behavioral weights across regulatory goals that emphasize either healthiness or tastiness during dietary choice, and personal gain in altruistic choice contexts. Regulatory goals that emphasize another's benefits (e.g. feelings), however, could instead be decoded from right TPJ and precuneus, but not DLPFC, suggesting representations of others' wellbeing is modulated according to the prosocial regulatory goal but only when it requires theory of mind. These findings speak to both the domain-generality and domain-selectivity of cognitive regulation of decision making and importantly advance our understanding of the neural systems important for cognitive control and decision making more generally. In general I am supportive of this paper but think some outstanding issues could be better addressed to confirm some of their interpretations and rule out others.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this positive evaluation of our study and the approach, as well as for the constructive comments and suggestions! We have performed several supplemental analyses in response to his/her suggestions, which have significantly strengthened the manuscript and provided further support for our interpretations. We detail these analyses below in our response to the reviewer’s specific comments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is notable that DLPFC flexibly encoded values of tastiness, healthiness, and $Self but not $Other or $Fairness on the one hand but strongly predicted altruistic choices on the other hand. Is the DLPFC prediction of altruistic choices then mediated especially by the change in $Self during altruistic choices, but not the change to $Other or $Fairness?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer raises an interesting question! We addressed this idea in the following way. First, at the behavioral level, we regressed changes in generosity (ΔGenerous Choices [(PC, EC) - NC]) on changes in model-based weights for subject’s own benefits (Δw $Self [NC - (EC, PC)]), and calculated the residuals. This gave us a measure of change in generosity after controlling for change in weight on $Self. Next, we repeated the cross‐subject decoding analysis (SVR) using neural response patterns in the DLPFC as features and the estimated residuals as labels for the prediction. This tells us whether the DLPFC continues to predict goal-consistent increases in generosity after controlling for change in the input of $Self on choices. Our results are consistent with the idea that the DLPFC predicts change in generosity because it encodes changes in weight on $Self: activation patterns in the DLPFC no longer predicted individuals’ goal-consistent changes in generosity when we controlled for changes in the weight of self-related benefits on choices (r=0.11, p=0.317, permutation test, [CI: -0.41, 0.41]). We next sought to show that this effect is specific to changes in self-related considerations. To do this, we repeated this supplemental analysis for each of the other choice attributes (i.e., regressing out change in weight on $Other or change in weight on Fairness, and then asking whether DLPFC predicts residual changes in generosity). We found that DLPFC prediction of altered generosity remained highly significant when we controlled for altered inputs of other’s benefits (r=0.51, p=0.016, [CI -0.41, 0.40]) or fairness considerations (r= 0.56, p=0.007, [CI -0.39, 0.39]) on choices. Taken together, these findings indicate that predictions of goal-consistent changes in generosity in the DLPFC are mediated specifically by altered weighs of subjects’ own monetary benefits on choices (Δw $Self). This finding is also consistent with evidence of a specific functional role of the DLPFC for altered representations for self-related considerations, while changes in attributes of $Other and Fairness are encoded elsewhere.</p><p>We now refer to this supplemental evidence in the Results section of the manuscript:</p><p>“Supplemental analyses suggest that predictive information on altered generosity was driven by neural information on changes in the attribute encoded in the DLPFC ($Self) and not by other attributes of the altruistic choice task (e.g., $Other, fairness) (see Appendix 1 – 1.5).”</p><p>We also present the details of these supplemental analyses in the Appendix. Due to the close match of this section with our description above, we refrain from re-iterating the details here and refer reviewer #2 to the relevant section of the supplemental material:</p><p>Appendix 1 – 1.5. DLPFC-based prediction of goal-consistent changes of generosity is driven by goal-consistent changes in attribute representations of $Self (but not $Other or Fairness).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A related question: Do the rTPJ and precuneus group effects predict individual differences in regulatory success during altruistic choices when goals depended on another's thoughts or feelings? Such evidence would tie together their argument that these latter regions &quot;assume responsibility&quot; for regulatory success when DLPFC does not because of the component process required to meet that goal.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. To address it, we ran supplemental decoding analyses to explicitly test if neural response patterns in the Precuneus and/or rTPJ predict individual differences in regulatory success in the altruism task. The analyses closely matched the prediction of regulatory success based on neural responses in the DLPFC with the following differences: First, ROIs were based on clusters in Precuneus and rTPJ in which information about other’s benefits ($Other) varied depending on the behavioral goal (for details see Table 4, for illustration see Figure 2H and Figure 2—figure supplement 1). Second, neural activation patterns for this prediction were extracted from subject-specific contrast images in GLM2 (altruism task) based on the contrast image of [PC &gt; EC], since this was the contrast that yielded reliable differences in attribute representations for both ROIs (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref> for illustration).</p><fig id="respfig1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31185.019</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Multi-voxel response patterns in the precuneus reliably predicted individuals’ altered generosity in the altruism task (ΔGenerous Choices [PC – EC]: r = 0.57, p = 0.002 [CI: -0.41, 0.38]; ΔGenerous Choices [(NC, PC) – EC]: r = 0.61, p = 0.004 [CI: -0.41, 0.41]).</title><p>This finding is consistent with the pattern of results on goal-dependent encoding of others benefits in this brain region (left panel).

Depending on details of the ROI selection and parameters of the decoding approach, we did observe significant predictions of regulatory success based on rTPJ responses. However, given the variability in these results, the lack of an independent replication sample to further validate the modulated decoding approach, and the complexity of the manuscript, we prefer not to expand on this TPJ finding in the manuscript. Should the reviewer or the editor feel that this complementary evidence is necessary to further validate our interpretation, we are happy to provide details of this complementary analysis that hints at prediction of regulatory success based on response patterns in the rTPJ.</p><p>Overall, these findings are in line with our interpretation that other regions such as the Precuneus might ‘assume responsibility’ for goal-consistent regulatory success when the DLPFC does not. We now refer to this supplemental evidence in the Results section of the revised manuscript.</p><p>Specifically we now report:</p><p>“Precuneus encodes individual differences in regulatory success in altruistic choice.</p><p>Strikingly, patterns in the DLPFC did not decode regulatory success for social attributes that were flexibly encoded in other regions of the brain (i.e., $Other, Fairness).

I may have missed something but I could not find one. The ROI from the conjunction presented in Figure 3 could be used or prior literature could be used.</p></disp-quote><p>Following the reviewers’ suggestion, we used an ROI-based approach to further examine if neural response patterns in the VMPFC encoded goal-consistent change in attribute representations. The ROI consisted of voxels in the VMPFC identified in the conjunction analyses (see Figure 3 for illustration, upper panel in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2</xref>). We tested this question in three different sets of analyses:</p><p>1) For the first approach, we examined average predictive information in the VMPFC-ROI identified by the whole brain searchlight decoding analyses described in the paper: For each participant and each condition, we extracted decoding accuracies for each voxel in the VMPFC-ROI and estimated an ROI-based average for each choice-attribute. Next, for each attribute, we ran a repeated measures ANOVA to explicitly test for altered information content. Confirming results from whole-brain analyses, information about the values of choice attributes (as measured by decoding accuracies) was not significantly modulated by the regulatory goal (all p’s &gt; 0.13, uncorrected). This finding is in line with our whole-brain results (implemented in SPM), and suggests that the lack of results was not due to overly stringent statistical thresholds. This provides further support for our interpretation that value representations in the VMPFC on the attribute level are unaffected at a group level by our implemented regulatory goals.</p><p>2) However, this analysis leaves open the possibility that local response patterns in the VMPFC (rather than average decoding accuracies) might differentiate attributes by regulatory goal. Thus, we ran supplemental ROI-based within‐subject decoding analyses to predict trial-wise values of an attribute based on local response patterns in the VMPFC. These analyses were similar to the searchlight decoding approach with the difference that ROI-wise response patterns in VMPFC served as neural features for the predictions. Thus, instead of extracting multi-voxel patterns from a sphere around individual voxels in the ROI, we use one response pattern consisting of all voxels of the ROI to define neural response patterns. For each attribute separately, we estimated how well a subject’s multi-voxel response patterns encoded attribute values in a particular task condition. Next, on a group level, we used repeated measures ANOVA to examine whether neural information on an attribute varied depending on the behavioral goal. Consistent with the searchlight decoding approach, predictive information encoded in the VMPFC did not significantly vary cross task conditions (all p’s &gt; 0.29, uncorrected).</p><p>3) Finally, we examined if response patterns in the VMPFC encoded goal-dependent changes across participants. Such a pattern might suggest that even though we did not observe main effects, VMPFC attribute representations still contribute in some way to regulatory success. Thus, in addition to the within-subject analyses described above (1-2), we also ran cross-subject decoding analyses. These analyses were identical to the decoding analyses of individual regulatory success from neural response patterns of the DLPFC, with the exception that response patterns were extracted from the VMPFC cluster identified in the conjunction analysis. Consistent with the lack of main effects for the supplemental analyses reported above, cross-subject decoding analyses did not yield significant predictions of participants’ regulatory success for any attribute or for choice behavior (i.e. healthy or generous choices) in the food task or altruism task (all p’s &gt; 0.31, uncorrected).</p><p>Finally, to address potential concerns that the selected ROI might have been too small for the multi-voxel analyses approach, we also repeated these analyses (1-3) using a larger VMPFC‐ROI (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2</xref>, lower panel). The original conjunction area in the VMPFC (upper panel) represents only the central voxels of the searchlight spheres that encoded all attribute values in the attribute-specific searchlight decoding analyses. The lower panel illustrates the VMPFC-ROI based on all voxels within spheres that predicted all attribute values. Results of the analyses (1-3) matched those for the original VMPFC ROI, suggesting that null-findings in supplemental analyses are not merely driven by the comparatively small number of voxels identified in the conjunction analyses (Tastiness, Healthiness, $Self, $ Other, Fairness).</p><fig id="respfig2"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31185.020</object-id><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>The figure illustrates two VMPFC-ROIs used for the supplemental analyses.</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-31185-resp-fig2-v1"/></fig><p>Taken together, these more sensitive and fine-grained ROI analyses confirm our conclusion that, in this study, our VMPFC ROI encodes the values of each of the individual attributes, but not in a manner that is sensitive to regulatory goals. We have highlighted these additional analyses briefly in the Results section of the main paper, and expanded on them in the Appendix.</p><p>The relevant paragraphs in the revised Results section now reads:</p><p>“No evidence for goal-dependent coding of attribute values and decision values in the VMPFC. […] While activation patterns in the VMPFC (as well as several other regions) reliably predicted overall decision values in both tasks, regulation failed to modulate decoding accuracies for decision value (Supplementary file 2) or for any specific attribute (Appendix 1 – 1.3), and did not predict individual differences in regulatory success (Appendix 1 – 1.3).”</p><p>“VMPFC does not encode individual differences in regulatory success.</p><p>Because of its hypothesized role in valuation, a post-hoc analyses also examined whether the VMPFC region that encoded all attributes predicted regulatory success in either choice task.

What do the authors find if the SVR is trained on one attribute (e.g. tastiness) and tested on the other two (e.g. healthiness and $self)?</p></disp-quote><p>The question of how the DLPFC encodes different attributes is extremely interesting! The reviewer is also correct that the main analyses of the manuscript do not address this issue. We therefore ran a supplemental decoding analysis to explicitly test if neural codes in the DLPFC are similar or distinct across contexts, attributes, and tasks. More precisely, we tested if a decoding model trained on neural data in one context (or attribute, or task) allows decoding the attribute values in a different context (or attribute, or task) based on neural data observed in these trials. Significant decoding would suggest that the neural code in one context is reinstated (at least in part) in the different context.</p><p>To do this, we used a post-hoc ROI-based approach using voxels in the DLPFC (Figure 5A) together with a within‐subject decoding approach (as described in the manuscript). However, instead of a leave-one-run-out cross-validation, we now trained the SVR model on data of one condition (e.g. Tastiness-HC) and tested it on data of another condition (e.g. Tastiness-TC). The procedure was then repeated, reversing training and testing data (e.g. train on Tastiness-TC, test on Tastiness‐HC). Decoding accuracies were estimated by averaging predictions across this 2-fold cross-validation. As a sanity check, we also ran the analysis for data within a condition (e.g. train on 1st half of data in Tastiness-HC, test on 2nd half of data in Tastiness-HC, and vice versa). Statistical significance was assessed at the group level using permutation tests in which we examined how likely observed decoding accuracies were compared to an empirical null-distribution of these predictions. Null-distributions were estimated by breaking up the matching of trial-wise neural activation patterns and attribute values (1000 folds). Upper cutoff-values for significance were the 95th percentile of null-distributions.</p><p>Our results suggest that the DLPFC maintains distinct neural codes for different attributes, but that such codes may be similar across different contexts. Figure 5B illustrates the results of this analyses for attributes encoded in the DLPFC (Tastiness, Healthiness, $Self).</p><p>First, we examined whether values of a particular attribute (e.g. Tastiness) relied on common neural codes across contexts/regulatory conditions (within-attribute decoding, yellow frames). For each attribute, we found evidence in favor of common coding of attribute values across contexts (illustrated in red, signifying significant cross-condition classification, p &lt; 0.05 in stringent permutation tests). For example, similar neural codes seem to represent values of Tastiness in TC and HC. However, a lack of significant cross-condition classification in 2 of the 18 tests (e.g. Tastiness in NC and HC) might also point to some degree of context-dependent differences in activation patterns for attribute values, or to the much weaker representation of some attributes in some conditions.</p><p>Second, and more importantly, the analyses enabled us to explicitly test whether neural codes in the DLPFC generalize across attributes (cross-attribute decoding). Response patterns that coded for values of one attribute did not allow predicting values of another attribute (illustrated in blue). This was found to hold true across regulatory conditions. This finding suggests that distinct neural codes within the DLPFC are used to encode values of individual attributes in both choice tasks (Tastiness, Healthiness, and $Self).</p><p>We now report these findings in the revised Results sections of the manuscript:</p><p>“This finding suggests that the DLPFC acts as a domain-general circuit for goal-sensitive value representations. But what does this convergence in the DLPFC signify? […] This supports the idea that the DLPFC acts as a domain-general mechanism for representing different attributes in a goal-sensitive manner, using unique codes for each attribute.”</p><p>We also refer to these findings in the revised Discussion section of the manuscript:</p><p>“Third, although we observed converging effects of regulation for a subset of attributes in the DLPFC (including tastiness, healthiness, and self-related benefits), representations of these attributes utilized distinct, differentiated codes. Taken together, although our results do not preclude the possibility that in other contexts cognitive regulation of decision making might operate on a single, centralized value integration mechanism, they suggest that it may often operate by changing distinct attribute representations.”</p><p>We believe that this set of supplemental analyses has significantly strengthened the manuscript and has shed further light on the neural computations in the DLPFC that underlie cognitive regulation of value-based choice.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Can the overlap between representations be better visualized?</p><p>It would be informative to visualize the feature weights for the key areas (e.g. VMPFC, DLPFC) across voxel space in every subject. This procedure should help to assess to what extent any decoding effects are due to hard anatomical boundaries between subareas (e.g. dorsal and ventral aspects of DLPFC) or to distributed patterns within areas.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer makes an interesting (but challenging!) suggestion. Using a post-hoc ROI approach based on voxels in the DLPFC (Figure 5B), we re-ran the within-subject decoding analyses of values of tastiness, healthiness, and $Self (separately for each condition). We then extracted feature weights of the prediction for each of the attributes encoded in the DLPFC, subject, and condition and projected them back into MNI space (3 attributes x 36 subjects x 3 conditions = 324 images). Visual inspection of feature weights did not reveal systematic clustering of feature weights across voxel space or hard anatomical boundaries. Because of the large amount of data, we have opted for now to leave out a presentation of every attribute in every subject and condition, as suggested by the reviewer.

Have the authors considered a model whereby coupling between DLPFC and distinct regions of sensory cortex is modulated according to the regulatory goal? The DLPFC must get its attribute representations from someplace.</p></disp-quote><p>We speculate that part of the altered representations in visual and motor cortex may be due to differences in patterns of eye movements, visual attention, and the vigor of motor responding. While these effects are not uninteresting, we suspect they are a corollary of changes happening in other areas, rather than drivers of regulation per se.</p><p>We wholeheartedly agree with the reviewer that, in theory, information transfer between the DLPFC and other areas could account for changes in attribute representations. However, it is not entirely clear what the appropriate method is to test for this coupling, given that attribute encoding effects in the DLPFC appeared only in multivariate response patterns, not univariate response, while current functional connectivity methods assume that connectivity will manifest in the coupling of univariate responses in one region to univariate responses in another. We suspect that functionally coupling actually occurs at the level of distributed representations within and across regions, which complicates the interpretation of effects in univariate connectivity analyses.</p><p>Nevertheless, and with that caveat in mind, we performed a complete set of connectivity analyses for four regions of interest (ROIs) identified in our dataset: 1) the DLPFC area showing a conjunction between regulatory effects on representations of Tastiness, Healthiness, and $Self, 2) the TPJ and 3) the precuneus showing altered attribute encoding for $Other, and 4) the VMPFC area showing a conjunction across all attribute representations. For each of these regions, we performed a beta series functional connectivity analysis (Rissman et al., 2004), a method that has more power to detect context-specific changes in functional connectivity for event-related designs (Cisler et al., 2014). These supplemental analyses explicitly tested for changes in functional connectivity that might explain altered representations in these regions:</p><p>1) Based on the reviewers’ comment, we first tested the possibility that DLPFC might be more connected with visual or motor areas during regulation, either on average, or as a function of regulatory success. To this end, we defined the DLPFC as seed region, extracted trial-by-trial responses from this region, and then used these responses as parametric modulators in a GLM to identify areas where response covaried with DLPFC differently as a function of regulation. These analyses did not reveal goal-dependent functional connectivity with either primary visual or motor areas that showed goal-dependent attribute coding, even at liberal statistical thresholds (p &lt; 0.005, uncorrected).</p><p>2) Following up on the notion that the DLPFC must get its attribute representations from someplace, we then tested the possibility of functional coupling between the DLPFC and the VMPFC region shown to encode all attributes in a goal-independent manner. We observed the following patterns:</p><p>a) During food choices, increased coupling between VMPFC and DLPFC during Health vs. Natural trials [HC &gt; NC] reflected the extent to which participants increased the weight of healthiness in Health vs. Natural trials (Δw Healthiness [HC &gt; NC], p &lt; 0.005, uncorrected).</p><p>b) During altruistic choices, decreased coupling between VMPFC and DLPFC during Natural vs. Regulatory trials [NC &gt; (EC, PC)] predicted the extent to which the weight on $Self decreased in Natural vs. Regulatory trials (Δw $Self [NC &gt; (EC, PC)], p &lt; 0.005, uncorrected).</p><p>These results are detailed in the revised manuscript and the Appendix:</p><p>“Figure 3—figure supplement 2.

I do not view this null finding as problematic, but out of curiosity do the authors have any thoughts as to what is going on when regulatory success depended on changes to fairness due to the goal of complying with social norms? This null finding should be addressed in the Discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We fully share the reviewer’s curiosity about the meaning of this result! We think there are two possibilities here that are not mutually exclusive. First, we speculate that the instructions to focus on ethical reasons for giving are less constrained than instructions to focus on one’s partner’s feelings. Ethical values can be derived from many sources (including fairness, deontological views about the correct action, consequentialist views about the correct outcome, etc.). Prior research suggests that there is considerable individual heterogeneity in which constructs people deem relevant, and we suspect that is in part what is happening here. In contrast, focusing on one’s partner’s feelings may result in more consistent focus on specific considerations and attributes related to empathy and perspective taking across subjects.</p><p>However, we also believe our results are just as consistent with a second interpretation: that the lack of a correspondence between behavioral weights and neural response in the ethics condition speaks to the idea that the behavioral weights that we estimate, despite giving a single number for a specific attribute, may actually result from the consideration of multiple sub-attributes served by specific computations being performed in specific regions. In other words, the increased weight on $Other in both Partner and Ethics focus conditions may reflect empathetic considerations of consequences in the Partner condition, but may reflect consideration of norms and rules (e.g., do unto others as you would have done unto you) in the Ethics condition. That neural activation patterns in the TPJ and precuneus encode $Other in the Partner focus condition and not in the Ethics condition suggests that their computations may support the former more directly than the latter.</p><p>We have revised the Discussion section to focus on this second possibility, specifically considering its implications for the computations occurring in the TPJ and precuneus:</p><p>“At the same time, goal-consistent changes in pro-social attributes (e.g. others benefits) appeared in areas like the TPJ and precuneus, especially when focused on the partner’s thoughts and feelings. […] Thus, the TPJ and precuneus appear to encode features specifically related to representing others’ outcomes in a goal-sensitive manner, pointing to specialized loci of cognitive regulation in social choice domains.”</p><p>We have opted not to include the first point (heterogeneity of strategies) because the Discussion is already a bit long, and we feel that other points are more critical to make. However, if the reviewer or editor feels that a discussion of this point is worth mentioning, we are of course very happy to include it.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>In this manuscript, Tusche and Hutcherson report an fMRI study on how cognitive regulation affects the neural representation of choice-relevant attributes. They look for mechanisms that may generalize across two types of choices, one involving conflict between healthiness and tastiness of food items, the other involving conflict between self-interests and altruistic concerns. In different conditions, participants are asked to focus on one or the other attribute, which regulates the weights assigned to the targeted attributes, as shown via computational modeling of choice data. The key findings are the links between these changes in attribute weights and the decoding accuracy obtained for these attributes using multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) in various cortical regions. The results are quite convincing, with successful decoding across tasks and individuals. There is no clear conclusion about whether the regulation is centralized or distributed though, since changes in decoding accuracy are observed in the DLPFC for most of the attributes but not all.</p></disp-quote><p>We fully concur that the DLPFC finding is convincing and intriguing, but not entirely consistent with either a fully centralized or fully distributed model. Response patterns in the DLPFC encoded values of three choice attributes (tastiness, healthiness, $Self) in a goal-consistent manner, while attribute values of Fairness and $Other were flexibly encoded in attribute-specific brain regions. Although this could be seen as providing “no clear conclusion” we believe our data, especially with the addition of new analyses suggested by our three reviewers, allows us to make a number of important and clear inferences. Specifically, we believe the paper presents convincing evidence in favor of a “hybrid model” in which goal-dependent changes in attribute values occur at the attribute level in attribute-specific loci for some attributes, but in a common hub in the DLPFC for other attributes. We believe that this is an important finding in its own right that will inspire future research on adaptive decision making. We have substantially modified the Introduction and Discussion to further clarify this point. More importantly, we now also report additional analyses of DLPFC responses that suggest that this common hub flexibly represents distinct attributes using distinct neural codes (as opposed to a unified value signal that generalizes across attributes and domains), shedding more light about how the DLPFC encodes goal-dependent attribute values. We now refer to these additional analyses and findings (suggested by reviewer #2) in the revised Results section of the manuscript:</p><p>“This finding suggests that the DLPFC acts as a domain-general circuit for goal-sensitive value representations. […] This supports the idea that the DLPFC acts as a domain-‐general mechanism for representing different attributes in a goal-‐ sensitive manner, using unique codes for each attribute.”</p><p>“Figure 5. Domain-general locus of goal-dependent attribute coding. […] This pattern of results indicates that goal-sensitive representations of attribute values in DLPFC rely on attribute-specific neural codes.”</p><p>Taken together, the sophisticated analyses and novel results significantly improve our understanding of when and why an individual will show specific or more global deficits in regulatory success in dietary and social choice, making our paper of high interest to the broad readership of <italic>eLife</italic>. Moreover, they open up several novel and interesting questions. The most prominent one is certainly the following question: what distinguishes attributes whose representations converge in DLPFC from those that did not? Are attributes that are flexibly encoded in the DLPFC simply less social in nature, less abstract and thus easier/faster to construct, or do they influence outcomes for the participant more directly? Identifying the precise factors that determine whether and when the DLPFC acts as the site for cognitive regulation of value opens up exciting new avenues for future research. We believe that the revised discussion of centralized and distributed loci of goal-consistent attribute coding has significantly strengthened the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The role of cognitive control in economic choice is poorly understood and this study brings valuable insights by applying MVPA to standard choice paradigms. My main concern is the absence of a mechanistic account linking brain activity to behavioral output. In a sense, the results seem a bit trivial: when participants pay attention to a particular type of information (by instruction), this information is easier to decode from their brain activity. This effect should be seen as the outcome (and not the process) of cognitive regulation. How cognitive regulation is implemented, and how better decoding translates into biased choices, still need to be explained.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for his/her critical comments and suggestions, and for the assessment that this study yields valuable insights! We agree with the reviewer that the following assumption is extremely intuitive: when participants pay attention to a particular type of information (by instruction), this information is easier to decode from their brain activity. However, for several reasons we believe that evidence in support of this notion is by no means trivial and that our findings provide valuable insights into the mechanisms that underlie cognitive regulation of value in the brain.</p><p>First, as we make clear in the revised Introduction and Discussion sections, extant research has actually not consistently found such patterns despite clear changes in behavior, raising an important puzzle to be explained. Our results are the first to identify a clear representation of all choice-relevant attributes across multiple contexts, and to show clear modulation of all choice-relevant attributes in a manner depending on regulatory goals. Second, we also think our specific pattern of results clearly speak against the trivial interpretation that one would have to observe changes in attribute coding in the brain, and that this is an uninteresting reflection of changes in behavior. We observe a highly specific pattern of altered and unaltered representations of attribute values: for each attribute, we identified brain regions that reliably encoded current attribute values independent of regulatory condition. The VMPFC is one example for this finding, highlighted in the manuscript. In fact, a lack of modulation was actually the rule rather than the exception. Only a limited number of brain regions contained information on attribute values that varied significantly across task conditions. More importantly, we find a coherent set of diverging and converging changes in in attribute representation: while some attribute changes can be decoded from the DLPFC, changes in social attribute representation appear specifically in social cognitive areas. This is anything but trivial, and, we believe opens up crucially important lines of questioning that will be the basis for a better understanding of cognitive regulation and its mechanistic implementation. We have substantially revised the Introduction and Discussion to highlight these important points.</p><p>Third, we completely agree with the reviewer that our results focus more on outcome (and not the process) of cognitive regulation. We have substantially revised the Introduction to clarify this point further. However, we respectfully disagree that no information about process or mechanism can be derived from a detailed description of where such changes are observed. We have tried to make this clearer in the following ways:</p><p>1) We have now clarified in the new version of the paper in the Introduction, Results, and Discussion how identifying where attribute encoding changes occur may allow us to distinguish between different theories about computational process and mechanism. Specifically, we make clearer that regulation could occur via two processes: modulation at the level of specific attribute representations in non-overlapping, attribute-specific regions, or at the level of weighting in the value integration process. We show how our results are clearly consistent with attribute-level modulation for some attributes (i.e., $Other in TPJ and precuneus, fairness in middle frontal gyrus), and how our results are more ambiguous for other attributes (i.e., modulation of Tastiness, Healthiness, and $Self in DLPFC).</p><p>2) We also make clearer that there are important outstanding questions about the domain-generality or domain-specificity of regulation effects. On the one hand, if different attributes are computed in different regions with different computational properties, regulation could operate through different channels in different domains. If, instead, regulation operates at a more domain-general level, then regulation might influence attribute representations in a common region across multiple different attributes and multiple choice contexts. Understanding whether regulation changes attribute representations in a domain-general or domain-specific way can help reveal both the targets of regulation, as well as the mechanism of action.</p><p>In the Discussion, we also highlight how these questions are not of purely theoretical importance: the locus of action (attribute or integration level, domain specific or domain general) predicts non-trivial differences in patterns of regulatory success, which we observe in our own data. For attributes where regulation influences representation in a common region (i.e., DLPFC) regulatory success tracks together, but for attributes represented elsewhere (i.e., $Other in TPJ and precuneus), regulatory success appears to operate independently. Our results also may help to explain when and why regulatory success might feel difficult: if, as we observe, there are many regions of the brain where attribute representations are not altered by regulation, then these altered representations may continue to leak into the choice process and interfere with regulatory success.</p><p>3) Finally, we have included several supplementary analyses, including analyses that tested for commonalities of goal-consistent attribute coding in the DLPFC as well as functional connectivity results, which shed some light on how these computational processes are implemented in the brain. Please see our detailed first response to reviewer 3. above (neural attribute coding in the DLPFC across attributes and tasks) and our response to the next point below for more information (exploratory functional connectivity).</p><p>Taken together, we believe that these revisions have significantly strengthened the manuscript and provide valuable insights into neural computations in cognitive regulation of decision making across contexts and domains.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>For the latter point, it would be important to show that the decoded value (i.e., the decoder output) correlates with the behavioral weights. The alternative would be that changes in decoding accuracy correspond to changes in precision (i.e., signal-to-noise ratio) and not changes in the signal itself. If correct, this would mean that a region downstream to the DLPFC could just read this value, add it to other values corresponding to other attributes, and feed the aggregate value to a selection process that makes the decision. Perhaps functional connectivity could be used to test for such a transfer of information. Thus, the neural model would parallel the behavioral model.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer suggests two supplemental analyses. First, we examined the link of decoding accuracy and estimated behavioral weights. To this end we ran supplemental regression analyses. Please see our sixth response to reviewer 3 below for details.</p><p>Second, we wholeheartedly agree with the reviewer that, in theory, information transfer between the DLPFC and other areas could account for changes in attribute representations. However, it is not entirely clear what the appropriate method is to test for this coupling, given that attribute encoding effects in the DLPFC appeared only in multivariate response patterns, not univariate response, while current functional connectivity methods assume that connectivity will manifest in the coupling of univariate responses in one region to univariate responses in another. We suspect that functionally coupling actually occurs at the level of distributed representations within and across regions, which complicates the interpretation of effects in univariate connectivity analyses.</p><p>Nevertheless, and with that caveat in mind, we performed a complete set of connectivity analyses for four regions of interest (ROIs) identified in our dataset (as also suggested by reviewer 2, see our seventh response to reviewer 2): 1) the DLPFC area showing a conjunction between regulatory effects on representations of Tastiness, Healthiness, and $Self, 2) the TPJ and 3) the precuneus showing altered attribute encoding for $Other, and 4) the VMPFC area showing a conjunction across all attribute representations. For each of these regions, we performed a beta series functional connectivity analysis (Rissman et al., 2004), a method suggested to have more power to detect context-specific changes in functional connectivity for event-related designs (Cisler et al., 2014). These supplemental analyses explicitly tested for changes in functional connectivity that might explain altered representations in these regions:</p><p>1) Using the DLPFC conjunction area as seed region, we first tested the possibility of functional coupling between the DLPFC and the VMPFC region shown to encode all attributes in a goal-independent manner would change either overall, or as a function of regulatory success. Consistent with this notion, we observed the following patterns:</p><p>During food choices, increased coupling between VMPFC and DLPFC during Health vs. Natural trials [HC &gt; NC] reflected the extent to which participants increased the weight of healthiness in Health vs. Natural trials (Δw Healthiness [HC &gt; NC], p &lt; 0.005, uncorrected).</p><p>During altruistic choices, decreased coupling between VMPFC and DLPFC during Natural vs. Regulatory trials [NC &gt; (EC, PC)] predicted the extent to which the weight on $Self decreased in Natural vs. Regulatory trials (Δw $Self [NC &gt; (EC, PC)], p &lt; 0.005, uncorrected).</p><p>2) We also examined coupling using Precuneus and TPJ as seed regions. This analysis suggested that, during altruistic choices, increased coupling between the VMPFC and Precuneus on Partner vs. Ethics trials also correlated with greater weighting of $Other in Partner vs. Ethics trials (Δw $Other [PC &gt; EC], p &lt; 0.005, uncorrected).</p><p>3) Complementary analyses using the VMPFC as a seed region yielded similar patterns.</p><p>Our results thus suggest precisely the relationship that the reviewer is suggesting: the DLPFC, TPJ, and Precuneus may be receiving information from – or sending information to – the VMPFC. We now report results for these exploratory, complementary connectivity analyses in the revised version of the manuscript and the Appendix:</p><p>“Figure 3—figure supplement 2. Exploratory functional connectivity analyses.[…] All results are shown thresholded at p &lt; 0.005 uncorrected.”</p><p>Detailed descriptions of the methods and results of this exploratory functional connectivity analyses can be found here:</p><p>“Appendix 1 – 1.6 Changes in functional connectivity with the VMPFC correlate with regulatory success”.</p><p>In addition, we refer to these exploratory findings in the Results section and Discussion section of the revised manuscript. Notably the section also acknowledges another reviewer comment (see our fifth response to reviewer</p><p>3 below) as well as the issue of directionality for the interpretation of functional coupling between brain regions (following up on comments of reviewer #2):</p><p>“However, exploratory functional connectivity analyses provided subtle hints that the VMPFC could be indirectly related to regulatory success through its modulation of both DLPFC and precuneus (see Figure 3—figure supplement 2 and Appendix 1 – 1.6 for details).”</p><p>“This raises an important question: what determines the capacity of the DLPFC to properly represent these different attributes?

The arguments taken from subjective report and from body-mass index are quite weak. For subjective report it could be that the rating scale is not reflecting the propensity to comply with the instructions. For body-mass index the opposite correlation could be expected: those who regulates food intake in real life should not need instructions in the lab.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that compliance with reviewer instructions could be driving these results, either in part or in whole. This criticism can be leveled at the majority of studies on cognitive regulation, in both the decision making and emotion-regulation literature. However, we believe the specific pattern of results that we find argues against the simplest version of an experimental demand explanation. Specifically, we hypothesize that the motivation to comply with instructions likely affects both the motivation to suppress concerns about your own payoff during altruistic choices as well as increase those for another person (if not more so, as regulatory goals in the PC Partner Condition explicitly focused on $Other). However, behavioral evidence specifically links the ability to decrease self-related monetary consideration ($Self) to goal-consistent changes of food attributes (but not changes in $Other or Fairness), a finding mirrored in identified neural substrates of goal-consistent attribute coding.</p><p>However, the reviewer makes a valid point and we agree that we cannot fully distinguish between capacity and motivation explanations in this dataset. We now explicitly acknowledge this limitation in the revised Discussion section of the manuscript:</p><p>“We cannot completely rule out that regulatory effects on behavior and attribute representations might partly reflect differences in motivation to satisfy expectations of the experimenter. […] Tying laboratory measures of regulation to real-world consequences also remains a necessary future step in understanding the significance of these findings.”</p><p>We are also happy to include any specific reviewer suggestions in this paragraph on how to further reduce motivational or experimenter demand effects in both choice paradigms, in addition to our probabilistic implementation of choices (ensuring anonymity with regard to the randomly drawn and implemented trial at the end of both tasks, as both the experimenter and the partner are unaware if the outcome was based on a choice or a choice reversal), collected self-report measures of subjects’ motivation to comply with task instructions, and collected real-‐world measures of dietary success (BMI). These concrete suggestions might benefit future studies that aim to further elucidate the neural basis of cognitive regulation of decision making.</p><p>We also would like to briefly mention evidence on structural brain correlates of dietary regulatory success reported elsewhere (Schmidt et al., in press), because we believe these results may in part address the reviewer’s concern. Using voxel-based morphometry, this paper combines four independent datasets that examine goal-dependent changes in two different forms of dietary self-regulation. Note that in this independent paper, dietary success refers to altered weights of food attributes as estimated in a behavioral regression model (instead of a drift diffusion model as used in the current paper). We show that individual differences in dietary success correlate with differences in grey matter volume in the DLPFC, identified in a whole-brain regression analyses without any a priori assumption about regions of interests. Importantly, this localized neuronatomical correlate of dietary regulatory success matches our functional DLPFC ROI. See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig7">Author response image 7</xref> for illustration. This finding indicates that goal-consistent changes in dietary choice at the behavioral level are likely not due solely to situational motivational effects, but might rather reflect more stable individual differences (as reflected in neuroanatomical markers in key regions of regulatory control). Upon acceptance of this manuscript, we intend to refer to this evidence in the respective Discussion section (see above) as additional reference.</p><fig id="respfig7"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31185.025</object-id><label>Author response image 7.</label><caption/><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-31185-resp-fig7-v1"/></fig><p>Finally, we have taken the comment of reviewer #2 to heart and have removed the description of the BMI related evidence from the revised manuscript and have moved the description of self-report data on subjects’ motivation to comply with experimental instructions to the Appendix:</p><p>“Appendix 1 – 1.8 Self-reported motivation to comply with instructions and observed regulation- success.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- The observation that all attributes are represented in the VMPFC but inaccessible to cognitive regulation is super interesting (and novel, to my knowledge).

Although there are hints in previous literature that the VMPFC may not always be the direct precursor of regulatory success, our study confirms and extends these earlier results in important ways. We have now performed a considerably more extensive analysis of VMPFC responses, using a post-hoc ROI-based approach as suggested by reviewer #2, confirming that decoding of attribute values in VMPFC doesn’t vary across regulatory goals and also fails to predict individual differences in success (in contrast to DLPFC, which does both). We have revised both the Introduction and Discussion sections to highlight the importance of understanding the roles of VMPFC and DLPFC in enabling regulatory success, and discuss the significance of the VMPFC null result more carefully in the Discussion section, incorporating the reviewer’s idea that the VMPFC may represent an earlier stage in the process of value construction:</p><p>The relevant sections in the revised Discussion section now read:</p><p>“Unexpectedly, cognitive regulation of decision making did not reliably modulate value signals within the VMPFC. Instead, regulatory effects converged to modulate a subset of distinct attribute representations in both the social and non‐social domain within a region of the DLPFC that has previously been implicated in value-based choice (Plassmann et al., 2007; Plassmann et al., 2010; Hutcherson et al., 2015)”</p><p>“The role of VMPFC and DLPFC in valuation and cognitive regulation.</p><p>Our study adds to a growing body of experimental work finding that behavioral effects of regulation can occur in the absence of corresponding changes to either overall levels of VMPFC response (Hollmann et al., 2012; Hutcherson et al., 2012; Yokum and Stice, 2013), or VMPFC representation of specific attributes like taste (Hare et al., 2011a). […] Future work including the use of measures with higher temporal precision may help to elucidate when and how interactions between the VMPFC and DLPFC determine regulatory success in different contexts.”</p><p>We also highlight the potentially distinct role of VMPFC and DLPFC in goal-consistent value coding in a separate goal of the study in the revised Introduction of the manuscript (Goal 3):</p><p>“Finally, we sought to shed light on whether information represented in VMPFC and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) supports either attribute-level or integration-level changes in value during cognitive regulation of decision making. […] However, several failures to observe changes in the VMPFC during cognitive regulation of decision making (Hollmann et al., 2012; Hutcherson et al., 2012; Yokum and Stice, 2013) suggest the need to either measure value computation in a more sensitive way, or to identify alternate routes to behavioral change.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- To compare the pattern of attribute weights and the pattern of decoding accuracy across conditions, the authors intend to reproduce significance of pair-wise comparisons. As they know this approach heavily depends on the statistical threshold, which may be matter of debate when multiple comparisons are made. I would favor a straight regression of decoding accuracy against weight (across conditions).</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer raises an interesting point. A regression of decoding accuracy against weight (across conditions) allows testing whether the amount of local neural information on attribute values reflects individual differences in the behavioral weights of this attribute. We expected that this alternative analysis approach would confirm our main findings for attributes for which neural evidence closely matched predictions of the behavioral computational models (e.g. for taste and health). However, one major potential concern with the suggested regression approach occurs in cases in which neural evidence diverges from predictions of the behavioral model (such as for $Others in the rTPJ and Precuneus). For those key findings of our study, estimated behavioral weights (specifically for the ethics condition) clearly don’t match the neural substrate for goal-dependent coding of attribute values. Thus, while our repeated measures ANOVAs identify any brain region in which information content on attribute values varies across condition (independent of whether it is consistent with predictions of the behavioral model or not), the regression approach identifies only brain regions in which neural decoding accuracies fully and closely match predictions of the behavioral model. Thus, if the behavioral model is even slightly miss-specified, or if more than one region contributes independently to the single weight estimated by the behavioral model, the neural results could fail to conform to predictions. While we are sensitive to potential concerns related to the issue of multiple comparisons, we respectfully argue that our original analysis approach is more appropriate to study goal-dependent changes across a wide variety of attributes, based on these theoretical considerations.</p><p>This being said however, we agree with the reviewer that it is important to know whether decoding accuracies also match the behaviorally estimated weights. We ran several supplemental analyses to provide further evidence on our key findings (also addressing reviewer 3’s third comment). More precisely, following the suggestion of reviewer #3, we used straight regression analyses of decoding accuracies against weights (across conditions). This set of complimentary analyses adopted a whole-brain approach that examined whether behavioral attribute weights covary with local neural decoding accuracies using parametric regression analyses as implemented in SPM: For each attribute (e.g. for the neural coding of tastiness values), these group-level analyses estimated a general linear model in SPM (simple one-sample t-test against 0) that used whole-brain decoding accuracy maps of each subject (collapsed across conditions) as the dependent variable and the attribute weights as the predictor variable. Contrast images of the parametric regressor against implicit baseline identify brain regions in which decoding accuracies covary linearly with behavioral attribute weights.</p><p>First, we examined attributes in the food choice task. Confirming results of our main analyses, the whole-brain analyses found that neural decoding accuracies on healthiness values in the right DLPFC were modulated by the weight of healthiness on choices as estimated in the behavioral model (p&lt;0.001, cluster-level corrected at p&lt;0.05 FWE). Likewise, in line with our previous results, we found that decoding accuracies on tastiness values in the right DLPFC (peak in the right superior frontal gyrus, SFG) covaried with the weight that this attribute had in food choices (p&lt;0.001, cluster-level corrected at p&lt;0.05 FWE). No brain region showed a negative correlation of decoding accuracies and behavioral attribute weights.

Consistent with our results suggesting that Altruistic Choice may be a more heterogeneous process, results of the regression analysis for $Self, $Other, and Fairness were weaker and did not survive correction for multiple comparisons in this whole- brain analyses. However, at a slightly more lenient statistical threshold (p &lt; 0.001, uncorrected), neural information in the right DLPFC on trial-wise values of $Self indeed reflected individual weights assigned to $Self during choices as estimated in the behavioral model (w $Self). This result further supports the notion that neural activation patterns in the right DLPFC are involved in goal-consistent coding for peoples own monetary benefits in the altruism task. A matching analyses that tested for brain regions in which neural information is negatively correlated with attribute weights for $Self did not yield any significant results at this statistical threshold. See Author Response Table 2 for complete list of results for $Self.</p><p>Taken together with the results of the regression analyses for food attributes reported above, these supplemental analyses provide further support for the notion that flexible attribute representations in the right DLPFC generalize across task domains (i.e., $Self, Tastiness, Healthiness).

Interestingly, for $Other, we found that at this threshold neural information on $Other significantly covaried with the subject’s w$Other in the left pSTS/TPJ (while the right pSTS/TPJ only became significant at a threshold of p &lt; 0.005, uncorrected). For illustration of both clusters (and the PCC/Precunes) at p &lt; 0.005, uncorrected, see panel A). Notably, the cluster in the right pSTS/TPJ closely matched the brain region identified using our previous approach in which we compared regulatory and natural conditions (see panel B for illustration). While results at this liberal statistical threshold have to be interpreted with extreme caution, these findings suggest that goal-sensitive neural representations of $Other might be encoded bilaterally in the pSTS/TPJ.</p><p>Taken together, these results suggest that our results are largely robust to different ways of conceptualizing the correspondence between decoding accuracies and behaviorally estimated attribute weights. As mentioned above, we have chosen to report the original ANOVAs in the paper because of their greater flexibility in identifying patterns that do not fully conform to the predictions of the behavioral model. We hope that the reviewer’s concerns on this regard have been fully addressed.</p><fig id="respfig10"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31185.028</object-id><label>Author response image
