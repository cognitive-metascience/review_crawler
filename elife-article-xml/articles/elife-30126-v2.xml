We show that the epibranchial placodes, in addition to giving rise to cranial sensory neurons, generate a novel lineage-related non-neuronal cell population for mouse pharyngeal arch development. Eya1 is essential for the development of epibranchial placodes and proximal pharyngeal arches. We identify an Eya1-Notch regulatory axis that specifies both the neuronal and non-neuronal commitment of the epibranchial placode, where Notch acts downstream of Eya1 and promotes the non-neuronal cell fate. Notch is regulated by the threonine phosphatase activity of Eya1. Eya1 dephosphorylates p-threonine-2122 of the Notch1 intracellular domain (Notch1 ICD), which increases the stability of Notch1 ICD and maintains Notch signaling activity in the non-neuronal epibranchial placodal cells. Our data unveil a more complex differentiation program in epibranchial placodes and an important role for the Eya1-Notch axis in craniofacial morphogenesis.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Eya1 phosphatase</kwd><kwd>Notch</kwd><kwd>epibranchial placode</kwd><kwd>pharyngeal arch</kwd><kwd>pharyngeal epithelium</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DK064640</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xu</surname><given-names>Pin-Xian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DC014718</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xu</surname><given-names>Pin-Xian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004359</institution-id><institution>Vetenskapsrådet</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>K2014-64X-20097-09-5</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lendahl</surname><given-names>Urban</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002794</institution-id><institution>Cancerfonden</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CAN 2016/271</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lendahl</surname><given-names>Urban</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Integrated Cardio Metabolic Center</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lendahl</surname><given-names>Urban</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002920</institution-id><institution>Research Grants Council, University Grants Committee</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RGC GRF 777411</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sham</surname><given-names>Mai Har</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002920</institution-id><institution>Research Grants Council, University Grants Committee</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RGC GRF 17113415</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sham</surname><given-names>Mai Har</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Dephosphorylation of Notch1 intracellular domain by Eya1 leads to enhanced Notch signalling activity in the non-neuronal epibranchial placodal cells, revealing an essential regulation for the formation of proximal pharyngeal arches during mouse craniofacial development.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Craniofacial morphogenesis depends on integration of signals from multiple cell types and is a complex morphogenetic process requiring, among other structures, the genesis of cranial placodes and pharyngeal arches. The cranial placodes are ectodermal thickening structures derived from the pre-placodal primordium, an ectodermal region adjacent to the neural plate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baker and Bronner-Fraser, 2001</xref>). The cranial placodes are divided into the anterior (adenohypophyseal, olfactory and lens placodes), intermediate (trigeminal placode) and posterior placodes (otic, lateral line and epibranchial placodes) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Streit, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Saint-Jeannet and Moody, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Singh and Groves, 2016</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The epibranchial placodes comprise the geniculate, petrosal and nodose placodes, which contribute to the cranial nerve VII (facial), IX (glossopharyngeal) and X (vagus), respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">D'Amico-Martel and Noden, 1983</xref>). It is believed that the principle function of the epibranchial placodes is to produce viscero-sensory neurons by delaminating cells that undergo neuronal differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Narayanan and Narayanan, 1980</xref>). In contrast, the olfactory and otic placodes also generate non-neuronal secretory or supporting cells, in addition to delaminating neuronal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Patthey et al., 2014</xref>). The pharyngeal arches (PA) are transient structures formed in the pharyngeal region of the early embryonic head and interactions of the pharyngeal epithelium, the endoderm, neural crest and mesenchyme give rise to facial, head and neck structures during development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). A key aspect of PA formation is the segmentation process, during which the pharyngeal endoderm extends laterally towards the ectoderm, forming an epithelial pocket called the pharyngeal pouch, while the surface ectoderm invaginates and forms the pharyngeal cleft (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Graham, 2003</xref>). The contact between ectodermal cleft and endodermal pouch forms the segmental plate, which gradually extends proximal-distally to define the boundary between each PA, and restricts the route for neural crest migration into each arch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Graham et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Shone and Graham, 2014</xref>). The segmental contact points are also sources of signaling factors that regulate the anterior-posterior and proximal-distal patterning of the PA and promote mesenchymal cell survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Trumpp et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Couly et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">David et al., 2002</xref>). The relationship between epibranchial placodes and PA development is poorly understood, but the notion that the geniculate, petrosal and nodose placodes are located near the pharyngeal clefts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), suggests that they are part of the coordinated development of the corresponding PA.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30126.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Cranial placode and pharyngeal arch development in wildtype and <italic>Eya1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mouse embryos.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic summary of the development of cranial placodes and pharyngeal arches (PA) in mouse embryos. The pre-placodal region, marked by expression of <italic>Eya</italic> and <italic>Six</italic> families of genes at E8.0, is divided into anterior, medial and posterior placodal regions at E8.5, which further develops into specific cranial placodes (A, adenohypophyseal; O, olfactory; L, lens; T, trigeminal; Gen, geniculate; Pet, petrosal; Nod, nodose) from E8.5–9.5.

Six proteins are DNA-binding activator proteins that promote expression of pre-placodal genes when partnered with Eya. In contrast, Eya does not bind DNA directly, but acts as the transactivating partner to Six proteins. The importance of Eya and Six proteins for craniofacial development is underscored by that mutations in the human <italic>EYA1</italic> and <italic>SIX</italic> genes, including <italic>SIX1</italic> and <italic>SIX5,</italic> are reported in approximately 50% of the patients suffering from Branchio-Oto-Renal (BOR) syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdelhak et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Smith, 1993</xref>). <italic>Eya1</italic> mutant mouse embryos display phenotypes in multiple pharyngeal and placodal derivatives including cranial neural crest cell-derived bones and cartilages, endoderm-derived tympanic cavity, thymus, thyroid and parathyroid glands, ectoderm-derived external auditory canal, otic and epibranchial placodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Xu et al., 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Zou et al., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">2006</xref>). <italic>Six1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> and <italic>Six4<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mouse embryos also exhibit pharyngeal phenotypes along with kidney problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Laclef et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Zou et al., 2006</xref>), in keeping with a tight functional coupling between Eya and Six proteins. However, the Eya1 protein does not only serve as a transcriptional co-activator, but also possesses tyrosine and threonine phosphatase activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Li et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Okabe et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tadjuidje and Hegde, 2013</xref>). The tyrosine phosphatase activity of Eya1 regulates H2AX and DNA repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cook et al., 2009</xref>) and is also required for the function of Eya1 as a transactivator in conjunction with Six (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Li et al., 2003</xref>). Less is known about the threonine phosphatase activity, but dephosphorylation of T58 in c-Myc by Eya1 has been shown to be important for nephrogenesis and tumour growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Xu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Li et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Craniofacial development is regulated by Notch signalling. Genetic and pharmacological inhibition of Notch results in proximal PA and craniofacial defects as well as premature neurogenesis and neuronal delamination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Humphreys et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Zuniga et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Daudet and Lewis, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">de la Pompa et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lassiter et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lassiter et al., 2014</xref>). Conversely, activation of Notch in the cranial placodes prevents both neurogenesis and delamination and expands the placodal epithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jayasena et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pan et al., 2013</xref>). The Notch signalling pathway is an evolutionarily ancient cell-cell communication system that controls differentiation in most tissues and organs. Upon activation by ligand on a juxtaposed cell, the Notch receptor is proteolytically processed and the final cleavage, which is executed by the γ-secretase complex, liberates the C-terminal portion of the Notch receptor, the Notch intracellular domain (Notch ICD). Notch ICD is translocated into the nucleus to form a complex with the DNA-binding protein CSL, which converts CSL from a repressor to an activator, leading to activation of Notch downstream genes, including <italic>Hes</italic> and <italic>Hey</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Siebel and Lendahl, 2017</xref>). Notch gene dosage and the level of Notch receptor mediated signaling have profound impact on cell fate decision in many cell types during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Andersson and Lendahl, 2014</xref>).</p><p>Here we address novel roles of Eya1 in regulating PA and epibranchial placode differentiation. We show that Eya1 is required for proper proximal PA, pharyngeal cleft and pouch formation. We also provide evidence that epibranchial placodes are not limited to generating viscero-sensory neurons only, but contain bipotential epithelial progenitors that in addition produce a non-neuronal cell lineage important for PA development. We further identified Notch1 ICD as a novel target of the threonine phosphatase activity of Eya1. Dephosphorylation leads to stabilization of Notch1 ICD and enhanced Notch signaling. Our data provide evidence for a more complex composition of epibranchial placodes and an Eya1-Notch axis important for PA formation and craniofacial morphogenesis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>Eya1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> embryos exhibit defective pharyngeal arch segmentation and lack proximal arch structures</title><p>The first PA became morphologically identifiable at E8.5, at this stage wildtype and mutant PA appeared grossly comparable in size and morphology (data not shown).

The expression patterns and morphological transitions are summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>. To obtain a more high-resolution view of the gene expression patterns, we examined the expression of Eya1, Sox2, Neurog2 and Fgf3 on transverse sections from E8.0 (5 somites) to E9.5 (25 somites) wildtype embryos at the position of the epibranchial or geniculate placodes. At E8.0 (5ss), the thickened placodal ectoderm was Sox2<sup>+</sup> and none of the cells was Fgf3<sup>+</sup> or Neurog2<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and F–G’</xref>). At E8.5 (8ss), Neurog2 and Fgf3 expression started to emerge in the Sox2<sup>+</sup> placodal ectoderm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and I–J’</xref>). Co-staining for Sox2 and Neurog2 showed a salt-and-pepper expression distribution at 15ss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3L</xref>) and three types of expression patterns could be discerned: Sox2 single positive, Neurog2 single positive, and Sox2/Neurog2 double positive cells. <italic>Fgf3</italic> expression could also be detected in the Sox2<sup>+</sup> cell population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C and M–M’</xref>). At 8-15ss, there were Fgf3/Sox2 double positive cells in the Neurog2 positive region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I–3J’ and and L–M’</xref>). Interestingly, at E9.5 (25ss), all Neurog2<sup>+</sup> cells were sorted to the proximal region while the Sox2<sup>+</sup>/Fgf3<sup>+</sup> cells were confined to the more distal region on the lateral surface of the PA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3O–3P'</xref>). Eya1 was co-expressed with Sox2 from 5ss onwards and was expressed in both the Neurog2<sup>+</sup> and Fgf3<sup>+</sup> regions from 8 to 25ss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E, H, K and N</xref>). Since the Fgf3<sup>+</sup>/Sox2<sup>+</sup>/Neurog2<sup>-</sup> cells also exhibited a thickened epithelial morphology and expressed <italic>Eya1</italic>, we propose that these cells define a new non-neuronal cell lineage in the epibranchial placode. In <italic>Eya1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> embryos, Neurog2 expression was lost while Sox2 expression was still retained in the epithelium from E8.0 to E9.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A–1D</xref>’).

To address this, we used a Sox2 cell lineage tracing system (<italic>Sox2-CreER; R26R<sup>EYFP</sup></italic> mice) in which tamoxifen induction at E7.5 would label the Sox2-expressing cells after this stage. Analysis of tamoxifen-injected embryos two days later, at E9.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3Q</xref>), revealed that some EYFP-expressing cells were also positive for Islet1, a marker for delaminating neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3R</xref>), suggesting that the Sox2<sup>+</sup> lineage gave rise to neuronal progeny destined for the geniculate ganglion. We however also observed EYFP-expression in cells with thickened epithelial morphology, which expressed Sox2 and also gave rise to the pharyngeal cleft, and proximal pharyngeal ectoderm cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 3S</xref>). This indicates that cells expressing Sox2 at E7.5 segregated to delaminating neurons as well as to cells in the non-neurogenic lineage. In conclusion, these data provide evidence for a novel type of lineage that ‘lives on’ in the epibranchial placode after delamination of neuronal cells, and continues to express Sox2, Fgf3 and other factors. By injection of tamoxifen at E9.5 and analysis at E12.5 and E14.5, we detected EYFP expression in the external auditory canal and pinna epithelium, indicating that non-neuronal cells were produced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1H and I</xref>).

We first analyzed the distribution of components of the Notch pathway and downstream target genes in wildtype embryos. The pharyngeal ectoderm showed extensive co-expression of Notch1 with Eya1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A–1A</xref>’’) and Sox2 from E8.0 onwards (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1O and Q</xref>). Notch immunoreactivity was observed also in the nuclei, indicating active Notch signaling, a notion further supported by expression of Hey1, a Notch downstream target, at the pharyngeal ectoderm, with a distribution similar to that of Sox2 from E8.5 to E9.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B–1E</xref>).

In sum, this indicates that Notch signaling pathway is involved in the specification of both the neurogenic and non-neuronal epibranchial domains.</p><p>We next assessed whether Notch signaling was altered in <italic>Eya1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> E9.5 embryos. To identify activated Notch signaling, we used an antibody that specifically recognizes the nascent N-terminus (V1744) formed on Notch1 ICD after γ-secretase cleavage. In wildtype embryos, V1744 immunoreactivity was observed in the ectodermal and endodermal cells as well as in the neural crest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and A’</xref>), whereas the ectodermal staining was specifically lost in the <italic>Eya1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and B’</xref>). This result may indicate that Notch1 is not proteolytically activated or that there is a reduction in the total amount of receptor. To distinguish between these two possibilities, we used an antibody (C20) that recognizes an epitope internally in the Notch1 ICD and thus monitors total amount of Notch1. The C20 immunoreactivity revealed a specific reduction of Notch1 immunoreactivity in the rostral-proximal ectodermal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D and D’</xref>) as compared to wildtype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C and C’</xref>), suggesting that the total amount of Notch1 receptor was reduced in the ectodermal cells rather than that receptor cleavage was affected.

In contrast to the prolongation of Notch1 ICD half-life by wildtype Eya1, two Eya1 mutants DYY and Y4, which largely affect the threonine phosphatase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Okabe et al., 2009</xref>) did not stabilize Notch1 ICD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E and F</xref>) and this was the case also for Eya1D327N, which affects both the tyrosine and threonine phosphatase activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Li et al., 2017</xref>). To corroborate the notion that the Eya1 threonine phosphatase activity was involved, we explored whether the amount of threonine-, serine- or tyrosine-phosphorylation of Notch1 ICD was altered by Eya1. Analysis using anti-phosphopeptide-specific antibodies for threonine, serine and tyrosine revealed that in the presence of Eya1, the total amount of Notch1 ICD was increased but the amount of threonine-phosphorylated Notch1 ICD was reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>). In contrast, the serine-phosphorylated Notch1 ICD was not affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>), and tyrosine-phosphorylated Notch ICD was hardly detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>). In keeping with these data, in vitro phosphatase experiments, using purified Flag-Eya1 and Flag-Notch1 ICD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>), showed that in the presence of Eya1 the amount of threonine-phosphorylated Notch1 ICD was reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>). As the stability of Notch1 ICD is regulated by phosphorylation and ubiquitination, in particular by the E3 ubiquitin ligase Fbw7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Oberg et al., 2001</xref>), we examined the impact of Eya1 on the turnover of Notch1 ICD. By immunoprecipitation experiments, we demonstrated that the ubiquitinated-Notch1 ICD level was enhanced by Fbw7, but reduced significantly in the presence of Eya1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I</xref>). The level of ubiquitination, assessed by anti-HA antibody, was also reduced by Eya1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I</xref>). In conclusion, the data show that Eya1 interacts with Notch1 ICD via its C-terminal domain and that Eya1 acts as a threonine phosphatase on Notch1 ICD, controlling its stability.</p><p>To identify the target dephosphorylated threonine residue on Notch1 ICD, we noted that there was a sequence similarity between the region around T2122 in Notch1 ICD and the region neighboring T58 in c-Myc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wei et al., 2005</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>), an established target threonine residue for the Eya1 threonine phosphatase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Xu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Li et al., 2017</xref>). To test the importance of T2122 in relation to Eya1 phosphatase activity and Notch1 ICD stability, we generated phospho-mimetic (T2122D) and phospho-dead (T2122A) versions of Notch1 ICD, i.e. mutant versions that mimic the phosphorylated form and which cannot be phosphorylated, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). The phospho-dead Notch1 ICD<sup>T2122A</sup> mutant could interact with Eya1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>), and its threonine phosphorylation status was not altered by Eya1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>), indicating that T2122 is the phosphorylation site targeted by Eya1. In line with this, the amount and threonine phosphorylation of in vitro phosphorylated Notch1 ICD<sup>T2122A</sup> was largely unaffected by Eya1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>).

Finally, we assessed the performance of the phospho-mimetic and phospho-dead Notch1 ICD mutants with regard to stability in response to Eya1. The results from the cycloheximide treatment experiments showed that the phospho-dead Notch1 ICD<sup>T2122A</sup> was considerably more stable (half-life = 10 hr) than control Notch1 ICD, whereas Eya1 did not significantly alter the stability of Notch1 ICD<sup>T2122A</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). In contrast, the phospho-mimetic Notch1 ICD<sup>T2122D</sup> mutant displayed a short half-life (5 hr), at par with control Notch1 ICD, and its half-life was not affected by Eya1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>).

To investigate the molecular basis of epibranchial placode cell fate decisions, we have identified Notch1 ICD as a novel substrate for Eya1 phosphatase.

The epibranchial placodes, along with the trigeminal placode, are called neurogenic placodes and are distinct from other placodes, such as the olfactory and otic placodes, which generate both neurons and non-neuronal supporting cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Beites et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Patthey et al., 2014</xref>). Previous findings in chick reveal that <italic>Sox3</italic> not only marks the classically-defined epibranchial placodes but also a larger domain that ceases to produce neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ishii et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Abu-Elmagd et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tripathi et al., 2009</xref>). In this report, we provide evidence that the epibranchial placodes generate two lineage-related cell types from a common Sox2-expressing progenitor cell pool present at around E8.0. These cells undergo a stepwise differentiation and segregation into two cell types: the previously characterized Neurog2<sup>+</sup> delaminating neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fode et al., 1998</xref>) as well as Sox2<sup>+</sup> and Fgf3<sup>+</sup> non-neuronal cells. The segregation to the neuronal and non-neuronal fates appears to be gradual. At E8.5, the placodal progenitors have already initiated the expression of <italic>Sox2, Fgf3,</italic> and <italic>Neurog2</italic>. Half a day later, the Sox2 single positive, Neurog2 single positive, and Sox2-Neurog2 double positive placodal progenitors are distributed in a salt and pepper pattern, implying that these cells may undergo a specification and differentiation process but are still intermingled. The Neurog2<sup>+</sup> population goes on to form the delaminating neurons, also taking on Islet1 expression and clusters separately from the non-neuronal progenitors (summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3U</xref>). This new bipotential model for epibranchial placode differentiation makes the epibranchial placode more similar to other cranial placodes, which seed both neuronal and supporting non-neuronal cells, such as the olfactory placodes. The findings also have an evolutionary bearing, and not only reveal a similarity to the chick epibranchial placode as discussed above, but also to a novel placode located adjacent to the geniculate placode that was recently discovered in the chick (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">O'Neill et al., 2012</xref>). This placode is also derived from Sox2<sup>+</sup> cells and gives rise to the mechanosensory paratympanic organ (PTO) in the chick middle ear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">O'Neill et al., 2012</xref>). The PTO will also delaminate neuronal precursors, indicating that in the chick, a placode with a dual fate exists. The PTO is not unique to the chick but has been found in several species of birds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Giannessi et al., 2013</xref>) and some reptiles also harbor PTO-like structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Neeser and von Bartheld, 2002</xref>), but these have not been reported in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Giannessi et al., 2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>The non-neuronal epibranchial placodal cell population regulates pharyngeal arch development</title><p>It may be asked what the function of the non-neuronal epibranchial placodal cell population is.

It appears reasonable to assume that dysregulation of Fgf signaling downstream of Eya1 and Notch plays a role for the aberrant pharyngeal arch development, as mutations in <italic>Fgfr1, Fgf8</italic> and <italic>Spry1</italic> affect these processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Trokovic et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Trokovic et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Trumpp et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Tucker et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Abu-Issa et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Simrick et al., 2011</xref>), but more work is required to precisely identify which Fgf ligand is most important. Similarly, it may be reasoned that the location of the non-neuronal placodal cells precisely where segmentation of the PA occurs would make them suitable candidates as signaling centers for this process, but additional research is required to stringently test their role in the formation of proximal PA. In addition to the geniculate placode, the petrosal and nodose placodes also consist of Sox2<sup>+</sup> and Fgf3<sup>+</sup> non-neuronal placodal cells, as well as Neurog2<sup>+</sup> neurogenic cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1F and G</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>An Eya1-Notch axis in epibranchial placode differentiation</title><p>We provide several lines of evidence that Notch acts downstream of Eya1 in craniofacial development. Firstly, Eya1 positively regulates Notch signaling activity during pharyngeal epithelium development, and in the absence of <italic>Eya1</italic>, the level of Notch1 receptor as well as expression of the Notch downstream gene <italic>Hey1</italic> was down-regulated in the pharyngeal epithelium. Secondly, ectopic expression of Notch1 ICD in Pax2-expressing cells was sufficient to rescue the PA phenotypes caused by loss of Eya1. Importantly, the phenotypic rescue by Notch1 ICD expression included restored expression of <italic>Fgf3</italic> and <italic>Spry1</italic> in the epibranchial surface, indicating that Notch1 ICD is sufficient to activate the expression of <italic>Fgf3</italic> and <italic>Spry1</italic> without <italic>Eya1</italic> in the pharyngeal ectoderm. Interestingly, expressing supra-physiological levels of Notch1 ICD, as determined by the elevated levels of <italic>Hey1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C and D</xref>) expression, did not generate a phenotype, which is in contrast to other situations of hyperactivated Notch signaling, for example in acute lymphoblastic T-cell leukemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Weng et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>Our analysis identifies specific roles for Notch signaling in the different steps of epibranchial placode differentiation. We confirm previous reports that Notch signaling exerts a negative effect on neuronal fate specification, differentiation and delamination from the epibranchial placode (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lassiter et al., 2014</xref>) as neuronal differentiation, as judged by Neurog2 and Islet1 expression, was largely ablated upon Notch1 ICD overexpression. In the neuronal differentiation program, which also requires Eya1, Notch signaling needs to be turned off in order for neurons to differentiate. As concerns the non-neuronal epibranchial cells, we define a new role for Notch in promoting the differentiation of the Sox2<sup>+</sup>/ Fgf3<sup>+</sup> cells (summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Here, Notch signaling needs to be sustained by the Eya1 threonine phosphatase activity. It will be interesting to explore whether the Eya1-Notch axis may be important also in other organs, where both Eya1 and Notch are expressed, and in support of such a notion, it has been observed that in the developing lung epithelium of <italic>Eya1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> embryos, the expression of Notch1 ICD, <italic>Hes1,</italic> and <italic>Hes5</italic> was reduced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">El-Hashash et al., 2011</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Eya1 positively regulates Notch signaling via dephosphorylation of Notch1 ICD</title><p>We provide evidence that Eya1 acts as threonine phosphatase for Notch1 ICD, and while a number of kinases responsible for phosphorylating Notch ICDs have been identified, including CDK8, GSK3β, NEMO, aPKC and PIM kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Foltz et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fryer et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ishitani et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sjöqvist et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Santio et al., 2016</xref>), this is to the best of our knowledge the first demonstration of a phosphatase acting on Notch ICD. Notch1 ICD interacts with the C-terminal domain of Eya1, which harbors the threonine kinase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Li et al., 2017</xref>). The target site for the Eya1 threonine phosphatase activity is likely to be T2122 in Notch1 ICD, as the phospho-dead Notch1 ICD<sup>T2122A</sup> mutant was not dephosphorylated by Eya1. Furthermore, the sequence composition around T2122 in Notch is strikingly similar to a domain in Myc, which harbors a threonine residue (T58) that is also dephosphorylated by Eya1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Xu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Li et al., 2017</xref>). The notion that dephosphorylation by Eya1 positively affects Notch1 ICD stability is supported by several lines of evidence. Notch1 ICD half-life was considerably enhanced by the presence of Eya1 and conversely, <italic>Eya1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> embryos showed reduced levels of the Notch1 receptor, accompanied by reduced expression of the Notch downstream gene <italic>Hey1</italic>. Eya1 is likely to exert an effect also on the full length Notch1 receptor, as the amount of Notch1 receptor was elevated after Eya1 stimulation under conditions when γ-secretase-mediated cleavage was blocked. Mutations in Eya1 that affect the threonine phosphatase activity in the C-terminal region or substrate-interacting domains in the N-terminal region failed to prolong the half-life of Notch1 ICD. Furthermore, the phospho-dead version of Notch1 ICD (Notch1 ICD<sup>T2122A</sup>) showed enhanced stability and was not affected by Eya1, whereas a phospho-mimetic mutant (Notch1 ICD<sup>T2122D</sup>) was short-lived, both in the presence and absence of Eya1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Collectively, these data provide a strong correlation between the phosphorylation status at T2122 and Notch1 ICD stability.</p><p>The identification of Eya1 as a phosphatase for T2122 raises the question of the nature of the kinase phosphorylating this site. The sequences around T2122 in Notch1 ICD are quite similar to sequences in Myc, cyclin E and c-Jun (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wei et al., 2005</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B</xref>), and the threonine residues at the positions corresponding to T2122 in Myc and c-Jun can be phosphorylated by GSK3β (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Welcker et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wei et al., 2005</xref>). This makes GSK3β a strong candidate as a kinase for T2122 in Notch1 ICD and GSK3β has indeed been shown to phosphorylate Notch ICDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Foltz et al., 2002</xref>). The conserved domain around T2122 also constitutes a binding site for the Fbw7 E3 ubiquitin ligase in c-Jun where phosphorylation of the corresponding threonine residue in the c-Jun phosphodegron motif stimulates ubiquitination and proteasome-mediated degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wei et al., 2005</xref>). We therefore propose that dephosphorylation of T2122 by Eya1 leads to decreased ubiquitination and therefore enhanced stability of Notch1 ICD.</p><p>In conclusion, our data shed new light onto the process of PA and epibranchial placode differentiation by providing evidence for a non-neuronal developmental trajectory from the epibranchial placodes. The non-neuronal epibranchial placodal cells are important for PA and cleft formation and link the placodal and PA developmental processes. The data also reveal that this more complex differentiation program in the epibranchial placodes is regulated by a novel Eya1-Notch axis and Notch1 ICD phosphorylation status.</p></sec></sec><sec

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Marianne Bronner as the Senior and Reviewing Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Jean-Pierre Saint-Jeannet (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Senior Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission. We have included the full reviews since there was some discrepancy between the opinions of the reviewers and we felt this might be helpful.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors investigate the role of Eya1 in epibranchial and pharyngeal arch development in the mouse. Using Eya1 knock out mice combined with marker analysis and lineage tracing, the results suggest that epibranchial placodes generate two different cell populations: neurons and non-neuronal cells both of which arise from Sox2<sup>+</sup> progenitors. The authors find that Notch signaling is downstream of Eya1 and provides a molecular mechanism in which Eya1 phosphatase activity regulates Notc1 ICd stability.</p><p>It has been assumed that some cells in the epibranchial placodes do not form neurons, and some of these non-neurogenic domains were known. However, this is the first study to use multiple markers to explore this region and demonstrates a unique genetic requirement for its integrity. Unfortunately, their model the authors present has a number of big holes, and even their marker characterization of the non-neural domain ignores some of the gene expression that their own figures show. The paper needs to provide a clearer sense of what is actually going on in this non-neurogenic region – what/where is the relevant Notch ligand, as well as reconcile their model with known data (e.g. the lack of a pharyngeal phenotype in FGF3 nulls).</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors need to show additional genotypes from their crosses in some of the figures. They should have these mice already, so additional images of these should be included.</p><p>2) What is the ligand that is activating Notch1 during the decision between Ngn2-expressing neurogenic placode tissue and Sox2/FGF3-expressing non-neural ectoderm? Dll1 is only expressed in delaminating neuroblasts – well away from the pharyngeal ectoderm – and Jag1 is only expressed in the pouch region. Either there is another Notch ligand responsible for activation of the Hes/Hey genes in the arch ectoderm, or else another signal (such as FGF3 or 8) may be activating these genes. Moreover, Sox2 and FGF3 only label the anterior (&quot;rostral-proximal pharyngeal&quot; as defined by the authors) ectoderm of each arch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2M and S</xref>), yet the Notch target genes Hes1 and Hey1 are expressed throughout the arch ectoderm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I and K</xref>). Finally, there appears to be very little Notch-ICD staining in the rostral-proximal pharyngeal compared to the arch mesenchyme adjacent to it, both in the wild type embryos and mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B, B</xref>' and D, D'). This may again indicate that other signals might be activating the Hes/Hey genes in this region.</p><p>3) There is some confusion in the results between whether Eya1 is modifying and regulating the cleaved Notch1 ICD and the intact Notch1 receptor. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C-D</xref> shows that the amount of Notch C20 staining decreases dramatically in the Eya1 mutants, and the authors conclude this suggests &quot;that the total amount of Notch1 receptor was reduced in the ectodermal cells rather than that receptor cleavage was affected.&quot; However, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>, the focus is on Eya1 modification and stabilization of the cleaved form. Is it possible that Eya1's threonine phosphatase activity regulates the stability of both the intact Notch1 receptor and its ICD?</p><p>4) In the rescue experiment in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, the over-expression of Notch-ICD activates Sox2 in the entire arch ectoderm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5K, M</xref>) but not in the Eya1 mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5L, N</xref>). This does not fit in with the model of Eya1-stabilized Notch signaling promoting Sox2 expression in the rostral-proximal pharyngeal ectoderm. The authors need to consider/explain this result, as they don't mention it at all in the text. Part of the problem in interpreting this experiment is that the authors need to show wild type and <italic>Eya1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> embryos as well as the <italic>Pax2-Cre</italic>; ROSA-N1ICD and <italic>Pax2-Cre</italic>; ROSA-N1ICD;<italic>Eya1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> images in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>.</p><p>5) The biggest issue is that the model has many holes, and the authors need to figure out a way of either plugging the holes or simplifying the model. They should provide a clearer sense of what is going on in this non-neurogenic region – what/where is the relevant Notch ligand, etc., as well as reconcile their model with known data (e.g. the lack of a pharyngeal phenotype in FGF3 nulls).</p><p>6) In the Discussion, the authors attribute their arch phenotype to a loss of FGF3: &quot;Therefore, one can assume that phenotypes observed only in <italic>Eya1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> embryos can be attributed to the non-neuronal epibranchial placode, and more specifically to the lack of <italic>Fgf3</italic> expression&quot; and: &quot;The failure to organize the PA architecture in the <italic>Eya1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> embryos are likely due to defective FGF signaling&quot;. FGF3 mutant mice do not have a clear arch phenotype. Ectoderm-specific FGF8 mutants have an arch phenotype that is much more severe than Eya1 mutants. The authors need to change these parts of the discussion as it impacts their model.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>This study investigates the role of Eya1 in epibranchial and pharyngeal arch development in mouse. In particular, the authors use Eya1 knock out mice combined with marker analysis, lineage tracing to suggest that epibranchial placodes generate two different cell populations, neurons and non-neuronal cells. They claim that both arise from Sox2<sup>+</sup> progenitors, and that the non-neural cells expressing various FGF ligands, are a so far not discovered cell population and act as a signaling centre to patter the pharyngeal arches. They show that Notch signaling, a mediator of neurogenesis, is downstream of Eya1 and provide a molecular mechanism in which Eya1 phosphatase activity regulates Notc1 ICd stability. Overall, they make three claims: i) discovery of a new cell population, the non-neural derivatives of epibranchial placodes; ii) the signaling centre activity of these cells with FGFs as mediators; iii) Notch activity regulation by Eya1 through regulating phosphorylation, NICD stability/degradation.</p><p>The strongest part of the paper are the biochemical experiments presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>, which provide new insight into how Eya1 interacts with the Notch pathway, how Notch signaling is regulated and the integration of key factors in placode development (Eya1) and downstream signaling. Thus, the evidence presented for the 3rd claim is solid and novel.</p><p>However, the other two points are do not provide any novelty and / or are not supported by the authors' data.</p><p>1) The authors argue that they have uncovered a 'novel lineage-related non-neural' derivative of epibranchial placodes, in addition to the neurogenic cells. Epibranchial placodes are focal thickenings, which in a Notch-Delta lateral inhibition mediated manner generate neurons. To the best of my knowledge there is no claim in the literature that <italic>all</italic> epibranchial cells form neurons, but rather that all are competent and only some do, and this is evidenced by studies showing individual delaminating cells. So, the authors do not discover a new cell population that is derived from Sox2<sup>+</sup> progenitor cells, but simply describe those cells that remain in the ectoderm. This is not a novel finding, but seems to give a name to cells that are known to exist.</p><p>They claim that this novel domain is Sox2/Fgf3 positive, while the neurogenic domain is Sox2/Ngn2 +. However, looking at the data provided in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> this does not seem to be the case and FGF3 expression appears to encompass both Ngn2 + and – regions (see below), contradicting their notion that these are two different regions or cells with different identities.</p><p>2) The authors claim that these cells act as an FGF3<sup>+</sup> signaling centre important for pharyngeal arch development. First, they do not provide any evidence that this region acts as a signaling centre beyond showing that it expresses various FGF ligands, and second the fact that FGF activity is important in this context from the ectoderm as well as from the endoderm is already known (e.g. findings from the Partanen, Scambler, Basson, Kimmel groups).

In this manuscript, Zhang and colleagues describe the unique function of Eya1 in the development of epibranchial placodes and proximal pharyngeal arches (PA). Unlike Six1 mutants, Eya1 deficient embryos exhibit hypoplastic 2nd and 3rd PA, defective pharyngeal clefts and pouches formation, and failure to express Ngn2 in epibranchial placode cells. The PA phenotype can be traced back to a previously unrecognized non-neuronal lineage derived from the epibranchial placode region and acting as a signaling center to pattern the PA. The authors provide evidence that Eya1 directs the development of this non-neuronal epibranchial placode lineage through Notch signaling by promoting Notch1 ICD stabilization via Eya1 phosphatase activity.</p><p>The manuscript makes an important contribution to the field. The overall quality of the work is superb, combining mouse genetics and biochemical analyses.

We believe this is the case, in particular for Hes1. When we revisit our data in the light of this comment, we agree that while Hes1 is downregulated in the epithelium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4K, L</xref>), the western blot data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4M</xref>) indicate that Hes1 is not subjected to a robust downregulation in the wider region of the pharyngeal arch tissue used for the Western blot experiment. This suggests that other factors may regulate Hes1 in the pharyngeal arches, for example Hes1 acts downstream of Tbx1, which is expressed in the mesoderm of the pharyngeal arches (van Bueren et al., 2010). This line of reasoning is also in agreement with the original paper on the CSL (RBPJk) knockout mouse (de la Pompa et al., 1997), which shows that Hes1 expression is not downregulated upon ablation of CSL or Notch1 in E9.0 mouse embryos.

To address this, we have conducted new cell transfection experiments, using both full length receptor constructs as well as a truncated but membrane-tethered form of Notch1 (Notch1ΔE). The results show that Eya1 affects not only Notch1 ICD, but also full length and Notch1ΔE. Technically, we blocked γ-secretase cleavage (DAPT) prior to Eya1 addition, to make sure that we primarily measured full length Notch1 and Notch1ΔE proteins that were “locked” in the membrane prior to S3 cleavage.

They should provide a clearer sense of what is going on in this non-neurogenic region – what/where is the relevant Notch ligand, etc., as well as reconcile their model with known data (e.g. the lack of a pharyngeal phenotype in FGF3 nulls).</p></disp-quote><p>These are important points, and we agree that our original model in some regards fell short of summarizing the actual data. We have addressed this concern by both providing additional data to support the model, but also tone down certain aspects of the model. To strengthen the model, we have studied the mode of Notch activation further (i.e. which ligands and downstream genes that are activated, see above), and we also provided additional data that FGF signaling indeed is activated downstream of Notch. We agree with the reviewer that Fgf3 is not necessarily the mediator, based on the Fgf3<sup>-/-</sup> phenotype and redundant functions with other Fgfs that are co-expressed in the pharyngeal region. FGF signaling is however important for epibranchial placode and pharyngeal arch development, as mutations in Fgfr1 and Fgf8 lead to dysregulated development (Trokovic et al., 2003; Abu-Issa et al., 2002; Trumpp et al., 1999; Tucker et al., 1999), and in the revised version, we show that Spry1 (Sprouty1; which is a proxy for downstream FGF signaling) is reduced in the <italic>Eya1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> embryos, and that Spry1 expression is restored upon Notch1 ICD expression in an <italic>Eya1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> background, arguing that Notch regulates FGF signaling output independent of Eya1. Importantly, this is not a consequence of altered FGF receptor expression levels, as Fgfr1 expression is not affected by Eya1. With regard to toning down the model, we have omitted the reference to the signaling center in the original model (and in the Discussion), as we admittedly cannot yet tell which FGF (or other morphogens) that may be at work. As also discussed with reviewer 1, we have also toned down the discussion on the non-neuronal cells as a new placode and we now refer to them as “non-neuronal cell population” in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> (and the text). We would however like to keep the schematic drawing of the molecular mechanism linking Eya1 and Notch, as we believe this is a central part of the paper, and also well supported by data. By providing additional data and making these amendments to the model, we feel that the revised model is not overstretching the data, but summarizes the key findings in a succinct way.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) In the Discussion, the authors attribute their arch phenotype to a loss of FGF3: &quot;Therefore, one can assume that phenotypes observed only in Eya1<sup>-/-</sup> 527 embryos can be attributed to the non-neuronal epibranchial placode, and more specifically to the lack of Fgf3 expression&quot; and: &quot;The failure to organize the PA architecture in the Eya1<sup>-/-</sup> 547 embryos are likely due to defective FGF signaling&quot;.

Epibranchial placodes are focal thickenings, which in a Notch-Delta lateral inhibition mediated manner generate neurons. To the best of my knowledge there is no claim in the literature that all epibranchial cells form neurons, but rather that all are competent and only some do, and this is evidenced by studies showing individual delaminating cells. So, the authors do not discover a new cell population that is derived from Sox2<sup>+</sup> progenitor cells, but simply describe those cells that remain in the ectoderm. This is not a novel finding, but seems to give a name to cells that are known to exist.</p></disp-quote><p>We accept the critique and agree that there is precedence for non-neuronal cells, but that the current literature has not addressed the fates of the epibranchial placodal cells comprehensively. We have now cited examples of non-neuronal cells. Notably, and as also discussed in Essential revisions above, we include references regarding non-classically defined epibranchial placode populations in chick (Abu-Elmagd et al., 2001; Ishii et al., 2001; Tripathi et al., 2009). We have amended the text to hopefully present a more balanced discussion of this topic (subsection “The discovery of a non-neuronal epibranchial cell population reveals a bipotential differentiation program in epibranchial placodes”). In the light of including the earlier literature on non-neuronal differentiation, we have decided to not refer to the non-neuronal cells as a novel type of placode, but as a lineage-related non-neuronal cell population from the epibranchial placodes. The text has been changed in accordance with this, both in the Title, Abstract, Introduction, Results and Discussion as well as in the summary figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). We however still believe that we add to the literature with regard to cell lineages from the epibranchial placodes, and that our study improves our understanding of the molecular basis for lineage segregation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>They claim that this novel domain is Sox2/Fgf3 positive, while the neurogenic domain is Sox2/Ngn2 +.

We have now provided better whole mount and matched section data to show the expression of the three genes, but still the visualization of combinations of Sox2/Ngn2/Fgf3 is complicated by the fact that there are no good antibodies to Fgf3, which therefore is analyzed by in situ hybridization for Fgf3, combined with IHC for Ngn2 and Sox2. We agree with the reviewer that at 8-15ss, the Sox2<sup>+</sup>/Fgf3<sup>+</sup> domain overlaps with the Ngn2+ region. We believe the gradual restriction of the Ngn2+ and Sox2<sup>+</sup>/Fgf3+ cell populations by E9.5 (25ss) is quite clear.

The model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> has also been modified and toned down in accordance with these changes (see also point 5 and 6 under Essential revisions).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In sum, I think the data of the paper is very solid, but at the moment I think their interpretation and model is incomplete.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate these positive comments, and the model has been amended.</p></body></sub-article></article>
