cannot be cured because the virus persists as integrated proviral DNA in long-lived cells despite years of suppressive antiretroviral therapy (ART). In a previous paper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Zanini et al, 2015</xref>) we documented HIV-1 evolution in 10 untreated patients. Here we characterize establishment, turnover, and evolution of viral DNA reservoirs in the same patients after 3–18 years of suppressive ART. A median of 14% (range 0–42%) of the DNA sequences were defective due to G-to-A hypermutation. Remaining DNA sequences showed no evidence of evolution over years of suppressive ART. Most sequences from the DNA reservoirs were very similar to viruses actively replicating in plasma (RNA sequences) shortly before start of ART. The results do not support persistent HIV-1 replication as a mechanism to maintain the HIV-1 reservoir during suppressive therapy. Rather, the data indicate that DNA variants are turning over as long as patients are untreated and that suppressive ART halts this turnover.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.18889.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.18889.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>HIV</kwd><kwd>cure</kwd><kwd>evolution</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Virus</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Stg. 260686</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Neher</surname><given-names>Richard A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004359</institution-id><institution>Vetenskapsrådet</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>K2014-57X-09935</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Albert</surname><given-names>Jan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Building on previous work (Zanini et al, 2015), deep-sequencing is used to show that HIV persistence during suppressive antiretroviral therapy, the main hurdle for HIV cure, is due to homeostatic proliferation and longevity of infected cells rather than ongoing virus replication.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) has had significant effects on the morbidity and mortality associated with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection. ART very effectively suppresses active virus replication, but it cannot eradicate the infection because HIV-1 persists as integrated proviral DNA in long-lived cells that constitute a virus reservoir. Latently infected resting memory CD4+ T-lymphocytes (memory CD4 cells) represent the most solidly documented HIV-1 reservoir (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Eriksson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chun et al., 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">1995</xref>). Fully functional integrated HIV-1 proviruses are present in a small fraction of memory CD4 cells. These cells do not produce virus when they are in a resting state, but can be induced to produce virus upon activation in vitro and in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Eriksson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chun et al., 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Massanella and Richman, 2016</xref>). The activation state of the infected cell and the viral encoded Tat feedback loop jointly determine latency and virus production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Razooky et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rouzine et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Because of their importance to development of a cure for HIV-1 infection, many methods to quantify HIV-1 reservoirs have been developed. The quantitative virus outgrowth assay (QVOA) has been the ‘gold standard’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">von Stockenstrom et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Massanella and Richman, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bruner et al., 2015</xref>), but recent studies have revealed that this assay greatly underestimates the true size of the functional reservoir (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ho et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bruner et al., 2016</xref>). In contrast, PCR-based assays overestimate the size of the functional reservoir because they cannot distinguish between replication-competent and defective viral genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">von Stockenstrom et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Massanella and Richman, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bruner et al., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">2016</xref>). Many defective proviruses contain large internal deletions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ho et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sanchez et al., 1997</xref>). Defective proviruses also result from APOBEC editing, which induces G-to-A hypermutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Yu et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kieffer et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Stopak et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bruner et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>The HIV-1 reservoir is established early during primary infection and is remarkably quantitatively and qualitatively stable. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Siliciano et al. (2003)</xref> found a 44-month half-life for latently infected cells capable of producing replication-competent virus in the QVOA. Similarly, HIV-1 DNA levels and genetic compositions are very stable in patients receiving long-term suppressive ART (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">von Stockenstrom et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Besson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Josefsson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kearney et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Günthard et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Evering et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kieffer et al., 2004</xref>). Early ART reduces the reservoir’s size and genetic complexity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chomont et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Josefsson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lori et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Strain et al., 2005</xref>). Most studies suggest that the HIV-1 reservoir is maintained by the physiological homeostasis of memory CD4 cells that in part involves occasional expansion and contraction of individual CD4 cell clones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">von Stockenstrom et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chomont et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">2009</xref>). However, the results of some studies have suggested that persistent virus replication may be an important contributor to the maintenance of the HIV-1 reservoir (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Buzón et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Yukl et al., 2010</xref>). Recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lorenzo-Redondo et al. (2016)</xref> reported evidence of rapid HIV-1 evolution in lymphoid tissue reservoirs.</p><p>Despite their significance for HIV-1 cure efforts, relatively little is known about the pre-ART establishment and turnover of the HIV-1 reservoir. In this study, we characterized the establishment and maintenance of the HIV-1 DNA reservoirs in 10 patients. We previously studied the evolution of HIV-1 in these patients before ART by whole genome deep-sequencing of HIV-1 RNA in longitudinal plasma samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Zanini et al., 2015</xref>). We now sequenced HIV-1 DNA from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from these patients after many years of suppressive ART and compared these reservoir DNA sequences with the replicating HIV populations that were present before ART. The collection dates of all available samples relative to start of treatment are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18889.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Sampling times before and after start of suppressive antiretroviral therapy.</title><p>For each study participant, the thick grey bar indicates the period of untreated HIV-1 replication.

The absence of genetic changes indicates that viral evolution and replication are not important mechanisms for the maintenance of HIV-1 reservoirs during supressive ART. We also found that the variants that were replicating shortly before start of ART were overrepresented in the HIV-1 DNA reservoirs. This excess of late variants in the DNA reservoirs indicated that proviral HIV-1 variants continued to turn over with a half-life of approximately one year until the patients began therapy. ART effectively froze the composition of the HIV-1 DNA reservoir in the state it had at start of therapy.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Patients and samples</title><p>The study population consisted of 10 HIV-1 infected patients who were diagnosed in Sweden between 1990 and 2003.

Longitudinal PBMC samples (1–3 samples per patient for up to a 2.6-year period) were obtained 3–18 years after the start of suppressive ART (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). We defined viral DNA reservoirs as HIV-1 p17gag sequences that were still present in PBMCs after at least 2 years of suppressive ART. HIV-1 DNA template numbers were quantified by limiting dilution by the same p17gag PCR that was used for sequencing. Identical p17gag sequences were merged into haplotypes while preserving their abundance. Minor haplotypes were merged with major haplotypes if they differed by one mutation (see Materials and methods section). Processed sequence data are available at hiv.tuebingen.mpg.de.

Instead these changes can create an impression of ‘backward’ evolution towards older HIV variants due the preferential pruning of later variants.</p><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lorenzo-Redondo et al. (2016)</xref> investigated HIV-1 DNA sequences in tissue and PBMC samples, but we only examined PBMC samples. However, Lorenzo-Redondo et al. found similar rates in PBMC compared to tissue samples. Furthermore, tissue and blood HIV-1 DNA variants should be well-mixed during the time period that we investigated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Josefsson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">von Stockenstrom et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lorenzo-Redondo et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Both <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lorenzo-Redondo et al. (2016)</xref> and we studied DNA sequences in HIV-1 reservoirs, which contain high proportions of defective virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ho et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bruner et al., 2016</xref>). The absence of provirus evolution or turnover does not fully exclude the possibility that there was replication and evolution of replication-competent viruses present in the reservoirs. However, if such replication occurred, it involved a minority of infected cells and occurred below the detection limit of the deep-sequencing method. To enrich for replication-competent and putatively evolving virus, QVOA followed by sequencing of virus released into the supernatant should be performed, not sequencing the total HIV-1 DNA (as done by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lorenzo-Redondo et al. [2016]</xref>, us, and others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Josefsson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kieffer et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Evering et al., 2012</xref>]). Our finding of genetic stability in the DNA reservoirs is consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Josefsson et al. (2013)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">von Stockenstrom et al. (2015)</xref>. They found that defective HIV-1 DNA integrants present during long-term effective ART appear to be maintained by proliferation and longevity of infected cells and not by ongoing viral replication.</p><p>We had detailed longitudinal data on the evolution of the plasma HIV-1 RNA population from the time of infection to the start of suppressive ART. Therefore, we could determine the time at which the viruses in the DNA reservoirs had been deposited (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and supplements). We found that a majority of the variants present in the HIV-1 DNA reservoirs were derived from HIV-1 RNA variants that had replicated during the last year before the start of suppressive ART. In contrast, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Frenkel et al. (2003)</xref> reported the persistence of greater numbers of earlier versus more recent virus variants in a few children receiving suppressive ART. We found a similar, but much less prominent, presence of variants replicating during the first 6 months post-infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, panel B). These early variants were overrepresented relative to the expected level if deposition had been uniform over time. This overrepresentation could be due to the high viral load present during primary HIV-1 infection and is consistent with results by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bruner et al. (2016)</xref>, who found that defective proviruses rapidly accumulate during acute HIV-1 infection. However, we observed such an excess of early variants in only 5 out 10 patients.</p><p>Defective HIV-1 proviruses are unique in vivo labels of individual memory CD4 cell clones. Similar to the sequencing of T-cell receptors, these labels can be used to track the fates of the memory CD4 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Robins, 2013</xref>). This strategy was used by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Imamichi et al. (2014)</xref>, who found that a T-cell clone carrying a defective HIV-1 provirus can persist for &gt;17 years. Similarly, prenatally formed T-cell receptors shared by twins have lifetimes that are &gt;30 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Pogorelyy et al., 2016</xref>). Our results are consistent with such long T-cell life times once HIV replication is suppressed by ART. In untreated infection, however, we estimate much faster turnover of infected cells with a half-life of approximately one year. This conclusion is based on the observation that most HIV-1 DNA sequences derive from replicating virus shortly before the start of ART. The results of earlier studies, which were based on different types of CD4 cell labelling, have indicated that CD4 cell die at a 3- to 4-fold increased rate in untreated HIV-1-infected patients, compared with uninfected individuals and with patients receiving suppressive ART (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hellerstein et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">McCune et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ribeiro et al., 2002</xref>). The more dramatic difference that we observed might be due to that earlier studies estimated lifespans of individual cells, whereas we estimated the lifespans of CD4 cell clones carrying defective proviruses (i.e., infected cells and their daughter cells).</p><p>Our study had several limitations. We did not sort cells and therefore could not investigate whether there were differences in HIV-1 turnover rates between different types and subsets of cells (e.g., memory CD4 cells and their subsets). However, it is reasonable to assume that most of our HIV-1 DNA sequences were from memory CD4+ T-lymphocytes because others have found that these cells are the main HIV-1 reservoir (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Eriksson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chun et al., 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">1995</xref>). Because we sequenced a relatively short region of the HIV-1 genome, we could not reliably distinguish between replication-competent and defective viruses. We did not find evidence of evolution in proviral DNA sequences, but we cannot rule out the possibility that a small subset of viruses was replicating and remained undetected among the many defective viruses. However, our analyses of the composition and turnover of the virus reservoir were aided by the fact that most of the viruses were defective because these proviruses acted as inert in vivo labels of CD4 cell clones. We observed large variations in the abundance of sequence haplotypes that likely indicate the presence of clonal expansions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Josefsson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">von Stockenstrom et al., 2015</xref>), independent integrations of identical sequences, and resampling of the same original DNA templates during sequencing. Given our sequencing method, we could not determine the relative contributions of these mechanisms. We are using Primer ID sequencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jabara et al., 2011</xref>) to better understand the in vivo dynamics of different viral haplotypes. Analysis of HIV integration sites represents an alternative method of clonal expansion identification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Maldarelli et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cohn et al., 2015</xref>). However, such analysis was not possible for us because we did not sequence the extreme ends of the LTRs. We analyzed p17gag because it was part of our plasma HIV RNA dataset and because it has sufficient genetic diversity to allow for accurate and valid comparisons between plasma RNA and PBMC DNA HIV populations. Results from several analyses suggested that clonal expansion did not affect our results in a qualitative manner. Clonal expansion would have resulted in artefactual over-representation of some sequences. To control for this, we repeated the analyses in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref> and counted each haplotype only once. We obtained very similar results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). Consistent with our results and interpretation, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cohn et al. (2015)</xref> found only a limited decrease in single integrations following the start of ART (from approximately 70 to 50%).</p><p>In summary, we found compelling evidence against persistent viral replication as a mechanism to maintain the latent HIV-1 DNA reservoir during suppressive therapy. We also found that most of the latently infected cells present during long-term suppressive ART were infected shortly before the start of ART, and that T-cell turnover slowed down dramatically when ART began.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Ethical statement</title><p>The study was performed according to Declaration of Helsinki requirements.

The patients were selected based on the following inclusion criteria: (1) A relatively well-defined time of infection (based on a negative HIV antibody test &lt;2 years before a first positive test or a laboratory-documented primary HIV infection); (2) No ART during a minimum period of approximately 5 years after diagnosis; (3) Availability of biobank plasma samples covering this time period; and (4) Later initiation of successful ART (plasma viral levels &lt;50 copies/ml) for ≥2 years. As previously described, 6–12 plasma samples per patient were retrieved from biobanks and used for full-genome HIV-1 RNA sequencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Zanini et al., 2015</xref>). The same patient nomenclature was used in both studies. For this study, the same 10 patients were asked to donate 70 ml fresh EDTA-treated blood on up to three occasions during a 2.5-year period. These blood samples were obtained 3–18 years after the start of successful ART. The clinical and laboratory findings (including Fiebig staging and BED testing) were used to calculate the EDI, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Zanini et al., 2015</xref>).

The extracted RNA was amplified using a one-step RT-PCR, outer primers for six overlapping regions, and Superscript III One-Step RT-PCR with Platinum Taq High Fidelity High Enzyme Mix (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California, US). An optimized Illumina Nextera XT library preparation protocol and a kit from the same supplier were used to build the DNA libraries, which were sequenced using an Illumina MiSeq instrument and 2 × 250 bp or 2 × 300 bp sequencing kits (MS-102–2003/MS-10–3003). For the present study, a section of the p17gag region of the HIV-1 genome was extracted from the full-genome RNA data set.

Total DNA was extracted from the PBMCs using the OMEGA E.Z.N.A Blood DNA Mini Kit (Omega Bio-Tek, Norcross, Georgia) or the QIAamp DNA Blood Mini Kit (Qiagen GmbH, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The amount of DNA was measured using a Qubit dsDNA HS Assay Kit (Invitrogen, Eugene, Oregon, USA). Patient-specific nested primers (Integrated DNA Technologies) were used to amplify a 387 bp long portion of the p17gag gene corresponding to positions 787 to 1173 in the HxB2 reference sequence. The primers were designed based on the plasma RNA sequences from each patient (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Outer primers and Platinum Taq DNA Polymerase High Fidelity (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California, US) were used for the first PCR. The protocol began with a denaturation step at 94°C for 2 min followed by 15 PCR cycles of denaturation at 94°C for 20 s, annealing at 50°C for 20 s, extension at 72°C for 30 s, and a final extension step at 72°C for 6 min. For the second PCR, 2.5 μl of the product from the first PCR was amplified using inner primers and the cycle profile and enzyme as for the first PCR. Amplified DNA was purified using Agencourt AMPure XP (Beckman Coulter, Beverly, Massachusetts) and quantified using Qubit. For each sample, the number of HIV-1 DNA templates used for sequencing was roughly quantified in triplicate by limiting dilution using the same PCR conditions, three dilutions (usually 0.5 µg, 0.1 µg, 0.02 µg DNA), and Poisson statistics. The plasmids NL4-3 and SF162 were used for control experiments, which were performed to evaluate PCR-induced recombination. Equal proportions of the plasmids were spiked into human DNA and were amplified using the same PCR conditions as previously described. The results revealed that there was minimal PCR-induced recombination in this short amplicon.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Sequencing and read processing</title><p>The HIV-specific primers were flanked by NexteraXT adapters. To construct sequencing libraries, indices and sequencing primers were added in 12–15 cycles of additional PCR. The amplicons were sequenced using an Illumina MiSeq instrument and 2 × 250 cycle kits. A total of 6500 to 190,000 (median 35,000) paired-end reads were generated per sample. The overlapping paired-end sequencing reads were merged to create synthetic reads spanning the entire p17gag amplicon. The nucleotide on the read with the higher quality score was used for the cases of disagreement between paired reads. We counted the numbers of times a particular p17gag sequence was observed, and performed subsequent analysis using read-abundance pairs. To reduce the effects of sequencing and PCR errors, we combined rare sequences (below frequency 0.002) with common sequences if they differed at no more than one position. Specifically, starting with the rarest sequences, we merged rare sequences with the most common sequence that was one base away. The cutoff value of 0.002 is the typical error frequency of the pipeline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Zanini et al., 2015</xref>). Less than 1 in 1000 reads that began with the HIV specific primer sequence could not be assigned with confidence to the previously determined RNA sequences.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Arup Chakraborty as the Senior Editor, and he also served as the Reviewing Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>You have carried out a nice study of HIV evolution in patients prior to and after initiation of antiretroviral therapy. You show that the virus continues to evolve until ART is started. During ART, there is no further evolution. This conclusion is consistent with many previous studies. Although most studies of HIV evolution during ART have concluded that ART stops viral replication and thus halts evolution, a recent Nature paper by Wolinsky and colleagues provided some evidence for continuing evolution. Thus, the current paper is timely. The issue is of particular importance with regard to finding a cure for HIV investigation. Most investigators believe that the real barrier to cure is a stable latent reservoir. However, the finding that evolution is still occurring during ART would suggest that an additional problem is inadequate suppression of viral replication. The demonstration that evolution is halted strongly favors the idea that reservoirs are the barrier to cure, not inadequate ART. For these reasons, we think that the paper is likely to be accepted, provided the following comments are addressed.</p><p>1) You analyzed gag sequences in proviral DNA. However, it is not clear that most proviruses are profoundly defective. Even if the gag gene can be successfully amplified, there are likely to be defects elsewhere in the genome in many of the sequences. How does this affect the phylogenetic analysis? Is it appropriate to treat defective and replication-competent viral species the same way in such analyses? Some discussion of this issue would be helpful.</p><p>2) Paragraph 2 in Introduction (on QVOA) is difficult to understand. First, none of the QVOA information is used later in the text. The study quantifies neither the number of defective viruses nor the size of the reservoir. Second, while this is a matter of scholarship, the statement about PHA partial stimulation is problematic. There is no evidence that PHA in culture results in partial T-cell activation. The cited paper, Ho et al. 2013 only shows that there is partial HIV reactivation in culture, not the mechanism of how it arises. Partial reactivation of HIV may be due to intrinsic properties of the virus and should also be mentioned (Razooky et al. 2015, Rouzine et al. 2015).</p><p>3) A very strong part of the study is the comparison between HIV DNA post-ART and the HIV RNA pre-ART.

It is a little difficult to understand particularly panels A versus B.

Neither of these are small numbers given the half-lives (time period without ART shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) and given the previous panel showing most sequences came from just before ART.

The counter argument that will in all likelihood be used to rebut and limit this work as definitive is the classic &quot;lack of data&quot; argument (i.e., demonstrating that changes in the viral sequence occurred as a result of viral evolution is typically easier since there can be presence of signal in the sequence that appears to show such changes, as in Lorenzo-Redondo et al; in contrast, lack of data is always less conclusive because, for several reasons, this signal may have been missed, and the authors state this in the text. However, by comparison to the Lorenzo-Redondo study, the data here has more patients and time points but does not have multiple organs. It would be helpful if it is pointed out how much evolution was observed in Lorenzo-Redondo et al. PBMC data, in how many patients, and then show how unlikely or likely it would be for them to have not seen it. If Lorenzo-Redondo et al. see it in PBMC data and the results here do not, why would that be? Also, in the second paragraph of their Discussion, the authors point out that Lorenzo-Redondo et al. report a higher than normal rate of evolution.

However, it is not clear that most proviruses are profoundly defective. Even if the gag gene can be successfully amplified, there are likely to be defects elsewhere in the genome in many of the sequences. How does this affect the phylogenetic analysis? Is it appropriate to treat defective and replication-competent viral species the same way in such analyses? Some discussion of this issue would be helpful.</italic> </p><p>It is true that most proviruses are likely to be defective. The dominating forms of inactivating genetic changes are large deletions and hypermutation. This has been fully explained in the Introduction (second paragraph) where we also have added a new reference (Bruner et al. Nature Med 2016;22:1043). In our analyses we identified hypermutated sequences and performed analyses with and without these sequences, with very similar overall results (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref> and elsewhere). You correctly state that with our sequencing method with we cannot identify sequences with deletions outside of the p17gag target region. This is a limitation of our study that we address in the Discussion: “Because we sequenced a relatively short region of the HIV-1 genome, we could not reliably distinguish between replication-competent and defective viruses. We did not find evidence of evolution in proviral DNA sequences, but we cannot rule out the possibility that a small subset of viruses was replicating and remained undetected among the many defective viruses.” However, apart from this caveat, the phylogenetic analyses actually are aided by defective proviruses because these sequences do not further evolve after integration. A sentence has been added to the Discussion to point this out: “However, our analyses of the composition and turnover of the virus reservoir were aided by the fact that most of the viruses were defective because these proviruses acted as inert in vivo labels of CD4 cell clones.”</p><p><italic>2) Paragraph 2 in Introduction (on QVOA) is difficult to understand. First, none of the QVOA information is used later in the text. The study quantifies neither the number of defective viruses nor the size of the reservoir. Second, while this is a matter of scholarship, the statement about PHA partial stimulation is problematic. There is no evidence that PHA in culture results in partial T-cell activation. The cited paper, Ho et al. 2013 only shows that there is partial HIV reactivation in culture, not the mechanism of how it arises. Partial reactivation of HIV may be due to intrinsic properties of the virus and should also be mentioned (Razooky et al. 2015, Rouzine et al. 2015).</italic> </p><p>We agree that it is not clear exactly why the QVOA underquantifies.</p><p>Therefore, we have rephrased the text in the Introduction (second paragraph). We have also added the references that reviewer mentions together with the recent Bruner paper mentioned above.</p><p><italic>3) A very strong part of the study is the comparison between HIV DNA post-ART and the HIV RNA pre-ART. However, there was not discussion or analysis of this. In our opinion, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> needs to be substantially 'fleshed out'.

Can you explain this so that these apparently contradictory issues are resolved?</italic> </p><p>We agree that this section of the Results (Time for deposition of reservoir HIV-1 DNA sequences) lacked clarity and important details. Therefore we have extensively rewritten this section. We have also completely revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> as well as added supplementary figures to this figure.</p><p><italic>4) A more rigorous comparison to the data in Lorenzo-Redondo et al.

Furthermore, they estimated substantial migration with mixing times smaller than 6 months between these compartments and state “We deduce that viral lineages in blood are derived from replicating virus in lymph nodes..”. Thus, we should be seeing evolved sequences in PBMC if substantial evolution had happened in lymph nodes and contributed a measurable fraction of HIV-1 DNA in PBMC. Our PBMC data derive from many more samples over a much longer time span than the data by Lorenzo-Redondo et al. Therefore, it is very unlikely that we could have missed a temporal signal of the magnitude Lorenzo-Redondo et al. report. We now include a supplementary figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>) that indicates the expected patterns of root-to-tip divergence based on the rate estimates by Lorenzo-Redondo et al.</p><p><italic>If Lorenzo-Redondo et al. see it in PBMC data and the results here do not, why would that be?

I think the authors should expand on this and specifically point out references and rates in the presence and absence of ART.</italic> </p><p>Lorenzo-Redondo estimate rates between 0.6−1.0×10<sup>-3</sup> substitutions per month and compare these rates to those reported in Lemey, P., Rambaut, A. &amp; Pybus, O. G. AIDS Rev. 8, 125140 (2006). This paper estimated a rate between 0.5 and 0.8 × 10<sup>-3</sup> per month. However, these estimates were for the C2-V5 region of gp120 using data by Shankarrappa et al., 1999. It is well-known that gag and pol evolve more slowly than gp120. Recent estimates suggest rates that are 3 to 10-fold lower (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> in Alizon and Fraser, Retrovirology 2013 or Zanini et al. 2016) than those estimated for C2V5.</p><p>As requested we have expanded the discussion of possible explanations for the opposing finding by Lorenzo-Redondo et al. and us (Discussion paragraphs #2-4). We have also added a supplementary figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>) that illustrates how analyses of samples obtained too early after start of therapy may give a false impression of rapid evolution.</p><p><italic>5) Related to the above point, why does the analysis not account for clonal expansion?

What if the sample prep or methodology are somehow dominated by clonal expansion which is why they don't capture any variation?</italic> </p><p>With our data we cannot perform the type of analysis that Maldarelli et al. and Cohn et al. performed. They analyzed integration sites and thereby obtained molecular tags for each integrant/clone. We chose to analyze p17gag because it was part of our plasma HIV RNA dataset, in contrast to the extreme ends of the LTRs, and because it had sufficient genetic diversity to allow reliable comparison between plasma RNA and PBMC DNA HIV populations. We have expanded the discussion of the pros and cons of our sequence method and data (Discussion, paragraph #7).</p><p>As pointed out in the revised Discussion, several lines of evidence suggest that clonal expansion has not affected our results in a qualitative manner. Clonal expansion would result in undue over-representation of a some sequences. To control against such expansion, we repeated the analysis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref> counting every haplotype only once, regardless of how many reads with that sequence were recovered (see supplements to these figures). By ignoring the number of times a sequence was sampled, effects of clonal expansion and PCR biases are removed. The results on the root-to-tip distances and the likely origin of the sequences are largely unchanged. Furthermore, data by Cohn et al. show only a limited decrease of single integrations following the start of ART (from about 70% to 50%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).</p><p><italic>6) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>: it is noted that most proviral sequences were assigned to a sample just before treatment.

Such aberrant reads were observed in 10 out of 30 samples and the majority of these reads mapped to the human genome. This has been clarified in the Methods section (subsection “Sequencing and read processing”).</p></body></sub-article></article>
