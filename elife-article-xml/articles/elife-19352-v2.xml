hypoxic/ischemic attacks. Here we show that seizures result in a severe hypoxic attack confined to the postictal period. We measured brain oxygenation in localized areas from freely-moving rodents and discovered a severe hypoxic event (pO<sub>2</sub> &lt; 10 mmHg) after the termination of seizures. This event lasted over an hour, is mediated by hypoperfusion, generalizes to people with epilepsy, and is attenuated by inhibiting cyclooxygenase-2 or L-type calcium channels. Using inhibitors of these targets we separated the seizure from the resulting severe hypoxia and show that structure specific postictal memory and behavioral impairments are the consequence of this severe hypoperfusion/hypoxic event. Thus, epilepsy is much more than a disease hallmarked by seizures, since the occurrence of postictal hypoperfusion/hypoxia results in a separate set of neurological consequences that are currently not being treated and are preventable.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.19352.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.19352.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19352.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>It has long been known that after an epileptic seizure, individuals often experience an extended period of impairments that affect how the brain works. Because the brain is organized so that specific tasks happen in particular areas, seizures that affect areas of the brain that control movement are often followed by muscle weakness. Likewise, amnesia may follow a seizure that affects brain areas involved in memory. While these events reduce quality of life in people with epilepsy, they have gone untreated because we did not understand what occurs in the brain after seizures.</p><p>It has been observed that the impairments that follow seizures are similar to those that follow strokes, where for a period of time blood flow to certain areas of the brain is restricted and these areas are starved of oxygen. Following a seizure, is there a local stroke-like event that is responsible for the behavioural and memory impairments?</p><p>To address this question, Farrell et al. studied blood flow in the brains of mice, rats and human volunteers with epilepsy. The experiments show that after an epileptic seizure, blood vessels become narrower, which reduces blood supply to the areas of the brain involved in the seizure and dramatically reduces oxygen levels in those same areas. Using drugs to block the activity of an enzyme called cyclooxygenase-2 or other proteins called L-type calcium channels prevented both the oxygen shortage and the behavioural impairments that follow seizures. Thus, people with epilepsy are experiencing stroke-like events after seizures that they should be able to avoid with simple medical treatments.</p><p>In the future, clinical research should determine how effective these treatments are in people with epilepsy. Other experiments should reveal if a shortage of oxygen after a seizure causes noticeable brain damage and the long-term behavioural problems that are often associated with epilepsy.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.19352.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.19352.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>epilepsy</kwd><kwd>seizures</kwd><kwd>hypoxia</kwd><kwd>hypoperfusion</kwd><kwd>behavioural dysfunction</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MOP-136839</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Federico</surname><given-names>Paolo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MOP-130495</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Teskey</surname><given-names>G Campbell</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038</institution-id><institution>Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RGPIN/03819-2014</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Teskey</surname><given-names>G Campbell</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Local tissue hypoxia follows seizures, is responsible for postictal behavioural dysfunction rather than the seizures per se and can be treated.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>For proper neuronal functioning, brain tissue oxygen levels are normally maintained through exquisite regulation of blood supply (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Erecińska and Silver, 2001</xref>). However, during neurological events when brain tissue oxygen levels fall below the severe hypoxic threshold (pO<sub>2</sub> &lt; 10 mmHg), neuronal dysfunction and behavioural disturbances are observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Farrar, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">van den Brink et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Maloney-Wilensky et al., 2009</xref>). Following termination of a seizure, behavioral impairments related to the specific brain structures that participated in the seizure are expressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Leung et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gallmetzer et al., 2004</xref>). Todd’s Paresis, for example, specifically refers to moderate to severe motor weakness following seizures and typically subsides within a few hours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Todd, 1849</xref>). The symptoms are so similar to ischemic stroke that Todd’s paresis is often misdiagnosed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mathews et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Masterson et al., 2009</xref>). The occurrence of these behavioral impairments have been attributed to the affected cortex being ‘exhausted’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Franck and Pitres, 1878</xref>) or silenced due to increased inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gowers, 1901</xref>), but these conjectures are not supported. Despite being first described over 160 years ago, the cause of postictal behavioral disturbances has not been determined. A few case studies of persons experiencing Todd’s paresis demonstrated that the affected cortex was inadequately perfused during this period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mathews et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yarnell and Paralysis, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rupprecht et al., 2010</xref>). Thus, we hypothesized that following termination of a seizure, a long-lasting and severe hypoxic episode would occur and manifest as behavioral dysfunction. This simple idea is intriguing, testable and provides a critical new insight into this broad reaching neurological disease by explaining some of the detrimental consequences associated with epilepsy. But to date, a continuous and detailed examination of local tissue oxygenation and blood flow following seizures has not been carried out.</p><p>Most investigations of the hemodynamics associated with seizures have concentrated on changes before or during the seizure and not during the postictal period. It is well established that there is a dramatic, transient increase in blood flow during seizures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gibbs et al., 1934</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Penfield et al., 1939</xref>) with a corresponding decrease in oxygenation that quickly recovers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bahar et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Suh et al., 2006</xref>). The few studies that investigated changes in blood flow during the postictal period have not yielded consistent observations with reports of local hypoperfusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rowe et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Newton et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Leonhardt et al., 2005</xref>) and hyperperfusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fong et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tatlidil, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hassan et al., 2012</xref>). These inconsistencies were likely due to the variable time-points after the seizure when blood flow was measured. To circumvent this problem we systematically investigated local oxygen levels and blood flow following evoked and spontaneous seizures in rats and mice. We then relied on those results to guide our clinical study and used arterial spin labeling (ASL) MRI to measure postictal hypoperfusion following spontaneous seizures in people with epilepsy.</p><p>We further hypothesized that the enzyme cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), which is primarily responsible for catalyzing arachidonic acid to the PGH2-derived prostanoids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hla and Neilson, 1992</xref>) and plays a major role in neurovascular coupling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Niwa et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lecrux et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lacroix et al., 2015</xref>), would mediate postictal hypoperfusion/hypoxia. We reasoned that electrographic seizures would engage this system and lead to a pronounced vasoconstriction and subsequent severe hypoxia. Downstream of this, we anticipated that elevated free calcium in vascular smooth muscle, particularly calcium conducted by L-type channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Putney and McKay, 1999</xref>), would sustain this vasoconstriction. Here we demonstrate that blocking these pathways prevents postictal severe hypoperfusion/hypoxia and spotlights its contribution to postictal behavioral impairments.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Long-lasting severe hypoxia follows spontaneous and evoked seizures</title><p>A bipolar electrode and oxygen-sensing probe (optode) were chronically implanted into CA1 and CA3, respectively, of the dorsal hippocampus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L</xref>). The optode continuously recorded the partial pressure of oxygen (pO<sub>2</sub> in mmHg) in awake, freely-moving rats before, during and, most importantly, after brief electrographic seizures over several weeks. During typical behavioral states, hippocampal pO<sub>2</sub> levels vary within the normoxia range between 18 and 30 mmHg (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Erecińska and Silver, 2001</xref>). 10 mmHg oxygen was chosen as the threshold for defining severe hypoxia since several independent studies have demonstrated that pO<sub>2</sub> levels at or below 10 mmHg cause significant changes to cellular physiology and brain injury. Hypoxia-dependent gene expression via Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1 transcriptional activation occurs as an exponential function with respect to decreasing pO<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jiang et al., 1996</xref>). In a HeLa cell culture system, 10–15 mmHg was determined to be the half-maximal response and since the steep portion of the exponential curve is at lower pO<sub>2</sub> levels, most gene expression occurs below this threshold. Restricting middle cerebral artery blood flow in the cat led to cell death at a threshold of 7–8 mmHg (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Farrar, 1991</xref>). Furthermore, both the depth and duration of severe hypoxia following traumatic brain injury are good predictors for clinical outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">van den Brink et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Maloney-Wilensky et al., 2009</xref>). 10 min of pO<sub>2</sub> below 10 mmHg was associated with increased risk of death, and further increases with lower pO<sub>2</sub> and longer duration of severe hypoxia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">van den Brink et al., 2000</xref>). A systematic review of clinical traumatic brain injury found that 10 mmHg was a suitable threshold for defining severe hypoxia associated with worse outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Maloney-Wilensky et al., 2009</xref>). In defining tumor hypoxia, which is thought to exacerbate cancer pathophysiology, 8–10 mmHg is the suggested threshold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Höckel and Vaupel, 2001</xref>). Thus, 10 mmHg is a reasonable threshold for defining severe hypoxia and integrating the entire area below 10mmHg combines the depth and duration to reveal the total hypoxic burden.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19352.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Seizures induce severe postictal hypoxia.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Local tissue oxygenation in the hippocampus of an awake, freely-moving rat (blue).

We measured a brief and small drop in hippocampal oxygenation at seizure onset and a subsequent increase in oxygenation during the electrographic seizure. However, oxygen levels dropped precipitously to below the severe hypoxic level (pO<sub>2</sub> &lt; 10 mmHg) following seizure termination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Even more striking was that the severe hypoxia was sustained for an hour. We then systematically examined this phenomenon in a higher throughput model of evoked focal seizures: electrical kindling.</p><p>Using electrical kindling we elicited an afterdischarge (i.e. electrographic seizure) by applying brief stimulation (1 ms pulse widths at 60 Hz for 1 s) through the chronically implanted bipolar electrode. A brief dip in oxygenation at seizure onset and subsequent increase was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Importantly, the severe hypoxic event following a kindled seizure was markedly similar in magnitude and duration compared to spontaneous seizures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Since no substantive differences in postictal hypoxia were observed between the two models, we chose to evoke afterdischarges with kindling stimulation as our principal model for subsequent experiments to maximize data collection efforts.</p><p>Daily repeated stimulation of the dorsal hippocampus gave rise to a wide range of primary afterdischarge durations across rats (10–50 s) and allowed us to determine that there is a strong positive and linear relationship between the duration of the hippocampal seizures and the severity of postictal hypoxia, as revealed by integrating the area below 10 mmHg (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p><p>To provide convergent evidence for this postictal hypoxia phenomenon, we also used an immunohistological staining technique based on pimonidazole (Hypoxyprobe<sup>TM</sup>-1), which selectively labels hypoxic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Chapman et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Höckel and Vaupel, 2001</xref>). Rats were injected with pimonidazole and afterdischarges elicited. Since postictal severe hypoxia in the rat hippocampus lasted a mean of 73.1 ± 7.8 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1N</xref>), we examined brains one hour post-seizure. We observed significantly increased numbers of pimonidazole-labeled cells in the dentate hilus and CA3 regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E–K</xref>) relative to non-seizure controls. Thus, two different and unrelated techniques identified a severe hypoxic period following brief seizures.</p><p>We then asked the question whether the phenomenon could be observed in a different structure. Rats were chronically implanted with an electrode in the corpus callosum to elicit neocortical afterdischarges and an optode was implanted into layer V of motor neocortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1M</xref>). Postictal severe hypoxia was also present in the motor cortex where the typically shorter neocortical afterdischarges gave rise to higher minimum pO<sub>2</sub> and a more rapid return to baseline oxygen levels, relative to hippocampus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1N</xref>). Quantification of severe hypoxia in these two structures revealed significantly worse severe hypoxia in the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1O</xref>), likely due to longer seizure durations.</p><p>To further ensure that postictal hypoxia was not specific to the method of seizure induction we also tested two other experimentally-induced seizure models. Maximal electroconvulsive shock (MES) which models generalized convulsions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Young et al., 2006</xref>) and 3 Hz electrical stimulation, which drives epileptiform activity and behavioral seizures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Teskey and Racine, 1993</xref>) both induced a long-lasting hypoxic event in the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) similar to those observed following spontaneous or electrical kindled seizures.

Pre-treatment with the L-type calcium channel antagonist nifedipine 30 min prior to seizure elicitation did not alter the afterdischarge duration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) indicating that nifedipine effects can be attributed to a neurovascular mechanism. We observed higher pO<sub>2</sub> levels at baseline (+9.0 mmHg, p&lt;0.01, paired ANOVA), throughout the postictal period, and an earlier return to baseline relative to vehicle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Moreover, nifedipine pre-treatment significantly attenuated the area below the severe hypoxic threshold (pO<sub>2</sub> &lt; 10 mmHg) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). We also observed that nifedipine was effective at reducing postictal severe hypoxia when administered immediately following termination of the afterdischarge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). This is not surprising since L-type calcium channels play a key role in the tonic phase of vascular smooth muscle contraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Putney and McKay, 1999</xref>). These results provide key evidence that hypoxia is largely mediated by hypoperfusion and that L-type calcium channel activity plays a role in sustaining this response.</p><p>While laser Doppler flowmetry provides inferential evidence that blood flow was reduced postictally, we sought a direct measure of changes in blood vessel diameter following epileptiform-like activity in the hippocampus. In young (P25-P40) freely moving rats, we first determined that 2 min of 3 Hz stimulation resulted in a remarkably similar profile of severe hypoxia compared to the standard 1 s stimulation evoked afterdischarges (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E,F</xref>). We then moved the 3 Hz stimulation protocol to an acute hippocampal slice preparation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>) and imaged hippocampal arterioles in the synaptic layer of CA1 (stratum radiatum) before, during, and after Schaffer collateral stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H,I</xref>). We observed sustained 13.8 ± 4.0% arteriole constriction following stimulation (60–90 min post-stim, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>). Poiseuille’s law dictates that a 13.8% reduction in diameter would lead to blood flow that is 55.2% of baseline, which correlates well with our laser Doppler flowmetry measurements (53.0 ± 8.3% at 40–60 min, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Pretreatment with nifedipine (50 µM) caused significant vessel dilation (108.4 ± 2.9% relative to baseline, p&lt;0.05, paired t-test) and prevented 3 Hz stimulation-induced vessel constriction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K</xref>).

which non-selectively inhibits both COX-1 and COX-2. Likewise, we also co-administered celecoxib and SC-560 to specifically and concurrently inhibit both enzymes. With both methods, inhibiting COX-1 and-2 achieved greater than 95% inhibition of severe hypoxia, similar to acetaminophen. This is of interest since COX-2 inhibition alone achieved a 67.26 ± 27.42% reduction in the severity of hypoxia and SC-560 had no significant effect. These results support a role for an interaction between COX-1 and COX-2, which has been demonstrated through COX-1/COX-2 heterodimer signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yu et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>The conversion of arachidonic acid to PGH2 by COX-2 is followed by PGE2, PGD2, PGF2, PGI2, and TXA2 production by specific synthases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hla and Neilson, 1992</xref>) and subsequent constriction or dilation though G-protein coupled receptor signaling. Specific inhibitors for each of these pathways are not available, but we were able to target two of them: PGE2 and TXA2. We inhibited PGE2 synthesis with CAY-10526, which resulted in a + 41.72 ± 9.94% reduction in the area below 10 mmHg. Disruption of TXA2 signaling by inhibiting its synthesis (ozagrel) or receptor (seratrodast) resulted in no significant change from vehicle. Thus, part of the COX-2 signaling pathway can be explained by PGE2 production.</p><p>Since, nifedipine inhibits calcium entry into vascular smooth muscle, we postulated that inhibiting the increase in free calcium with 2-APB (primarily through IP3 receptors and TRP channels) should also inhibit postictal hypoxia. Indeed, we observed a 45.27 ± 18.44% decrease in the area below 10 mmHg with 2-APB pre-treatment. We then hypothesized that the rise in free calcium could activate protein kinase C (PKC), which can sustain vasoconstriction by inhibiting myosin light chain phosphatase through CPI-17 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kitazawa et al., 2003</xref>). However, PKC inhibition was unable to prevent severe postictal hypoxia. Furthermore, activating vasodilatory pathways by increasing cAMP (milrinone), (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Farrar, 1991</xref>) increasing cGMP (sildenafil), (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">van den Brink et al., 2000</xref>) hyperpolarizing smooth muscle with IK<sub>Ca</sub> activator (SKA-31), (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Maloney-Wilensky et al., 2009</xref>) preventing astrocytic release of potassium onto smooth muscle via BK<sub>Ca</sub> (paxilline), or (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Leung et al., 2000</xref>) increasing production of nitric oxide (L-arginine) provided no inhibition of postictal hypoxia. In fact, Rho Kinase inhibition with fasudil achieved the opposite effect and augmented postictal severe hypoxia perhaps by distributing blood flow to areas outside of the afterdischarge zone. Together, these data provide support for the inflexible nature of postictal hypoperfusion/hypoxia, which is not amenable to several vasodilatory treatments, and highlights the central roles COX-2 activation and the sustained calcium elevation in vascular smooth muscle.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Anti-seizure drugs (ASDs) do not inhibit postictal severe hypoxia</title><p>Despite taking ASDs, many persons with epilepsy still experience breakthrough seizures and 30–40% are completely refractory to ASD treatment. Given the potential negative consequences of prolonged periods of severe local tissue hypoxia, an important question for us was whether the commonly prescribed ASDs modulate this phenomenon. Fortunately, using electrical kindling stimulation well above seizure threshold did not affect seizure duration following ASD treatment and allowed us to observe the effect of ASDs on postictal severe hypoxia without that confound. Acute dosing with commonly prescribed ASDs had no significant effect on postictal severe hypoxia when compared to vehicle treatment (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl4">Table 4</xref>). Interestingly, ethosuximide reduced the severity of hypoxia by 47.61 ± 11.01%.

We hypothesized that the postictal hypoperfusion/hypoxic period would be responsible for motor impairment and that this impairment would also be confined to the hypoperfusion/hypoxic period. To test this, we used nifedipine as a tool to prevent postictal hypoperfusion/hypoxia, allowing us to dissociate the effects of an afterdischarge from the combined effects of an afterdischarge with hypoperfusion/hypoxia on behavior. We targeted the corpus callosum at the level of the forelimb area of motor cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Teskey et al., 2002</xref>) as the site to elicit bilateral afterdischarges. The hanging bar test was used to assess motor weakness. We first measured baseline hang time (standardized to 100%) and then elicited an afterdischarge. Hang time was repeatedly measured at 20, 40 and 80 min postictal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>) whilst neocortical pO<sub>2</sub> was continuously recorded throughout. As expected, pretreatment with nifedipine prevented the expression of postictal severe hypoxia without affecting seizure duration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Although severely hypoxic at both the 20- and 40 min time-point, the vehicle-treated seizure group displayed a significantly shorter hang time at 40 min postictal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>), suggesting that the duration of severe hypoxia is important for the generation of behavioral deficits. At 80 min post-afterdischarge, the non-treated group's pO<sub>2</sub> levels returned to normoxia and the behavioral performance was equivalent to nifedipine treated and non-seizure groups. These results indicate that it is the postictal severe hypoxic period that is responsible for the motor weakness, not the seizure per se.<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19352.016</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Preventing postictal severe hypoxia prevents behavioral impairments.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Experimental timeline for neocortex experiments.

Following habituation to the testing environment, hippocampal afterdischarges were elicited in the presence or absence of acetaminophen and rats were exposed to two identical objects at a time of severe hypoxia (45 min post-discharge). 24 hr later, rats were re-introduced to the testing chamber in the presence of a novel and familiar object (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Since rats prefer to explore the novel object more frequently, a preference for the novel object indicates a memory was formed for the familiar object. Rats that were severely hypoxic at the time of memory encoding (seizure+vehicle, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>) explored the novel and familiar objects with no significant preference 24 hr later, which indicates that they were unable to form the memory during the postictal severe hypoxia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). Moreover, the rats that had seizures without severe hypoxia (acetaminophen pre-treatment) performed at the same level as controls (acetaminophen or vehicle without seizures). These results, along with the ability of nifedipine to prevent Todd’s paresis, support the hypothesis that severe hypoxia following seizures, and not the seizures themselves, are the underlying cause of these specific postictal impairments.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Using a multi-level approach from animal models to clinical epilepsy, we demonstrate a profound postictal hypoperfusion/hypoxic event. We also demonstrated significant post-ictal hypoperfusion in 8 of 10 patients. The reasons why two subjects did not exhibit significant post-ictal hypoperfusion are unclear, but could relate to the brief duration of their seizures and/or patient heterogeneity. In rodents we identified COX-2 activity during afterdischarges as a central player in mediating this pathophysiological response. Inhibiting COX-2 or restoring perfusion with the potent vasodilator, nifedipine, prevented ensuing severe hypoxia and averted postictal behavioral impairments. Thus, brief seizures initiate a local and long-lasting hypoperfusion/hypoxic insult, which is responsible for behavioral dysfunction in the postictal period rather than the seizure itself.</p><p>Prior to this report the direction of postictal hemodynamic changes was unclear since conflicting reports indicated either postictal hypoperfusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rowe et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Newton et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Leonhardt et al., 2005</xref>) or hyperperfusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fong et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tatlidil, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hassan et al., 2012</xref>). This discordance is most likely explained by the variable timing of the single postictal scans. In our rat models we observed the most severe hypoxia occurred between 20–60 min post-seizure thus we performed clinical postictal scans in this time window and observed dramatic local hypoperfusion. Importantly, only those previous studies that imaged during this period observed hypoperfusion, which highlights the importance of timing with this phenomenon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rowe et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Newton et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Leonhardt et al., 2005</xref>). Moreover, the timing of postictal scans is an important consideration as these techniques may aid the ability of clinicians to locate the seizure onset zone in potential surgical candidates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Duncan et al., 1993</xref>).</p><p>A limitation of this study is the tool used to measure hypoperfusion in the rat. Laser Doppler flowmetry was used for in vivo recordings, which is an indirect measure of blood perfusion. However, we used this system in conjunction with our highly accurate pO<sub>2</sub> recordings in the same region of the hippocampus and observed hypoperfusion and hypoxia that display similar kinetics. For a more direct measure of vasoconstriction, we used acute hippocampal slices and observed the diameter of local arterioles. The conditions in slice differ substantially from in vivo conditions and this could potentially alter the results. However, the degree of constriction observed in slice predicts a similar change in blood perfusion to what we observed with laser Doppler flowmetry. Furthermore, the vasoconstriction following seizure stimulation in slice was sensitive to acetaminophen and nifedipine, which supports the notion that this constriction follows the same set of mechanisms that occur in vivo. In conjunction with the clinical observations of hypoperfusion, these data support the central role of hypoperfusion in the generation of severe hypoxia in the postictal period.</p><p>Prior to this study, few have investigated local tissue oxygenation during the seizure event itself and they identified a transient ‘dip’ at seizure onset that quickly recovers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bahar et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Suh et al., 2006</xref>). The longest of these recordings included 30 s of postictal oxygen sampling and took place under ketamine anesthesia, which dramatically reduces neurovascular coupling by inhibiting NMDA-dependent COX-2 activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tran and Gordon, 2015</xref>). It is therefore unsurprising that postictal hypoperfusion/hypoxia was not identified in these studies. One group discovered hypoxyprobe-positive neurons following pilocarpine-induced SE and during the period of recurrent spontaneous seizures (three weeks post SE), which they attributed to the hypoxic dip that occurs during seizures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gualtieri et al., 2013</xref>). We also observed a transient dip in oxygenation at seizure onset, but the duration of this dip is dwarfed by the prolonged period of severe hypoxia during the postictal period and likely accounts for hypoxyprobe labeling.</p><p>We identified that COX-2 plays a central role in coordinating a cascade of events to induce severe hypoxia following electrographic seizures. Activity-dependent induction of COX-2 in neurons plays an important role in normal neurovascular coupling by producing vasoactive prostanoids that act on blood vessel receptors to cause vasodilation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Niwa et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lecrux et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lacroix et al., 2015</xref>). Under pathophysiological activation during electrographic seizure activity, we observed that vasodilation is quickly switched to prolonged vasoconstriction. We also found that inhibiting PGE2 synthesis provided partial inhibition of severe hypoxia. The EP1 and EP3 receptor subtypes for PGE2 have been observed to induce vasoconstriction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jadhav et al., 2004</xref>) and may mediate part of this response.</p><p>Our study also investigated several other pathways by which postictal severe hypoxia could be mediated and also aimed to identify other drug candidates to inhibit this phenomenon. Of particular note was nifedipine’s inhibition of severe hypoxia even when administered after the seizure. Furthermore, this strategy is important clinically since administering a drug after a seizure avoids the challenges of seizure prediction. We also tested commonly prescribed anti-seizure medications since it would be informative to know which of these medications potentially inhibit, or more importantly, exacerbate postictal severe hypoxia in patient populations. Most drugs, including anti-seizure medications, failed to modulate this postictal severe hypoxia, which we believe emphasizes that this is a pathological phenomenon and that breakthrough seizures while on antiseizure medications do not directly protect against this insult.</p><p>Postictal behavioral impairments last much longer than the seizures themselves and negatively impact quality of life. The mechanism underlying these disruptions were previously unknown and no treatment options existed. Our data clearly demonstrates that two common postictal impairments, Todd’s paresis and amnesia, can be prevented by interfering with the pathways that lead to hypoperfusion/hypoxia. Thus, L-type calcium antagonists and COX-2 inhibitors are strong candidates for the treatment of these currently untreated behavioral impairments.</p><p>Our discovery that brief and mild seizures lead to an extended hypoperfusion/hypoxic event is critically important because it establishes that seizures could injure the brain through <italic>postictal severe hypoxia</italic>, and not necessarily by the seizure itself. Severe hypoxia may be an important component of seizure-induced brain damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jackson et al., 1999</xref>) and since postictal hypoperfusion/hypoxia is COX-2 dependent, this hypothesis can be assessed. Though there is some controversy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rojas et al., 2014</xref>), it is generally accepted that COX-2 inhibition is neuroprotective from seizures. Indeed, with genetic or pharmacological COX-2 inhibition, seizure-induced brain damage can be dramatically reduced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Serrano et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kunz and Oliw, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hewett et al., 2006</xref>). Though at the time of these studies researchers were unaware of postictal hypoperfusion/hypoxia and the requirement of COX-2 in this response, they provided support for the hypothesis that postictal hypoperfusion/hypoxia injures the brain. Given the central role of brain injury in epileptogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sloviter and Bumanglag, 2013</xref>), preventing injury from hypoperfusion/hypoxia may be a novel preventative treatment strategy in epilepsy.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>Young adult male Hooded Long-Evans (LE) rats weighing between 250–300 g at the start of experimentation were used in this study (Charles River, Canada).

The manufacturer individually calibrates each biologically inert probe, called an optode. The implantable system was designed by JFD in collaboration with Oxford Optronics. The implant is inserted under isoflurane anesthesia. We allow at least seven days between implantation and initiation of measurements to ensure that the effects of acute trauma were minimized. pO<sub>2</sub> measurements at 1 Hz can then be made at any time by connecting the implant to the Oxylite using an extension fiber optic lead.

Nifedipine (15 mg/kg) or vehicle was injected into rats on the first day and the other treatment on the following day. Rats were tested immediately before a seizure (or sham) to establish a baseline and then connected to the EEG and oxygen recording system to elicit and record a seizure, using standard kindling stimulation. In the sham condition, rats did not previously undergo surgery. We then tested at 20, 40, and 80 min after a seizure (or sham).

Following recovery from surgery, rats were habituated to the environment on the morning of day 1. In the afternoon, rats were injected with vehicle or acetaminophen (250 mg/kg i.p.) to permit or prevent hypoxia following a seizure, respectively. After 30 min rats were stimulated with kindling stimulation and both EEG and local tissue oxygenation were sampled. We confirmed that acetaminophen prevented hypoxia in the rats that received it and did not affect seizure duration, suggesting we have a clear dissociation. Rats were disconnected from the data acquisition system at 45 min postictal and transferred to the testing chamber where they were introduced to two identical objects and allowed to explore them for 5 min. Rats were returned to their home cage and brought back to the testing chamber 24 hr later. This time, a familiar object and a novel object (which differed in color, size, and texture) were introduced and the rats were allowed to explore the objects for 5 min. The position of the objects and type of objects were counter-balanced to account for rat’s preference not related to memory. If rats adequately form the memory for the two identical objects on day 1, they should spend more time exploring the novel object on day 2. Each session was videotaped and the duration spent investigating each object was measured. Investigation includes orienting the snout within 2 cm of the object, but not sitting on the object.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Statistics</title><p>All statistical analyses were performed using Prism version 5.01 (GraphPad, La Jolla, CA). t-tests were used for experiments with only two groups.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom, Jan-Marino Ramirez (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Gary Westbrook as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Franck Kalume (Reviewer #3). The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This study investigates the mechanisms underlying behavioral impairments during and in the aftermath of seizures in an animal model and human patients. Using EEG, focal oxygen recordings, and laser Doppler flowmetry, the authors demonstrate that the evoked and spontaneous seizures caused a dramatic reduction in local tissue oxygenation and blood perfusion in three different models of seizures: rat model kindling, maximum electroshock, and 3Hz electrical stimulation seizures. The study is significant since it seems to resolve a significant uncertainty in the field. Previous data have implicated hypoxia in seizure mechanisms, but the findings were in human and thus do not benefit from the better physiological control and mechanistic studies as presented here in the animal model. Moreover, there are also previous human studies that do not observe post-seizure hypoxia, perhaps due to the variable nature of the seizure phenomenon. The study is technically elegant since the authors use sensitive and complementary measures of brain blood flow, which indicate severe ischemia following seizure. The authors compare the animal studies with studies of human patients and demonstrate similar hypoxic and hypoperfusion events in a clinical study of patients with epilepsy. Moreover, employing pharmacological experiments, the investigators demonstrate that the blockade of cyclooxygenase-2 or L-type calcium channels alleviates the seizure-induced hypoxia, hypoperfusion, as well as the resulting post-ictal behavioral impairments. The study suggests that it is possible to separately treat the seizure event and the hypoxic event. This is a clinically significant discovery and the fact that animal studies were combined with the human studies makes this an interesting paper for a general readership.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors throughout the paper define ischemia as blood flow that leads to less than 10mm of mercury partial pressure of oxygen. This measure results in a threshold change for defining hypoxia. This measurement is potentially misleading because many of the treatments are only partially protective and seizures still produce a reduction in PO2, but not all the way to 10mm Hg partial pressure of O2. To make the manuscript more balanced, the authors should remove this thresholding of hypoxia at 10mm of mercury. In cases where area under the curve is presented, the entire area under the curve should be considered not just whether there is a component, which is below 10mm of mercury. Importantly, the authors were able to perform their studies without the confounding effects of anesthesia, which greatly increases the worth of the study.</p><p>2) For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> showing the nifedipine treatment, please calculate panel D based on the entire area under the curve. Furthermore, all statistics in the paper should be based on the total area under the curve and not that below 10mm.</p><p>3) Simultaneous blood flow and pO2 are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, this is important as it suggests that the changes in pO2 are secondary to a reduction in blood flow. However, the sample size of 3 for this key measure seems small. We suggest to add more n's and ideally the effect of the various pharmacological manipulations should be extended to blood flow to confirm that these treatments are not just affecting the utilization of O2 by tissue. We would like to emphasize that these experiments should be relatively straight-forward and manageable within a 2 month time window. If the authors cannot perform these experiments, this should be discussed as a limitation in the Discussion section.</p><p>4) The data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> showing the effects of repeated stimulation on vessel diameter in slices are interesting. However, these effects could potentially be caused by a mechanistically different effect, because the slices have very different conditions than the in vivo conditions. Note, that in this case the slices are well-stimulated, but not necessarily ischemic. Moreover, the authors are also unable to determine the identity of the vessels within the slice they are examining. Are these arterioles or veins? Thus, the reviewers are not convinced that the authors can conclude a vasoconstriction mechanism without also adding an in vivo measure (2-photon). The authors should discuss this issue as a caveat of the in vitro experiments.</p><p>5) The human data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> is interesting, although much of the quantification of these data is in a more descriptive form in the tables. We suggest that the authors present these data as mean levels of blood flow in the different groups before and after seizure. The presentation of the human clinical data is done so in a qualitative manner in the tables. This data should be properly quantified in some form of absolute blood flow units that are comparable to the mm of 02 for the animal work. Please also add some information about how the analysis was done. Were investigators blinded to conditions? What exactly are the controls? Potentially, periods without seizures in the same patients and blood flow at this time could be used as a control. Furthermore, given that some of the patients have multiple seizures, it would also be interesting to know whether the results were repeatable on different imaging sessions.</p><p>6) &quot;Significant (&gt; 25 CBF units) postictal hypoperfusion was seen in 7 of 10 subjects (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). Two examples are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. The location of postictal hypoperfusion was concordant with the clinically determined seizure onset zone in four cases and it was in the same lobe of the brain as the seizure onset in two cases. &quot; Please clarify what is meant by significant hypoperfusion &gt; 25 CBF units? Does this mean a change in perfusion of 25 units? Please explain why &gt;25 CBF units would denote hypoperfusion if we don't know what the upper end of the range could be? The correlation with the clinical data does not seem very strong (2 or 4 of 10 examples?). How does this compare to the O2 values from the animal work? Please add this into the Discussion section.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Postictal behavioural impairments are due to a severe prolonged hypoperfusion/hypoxia event that is COX-2 dependent&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.

We have complied with the reviewers’ request to calculate the entire area under the curve between baseline and recovery of pO2 levels for the graphical display of the data and have made those data available with this response. However, we would like to take this opportunity to convince the reviewers that the area below 10 mmHg of pO2 is the more useful and important measure rather than the area below from baseline. We acknowledge that the originally submitted manuscript did not adequately describe the significance of brain pO2 below 10mmHg and we have rectified that situation in our resubmission by expanding the rationale for choosing 10mmHg.</p><p>The new section reads, &quot;10mmHg oxygen was chosen as the threshold for defining severe hypoxia since several independent studies have demonstrated that pO2 levels at or below 10mmHg cause significant changes to cellular physiology and brain injury. […]Thus, 10mmHg is a reasonable threshold for defining severe hypoxia and integrating the entire area below 10mmHg combines the depth and duration to reveal the total severe hypoxic burden.&quot;</p><p>An important strength of the oxygen monitoring methodology used in this manuscript is that it measures the absolute pO2. While relative oxygen recordings can show the magnitude of changes, the importance of absolute pO2 is not properly captured in those measurements. Moreover, the physiological relevance of absolute pO2, particularly below 10mmHg, dramatically outweighs what is learned by measuring relative changes from baseline. For example, if Rat A has a seizure and local brain oxygen decreases from a baseline of 30mmHg to 10mmHg in the postictal period, then Rat A has a net change of 20mmHg. If Rat B has a baseline of 20mmHg and also decreases by 20mmHg, then Rat B is completely anoxic. The total area below baseline pO2 would be identical in Rat A and B (assuming kinetics are the same), but we know from the absolute pO2 values that Rat B is subjected to a much more extreme physiological stressor with molecular and behavioural consequences.</p><p>Aside from losing the ability to quantitatively define severe hypoxia, the total area under the curve is particularly susceptible to changes in baseline pO2. We have noted much greater variability in baseline oxygenation (within and between animals) than postictal hypoxia. This variability is seen in our mean oxygen profiles where the error bars at baseline or recovery of oxygenation are 2-3 times greater than during severe hypoxia. This problem introduces a large degree of variability in the area below baseline analysis since baseline oxygen can vary by a wide margin. This becomes especially critical for between subject comparisons where baseline pO2 can vary by more than 15mmHg across animals. For example, the strong positive correlation between seizure duration and area below 10mmHg (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) is lost when we convert to area below baseline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Author response image 1A</xref>, p=0.99). Instead, area below baseline is substantially dependent on baseline pO2 (p&lt;0.0001). Furthermore, a change small change (3-5mmHg) in the level oxygenation during severe hypoxia has greater physiological significance than at baseline (see additions to manuscript).<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19352.018</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Susceptibility of Area Below Baseline analysis to changes in baseline pO<sub>2</sub>.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Seizure duration is not correlated with total area under curve (R square=0.000013, p=0.99).

We appreciate the reviewers’ concerns to keep this analysis balanced. We believe a threshold of severe hypoxia at 10mmHg is both objective and informative of the true impact postictal changes in oxygenation.</p><p><italic>2) For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> showing the nifedipine treatment, please calculate panel D based on the entire area under the curve. Furthermore, all statistics in the paper should be based on the total area under the curve and not that below 10mm.</italic> </p><p>The reviewers pointed out that a threshold of 10mmHg may be misleading in the case of nifedipine, which is only partially protective. This was not our intention. Pre-treatment with nifedipine works by increasing baseline pO2 as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>. As a thought experiment, if we were to change the threshold to 15mmHg, nifedipine has the ability to inhibit postictal hypoxia (78.82 ± 7.632% reduction of AB10 vs. 69.16 ± 8.577% reduction of AB15 relative to vehicle). However, when we take the entire area below baseline (acknowledging the caveats described above), nifedipine has no effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Author response image 2A</xref>). This is troubling since administering nifedipine after the seizure dramatically inhibits the area below baseline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Author response image 2B</xref>). Since the area below 10mmHg does not differ between pre- and post-treatment with nifedipine (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>), but the area below baseline does, this highlights the susceptibility of area below baseline analysis to changes in baseline pO2.<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19352.019</object-id><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Comparing area below baseline analyses with pre- and post-administration of nifedipine.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Pre-administration of nifedipine had no effect on area below baseline.

We have now expanded the discussion to address the issues between relative changes from baseline vs. changes in severe hypoxia (area below 10mmHg) with nifedipine pre-treatment. We hope this acknowledges the reviewers’ concerns and increases the transparency of the data presented.</p><p><italic>3) Simultaneous blood flow and pO2 are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, this is important as it suggests that the changes in pO2 are secondary to a reduction in blood flow.

If the authors cannot perform these experiments, this should be discussed as a limitation in the Discussion section.</italic> </p><p>As requested we have added 2 more subjects to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> which brings the sample size to 5. We have also updated the text to reflect this.</p><p>We were unable to perform pharmacological treatments in conjunction with Laser Doppler Flowmetry within the allotted time period. However, it should be noted that we performed experiments with nifedipine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K</xref>) and acetaminophen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>) in our acute slice preparation to observe their effect on arteriole constriction following seizure stimulation. In both cases, the pharmacological agents prevented vasoconstriction and parallel the in vivo pO2 recordings.</p><p>In accordance with the reviewers comments the discussion has now been expanded to address these limitations. It reads, &quot;A limitation of this study is the tool used to measure hypoperfusion in the rat. Laser Doppler flowmetry was used for in vivo recordings, which is an indirect measure of blood perfusion. […] In conjunction with the clinical observations of hypoperfusion, these data support the central role of hypoperfusion in the generation of severe hypoxia in the postictal period.&quot;</p><p><italic>4) The data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> showing the effects of repeated stimulation on vessel diameter in slices are interesting.

We have now addressed this concern in the discussion (see our response to point 3 above). A few things to note are that (1) the degree of vasoconstriction predicts a similar change in perfusion to that seen in vivo and (2) vasoconstriction in slice was sensitive to the same pharmacological agents that prevent hypoxia in vivo (nifedipine and acetaminophen). This provides support that the mechanisms are likely similar in nature.</p><p>The reviewers mention that the slices are well-stimulated, but not necessarily ischemic. One of the weaknesses of the manuscript prior to review was that the various methods were not well tied together. In the Results section, we now compare the observations made in slice to those made in vivo. We point out that according to Poiseuille's law a 13.8% vessel constriction translates to a 55.2% reduction in blood flow, which is substantial hypoperfusion. We observed remarkably similar changes in blood flow with laser Doppler flowmetry and confirmed the presence of severe hypoxia under these conditions.</p><p>The reviewers raised concerns about the nature of the vessels we were imaging (arterioles or veins?). We only measured vessel diameter in hippocampal arterioles and these vessels were identified by their encapsulation by smooth muscle. This identification feature has been added to the manuscript.</p><p><italic>5) The human data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> is interesting, although much of the quantification of these data is in a more descriptive form in the tables. We suggest that the authors present these data as mean levels of blood flow in the different groups before and after seizure. The presentation of the human clinical data is done so in a qualitative manner in the tables.

Furthermore, given that some of the patients have multiple seizures, it would also be interesting to know whether the results were repeatable on different imaging sessions.</italic> </p><p>We agree and now provide more quantitative analysis of the human blood flow data. We have summarized the quantitative CBF data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>. The data are now presented in two ways: (1) absolute measurements of baseline and postictal blood flow and (2) percent change in blood flow as a function of seizure duration. As requested, the inclusion of percent change makes this data more comparable with the work in animal models. Furthermore, we included the number of each patient beside their correspond data point on each graph to easily allow comparison to the qualitative information presented in the tables.</p><p>We have expanded the methods section to include more information on how the analysis was done. Briefly, to obtain the quantitative CBF data, a region of interest (ROI) was manually drawn in a blinded fashion around the single brain area exhibiting the maximal post-ictal blood flow reduction as well as adjacent, confluent voxels with CBF reductions &gt; 10 mL/100g/min. In <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>, we now provide where the seizure occurred (as determined by an Epileptologist's review of EEG), where maximal hypoperfusion occurred, and the size of the ROI analyzed. We also noted concordance between areas maximally hypoperfused and areas involved in the seizure.</p><p>Persons reviewing the ASL data were blinded to the clinical data when determining where the maximal post-ictal CBF changes were seen and when manually drawing ROIs to obtain the quantitative CBF data. Control (baseline) interictal ASL data were obtained from the same patients from whom post-ictal ASL data were obtained. The baseline data were obtained following a seizure-free period of &gt;24 hrs, while the patients were still on the seizure monitoring unit (to confirm that they were in fact seizure-free for &gt; 24 hrs).</p><p>We agree with the reviewers that results from multiple seizures would be very useful data to obtain. However, patients are typically discharged from our seizure monitoring soon after obtaining the ASL data. Thus, they are not available for a repeat study while in hospital. It is not possible to obtain postictal ASL data on patients who are outpatients. It is also not possible to re-admit patients to our clinical Seizure Monitoring Unit for research purposes only.</p><p><italic>6) &quot;Significant (&gt; 25 CBF units) postictal hypoperfusion was seen in 7 of 10 subjects (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). Two examples are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. The location of postictal hypoperfusion was concordant with the clinically determined seizure onset zone in four cases and it was in the same lobe of the brain as the seizure onset in two cases. &quot; Please clarify what is meant by significant hypoperfusion &gt; 25 CBF units? Does this mean a change in perfusion of 25 units? Please explain why &gt;25 CBF units would denote hypoperfusion if we don't know what the upper end of the range could be? The correlation with the clinical data does not seem very strong (2 or 4 of 10 examples?). How does this compare to the O2 values from the animal work? Please add this into the Discussion section.</italic> </p><p>Normal cortical cerebral blood flow (CBF) is approximately 60 ml/100g/min. The threshold for which neuronal function is impaired and the tissue is at risk of infarction is approximately 25 ml/100g/min. Given this, we identified the number of patients who had maximal post-ictal CBF reductions of at least 25mL/100g/min compared to baseline since this is likely clinically significant and measurable by ASL. To this end, we identified 7 patients that had maximal postictal CBF reductions of &gt; 25 ml/100g/min. Note, that in this context, the maximal hypoperfusion (&gt; 25 ml/100g/min) described herein would be expected to be higher than the average CBF changes seen in the ROIs that also included adjacent voxels with CBF changes &gt; 10 ml/100g/min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>).</p><p>We apologize for the lack of clarity in reporting the concordance of the postictal ASL data with the presumed seizure onset zone. Since the original submission, we have modified our method of determining concordance between the ASL and clinical data and now described it in the methods section.</p><p>Unfortunately a direct comparison of blood flow data from humans with pO2 values from the animal models is not possible. We did, however, convert ASL data to percentage decrease in blood flow to be more comparable to rat LDF recordings. The best comparison would be to actually measure blood flow with ASL fMRI in an animal model, whilst simultaneously performing pO2 measures, and then to compare those blood flow measures to those in human epilepsy patients. In fact this is one of our planned experiments for the near future.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p><italic>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining very minor issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as below:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) To avoid confusion the authors should state in the title of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> that the results presented are from an &quot;</italic>in vitro<italic>&quot; preparation</italic> </p><p>We have added &quot;in an in vitro preparation&quot; to the title of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>.</p><p><italic>2) The authors maintained the analysis of hypoxia using 10 mm Hg of pO2 threshold for evaluation of nifedipine effect and indicated that this is to focus on the severe type of hypoxia.
