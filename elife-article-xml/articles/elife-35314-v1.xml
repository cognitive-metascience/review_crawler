contagious cancer circulating in the Tasmanian devil (<italic>Sarcophilus harrisii</italic>), a species which already harbours a more widespread contagious cancer, Devil Facial Tumour 1 (DFT1). Here we show that in contrast to DFT1, DFT2 cells express major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules, demonstrating that loss of MHC is not necessary for the emergence of a contagious cancer. However, the most highly expressed MHC class I alleles in DFT2 cells are common among host devils or non-polymorphic, reducing immunogenicity in a population sharing these alleles. In parallel, MHC class I loss is emerging in vivo, thus DFT2 may be mimicking the evolutionary trajectory of DFT1. Based on these results we propose that contagious cancers may exploit partial histocompatibility between the tumour and host, but that loss of allogeneic antigens could facilitate widespread transmission of DFT2.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.35314.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>While cancer cells typically cannot spread between individuals, there are a few examples of contagious tumours. Remarkably, two examples have emerged in a single species, the Tasmanian devil, a marsupial carnivore. These tumours are known as Devil Facial Tumour 1 (or DFT1) and Devil Facial Tumour 2 (or DFT2); both cause tumours round the faces of infected devils. Since it emerged in the 1990s, DFT1 has killed 60–90% of the devil population. Preserving the few remaining healthy devils has been a major challenge for conservationists. This challenge became more urgent in 2014, when the second contagious cancer, DFT2, was discovered circulating in the population.</p><p>Contagious cancers are rare because the immune system usually eliminates cells coming from outside the body. Each healthy cell carries molecules known as the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) that act as a barcode showing where each cell comes from. The immune system uses these molecules to help it tell the difference between the body’s own cells and those from elsewhere. DFT1 can avoid the immune system and spread to new hosts because it has lost MHC. In 2014, scientists identified a new Tasmanian devil cancer named DFT2, but it was unclear how this second cancer evades the immune system as it spreads from host to host.</p><p>Caldwell et al. have now examined the MHC on cells from DFT2 cancers, including cells grown in the laboratory and cells taken from cancer biopsies. Biochemical tests showed that the DFT2 cells do carry MHCs, but that the MHC barcodes of DFT2 are similar to those of the devils infected with the disease. This finding may explain how the cancer can spread undetected in these animals, because the immune system does not recognize it as coming from outside the body. Further analyses also reveal that the cancer cells are slowly evolving to lose their MHCs. This means DFT2 could, with time, become as contagious as DFT1.</p><p>These two contagious cancers threaten the future of the Tasmanian devil. As top predators, devils are key to the ecosystem in Tasmania and their preservation is vital. While DFT2 provides a unique opportunity to study an emerging cancer as it develops, this research will also help to protect the devils and may lead to effective vaccines. These results could also reveal how other cancers avoid the immune system and may help to detect them during treatment. In addition, there are many similarities between contagious cancer cells and organ transplants. Understanding the role of MHC in DFT2 could lead to better ways to prevent rejection following transplants.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Sarcophilus harrisii</kwd><kwd>MHC</kwd><kwd>contagious cancer</kwd><kwd>immune escape</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100012166</institution-id><institution>Gerald Kerkut Charitable Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Postgraduate student scholarship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Caldwell</surname><given-names>Alison</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000739</institution-id><institution>University of Southampton</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Vice-Chancellor's Scholarship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Caldwell</surname><given-names>Alison</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005370</institution-id><institution>Gates Cambridge Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stammnitz</surname><given-names>Maximilian R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>102942/Z/13/A</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Murchison</surname><given-names>Elizabeth P</given-names></name><name><surname>Stammnitz</surname><given-names>Maximilian R</given-names></name><name><surname>Kwon</surname><given-names>Young Mi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000275</institution-id><institution>Leverhulme Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Philip Leverhulme Prize</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Murchison</surname><given-names>Elizabeth P</given-names></name><name><surname>Stammnitz</surname><given-names>Maximilian R</given-names></name><name><surname>Kwon</surname><given-names>Young Mi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000275</institution-id><institution>Leverhulme Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RPG-2015-103</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Elliott</surname><given-names>Tim</given-names></name><name><surname>Siddle</surname><given-names>Hannah VT</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Herchel Smith Postgraduate Scholarship</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kwon</surname><given-names>Young Mi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A recently discovered contagious cancer in the Tasmanian devil has the potential to become widespread in the population due to the loss of histocompatibility antigens that are allogeneic to its hosts.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Contagious cancers have emerged and circulate in two species of mammals (dogs and Tasmanian devils) and four species of molluscs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Metzger et al., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Novinski, 1876</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Pearse and Swift, 2006</xref>). The Tasmanian devil is the only mammalian species in which two independent contagious cancers exist, Devil Facial Tumour 1 (DFT1) and Devil Facial Tumour 2 (DFT2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Pye et al., 2016b</xref>). Although both cancers have similar gross morphology, causing tumours on the face, neck and oral cavity, genetic analysis shows that they emerged in different individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Pearse and Swift, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Pye et al., 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Stammnitz et al., 2018</xref>). DFT1 was first identified in 1996 in the northeast of Tasmania (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hawkins et al., 2006</xref>), but has since spread widely, causing close to 100% mortality and drastic decline of affected populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hamede et al., 2015</xref>). In contrast, DFT2 is a more recent contagious cancer, it was first characterised in 2014 and has been formally identified in eleven devils from the Channel region of Southwest Tasmania (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Pye et al., 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kwon et al., 2018</xref>). Recent immunohistochemical and drug sensitivity analyses of DFT2 indicate it arose from a similar tissue to DFT1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Stammnitz et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>As allografts, DFT1 and DFT2 cells should be rejected by the host devil through T cell recognition of non-self MHC class I molecules encoded by the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Sherman and Chattopadhyay, 1993</xref>). The mature MHC class I molecule is a trimer that acts as a ligand for the T cell receptor (TCR) and is composed of a light chain, β<sub>2</sub>-microglobulin (β<sub>2</sub>m), in non-covalent association with a heavy chain, which provides a binding cleft for self and non-self peptides. Classical MHC class I molecules are important transplantation antigens that are highly polymorphic, ubiquitously expressed and involved in peptide-antigen presentation. In contrast, non-classical MHC class I molecules have little polymorphism and more diverse functions, including regulation of the immune response particularly by inhibiting natural killer (NK) cell function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Braud et al., 1999</xref>). Allografts can be rejected within 7–14 days when host CD8+ T cells are exposed to non-self MHC class I molecules and their bound peptides on the surface of donor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Rosenberg, 1993</xref>).</p><p>Vertebrates have multiple MHC class I genes that are generally not orthologous between species due to rapid evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams and Parham, 2001</xref>). Five MHC class I genes have been identified in the genomic region encoding the Tasmanian devil MHC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cheng et al., 2012</xref>). <italic>Saha-UA, -UB</italic> and <italic>–UC</italic>, are likely classical, with moderate levels of polymorphism and ubiquitous expression, while <italic>Saha-UD</italic>, <italic>–UK</italic> and <italic>-UM</italic>, are non-classical, with limited polymorphism and restricted expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cheng et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cheng and Belov, 2014</xref>).</p><p>We have previously demonstrated that DFT1 cells down-regulate MHC class I and class II molecules from their cell surface, thereby removing the targets for a T cell response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Siddle et al., 2013</xref>). This is the first indication that DFT1 cells have similar immune evasion mechanisms to those found in single organism tumours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hicklin et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">McGranahan et al., 2017</xref>). Loss of MHC class I is due to epigenetic down-regulation of β<sub>2</sub>m, and the peptide transporter encoded by TAP1 and TAP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Siddle et al., 2013</xref>) but MHC class I can be restored in DFT1 cells when treated with IFNγ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Siddle et al., 2013</xref>). MHC class I positive DFT1 cells have since been used with some success in initiating immune responses to DFT1 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Tovar et al., 2017</xref>). Down-regulation of MHC is also observed in the canine transmissible venereal tumour (CTVT), where MHC molecules are down-regulated during transmission and growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hsiao et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Pérez et al., 1998</xref>). However, subsequent cytokine signalling leads to lymphocyte infiltration of tumours, MHC up-regulation and either tumour regression or stasis of growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Yang et al., 1987</xref>). These findings have suggested that loss of MHC class I expression is necessary for the emergence and subsequent transmission of contagious cancers.</p><p>Why DFT2 cells can pass between individuals without a protective immune response from the host is not known, nor are the conditions that have facilitated the emergence of two contagious cancers in this species. Here we show that in contrast to DFT1, DFT2 cells express MHC class I molecules. However, the dominantly expressed MHC class I alleles are either non-classical or shared with host devils and common in the wider population. Finally, DFT2 tumours were identified with evidence of MHC class I loss, indicating the emergence of MHC class I down-regulation in this tumour.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>DFT2 cells express β<sub>2</sub>m protein, a component of the MHC class I complex</title><p>Flow cytometry using a monoclonal antibody against Tasmanian devil β<sub>2</sub>m was used to assess the level of MHC class I expression on the surface of a representative DFT1 cell line (DFT1_4906) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), DFT1 cells treated with IFNγ (DFT1_4906 + IFNγ) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), three DFT2 cell lines (DFT2_RV, DFT2_SN and DFT2_TD549) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D and E</xref>) and devil fibroblast cells (Fibroblasts_Salem) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>).

In contrast, all three DFT2 cell lines express cell surface β<sub>2</sub>m, but the level of expression varies, DFT2_TD549 cells have the highest level of expression (Mean Fluorescence Intensity (MFI) 42.1) followed by DFT2_RV (MFI 37.6) and DFT2_SN (MFI 12.1). Although all three DFT2 cell lines express β<sub>2</sub>m, they have lower levels of β<sub>2</sub>m than DFT1 cells that have been treated with IFNγ (MFI 92.5) and devil fibroblasts (MFI 93.3).

In contrast, we show that DFT2 cells express cell surface β<sub>2</sub>m molecules in addition to classical and non-classical class I heavy chains, indicating that functional MHC class I are present on the surface of DFT2 cells.</p><p>The expression of a non-classical MHC class I molecule, Saha-UK, on DFT2 cells could reduce the immunogenicity of the tumour cells. Saha-UK is expressed in some DFT2 tumours in vivo and the <italic>Saha-UK</italic> heavy chain is expressed at similar levels to the three classical MHC class I genes (amplified as a group) in vitro. While antibodies specific for <italic>Saha-UD</italic> are not available, RT-PCR indicates it is also expressed, but at a very low level compared to <italic>Saha-UK</italic>. Non-classical MHC class I molecules can be inhibitory ligands for NK receptors and some human cancers down-regulate classical MHC class I and overexpress non-classical MHC class I to avoid a cytotoxic immune response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kochan et al., 2013</xref>). While the function of <italic>Saha-UK</italic> and <italic>Saha-UD</italic> are not known (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Siddle et al., 2009</xref>), neither are highly polymorphic (<italic>Saha-UK</italic> is monomorphic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Siddle et al., 2010</xref>]) and unlikely to elicit an allogeneic T cell response in host devils. However, further investigation is needed to determine the function of these molecules and the functional classification of Tasmanian devil MHC class I molecules as ‘classical’ or ‘non-classical’.</p><p>DFT2 cells also express classical MHC class I alleles belonging to the <italic>Saha-UA</italic>, <italic>-UB</italic> and <italic>-UC</italic> loci. Of these classical MHC class I alleles, SahaI*27 is the most abundant in DFT2 cells and is also found in the three host devils, reducing the immunogenicity of DFT2 cells in these animals. The primers designed in this study should amplify all known DFT1 and DFT2 MHC class I alleles with equal efficiency, suggesting that this allele represents an MHC class I locus with dominant expression. As well as being found in the host devils, this allele is highly prevalent in at least one devil population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lane et al., 2012</xref>) and the high expression levels in DFT2 may be facilitating tolerance of the tumour in this population of devils. The similarity of the MHC class I alleles between DFT2 and host devils may reflect a shared geographical range and genotype pool to the cancer founder's (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Stammnitz et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, the frequency of this allele among the wider population may impact the ability of DFT2 to spread further.</p><p>The heterogenic expression of MHC class I molecules in DFT2 biopsies suggests that MHC class I expression is not fixed and may be gradually lost in DFT2. While some MHC class I alleles are shared between DFT2 and its hosts, the tumour does have a number of unique alleles. SahaI*74/88 differs to SahaI*27 by only one amino acid that is not predicted to interact with the TCR, but SahaI*90 and SahaI*35 have a number of unique sites when compared to host MHC class I alleles. While these alleles have lower expression on DFT2 than SahaI*27, their presence may still initiate an immune response in some host animals, providing a selective pressure for MHC class I loss. It is possible that, like single organism tumours, DFT2 is undergoing immunoediting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dunn et al., 2002</xref>), which can operate to down-regulate specific MHC class I alleles that are immunogenic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">McGranahan et al., 2017</xref>) or select for mutations that remove or modulate total MHC class I expression. However, while four of the six primary DFT2 tumours examined have CD3 positive cells in the tumour mass, which may indicate an immune response, the infiltration is notably present in DFT2_812, which is negative for classical MHC class I and could be expected to be CD3 negative. Thus, further detailed analysis is needed to define the host immune response to DFT2 and its role in shaping tumour evolution.</p><p>While DFT1 cells currently circulating in the population are MHC class I negative, it is possible that DFT1 down regulated MHC class I expression after the tumour became transmissible and that initial transmission events were among individuals that shared prevalent MHC class I alleles. This is supported by previous studies that have found reduced polymorphism in devil MHC and microsatellite loci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jones et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Siddle et al., 2007</xref>). In addition, a hemizygous deletion of β<sub>2</sub>m has recently been identified in a DFT1 cell line, perhaps indicating past selective pressure for MHC class I loss in this older transmissible tumour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Stammnitz et al., 2018</xref>). Similarly, CTVT is thought to have emerged in an old world dog and the genetic structure of a dog pack would have favoured the emergence of CTVT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Murgia et al., 2006</xref>). However, the presence or absence of MHC antigens is likely not singly responsible for determining the ability of the host to respond to the tumour. DFT2 may also be manipulating its microenvironment by release of immune suppressive cytokines, such as Transforming Growth Factorβ, which can drive metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Tauriello et al., 2018</xref>) and in conjunction with PD1/PD-L1 interactions can inhibit and exclude T cells from a tumour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Mariathasan et al., 2018</xref>). In addition, recruitment of T regulatory cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Curiel et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">James et al., 2010</xref>) or immunosuppressive myeloid cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Almand et al., 2001</xref>) can also negatively impact the T cell responses to tumours.</p><p>DFT1 is now at least 21 years old and CTVT is predicted to be over 10,000 years old (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Murchison et al., 2014</xref>), whereas DFT2 was first discovered in 2014 and is most likely a recently emerged tumour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Pye et al., 2016b</xref>). As such, DFT2 provides an opportunity to study the early evolution of a contagious cancer. The emergence of a contagious cancer that can transmit while maintaining MHC class I expression indicates that loss of MHC is not necessary for transmission, but as the tumour encounters the immune system of genetically disparate hosts subclones that have down-regulated MHC may be selected. Our results predict that loss of MHC class I is already occurring, perhaps due to structural mutations or epigenetic changes. Loss of MHC antigens could allow rapid dissemination of DFT2 through the population, impacting an already vulnerable species.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type (species) <break/>or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Gene <break/>(<italic>Sarcophilus harrisii</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>Saha-UK</italic></td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Murchison et al.

The NucleoSpin totalRNA FFPE kit (Macherey-Nagel) was used to extract RNA from formalin fixed tumour tissues according to the manufacturer’s instructions. 1 μg of RNA was reverse transcribed to cDNA as described previously. Three primer sets were used to amplify all classical and non-classical MHC class I alleles. Primer set one was used to amplify <italic>Saha-UA</italic>, <italic>-UB</italic> and <italic>–UC</italic> products as a group, primer sets 2 and 3 were used to amplify <italic>Saha-UK</italic> and <italic>Saha-UD</italic> genes specifically (for PCR conditions see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). All products were purified using NucleoSpin Gel and PCR Clean-up (Macherey-Nagel), cloned into a pJET plasmid (CloneJET; ThermoFisher Scientific). Plasmid DNA from individual clones was isolated and sequenced using T7 primer. PCR, cloning and sequencing was performed in triplicate for the DFT2 cells and duplicate for the spleen samples. For primer set 1 between 15 and 65 clones were sequenced for each PCR, for primer sets 2 and 3 between 4 and 6 clones were sequenced. To assess the relative abundance of each of the classical MHC class I alleles within DFT2 cells 65 clones were isolated and sequenced using primer set 1.</p><p>To validate the MHC class I alleles, <italic>Saha-UA</italic>, <italic>-UB</italic> and <italic>-UC</italic> genes were amplified using primer set one as described above and resulting PCR products (containing all MHC class I alleles for these genes) were sequenced directly using these primers. The resulting chromatograms were used to identify polymorphic sites in the transcripts and to confirm the validity of alleles. In addition, MHC class I alleles for RV, 818 and SN were searched against genomes generated for these animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Stammnitz et al., 2018</xref>) to validate their presence in the genome. All sequences were quality checked and analysed in CLC Genomic Workbench. Residues in the MHC class I sequences predicted to interact with the peptide or the TCR were identified by aligning to HLA-A2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bjorkman et al., 1987</xref>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors thank the histology department at the University of Southampton Hospital for H and E staining and paraffin embedding some tumour samples.

Your article has been reviewed by Arup Chakraborty as the Senior Editor, a Reviewing Editor, and three reviewers. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Mel Greaves (Reviewer #1); Rob Miller (Reviewer #2); Cornelis Melief (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>While all the referees found the subject of interest and the findings of relevance to understanding immune – tumor interactions, they also found limitations to the study in its current state.

The paper would be substantially strengthened if it is possible to provide some validation of the cell line data using tissue samples. In this regard, patchiness of the immunohistochemical staining seems odd. Why should there be areas of continued expression and areas where there is loss of expression? Why wouldn't loss of expression be more random? Some of the images seem to show that staining is peripheral in to the tumors (Figure 4—figure supplement 1). Was this the case and why might that be?

To address this we have used reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR to compare the expression of B2m, classical MHC class I and the non-classical class I in the three DFT2 cell lines and the 6 primary tumour samples which were used in the immunohistochemistry (IHC) experiments (Figure 2E). Two of these primary tumours, DFT2_RV and DFT2_SN were used to derive the cell lines analysed in Figure 1 and are key to comparing the flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry and RTPCR results. This data has been added to Figure 2E and the Results section.</p><p>We find that the primary tumour samples express B2m, reflecting the B2m cell surface protein and mRNA expression in the cell lines. In addition, the primary tumours express both classical MHC class I and non-classical MHC class I, but this expression appears weaker than the cell lines and variable between the tumours. While variable expression was also overserved in the IHC experiments, it should be noted that we do not consider the RT-PCR quantitative as the amount of stroma (host) will vary in each sample, contributing to the total RNA and potentially affecting transcript levels. This has been noted in the manuscript (subsection “DFT2 cells express classical and non-classical MHC class I heavy chain genes in vitroand in vivo.”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In this regard, patchiness of the immunohistochemical staining seems odd. Why should there be areas of continued expression and areas where there is loss of expression? Why wouldn't loss of expression be more random? Some of the images seem to show that staining is peripheral in to the tumors (Figure 4—figure supplement 1). Was this the case and why might that be? Because the older sections of the tumor were more likely to have lost expression?</p></disp-quote><p>This point is valid and we have performed a review of our immunohistochemistry data to identify regions subject to edge artefact and necrosis of the tumour tissue, which may have given a misleading impression of positive expression. We have re-imaged the sections, avoiding these areas and shown the six different tumours in Figure 3 (rather than as supplementary material) to present these results more clearly.</p><p>Figure 3 shows that DFT2 primary tumours can have high expression of the classical class I heavy chains (i.e. DFT2_RV, SN and 818), while others have lower expression (i.e. DFT2_812). Variable expression is also observed for the non-classical MHC class I, <italic>Saha-UK</italic>. However, the staining indicates that expression may be primarily internal, and this is reflected in the text of the Results section, Figure 3.</p><p>In a number of tumours, the staining for the classical MHC class I and non-classical MHC class I (i.e. DFT2_547) is ‘patchy’ we see some areas of the tumour tissue where cells are staining more strongly for the MHC class I proteins. This may be because older sections of the tumour have lost expression, but it may also be due to local environmental factors, signalling and cytokines from host devils. However, further experiments are needed to assess the mechanisms controlling modulation.</p><p>There is considerable precedent for this in single organism tumours and we have included for the reviewers some examples of head and neck tumours with a range MHC class I expression, including weak, variable and strong examples (stained with W632, a pan specific HLA antibody). There is also considerable literature on loss of MHC class I molecules through DNA mutations in genes involved in antigen processing and presentation and so called ‘soft’ mutations, usually epigenetic and sometimes rescueable (Restifo et al., 1996; McGranahan et al., 2017). We have referred to this literature in the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Were sequential sections stained with anti-UA, B, C followed by anti-UK to see if staining is common to areas and therefore may be artifact or some evidence of co-staining?</p></disp-quote><p>Where possible we have always used serial sections for the staining of class I heavy chains and CD3 (Figure 3 and Figure 4). However, in some cases the tissue architecture is different between sections, particularly in tumours with little fibrous stroma. We have attempted co-staining for the different heavy chains, but as both the classical and non-classical genes are expressed together on cells and the affinity of the antibodies is different, it is difficult to resolve both signals clearly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) It is unclear how the authors think it likely DFT2 succeeds in immune evasion. Is it (a) there is nothing to be recognised on DFT2 cells; or (b) the DFT2 cells are immune-suppressive? The suggestion that non-classical MHC class 1 molecules (Saha) are inhibitory appears to be entirely speculative. Can the authors provide further studies that might illuminate the mechanism?</p></disp-quote><p>A combination of both a and b. As the reviewers point out below there are many ways in which tumours can actively suppress the immune system, but in this work we have focused on what would be antigenic on the cell surface in the context of MHC class I. Unfortunately, at present we cannot contribute any other data to determine the function of the non-classical MHC class I, this will have to remain speculative. However, we have pointed out in the Discussion section that its non-polymorphic nature means it is unlikely to be a major alloantigen in devils, regardless of function.</p><p><italic>In this regard, MHC molecule expression</italic> in vivo <italic>is recorded as variable. From this the authors conclude that they may be catching immune-editing or evolutionary selection for MHC loss as it happens.

Importantly, the authors do not observe infiltration of tumor with lymphocytes which might reflect ongoing selection. How do they reconcile this with their hypothesis about immune evasion and selection?</italic> </p><p>We agree that we have not shown extensive data on how the devil immune system responds to DFT2 (if it does at all). We have improved this analysis by undertaking more extensive staining for CD3 to screen for infiltrating lymphocytes in the primary tumours (This is now shown in Figure 4). We find that 4 of the 6 primary tumours have CD3 cell infiltrating the tumour (Results section).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2</p></disp-quote><p>Previous reports have shown the vast majority of DFT1 tumours are CD3 negative (reflecting the lack of immune response to this tumour) and as we have noted in the text lymphocyte infiltration is associated with a more positive prognostic outcome in many single organism tumours (Chee et al., 2017 and Galon et al., 2006). At present the proposal that DFT2 is losing MHC expression due to an immune response from the host is speculative and we have altered the Discussion section for clarity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>One would expect processing and presentation in the MHC I molecules of minor histocompatibility antigens, at least some of which are expected to differ between the first animal from whom the tumor arose and subsequent recipients.
