Many acquired diseases, including HIV and COPD, affect specific muscles while sparing others. Even monogenic muscular dystrophies selectively affect certain muscle groups. These observations suggest that factors intrinsic to muscle tissues influence their resistance to disease. Nevertheless, most studies have not addressed transcriptional diversity among skeletal muscles. Here we use RNAseq to profile mRNA expression in skeletal, smooth, and cardiac muscle tissues from mice and rats. Our data set, MuscleDB, reveals extensive transcriptional diversity, with greater than 50% of transcripts differentially expressed among skeletal muscle tissues. We detect mRNA expression of hundreds of putative myokines that may underlie the endocrine functions of skeletal muscle. We identify candidate genes that may drive tissue specialization, including <italic>Smarca4</italic>, <italic>Vegfa</italic>, and <italic>Myostatin</italic>. By demonstrating the intrinsic diversity of skeletal muscles, these data provide a resource for studying the mechanisms of tissue specialization.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34613.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>About 40% of our weight is formed of skeletal muscles, the hundreds of muscles in our bodies that can be voluntarily controlled by our nervous system. At the moment, the research community largely sees all these muscles as a single group whose tissues are virtually interchangeable.</p><p>Yet, skeletal muscles have highly diverse origins, shapes and roles. For example, our diaphragm is a long muscle that contracts slowly and rhythmically so we can draw breaths, while tiny muscles in our eyes generate the short and precise movements of our eyeballs. Different skeletal muscles also respond in distinct ways to injuries, drugs and diseases. This suggests that these muscles may be diverse at the genetic level.</p><p>While all the cells in our body have the same genetic information, exactly which genes are turned on and off (or âexpressedâ) changes between types of cells. On top of this âon or offâ regulation, the level of expression of a gene â how active it is â can also differ. However, the studies that examine the differences in gene expression between tissues usually overlook skeletal muscles.</p><p>Here, Terry et al. use genetic techniques to measure how genes are expressed in over 20 types of muscle in mice and rats. The results show that the expression levels of over 50% of all the animalsâ genes vary between muscles. In fact, any two types of muscles express on average 13% of their genes differently from each other. The analyses yield further unexpected findings. For example, the expression levels in a muscle in the foot that helps to flex the rodentsâ toes are more similar to those found in eye muscles than to the ones observed in limb muscles. These conclusions indicate that skeletal muscles are a widely diverse family of tissues.</p><p>The research community will be able to use the data collected by Terry et al. to explore further the origins and the consequences of the differences between skeletal muscles. This could help researchers to understand why specific groups of muscles are more susceptible to disease, or react differently to a drug. This knowledge could also be exploited to refine approaches in tissue engineering, which aims to replace damaged muscles in the body.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>skeletal muscle</kwd><kwd>myokine</kwd><kwd>RNAseq</kwd><kwd>gene expression</kwd><kwd>tissue engineering</kwd><kwd>Vegfa</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000069</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AR069266</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Esser</surname><given-names>Karyn A</given-names></name><name><surname>Hughes</surname><given-names>Michael E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000069</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AR066082</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Esser</surname><given-names>Karyn A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>There is no such thing as a representative skeletal muscle tissue, as each member of this family of tissues expresses a specialized mRNA program.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Gene expression atlases have made enormous contributions to our understanding of genetic regulatory mechanisms. The field of functional genomics was set in motion by the completion of the Human Genome Project and the coincident development of high throughput gene expression profiling technologies. The overriding goals of this field are to understand how genes and proteins interact at a whole-genome scale and to define how these interactions change across time, space, and different disease states. The development of SymAtlas was an early, influential effort to address these questions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Su et al., 2002</xref>). Custom microarrays were used to systematically profile mRNA expression in dozens of tissues and cell lines from humans and mice. Besides describing tissue-specific expression patterns, these data provided essential insights into the relationship between chromosomal structure and transcriptional regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Su et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>Related approaches have had a similarly high impact on biomedical research. For example, microRNA expression throughout mammalian tissues was described in an expression atlas that has revolutionized the study of regulatory RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Landgraf et al., 2007</xref>). Our lab has contributed to this growing literature with the creation of CircaDB, a database of tissue-specific mRNA rhythms in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hughes et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>). Taken together, these projects demonstrate that publicly available functional genomics data have enduring value as a resource for the research community.</p><p>Nevertheless, previous gene expression atlases have largely ignored skeletal muscle. CircaDB includes gene expression data from the heart and whole calf muscle, but it does not distinguish between their constituent tissues. Similarly, SymAtlas profiles nearly 100 different tissues, but there is only a single representative sample for either cardiac or skeletal muscle. The microRNA Atlas includes over 250 human, mouse, and rat tissues; however, skeletal muscle is entirely absent from these data. More recent human gene expression atlases have similar biases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Evangelista et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lindholm et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Vissing and Schjerling, 2014</xref>). Many studies have compared muscle-specific gene expression in different tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Porter et al., 2001</xref>), fiber-types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chemello et al., 2011</xref>), or disease states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Colantuoni et al., 2001</xref>), but on the whole, there is no systematic analysis of transcriptional diversity in skeletal muscle.</p><p>This gap in the literature is problematic since skeletal muscle comprises a remarkably diverse group of tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tirrell et al., 2012</xref>). Skeletal muscle groups originate from different regions of the developing embryo, and they have characteristic morphological specializations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Merrell and Kardon, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Murphy and Kardon, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Noden and Francis-West, 2006</xref>). Their physiological functions are similarly diversified. For example, extraocular muscles govern precise eye movements, the diaphragm drives rhythmic breathing, and limb skeletal muscles are involved in either fast bursts of motion or sustained contractions underlying posture.</p><p>These intrinsic differences contribute to differential susceptibility of muscle groups to injury and disease. For example, there are six major classes of muscular dystrophy, and each one afflicts a characteristic pattern of skeletal and cardiac muscle tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ciciliot et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Emery, 2002</xref>). Since the causative mutations underlying congenital muscular dystrophies are germline and present in all cells, this observation indicates that there are properties intrinsic to different muscle tissues that regulate their sensitivity or resistance to different pathological mechanisms.</p><p>Acquired diseases show similar specificity in which muscle tissues they affect and which they spare. Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD) typically have pronounced myopathy in their quadriceps and dorsiflexors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barreiro and Gea, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Clark et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gagnon et al., 2013</xref>). Critical illness myopathy, a debilitating condition caused by mechanical ventilation and steroid treatment, causes muscle weakness in limb and respiratory muscles while sparing facial muscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aare et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hermans and Van den Berghe, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Latronico et al., 2012</xref>). Cancer cachexia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Acharyya et al., 2005</xref>), HIV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Serrano et al., 2008</xref>), and sepsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tiao et al., 1997</xref>) cause muscle wasting, typically affecting fast twitch fibers more severely than slow twitch fibers. In fact, histologically identical muscle fibers show widely divergent responses to injury and disease depending on the muscle group in which they reside (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ciciliot et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Aravamudan et al., 2006</xref>). Taken together, these observations strongly suggest that the intrinsic diversity of skeletal muscle has important consequences for human health and disease. However, the mechanisms through which disease susceptibility and functional specialization are established are unknown.</p><p>Here we present the first systematic examination of transcriptional programming in different skeletal muscle tissues. We find that more than 50% of transcripts are differentially expressed among skeletal muscle tissues, an observation that cannot be explained by fiber type composition or developmental history alone. We show conservation of gene expression profiles across species and sexes, suggesting that these data may reveal conserved functional elements relevant to human health. Finally, we discuss how this unique data set may be applied to the study of disease, particularly regarding muscular dystrophy and regenerative medicine.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>To determine which skeletal muscle tissues are of the broadest general interest, we distributed a Google poll (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>) to leading investigators in the skeletal muscle field. Having recorded over 100 individual responses, we selected 11 mouse skeletal muscle tissues (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>) for study in order to span the functional, developmental, and anatomical diversity of skeletal muscles. To hedge against selection bias from the investigators asked to vote in the poll, we cross-correlated these results with papers indexed in NCBIâs PubMed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>). In addition to these 11 mouse skeletal muscle tissues, we also identified representative smooth and cardiac muscle tissues for collection from mouse, and two skeletal muscle tissues (<italic>EDL</italic> and <italic>soleus</italic>) from male and female rats to permit inter-species and inter-sex comparisons (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34613.003</object-id><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>The biological samples collected in this study and the total number of aligned RNAseq reads.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Tissue</th><th valign="top">Type</th><th valign="top">Species</th><th valign="top">Sex</th><th valign="top">Replicates</th><th valign="top">Aligned reads (Millions)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Total Aorta</td><td valign="top">Smooth</td><td valign="top">Mouse</td><td valign="top">Male</td><td valign="top">6</td><td valign="top">205.2</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Abdominal Aorta</td><td valign="top">Smooth</td><td valign="top">Mouse</td><td valign="top">Male</td><td valign="top">6</td><td valign="top">219.7</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Thoracic Aorta</td><td valign="top">Smooth</td><td valign="top">Mouse</td><td valign="top">Male</td><td valign="top">6</td><td valign="top">214.0</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Atria</td><td valign="top">Cardiac</td><td valign="top">Mouse</td><td valign="top">Male</td><td valign="top">6</td><td valign="top">169.0</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Left Ventricle</td><td valign="top">Cardiac</td><td valign="top">Mouse</td><td valign="top">Male</td><td valign="top">6</td><td valign="top">193.9</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Right Ventricle</td><td valign="top">Cardiac</td><td valign="top">Mouse</td><td valign="top">Male</td><td valign="top">6</td><td valign="top">176.2</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Diaphragm</td><td valign="top">Skeletal</td><td valign="top">Mouse</td><td valign="top">Male</td><td valign="top">6</td><td valign="top">159.1</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">EDL</td><td valign="top">Skeletal</td><td valign="top">Mouse</td><td valign="top">Male</td><td valign="top">6</td><td valign="top">176.8</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Extraocular</td><td valign="top">Skeletal</td><td valign="top">Mouse</td><td valign="top">Male</td><td valign="top">6</td><td valign="top">171.7</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">FDB</td><td valign="top">Skeletal</td><td valign="top">Mouse</td><td valign="top">Male</td><td valign="top">6</td><td valign="top">202.5</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Masseter</td><td valign="top">Skeletal</td><td valign="top">Mouse</td><td valign="top">Male</td><td valign="top">6</td><td valign="top">216.2</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Plantaris</td><td valign="top">Skeletal</td><td valign="top">Mouse</td><td valign="top">Male</td><td valign="top">6</td><td valign="top">185.1</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Soleus</td><td valign="top">Skeletal</td><td valign="top">Mouse</td><td valign="top">Male</td><td valign="top">6</td><td valign="top">172.2</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Tongue</td><td valign="top">Skeletal</td><td valign="top">Mouse</td><td valign="top">Male</td><td valign="top">6</td><td valign="top">210.4</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Gastrocnemius</td><td valign="top">Skeletal</td><td valign="top">Mouse</td><td valign="top">Male</td><td valign="top">6</td><td valign="top">276.1</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Quadriceps</td><td valign="top">Skeletal</td><td valign="top">Mouse</td><td valign="top">Male</td><td valign="top">6</td><td valign="top">275.6</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Tibialis Anterior</td><td valign="top">Skeletal</td><td valign="top">Mouse</td><td valign="top">Male</td><td valign="top">6</td><td valign="top">276.6</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">EDL</td><td valign="top">Skeletal</td><td valign="top">Rat</td><td valign="top">Male</td><td valign="top">6</td><td valign="top">226.4</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">EDL</td><td valign="top">Skeletal</td><td valign="top">Rat</td><td valign="top">Female</td><td valign="top">6</td><td valign="top">206.8</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Soleus</td><td valign="top">Skeletal</td><td valign="top">Rat</td><td valign="top">Male</td><td valign="top">6</td><td valign="top">261.2</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Soleus</td><td valign="top">Skeletal</td><td valign="top">Rat</td><td valign="top">Female</td><td valign="top">6</td><td valign="top">243.0</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Average</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">6</td><td valign="top">211.3</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Total</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">126</td><td valign="top">4,437.7</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>Adult mice and rats were sacrificed and whole muscle tissues were dissected to include the entire muscle body from tendon to tendon. Each sample included six biological replicates from three animals apiece. Therefore, tissues were collected from 18 individual animals for every sample. RNA was purified from these tissues, and RNAseq was used to measure global gene expression (MaterialsÂ andÂ methods and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). On average, every muscle sample was covered by greater than 200 million aligned short nucleotide reads, for a grand total of over 4.4 billion aligned reads in the entire data set (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Empirical simulations indicate that this experimental design reaches saturation with respect to identification of expressed exons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2</xref>). Pairwise comparisons of each replicate sample further indicate a high degree of reproducibility in expression level measurements among biological replicates (median R<sup>2</sup> valueÂ &gt;0.93, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>Over 80% of transcripts encoded in the genome are expressed in at least one skeletal muscle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Comparing the transcripts expressed in all tissues identifies a core group ofÂ ~21,000 transcripts found in every skeletal, cardiac, and smooth muscle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Presumably, these mRNAs include the minimal set of genes required for a cell to generate contractile force. Differential expression analysis shows that even at extremely stringent (qÂ &lt;Â 10<sup>â6</sup>) statistical thresholds, 55.2% of mouse transcripts are differentially expressed among skeletal muscle tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Phrased differently, over half of all transcripts are statistically different when comparing mRNA expression among the 11 mouse skeletal muscles in this study. To validate a subset of these data, we selected 10 genes differentially expressed between <italic>EDL</italic> and <italic>soleus</italic> across a range of different fold changes and performed quantitative PCR (qPCR) on independent biological samples. All 10 replicated, and manual examination of internal controls for cardiac and smooth muscle agreed with <italic>a priori</italic> expectations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1âfigure supplement 4</xref>). To explore similarity between tissues, we calculated a pairwise Euclidean distance between every tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1âfigure supplement 5</xref>). From these data, we generated a dendrogram that clusters tissues based on overall transcriptome similarity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Smooth and cardiac tissues clustered together as expected, and skeletal muscles were found in two primary clusters, presumably based on the proportion of fast twitch fibers they include (i.e. the proportion of <italic>Myosin heavy chain 4</italic> (<italic>Myh4</italic>) expression). We then calculated the proportion of differentially expressed transcripts in every pairwise tissue comparison (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Some surprising observations emerged from this analysis. For example, masseter, a head/neck muscle, is more similar to limb muscles like <italic>EDL</italic> than muscles that share a similar developmental history, such as the tongue. In contrast, the <italic>flexor digitorm brevis</italic> (<italic>FDB</italic>), a muscle necessary for flexing the toes, is more similar to extraocular muscles than limb muscles. On average, 13% of transcripts are differentially expressed between any two skeletal muscles, with a maximum of 36.5% and a minimum less than 1%. A list of all transcripts differentially expressed among skeletal muscles is provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>, and the analyzed expression data can be found in our online database.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34613.004</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Transcriptome profiling reveals extensive gene expression differences among muscle tissues.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The percent of all transcripts detected as being expressed in different classes of tissues is shown as a bar graph.Â &gt;80% of all transcripts are detectably expressed in at least one skeletal muscle tissue.

Therefore, a key question is whether the transcriptome diversity described above reflects genuine expression differences in muscle cells or alternatively differential cellular composition of the bulk tissues. To answer this we performed principal component analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). The first principal component (PC1) accounts for nearly 80% of the variance in our data and separates skeletal muscles into two groups with striking similarity to skeletal muscle clusters 1 and 2 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>. The second principal component (PC2) accounts for roughly 8% of variance and separates cardiac and smooth muscles from skeletal muscle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). We then calculated the correlation (expressed as R<sup>2</sup> values) between each transcriptâs expression and PC1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). A small number of transcripts are highly (R<sup>2</sup>Â &gt;0.90) correlated with PC1 and are thereby predictive of skeletal muscle identity. From the literature, we identified a number of âmarkerâ genes commonly used to separate non-muscle cells from skeletal muscle in flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Liu et al., 2015</xref>).

This observation supports the interpretation that some gene expression differences observed in this study are due to differential cellular composition. Nevertheless, every one of the top ten genes most strongly correlated with PC1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) encodes a characteristic skeletal muscle protein that is unlikely to have been transcribed by non-muscle cell types. To extend on this observation, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref> provides a list of the top 100 genes most strongly correlated with PC1. GO pathway analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Huang et al., 2009a</xref>) reveals that the most significantly enriched term among this list of genes is âmuscle proteinâ (enrichment 6.58, FDRÂ &lt;Â 10<sup>â46</sup>). Moreover, some of these genes are positively correlated with PC1 while others are negatively correlated. This observation implies that PC1 is more than simply a gross measure of the relative contribution of muscle cell RNA in any given sample. Taken as a whole, these observations indicate that many of the gene expression differences in this study reflect bona fide differences among muscle cell transcriptional programs rather than contamination from non-muscle mRNAs.</p><p>To extend on this analysis, we performed Gene Ontology (GO) analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Huang et al., 2009a</xref>) on every pairwise comparison of skeletal muscle tissues. We then consolidated these results by identifying GO terms that were repeatedly enriched in pairwise comparisons. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2âsource data 1</xref> summarizes these results for all 11 skeletal muscle tissues. Consistent with the principal component analysis described above, many of these GO terms were related to structural components of the sarcomere, including Z-disc, A-band, M-band, and others. We also observed enrichment in terms related to extracellular proteins such as Integrin, Collagen, and Fibronectin. More general terms were also enriched, including various pathways involved in mitochondrial function, fatty acid metabolism, and neuromuscular junction assembly. To extend on these observations, we performed co-expression analysis using WGCNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Langfelder and Horvath, 2008</xref>). As an internal control, we first identified clusters of genes that differentiate smooth, cardiac, skeletal muscle cluster one and skeletal muscle cluster 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). As expected, GO analysis of the most statistically significant clusters of co-expressed genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementaryl file 4</xref>) included genes conventionally associated with smooth, cardiac, and skeletal muscle physiology respectively. Co-expression analysis of all 17 mouse tissues revealed a smaller number of statistically significant gene clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1B</xref>), and analysis of the resulting gene lists revealed enrichment in genes typically believed to be specific for skeletal muscle tissue (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>). These observations are consistent with the notion that many of the gene expression differences observed herein are genuine products of differential muscle cell gene expression. Moreover, close examination of the lists of genes identified by principal component, gene ontology, and co-expression analyses reveals that the most informative genes regarding skeletal muscle identity come from families of genes known for their function in skeletal muscle, such as <italic>Troponin</italic>, <italic>Tropomyosin</italic>, <italic>Calsequestrin</italic>, <italic>Myosin heavy chain</italic> (<italic>Myh</italic>), and <italic>Myosin light chain</italic>.</p><p>Skeletal muscle is comprised of myofibers which are typically classified into one of four types in mice based on their <italic>Myh</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Haizlip et al., 2015</xref>). We used our data to quantify the relative abundance of different fiber types across skeletal muscle tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). These results were cross-correlated with legacy data from histological studies, showing close agreement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1</xref>). One hypothesis is that fiber type composition (i.e. the relative amounts of fast versus slow twitch fibers) establishes the observed diversity of gene expression profiles. To test this, we clustered skeletal muscle tissues based on similarity of <italic>Myh</italic> expression. The resulting dendrograms are grossly similar to those based on global gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>; compare with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), as predominantly fast twitch muscles expressing high levels of <italic>Myh4</italic> (Type IIB fibers) tend to cluster together.

These legacy data reveal that <italic>Myostatin</italic> (<italic>Mstn</italic>) is almost exclusively expressed in fast twitch fibers.

This is in marked contrast to clustering by the entire transcriptome, where each skeletal muscle is more similar to other skeletal muscles than any cardiac or smooth tissue. <italic>Hox</italic> gene expression in muscle recapitulates the developmental history of these tissues with respect to anterior/posterior axis formation.

As a first step to this end, we used Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">KrÃ¤mer et al., 2014</xref>) to predict TFs upstream of differentially expressed genes among skeletal muscles.

Therefore, we identified transcripts expressed in a tissue-specific fashion in skeletal muscle. Plotting tissue specificity versus average expression reveals a bimodal distribution among all transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1âfigure supplement 6A and B</xref>). The majority of transcripts in skeletal muscle are expressed evenly across most skeletal muscle tissues, consistent with the notion that there is a minimal set of genes required to form sarcomeres and to generate contractile force. Nevertheless, a smaller set of transcripts (~5%) show nearly exclusive expression in a single skeletal muscle tissue. Manual examination of these tissue-specific genes reveals that many are found in head and neck muscles that have the most divergent developmental history of tissues in this study. Nonetheless, we found examples of tissue-specific genes in the diaphragm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1âfigure supplement 6C</xref>) and the <italic>FDB</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1âfigure supplement 6D</xref>). A list of the most specific genes for any given muscle tissue is presented in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>. We note that one of the most specific genes for soleus, <italic>Myh7</italic>, has been validated previously using measures of protein expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Burkholder et al., 1994</xref>). Nevertheless, we caution readers that independent validation using alternative approaches is recommended for the observations herein.</p><p>The presence of tissue-specific gene expression is consistent with a skeletal muscle transcriptome that is considerably more complex than previously appreciated. Moreover, the unprecedented depth of sequencing coverage in muscle permits the discovery of heretofore-unannotated transcripts. Manual examination of âgapped readsâ spanning two or more loci in the genome indicates that hundreds to thousands of splicing events occur in muscle that have not been previously described (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s7">Figure 1âfigure supplement 7A</xref>). The majority of these novel splicing events result in either inclusion of novel exons or the exclusion of exons previously thought to be constitutive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s7">Figure 1âfigure supplement 7B</xref>). To validate this observation, we designed oligonucleotide primers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s7">Figure 1âfigure supplement 7C</xref>) specific for two novel exons of <italic>Myosin light chain kinase 4</italic> (<italic>Mylk4</italic>), a gene with high expression (&gt;200 FPKM) in many skeletal muscle tissues. PCR amplification and molecular cloning confirmed that these putative exons are included in full-length <italic>Mylk4</italic> transcripts in two different skeletal muscle tissues, <italic>EDL</italic> and <italic>soleus</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s7">Figure 1âfigure supplement 7D</xref>). As the previously canonical splicing event linking exons 2 and 3 is detected by RNAseq in every muscle sample in this study, albeit at levels below the threshold for detection in RT-PCR, we conclude that transcripts including these putative exons are in actuality the predominant species of <italic>Mylk4</italic> mRNA. A list of all novel splice junctions is provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp7">Supplementary file 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp8">8</xref>.</p><p>There are significant differences in fiber type composition between analogous muscle tissues of different mammals. For example, mouse <italic>soleus</italic> is a mixture of fast- and slow fibers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), while rat <italic>soleus</italic> is almost entirely slow twitch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Because of this, we asked whether gene expression differences in mice are conserved across species. Expression of orthologous genes in mouse versus rat tissues has moderate levels of correlation (R<sup>2</sup>Â &gt;0.6, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>), despite the difference in fiber type composition noted above. This reinforces the observation that tissue identity, rather than fiber-type composition, drives transcriptome diversity in muscle. Moreover, the vast majority of genes differentially expressed between <italic>EDL</italic> and <italic>soleus</italic> in both mice and rats changed in the same direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Taking this observation one step further, the fold change of all genes differentially expressed in mouse <italic>EDL</italic> compared to <italic>soleus</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>) is largely consistent with the fold change of same genes in rat <italic>EDL</italic> versus <italic>soleus</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). Sex differences did not dramatically influence differential gene expression between <italic>EDL</italic> and <italic>soleus</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Fewer than 3% of transcripts were differentially expressed between male and female rat <italic>EDL</italic> (2.7%) and male and female rat <italic>soleus</italic> (1.9%). Of these differentially expressed genes, most are up-regulated in males. This observation agrees with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Roth et al., 2002</xref>) and is consistent with the possibility that androgen response elements influence sex-specific gene expression differences in skeletal muscle. These results indicate that differentially expressed genes are largely conserved between mice and rats and suggest that these data may predict gene expression in related species.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34613.020</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Differential gene expression is conserved between mice and rats.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The relative abundance of fast:slow <italic>Myosin heavy chain</italic> (<italic>Myh</italic>) transcripts in rat male and female <italic>EDL</italic> and <italic>soleus</italic> is shown as a bar graph.

Our data show that isoforms of <italic>Pkm</italic> are up-regulated by several standard deviations in <italic>EDL</italic> compared to all other muscle groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Myotonic dystrophy disrupts normal splicing and pathologically elevates <italic>Pkm</italic>, which in turn disrupts normal metabolism, decreasing oxygen consumption and increasing glucose consumption. Based on these observations, elevated expression of <italic>Pkm</italic> in adult tissues is hypothesized to be a critical step in the pathology of myotonic dystrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gao and Cooper, 2013</xref>). Since <italic>Pkm</italic> is expressed much higher in <italic>EDL</italic> than all other muscle types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>), we predict that <italic>EDL</italic> would be more sensitive to degeneration than other muscles. As myotonic dystrophy most dramatically affects certain subsets of muscle tissues, these observations suggest testable hypotheses regarding the underlying mechanism of disease susceptibility. Consistent with this possibility, we note with great interest that in mouse models, <italic>EDL</italic> is considerably more susceptible to muscle weakness than either diaphragm or <italic>soleus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Moyer et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>In addition to disease susceptibility, these data may help explain differential drug sensitivity in muscle. To give one example, the drug chlorzoxazone (brand name: Lorzone) is used to treat muscle spasms. It is thought to act on the central nervous system (CNS) by regulating a potassium channel encoded by the gene <italic>Kcnma1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dong et al., 2006</xref>). Although <italic>Kcnma1</italic> is expressed throughout the central nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">ENCODE Project Consortium, 2012</xref>), it is also found at comparable levels in most skeletal muscle tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). The two exceptions are extraocular eye muscles and the <italic>soleus</italic> that have greater than three-fold higher <italic>Kcnma1</italic> expression than other muscle tissues. The differential abundance of chlorozoxazoneâs target could influence either the efficacy of this drug or the severity of its side effects in different muscles. The expression in skeletal muscle of mRNAs encoding chlorzoxazoneâs protein target calls into question the assumption in the literature that this drug acts exclusively through the CNS. Moreover, given that some commonly prescribed drugs, such as glucocorticoids, cause muscle wasting in specific subsets of muscle tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Schakman et al., 2008</xref>), we speculate that this data set will be a valuable resource for exploring the mechanisms underlying differential drug sensitivity among skeletal muscles.</p><p>Skeletal muscles are endocrine tissues, secreting numerous hormones that influence the physiology and metabolism throughout the body. Termed âmyokinesâ, these signaling molecules are key regulators of human health and disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lightfoot and Cooper, 2016</xref>). The total number of myokines is currently unknown. Our data contribute to this field by comprehensively defining mRNA expression of candidate myokines for future study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7âfigure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp10">Supplementary file 10</xref>). Dozens of genes encoding secreted proteins are differentially expressed among skeletal muscles at relatively high levels (NÂ =Â 42 unique genes, FPKMÂ &gt;10). One notable example is <italic>Vegfa</italic> (q-valueÂ ~10<sup>â30</sup>), a gene involved in angiogenesis, cardiac disease, cancer progression, and many other normal and pathological processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Smith et al., 2015</xref>). Average expression of its predominant isoform is in the top 98<sup>th</sup> percentile of all transcripts expressed by skeletal muscle. Moreover, maximal expression of <italic>Vegfa</italic> in the diaphragm is nearly 10-fold greater than its minimal expression in the FDB, indicating that there are muscle-specific mechanisms for regulating <italic>Vegfa</italic> levels in particular and myokine levels in general. The serum concentration of VEGF-A in healthy adult humans is considerably greater than serum levels of IL6, a canonical myokine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lightfoot and Cooper, 2016</xref>). Given that roughly 40% of the human body is comprised of skeletal muscle expressing high levels of <italic>Vegfa</italic>, we speculate that muscle may be a heretofore under-appreciated source of VEGF-A in circulation. Whether <italic>Vegfa</italic> expression by skeletal muscle has endocrine as well as paracrine functions is unknown.</p><p>Regenerative medicine has made considerable progress in generating skeletal muscle from stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Qazi et al., 2015</xref>). Nevertheless, engineered tissues have important deficiencies in generating sufficient force and forming appropriate neuromuscular synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Juhas and Bursac, 2013</xref>). Given the extensive diversity observed among skeletal muscle tissues, we speculate that the inability to form proper synaptic connections in engineered tissue may be due to the expression of inappropriate or incomplete transcriptional programs. In other words, differentiating stem cells into generic skeletal muscle may not recapitulate all the cues necessary for muscle-specific synapse formation. Therefore, we examined the differential expression of genes implicated in synapse assembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7âfigure supplement 2</xref>). Dozens of transcripts involved in synapse formation are expressed at high levels (FPKMÂ &gt;10), suggesting that they are skeletal muscle mRNAs, rather than contamination from nearby neurons. One illustrative example, <italic>Fbxo45</italic>, is an E3 ligase involved in synapse formation. Mouse knock-outs of <italic>Fbxo45</italic> have disrupted neuromuscular junction (NMJ) formation in the diaphragm, resulting in early lethality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Saiga et al., 2009</xref>). Moreover, the <italic>C. elegans</italic> ortholog, <italic>FSN-1</italic>, also disrupts NMJ formation, with some synapses being over-developed while others are under-developed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Liao et al., 2004</xref>). We speculate that this protein and its orthologs may play a conserved role in tissue-specific NMJ assembly.</p></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>General textbook discussions of skeletal muscle typically focus on developmental patterning, neuromuscular synapse physiology, or the biophysics of contractile functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alberts, 2014</xref>). This reflects the generally held belief that adult skeletal muscle is interesting only as a mechanical output of the nervous system. Functional genomics studies have acted on this assumption to the extent that every gene expression atlas generated to-date has selected at most one skeletal muscle as representative of the entire family of tissues. As such, the null hypothesis of this study was that gene expression profiles would be largely similar among skeletal muscle tissues.</p><p>However, as more than 50% of transcripts are differentially expressed among skeletal muscles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), and 13% of transcripts are differentially expressed between any two skeletal muscle tissues on average (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), the data are entirely inconsistent with the null hypothesis. These results indicate that there is no such thing as a representative skeletal muscle tissue. Instead, skeletal muscle should be viewed as a family of related tissues with a common contractile function but widely divergent physiology, metabolism, morphology, and developmental history. Based on these antecedents, it comes as no surprise that the transcriptional programs maintaining skeletal muscle specialization in adults are highly divergent as well.</p><p>This study is the first systematic examination of transcriptome diversity in skeletal muscle. At greater than 200 million aligned short nucleotide reads per tissue and six biological replicates apiece, this data set is unprecedented in its scope, accuracy, and reproducibility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1âfigure supplement 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1âfigure supplement 4</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Moreover, the depth of sequencing allows the detection of previously unannotated transcripts that may play a role in muscle physiology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s7">Figure 1âfigure supplement 7</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp7">Supplementary file 7</xref>Â andÂ <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp8">8</xref>).</p><p>Besides establishing that skeletal muscles have considerable differences in their transcriptomes, the key significance of this paper will be as a resource for future studies. Therefore, we have made our analyzed data freely available (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://muscledb.org">http://muscledb.org</ext-link>), and all raw data may be downloaded from NCBIâs GEO. This resource will allow investigators to perform analyses beyond the scope of this paper, such as generating muscle-specific <italic>Cre</italic>-recombinase mouse strains for genetically manipulating specific muscle groups. Most importantly, these data will provide the foundation for computational modeling of transcription factor networks, a method we believe will uncover the genetic mechanisms that establish and maintain muscle specialization. To this end, we have used principal component analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) and related approaches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1âfigure supplement 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s7">Figure 1âfigure supplement 7</xref>) to show that expression of key skeletal muscle genes including different versions of <italic>Troponin</italic>, <italic>Tropomyosin</italic>, and <italic>Calsequestrin</italic> are highly predictive of skeletal muscle identity. Moreover, we used pathway analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>) to identify 20 candidate transcription factors that may drive transcriptional specialization in muscle cells.</p><p>One potential criticism is that gene expression does not always predict protein level and therefore function. We acknowledge that many processes besides steady-state mRNA levels regulate protein expression. Nevertheless, regulation of mRNA expression is unquestionably of biological importance in muscle cells, and transcriptional profiling predicts the majority of protein expression levels even in highly dynamic settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Robles et al., 2014</xref>). Moreover, the larger dynamic range of RNAseq measurements permits a more comprehensive description of expression profiles than would be possible with existing proteomic technology. We look forward to proteomic studies making use of these mRNA data, especially the identification of novel spliceforms, to generate improved catalogs of protein expression in skeletal muscle.</p><p>We further acknowledge that the samples collected and analyzed in this study are bulk tissues rather than single-fiber preparations, and that contaminating tissues such as vasculature and immune cells may influence some gene expression measurements. However, our data agrees with the few single-fiber profiling papers in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chemello et al., 2011</xref>), indicating that this potential bias is unlikely to confound the major observations herein. Consistent with this, the genes whose expression is most predictive of skeletal muscle identity are almost unanimously canonical skeletal muscle genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). Furthermore, we emphasize that the majority of studies in the field use bulk tissues rather than single cell preparations. As such, our experimental design yields the greatest possible consistency with previous and future studies. In short, we believe whole tissue expression profiling provides a critical reference point and the rationale for follow-up work examining single-fiber gene expression.</p><p>Acquired and genetic diseases show remarkable selectivity in which muscles they affect and which muscles they spare. For example, Duchenne muscular dystrophy severely affects the diaphragm and proximal limb extensors, while oculopharyngeal dystrophy causes weakness in the neck, facial, and extraocular muscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Emery, 2002</xref>). At present, there is no satisfying explanation for how this occurs. A reasonable hypothesis is that intrinsic properties of muscle cells, such as gene expression, determine their sensitivity to different pathological mechanisms. These data are a starting point for future studies on how specialized transcriptional programs in muscles are maintained and how they ultimately influence disease. As an illustrative example, we note that the naturally elevated expression of <italic>Pkm</italic> in <italic>EDL</italic> may in part explain how this muscle is most dramatically affected in mouse models of myotonic dystrophy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p><p>Finally, skeletal muscle is an endocrine organ that regulates many normal and pathological processes, including sleep, bone health, diabetes, cancer, and cardiovascular disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Giudice and Taylor, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Iizuka et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Karsenty and Olson, 2016</xref>). At roughly 40% of an adult humanâs body weight, skeletal muscle has an enormous capacity to influence other tissues through the expression of local or systemic signaling molecules. This study reveals extensive differential expression of putative myokines with largely unexplored functional significance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7âfigure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp10">Supplementary file 10</xref>).

For modules of interest, transcripts were converted from either Refseq or UCSC IDs to gene symbols using the biotools.fr online converter.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Validation and novel splicing events</title><p>Independent biological replicates of mouse <italic>EDL</italic> and <italic>soleus</italic> tissues were collected as described above. Total RNA was purified and integrity was verified as described above. Reverse transcription reactions were performed with 500 ng starting material using the manufacturerâs protocol (TaqMan Fast Universal PCR Master Mix, Applied Biosystems). qPCR was performed with ABI Taqman probes on a Stratagene MX3005 instrument (Pcp4l1:mm01295270_m1, Fam129a:mm00452065_m1, Fhl2, mm00515781_m1, Tsga10:mm01228282_m1, Stau2:mm00491782_m1, Prkag3:mm00463997_m1, Mstn:mm01254559_m1, Plcd4:mm00455768_m1, Myl1:mm00659043_m1, Igfbp5:mm00516037_m1, Ipo8:mm01255158_m1) using the manufacturerâs recommendations.</p><p>To identify novel splicing events, previously unknown introns were identified from the junctions_all.rum file in RUMâs output. These results were then sorted by the number of reads aligning to that splice junction and manually curated for follow-up studies. To validate novel splicing events, PCR reactions were performed using 1 ul of the reverse transcription reaction using the manufacturerâs protocol (Clontech Takara PCR kit). PCR products were visualized on a 1% agarose gel using conventional methods. The primary PCR products for <italic>EDL</italic> and <italic>soleus</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s7">Figure 1âfigure supplement 7D</xref>) from primers Exon 2-Â &gt;Â Exon 2.1 and Exon2 -Â &gt;Â Exon3 were excised, purified, and TOPO cloned using the manufacturerâs protocol (TOPO TA, Thermo Fisher). Cloned fragments were sequenced using conventional Sanger methods. All PCR primers were ordered from IDT; primer locations are described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s7">Figure 1âfigure supplement 7C</xref>. Primer sequences as follows: Exon 2 â AGGATCTCAGATTTGCTCACG, Exon 2.1 â GGATCCACTTTCCAGAATGC, Exon 2.2 â CATCTTTGCACCTGCATTC, Exon 3 â TATGGTCCAACCGTGCACTA, CtrlF â AGTGTGGGCGTCATCACAT, CtrlR â GTGGAGCTTGTGGTCTGACA.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Immunohistochemistry</title><p>Validation experiments using immunohistochemistry were performed for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1âfigure supplement 6</xref> using the following antibodies: UPK1B polyclonal antibody 1:200 (PAB25730, Abnova) and BBOX1 polyclonal antibody 1:400 (NBP1-32327, Novus Biologicals).

Using RNA-sequencing, the authors assembled a dataset, termed MuscleDB, to reveal the transcriptional diversity of muscle tissues. Overall, the manuscript has good experimental design and quality control to ensure data accuracy and reproducibility (e.g. high replicate number for RNA-seq experiments, adequate sequencing depth and data validation). The work presents a new dataset to fill the knowledge gap regarding to whole muscle diversity. However, the data suggests that neither developmental history nor fiber composition could be the explanation of transcriptome diversity among different muscles and the question was left unanswered. Also, as mRNA levels are measured in a whole muscle context, the underlying complexity of different cell types within different muscles can affect the result of RNA-seq profiling. For instance, the level of MyoD is known to be high in the muscle stem cells (or satellite cells), but not in the rest of skeletal muscle tissue. It is not surprising that analyses concerning important regulatory factors are inconclusive. Lastly, the section regarding the hypothetical use of this dataset is highly speculative that is better suited for Discussion and not as a part of the Results section. Together, these concerns greatly reduce the impact of the work.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>The manuscript by Terry et al. reports the results from transcriptional profiling of 11 different mouse skeletal muscles and comparing these profiles among the mouse muscle groups, rat EDL and soleus and mouse cardiac and smooth muscle. The study clearly shows that there is huge diversity among skeletal muscles with respect to transcriptional profiles. The authors have created a readily accessible database (Muscle DB) to provide other researchers access to these data. This is a carefully performed study that is likely to help determine why select muscles are affected in some muscle diseases. The paper also shows clearly that neither fiber type or developmental history alone can explain the diversity of transcriptional profiles. The data generated in this study are likely to be mined for many years to come. The remarkable diversity in transcriptional profiles also clearly demonstrates that there is no such thing as a truly representative muscles (i.e., EDL as fast twitch and soleus as slow twitch) and hence, when analyzing animal models of humans disease, it will be important to study more muscle groups to truly assess the consequences of disease. The data are also likely to be important for identifying new drug targets. While it would have been even more exciting if a disease model had been included, there is no doubt that this study will contribute greatly to the muscle field.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>In the current manuscript entitled &quot;Transcriptional profiling reveals extraordinary diversity among skeletal muscle tissues&quot;, the authors addressed an important and outstanding issue in the field of skeletal muscle research: how similar or different are the tissues from distinct skeletal muscle groups?</p><p>A major strength of this manuscript is that it assessed this issue on a comprehensive level.</p><p>Based on their analysis, the authors concluded that distinct skeletal muscle groups are profoundly different in their gene expression profiles, and provided some useful and novel examples to understand these differences and exploit this information for potential advancement of our understanding of muscle disease pathogenesis and improvement of disease treatment.

We argue that a complete understanding of this requires the concerted efforts of many different labs using diverse technical approaches. At a minimum, one would like to see genetic manipulation of key muscle regulatory factors in mice, and subsequent observations of how those changes influence the molecular, physiological, and histological identity of different skeletal muscles. The significance of our Resource is to point the field towards this critical unanswered question and to identify candidate regulatory genes for future studies. Our revised manuscript now contains a variety of pathway analyses, identifying 20 high-confidence candidate transcription factors that may drive muscle specialization (Figure 5 and Table 2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A major strength of this manuscript is that it assessed this issue on a comprehensive level.</p><p>A major concern is whether this manuscript is more appropriately suited in a specialized journal.</p></disp-quote><p>Regarding concerns that this article belongs in a more specialized journal, we respectfully disagree. Every major gene expression atlas published to date has profiled at most one ârepresentativeâ skeletal muscle tissue. The reviewers unanimously agree that our data contradicts this implicit assumption. Nevertheless, the myth that skeletal muscle is homogeneous has been perpetuated in the top echelon of academic journals, including Science, Nature, Cell, and PNAS. Such a pervasive blind spot limits both the functional genomics and skeletal muscle fields. Moreover, the data presented herein will find application in the fields of developmental biology and tissue engineering. Challenging a significant and systematic error in the literature is entirely consistent with the publicly stated aims of <italic>eLife</italic>âs editorial leadership.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major issues:</p><p>1) Due to the tissue harvesting procedures and the nature of bulk RNA-Seq used in this manuscript, it is likely that at least part of the differences observed among distinct skeletal muscle groups could be due to the other cell types present in the muscle tissues rather than from the skeletal muscles per se. Confirmation in MSCs/FAPs and endothelial cells versus purified single fibers from EDL and FDB would provide support.</p></disp-quote><p>We acknowledge that some differential expression in our data is likely due to other cell types and emphasize that to maximize the broad applicability of this Resource, we have chosen to replicate the most common experimental design in the field. Furthermore, we do not believe this caveat calls into question the observation that skeletal muscle transcriptomes are highly divergent, since the sheer magnitude of differential expression in these data is unlikely to come from a minority of nearby cells.</p><p>To address the reviewersâ concern directly, we have performed principal component (PC) analysis on the transcriptomes of every tissue studied (Figure 2). We find PC1 accounts for ~80% of variance in the entire dataset, and that PC1 separates different skeletal muscles. In contrast, PC2 accounts for ~8% of variance, and differentiates smooth from cardiac muscles. Naturally, every remaining PC contributed less to the variance than PC1 and PC2. We then measured component loading for a number of RNA markers of different constituent cell types against PC1. We note that <italic>Pecam1</italic>, a marker of endothelial cells, had the greatest correlation with PC1 of all marker genes (R<sup>2</sup> value of ~0.5). Moreover, we note that the top 100 genes correlated with PC1 (min R<sup>2</sup> value = 0.84; max R<sup>2</sup> = 0.99) were almost unanimously canonical skeletal muscle genes (Supplementary file 3). Extending on this observation, we observed that some of these genes were negatively correlated with PC1 (i.e., there were both positive and negative r values), which contradicts the trivial explanation that PC1 is simply a measure of the abundance of muscle cells relative to contaminating cell types in any given sample.</p><p>We therefore conclude that the majority of transcriptional differences in this dataset are the result of genuinely different transcriptional programs in skeletal muscle cells. We acknowledge in the Results and Discussion that differential cellular composition, especially from endothelial cells, may contribute to tissue identity; an observation that â by itself â may be of further interest to the field.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) A considerable number of conclusions are solely based on the RNA-Seq data without further experimental validation. For example, in Figure 4 the authors showed two examples of genes that can distinguish DIA and FDB, respectively, from all the other skeletal muscle types examined. The authors should also provide additional evidence to confirm their findings, such as RNA in situ hybridization or tissue IHC. As unique skeletal muscle type markers can be very valuable to the field, I suggest the authors to perform a more systematic analysis to find unique markers for all the skeletal muscle types in their study, and back up some of the markers using in situ or IHC as suggested above.</p></disp-quote><p>Every reasonable step has been taken to cross-validate the accuracy of our RNA-seq data, including qPCR validation of biologically independent samples (Figure 1âfigure supplement 4), analysis of replicate reproducibility (Figure 1âfigure supplement 3), and computational simulations of appropriate read depth (Figure 1âfigure supplement 2). Furthermore, whenever possible, we have tested our data against the literature for both RNA and protein expression of known internal controls (Figures 3, 4, Figure 1âfigure supplement 4, and Figure 3âfigure supplement 1). We acknowledge that RNA expression does not correlate linearly with protein expression in both the Results and Discussion, but we emphasize that only RNAseq has the dynamic range and throughput to execute a study of this magnitude with any degree of accuracy or reproducibility.</p><p>The RNAseq analysis did identify some unique genes expressed in selected skeletal muscles and in response to the Reviewer we used immunohistochemistry to localize expression of Bbox1, enriched in the FDB muscles, and Upk1b, enriched in the diaphragm. We purchased and tested commercially available antibodies to these two proteins but we were not able to obtain images of even positive control tissues such as the bladder for Upk1b.</p><p>The primary challenge is that these antibodies are not commonly used, as evidenced by the lack of references in the literature from tissue samples. These genes are not well studied in any tissue and the antibodies have not been validated for IHC on frozen sections. For Upk1b, a Pubmed search pulled up a total of 59 references with the predominant tissue being bladder and 0 references when including skeletal muscle. The antibody data sheet showed staining in human bladder but listed no publications in which the antibody was used. For Bbox1, a Pubmed search yielded 18 total references and none with skeletal muscle. The antibody to Bbox1 is available through Novus and we tested it on many different muscle and non-muscle mouse tissues (frozen sections) and we obtained no specific staining. It should be noted that there are no published papers using this antibody and the western blot data presented comes from cell extracts of unknown origin.</p><p>Recognizing this uncertainty, we have moved the tissue specificity figure to the supplements (Figure 1âfigure supplement 6), and we acknowledge in the Results that future studies to generate muscle-specific promoter lines will require validation of these observations at the protein level. To assist follow-up studies, we now provide a table listing the most specific gene in every skeletal muscle tissue as the reviewer requested (Supplementary file 6). We further note that some of the most specific genes, such as <italic>Myh7</italic> in the soleus, have been extensively validated using IHC and Western Blot analysis (e.g., Burkholder et al. (1994)).</p><p>Finally, we emphasize that although the observation of tissue-specific gene expression supports our overall contention that skeletal muscles have distinct transcriptional programs, validation via IHC is not necessary to confirm this paperâs essential observation regarding specialization of RNA profiles, especially in light of the principal component analysis described above (point #1). Instead, we argue that these tissue-specific expression data should be evaluated as a Resource for generating mouse genetic reagents in follow-up studies, and that the most likely application â generating promoter:Cre fusions â depend more on RNA expression patterns than protein.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) To obtain a better overview of transcriptional differences among muscle groups, it is advisable to perform GO analysis to examine what functionally-related gene sets are preferentially enriched among distinct skeletal muscle groups.</p></disp-quote><p>We used NCBIâs DAVID to identify enriched GO terms in every pairwise comparison (N = 110) of differentially expressed genes in skeletal muscle tissues. We then consolidated these enriched pathways based on the number of times they occur for each tissue. These analyses are now included as Figure 2âfigure supplement 1. We found that a variety of terms related to structural components of the sarcomere (Z-disc, A-band, etc.) were common between different skeletal muscle tissues, as well as terms involved in extracellular matrix components, such as Heparin, Collagen, and Integrin. These observations are consistent with the genes most strongly correlated with sample identity being differentially expressed genes of skeletal muscle origin, as discussed in point #1 above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) As transcription factors (TFs) commonly serve as nodes of gene expression regulation, it is recommended to perform TF network analysis to examine major TFs/TF networks that drive the transcriptional differences among muscle groups.</p></disp-quote><p>We used the same lists of differentially expressed genes from pairwise tissue comparisons (N = 110) as described in Point #3 above in conjunction with Ingenuity Pathway Analysis to predict transcription factors upstream of differentially expressed genes for each skeletal muscle tissue. We then consolidated this list by identifying transcription factors predicted to be upstream of the differentially expressed genes in multiple tissues, as well as being themselves differentially regulated. Table 2 summarizes these data and presents 20 high confidence transcription factors as well as the functionally significant muscle genes with whom they interact.</p><p>These data are presented in a visual network diagram in Figure 5. Key differentially expressed genes, such as <italic>Myostatin</italic> and <italic>Vegfa</italic>, are included with the transcription factors predicted to regulate their expression. Additionally, we show links between these genes and known regulatory events influencing muscle disease and physiology.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) WGCNA analysis can be performed to examine the major and unique sets of genes that define each muscle groups. It can be helpful to include also smooth and cardiac muscles as an internal control for the analysis.</p></disp-quote><p>We performed WGCNA analysis using two different sets of input data: (1) expression data condensed into the primary groups of cardiac, smooth, skeletal muscle cluster 1, and skeletal muscle cluster 2, and (2) expression data from all 17 mouse tissues (Figure 2âfigure supplement 2). The identities of the most statistically significant clusters of genes are available in Supplementary files 4 and 5. GO analysis of these gene lists revealed that the most statistically significant clusters were enriched in skeletal muscle-specific genes, consistent with points #1 (PCA) and #3 (GO analysis) described above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Try to identify molecular correlates of muscle diversity.</p></disp-quote><p>Principal component analysis (point #1 above) revealed that the genes most strongly correlated with muscle identity are conventional skeletal muscle genes, including different versions of <italic>Troponin, Tropomyosin, Titin, Calsequestrin, Myosin heavy chain</italic>, and <italic>Myosin light chain</italic> (Supplementary file 3). Furthermore, we used pathway analyses (point #4 above) to predict the transcription factors upstream of these genes (Table 2). This study revealed an interconnected web of transcription factors, effector genes, and muscle disease (Figure 5). The available data suggest that the relative expression of various characteristic skeletal muscle genes determines tissue specialization, and further suggests candidate transcription factors that may drive the establishment and maintenance of these transcriptional programs. We make special note of <italic>Smarca4</italic>, the most statistically significant candidate TF. <italic>Smarca4</italic> activates muscle gene transcription, suggesting a link between muscle differentiation and specialization in adulthood (Albini et al. (2015)). These new results suggest novel hypotheses that may be tested regarding the molecular drivers of muscle diversity and underscore the importance that this dataset be made available to the community.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) As a Resource, paper the authors should list all the differentially expressed genes and novel splicing events in an excel spreadsheet.</p></disp-quote><p>All differentially expressed transcripts among skeletal muscles are now available as Supplementary file 2.
