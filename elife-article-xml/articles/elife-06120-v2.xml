One common modification is to add a phosphate group to the protein, which is performed by enzymes called protein kinases. Although most of the protein kinases work on proteins inside the cell, it was discovered recently that a small group of kinases work within the ‘secretory pathway’ and modify proteins that are released (or secreted) out of cells.</p><p>One such secretory pathway kinase—called Fam20C—phosphorylates a wide range of secreted proteins and helps to ensure the proper development of bones and teeth. Specifically, Fam20C and a closely related protein called Fam20A are important for forming enamel, the hardest substance in human body, which makes up the outer surface of teeth. However, the exact role of Fam20A is unknown.</p><p>Cui et al. now show that Fam20A binds to Fam20C, and this increases the ability of Fam20C to phosphorylate the proteins that form the ‘matrix’ that guides the deposition of the enamel minerals. Furthermore, mutations in Fam20A lead to the inefficient phosphorylation of enamel matrix proteins by Fam20C, and prevent proper enamel formation. The results raise the possibility that similar mechanisms of secretory kinase activation may also be important in other biological processes where many secreted proteins need to be phosphorylated rapidly.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06120.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06120.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>kinase complex</kwd><kwd>extracellular protein phosphorylation</kwd><kwd>secretory pathway phosphorylation</kwd><kwd>pseudokinase</kwd><kwd>tooth enamel formation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A pseudokinase in the secretory pathway, Fam20A, activates the real Golgi casein kinase, Fam20C, via a unique mechanism that is lost in human diseases.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Reversible phosphorylation is a fundamental mechanism used to regulate cellular signaling and protein function. In the past several decades, efforts have been focused on understanding phosphorylation events in the cytoplasm and nucleus. However, little is known about the function and regulation of protein phosphorylation within the secretory pathway, despite the fact that numerous secreted proteins that carry out important biological functions are phosphorylated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bahl et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zhou et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Carrascal et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Salih et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Stone et al., 2011</xref>). This is likely because the kinases in the secretory pathway have only recently been discovered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ishikawa et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Tagliabracci et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bordoli et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Our laboratory recently identified a family of secretory pathway kinases, which includes the ortholog of <italic>Drosophila</italic> Four-jointed (Fj) as well as Fam20A, Fam20B, Fam20C, Fam198A and Fam198B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ishikawa et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Tagliabracci et al., 2012</xref>). Fam20C was identified as the long-sought Golgi casein kinase, which phosphorylates secreted proteins within Ser-x-Glu/phospho-Ser (SxE/pS) motifs, including casein and members of the secretory calcium binding phosphoprotein (SCPP) family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kawasaki and Weiss, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Tagliabracci et al., 2012</xref>). Furthermore, some 75% of phosphoproteins identified in human serum and cerebrospinal fluid contain phosphate within the Fam20C consensus sequence, suggesting that Fam20C may have a broad spectrum of substrates and therefore play a major role in establishing the secreted phosphoproteome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bahl et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zhou et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Salvi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tagliabracci et al., 2013</xref>). Nonetheless, how Fam20C is regulated is unknown. In addition to Fam20C, Fj, the founding member of the family, phosphorylates extracellular cadherin domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ishikawa et al., 2008</xref>). Fam20B phosphorylates xylose within a tetrasaccharide linkage region of O-linked proteoglycans and functions to promote glycosaminoglycan chain elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Koike et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wen et al., 2014</xref>). The biochemical functions of the other members of this protein family are unknown. Here we address the function of Fam20A, the closest paralog of Fam20C.</p><p>Both Fam20C and Fam20A are implicated in biomineralization. Fam20C deficiency in humans is associated with a severe and often lethal osteosclerotic bone dysplasia known as Raine syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Simpson et al., 2007</xref>). Patients with non-lethal forms of Raine syndrome exhibit hypophosphatemia, ectopic calcifications and dental anomalies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Simpson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fradin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Rafaelsen et al., 2013</xref>). These patients have misformed dentin and enamel, suggesting that Fam20C is essential for dentinogenesis and amelogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fradin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Rafaelsen et al., 2013</xref>). Furthermore, patients with <italic>FAM20A</italic> gene mutations also develop disorders of enamel formation referred to as Amelogenesis Imperfecta (AI), which is often accompanied by ectopic calcification, such as nephrocalcinosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">O'Sullivan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cho et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jaureguiberry et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cabral et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wang et al., 2013a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kantaputra et al., 2014a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">2014b</xref>). Notably, both Fam20A-knockout (KO) and Fam20C-KO mouse models have been generated and they exhibit similar enamel phenotypes, suggesting that Fam20A and Fam20C might function in the same pathway to control enamel formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Vogel et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wang et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">2013c</xref>).</p><p>Further evidence to support a role for extracellular protein phosphorylation in the regulation of enamel formation comes from the discovery that AI can be caused by a missense mutation in the secreted protein enamelin (ENAM) that disrupts phosphorylation within an SxE motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chan et al., 2010</xref>). ENAM is an enamel matrix protein that, together with amelogenin X (AMELX), ameloblastin (AMBN) and amelotin (AMTN), makes up a subfamily of the SCPPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kawasaki and Weiss, 2008</xref>). These proteins are secreted from specialized cells known as ameloblasts and act as a scaffold for enamel calcification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Moradian-Oldak, 2012</xref>). ENAM, AMELX, AMBN and AMTN are all phosphorylated within SxE motifs and are therefore potential Fam20C substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kawasaki and Weiss, 2008</xref>). In addition to ENAM phosphorylation, phosphorylation within a conserved SxE motif in AMELX also appears to be important for enamel mineralization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kwak et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Here we show that Fam20C phosphorylates enamel matrix proteins in vitro and in cells. Even though Fam20A lacks a residue critical for catalysis and appears to be a pseudokinase, it forms a functional complex with Fam20C and allosterically activates Fam20C to efficiently phosphorylate secreted proteins. Our results reveal a novel mechanism to regulate secretory protein phosphorylation, and provide a molecular link between an observed biochemical function of Fam20A and the phenotype of patients with AI.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Fam20C phosphorylates enamel matrix proteins in vitro and in ameloblasts</title><p>To determine whether enamel matrix proteins are substrates of Fam20C, we expressed and purified recombinant human AMELX, AMTN, and the conserved proteolytic fragment of ENAM (aa173–277) found in developing enamel as 6× His tag-fusion proteins in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Al-Hashimi et al., 2009</xref>). Recombinant Fam20C phosphorylated each of these proteins in a time-dependent manner in vitro, whereas an inactive Fam20C D478A mutant did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). ENAM (173–277) contains two SxE motifs (S191 and S216), both of which are highly conserved and known to be phosphorylated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fukae et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Al-Hashimi et al., 2009</xref>). As mentioned above, a S216L mutation causes AI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chan et al., 2010</xref>). We generated ENAM S191A and S216L mutants and tested them as substrates for Fam20C. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, both the S191A and S216L ENAM mutants exhibited markedly reduced phosphorylation by Fam20C. Further, mutation of both Ser residues completely abolished Fam20C-dependent phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Thus, Fam20C phosphorylates ENAM (173–277) on S191 and S216.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06120.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Fam20C phosphorylates the enamel matrix proteins within SxE motifs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Phosphorylation of enamel matrix proteins by Fam20C in vitro. 250 μg/ml purified recombinant human ENAM (173–277), AMTN or AMELX was incubated with recombinant Fam20C, Fam20C-D478A (DA) or Fam20A (5 μg/ml) at 30°C in the presence of [γ-<sup>32</sup>P]-ATP.

Most of the residues important for Fam20C activity are conserved in Fam20A, including the metal-binding Asp (D478 in human Fam20C), the catalytic Asp (D458 in human Fam20C), and the ion pair (K285 and E311 in human Fam20C) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). However, a conserved Glu in Fam20C (E306 in human), which coordinates the Mn<sup>2+</sup> ion and the ion-pair Lys and is indispensable for Fam20C kinase activity, is replaced by a Gln (Q258 in human) in all Fam20A orthologs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Xiao et al., 2013</xref>]).

Recombinant Fam20C E306Q exhibited greatly reduced in vitro kinase activity towards casein, ENAM (173–277), as well as osteopontin (OPN), an SCPP and model substrate of Fam20C, as compared to WT Fam20C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Accordingly, the intrinsic ATPase activity of Fam20C E306Q was abolished (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Conversely, Fam20A Q258E was able to hydrolyze ATP and phosphorylate OPN, albeit less robustly than Fam20C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E,F</xref>).

This effect was not solely restricted to enamel proteins because phosphorylation of V5-tagged OPN was also dramatically reduced in Fam20A-KO ALCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).

When both Fam20A and Fam20C were included in the reactions, ENAM (173–277) was readily phosphorylated. However, the S191A/S216L double mutant was not, even though it contains 21 additional Ser/Thr/Tyr residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). These results demonstrate that the phosphorylation remains specific to SxE motifs. Further, we replaced each of the Ser and Thr residues with Ala in SUMO-AMBN-N. In vitro kinase assays confirmed that the phosphorylation was specific for SxE in the presence of Fam20A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). As anticipated, the kinase activity of Fam20C was indispensable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). These results point to a model where Fam20A functions as an activator of Fam20C kinase activity.</p><p>To verify this model, we sought to rule out the possibility that Fam20A could be phosphorylated and activated by Fam20C. We pre-incubated Fam20C and excessive Fam20A with ATP on ice or at 30°C prior to the addition of ENAM (173–277) and [γ-<sup>32</sup>P]-ATP, and monitored ENAM phosphorylation. Pre-incubation of Fam20A and Fam20C with ATP at 30°C would allow Fam20C to phosphorylate Fam20A; however, this did not increase subsequent ENAM phosphorylation when compared to conditions where pre-incubation was carried out on ice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, group 2 and 3). Furthermore, ENAM phosphorylation remained constant when Fam20A and Fam20C were pre-incubated with ATP or AMP-PCP, a non-hydrolyzable ATP analogue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, group 3 and 4). These findings suggest that the increase of substrate phosphorylation in the presence of Fam20A and Fam20C does not require Fam20C-dependent phosphorylation of Fam20A.</p><p>To further confirm that the putative catalytic activity of Fam20A was not required for the increase in Fam20C-dependent substrate phosphorylation, we mutated the putative metal binding Asp of Fam20A (D430A). Although mutation of the corresponding residue in Fam20C eliminated its kinase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), expression of Flag-tagged Fam20A D430A in Fam20A-KO ALCs increased Fam20C-dependent OPN phosphorylation similar to that of WT Fam20A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). Recombinant Fam20A D430A also enhanced ENAM phosphorylation by Fam20C in vitro, although slightly less effectively than WT Fam20A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). Moreover, Fam20A Q258E, which acquires kinase activity, did not phosphorylate Fam20C and was less potent than WT Fam20A to potentiate Fam20C-catalyzed ENAM phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>).

However, when expressed in mammalian cells, both Fam20A and Fam20C are localized in the Golgi and are secreted into the conditioned medium at comparable levels ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Tagliabracci et al., 2012</xref>] and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>).

As expected, WT and non-lethal Fam20C mutants (T268M and P328S), but none of the other mutants induced a mobility shift in OPN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>), consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Tagliabracci et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">2014</xref>).

In the Fam20A/Fam20C complex, Fam20C is catalytically active, whereas Fam20A functions as an allosteric activator to increase Fam20C kinase activity. Because the residual time of secreted proteins within the secretory pathway is limited, the formation of Fam20A/Fam20C complex, whose turnover number (<italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub>) is dramatically increased, may reflect an important mechanism to achieve high stoichiometry of secreted proteins phosphorylation. Our model suggests that loss-of-function mutations in Fam20A result in inefficient phosphorylation of enamel matrix proteins by Fam20C, which prevents proper enamel formation and leads to AI. The degree of phosphorylation of enamel matrix proteins required for proper enamel formation is unknown. However, patients with hypomorphic mutations in Fam20C, including T268M and P328S, survive infancy but developed dental defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fradin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Rafaelsen et al., 2013</xref>), indicating that optimal Fam20C activity is critical for enamel formation.</p><p>Our proposed mechanism for activation of Fam20C by Fam20A is supported by the fact that both Fam20A and Fam20C deficiency result in impaired biomineralization in humans and mice. In contrast to Fam20C, which is ubiquitously expressed, Fam20A expression has only been detected in dental tissues, lactating mammary gland, parathyroid gland and kidney (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Vogel et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). Further, Fam20A deficiency does not cause complete loss of Fam20C-dependent substrate phosphorylation. These are consistent with the fact that patients harboring Fam20A mutations display mild and localized biomineralization phenotypes, as compared to the more severe forms caused by Fam20C mutations.</p><p>It is increasingly apparent that in addition to phosphotranfer, kinase domain-containing proteins can play non-catalytic roles as scaffolds or allosteric regulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zeqiraj and van Aalten, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Shaw et al., 2014</xref>). Approximately 10% of the human kinome encodes pseudokinases, which are predicted to lack essential catalytic residues and primarily exert non-catalytic functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Manning et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zeqiraj and van Aalten, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Shaw et al., 2014</xref>). Several pseudokinase-kinase pairs have been revealed, where a pseudokinase binds and potentiates an active kinase. For example, the pseudokinase STRAD, together with MO25, forms a complex with LKB1 and activates LKB1 kinase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zeqiraj et al., 2009a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">2009b</xref>). Similarly, the pseudokinase domain of HER3 can dimerize with and allosterically activate catalytically active EGFRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zhang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jura et al., 2009</xref>). Furthermore, the pesudokinase-like inactivated BRAF, generated through binding to ATP-competitive inhibitors or mutation of a residue in the catalytic spine (C-spine), can still allosterically activate other RAF family kinases via dimerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hatzivassiliou et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Heidorn et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Poulikakos et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hu et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">2013</xref>). Fam20A lacks a negatively charged residue that is critical for kinase activity and therefore is a pseudokinase. Nevertheless, it binds and increases Fam20C activity in a phosphorylation-independent manner. Discovery of the Fam20A-Fam20C pair extends the concept that the activity of a kinase can be allosterically regulated by dimerization with an inactive paralog, which further expands the pseudokinase-kinase mode of regulation to protein phosphorylation within the secretory pathway.</p><p>Our result suggests that Fam20A binds ATP, which may stabilize a conformational state that is required for the allosteric function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). This mechanism has been reported for other pseudokinases. For instance, the crystal structure of the LKB1-STRAD-MO25 complex revealed that upon binding to ATP and MO25, STRAD was maintained in an active conformation and engaged LKB1 as its ‘pseudo-substrate’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zeqiraj et al., 2009a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">2009b</xref>). In agreement with the potential role of ATP in stabilizing Fam20A conformation, Fam20A Q258E, which is able to hydrolyze ATP and therefore will not be locked in an ATP-binding conformation, is less potent than WT Fam20A to activate Fam20C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2 fig4">Figures 2E, 4G</xref>).</p><p>Although dimerization-induced allostery has emerged as a mechanism to regulate protein kinase activity, the interfaces used for mediating kinase domain association appear to be highly diverse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lavoie et al., 2014</xref>). The architecture of the Fam20A/Fam20C complex, as well as the detailed mechanism by which interactions between Fam20A and Fam20C increase the kinase activity of Fam20C, are currently unclear. However, the ability of Fam20A to increase the activity of Fam20C mutants identified in patients may lead to a method to allosterically boost Fam20C activity and this may have therapeutic potential. A crystal structure of the Fam20A/Fam20C complex will be of paramount importance.</p><p>As mentioned above, in addition to its critical role in biomineralization, Fam20C also appears to be important for maintaining the secreted phosphoproteome. However, regulation of Fam20C-dependent secreted protein phosphorylation is poorly understood. Our data demonstrate that Fam20C activity can be allosterically potentiated by Fam20A, and this increased catalytic activity is critical for enamel formation. Because the expression of Fam20A is tissue-specific, it is unlikely that Fam20A functions as a global regulator of Fam20C, arguing the existence of additional regulatory mechanisms for Fam20C activity. Indeed, we show that both Fam20A and Fam20C mRNA levels are dramatically increased in the lactating mammary gland, suggesting transcriptional regulation, which may involve pregnancy-related hormones.</p><p>In conclusion, our work suggests a model by which Fam20A regulates secretory pathway phosphorylation and tooth enamel formation via activation of Fam20C. We hypothesize that in cells where Fam20A and Fam20C are co-expressed, Fam20A forms a complex with Fam20C and enhances its kinase activity, leading to high levels of substrate phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). This would be especially important in the biological processes where large amounts of substrates need to be phosphorylated, such as teeth development or milk production. Conversely, Fam20A deficiency results in reduced Fam20C activity and basal levels of substrate phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). Phenotypes, such as enamel defects, will present when the basal phosphorylation is insufficient to support the corresponding biological process. Thus, our findings have uncovered a novel mechanism to regulate secretory pathway phosphorylation and biomineralization.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cloning</title><p>Human cDNAs for FAM20A, FAM20B, FAM20C, ENAM and AMELX were from Open Biosystems.

The following primers were used to screen for the disrupted alleles: mouse <italic>Fam20a</italic>, 5′-GGTCCCCAAGTTCAGGGAAG-3′ (forward) and 5′-CTGTGACGGCAGAGTGAAGT-3′ (reverse); mouse <italic>Fam20c</italic>, 5′-CATGAAGATGATACTGGTGCG-3′ (forward) and 5′-GTCGCTGTTCACATTAAACAG-3′ (reverse).</p><p>FAM20C-KO U2OS cell line was generated by means of transcription activator-like effector nuclease (TALEN). A TALEN binding pair was designed to target the exon 1 of human <italic>FAM20C</italic> gene. The genomic recognition sequences for the left and right TALEN arms are GCGCCGGTTCCGCGTGCT (NN-HD-NN-HD-HD-NN-NN-NG-NG-HD-HD-NN-HD-NN-NG-NN-HD-NG) and GGTGGCCTGCGCGCTGC (NN-HD-NI-NN-HD-NN-HD-NN-HD-NI-NN-NN-HD-HD-NI-HD-HD), respectively. TALEN vectors were assembled using the Golden Gate method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cermak et al., 2011</xref>). The cutting activity of the designed TALEN pair was measured by the SURVEYOR assay (Transgenomics, Omaha, NE). To isolate Fam20C-KO clones, U2OS cells were transfected with the TALEN plasmids by electroporation and subjected to limiting dilution. Cell clones were expanded and genomic DNA was isolated using Quick-gDNA MiniPrep kit (Zymo Research). Disruption of <italic>FAM20C</italic> gene was assessed by PCR using primers 5′-GGACCCACACGCCCG-3′ (forward) and 5′-GCAGGATGCGGAGCG-3′ (reverse) and DNA sequencing. Loss of Fam20C expression was confirmed by immunoblotting.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Mouse mammary gland RNA and protein isolation, fractionation and qRT-PCR</title><p>Mammary glands were harvested from virgin or lactating C57BL/6 female mice. For generating the whole tissue lysate, mammary glands were homogenized in a buffer containing 50 mM Tris–HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mM NaCl, 0.5% NP-40, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mM EDTA and protease inhibitors cocktail. To enrich the ER/Golgi, mammary glands were homogenized in HME buffer containing 10 mM Tris–HCl (pH 7.4), 250 mM sucrose, 1 mM EDTA and protease inhibitors cocktail. The homogenate was centrifuged at 1000×<italic>g</italic> to remove nuclei and unbroken cells. The supernatant was centrifuged at 3000×<italic>g</italic> to pellet heavy mitochondria. The 3000×<italic>g</italic> supernatant was then centrifuged at 17,000×<italic>g</italic> to pellet the ER, Golgi and light mitochondria. This pellet was resuspended in HME buffer as the ER/Golgi-enriched fraction. For co-immunoprecipitation of Fam20A and Fam20C, NaCl and Triton X-100 were added to the ER/Golgi fraction to the final concentrations of 100 mM and 1%, respectively, prior to the addition of rabbit anti-Fam20C antibody. Normal rabbit IgG was used as control. Immunoprecipitates were subjected to a 6% polyacrylamide gel to separate Fam20A from the heavy chain. Fam20A and Fam20C were detected by immunoblotting.</p><p>For qRT-PCR analysis, total RNA was isolated from lactating or non-lactating mammary glands using the NucleoSpin RNA kit (MACHEREY-NAGEL, Bethlehem, PA). A panel of total RNA isolated from mammary glands at various pregnant/lactating stages was purchased from Zyagen (San Diego, CA). cDNA was synthesized using the iScript kit (Bio-Rad). qRT-PCR analysis was performed using the Power SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Waltham, MA) on Applied Biosystems 7500 Real-Time PCR System with primers as follows: Fam20A, 5′-GGCATCATTGACATGGCCGTCTTT-3′ (forward) and 5′-TTCATCCTGGGAATGTCGTCCGAA-3′ (reverse); Fam20B, 5′-TTCCAAATGGCATGCGATGGTCTG-3′ (forward) and 5′-TAACTGTGGTCCGTAGCTTGCACT-3′ (reverse); Fam20C, 5′-TGAAGATGATACTGGTGCGCAGGT-3′ (forward) and 5′-CAACAGCAATGTGCAAAGCGCAAG-3′ (reverse); Fam198A, 5′-TGACTTTCTGCTTCAGGTCCACGA-3′ (forward) and 5′-ATGCTGAAGGTTGCCAGCATTGTC-3′ (reverse); Fam198B, 5′-AAGCAATGATAGCCATTCCTCTG-3′ (forward) and 5′-CCACTCAGGTCTGGGAACC-3′ (reverse); Fjx1, 5′-CATGCCAGGCTGTTTCCTTTCCAA-3′ (forward) and 5′-TCGGATCCAATCTCCACACAAGCA-3′ (reverse). The expression level of target genes was normalized to that of GAPDH.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We acknowledge John Bartlett (Forsyth Institute) and Toshihiro Sugiyama (Akita University) for kindly providing the ameloblast-like cells.

Reviewers have the opportunity to discuss the decision before the letter is sent (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://elifesciences.org/review-process">review process</ext-link>). Similarly, the author response typically shows only responses to the major concerns raised by the reviewers.</p></boxed-text><p>Your paper has been favorably reviewed by Tony Hunter (Senior editor and Reviewing editor) and three reviewers, who all felt that this is an important advance both in our understanding of Fam20C function and also the enigmatic function of pseudokinases. The evidence that <italic>FAM20A</italic> is a pseudokinase is persuasive, and the fact that you are able to introduce a mutation that reactivates <italic>FAM20A</italic> as an active kinase is striking, since this has not been possible to demonstrate with many other pseudokinases investigated, such as STRAD.</p><p>There is only one experiment that we recommend that you include in a revised version:</p><p>The authors show that Fam20A and Fam20C co-elute by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) consistent with a molecular weight of ∼200 kDa, which they speculate is a 2:2 complex. A relatively straightforward SEC-MALS experiment (or analytic ultracentrifugation), which would yield an absolute mass of the complex, should be performed to clarify this rather important mechanistic point.</p><p>I have included some of the reviewers' minor comments that you may wish to address in a revised version.</p><p>1) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, an alignment of a 13-residue section from various Fam20A and Fam20C kinases is shown. It might be useful to show a more extended alignment along with some other atypical kinases. In the alignment shown in the 2012 Science paper, the conserved “q” and the “e” are in a sequence that was “omitted” from the alignment. The kinase aficionados would probably appreciate a more extensive alignment.</p><p>2) The gel filtration experiments are interesting and deserve some more comment. Does it appear that 20C is a dimer and 20A is a monomer? The data also suggest that in this experiment all of the Fam20A/C is in the complex, and little monomeric 20A or C is present. Why does it then require 15X excess of FAM20A to reach full activity as shown in Figure 5–figure supplement 2? One would expect this just to be dependent on the affinity of the interaction.</p><p>3) It would be interesting to add to the Discussion some speculation as to what some of the advantages of a system like this would be. Potentially, phosphorylation of proteins in the ER might not be desirable and perhaps assembly of the complex only occurs in the Golgi? This could function to control spatially and temporally when kinase activity is present? Is Fam20A targeted differently than Fam20C?</p><p>4) Several of the figures of the paper (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1 fig2 fig3 fig4 fig5">Figures 1-5</xref>) have supplementary panels that go with the figure. In our view many of these panels contain quite important data that could be included in the main figures rather than being in a supplementary figure.</p><p>5) The authors may wish to consider expanding slightly their general discussion on pseudokinases activating protein kinases in the Discussion section. The Fam20A-FAM20C system seems to have similarities with other pseudokinase-kinase pairs such as STRAD and LKB1 that are associated with disease that the general readers may not be aware of. Clearly it seems that major roles for pseudokinases are emerging as activators of protein kinases.</p><p>6) The authors show that the Fam20A mutation Q258E restores weak catalytic activity to Fam20A. It would be interesting to know whether the mutation has any effect on the ability of Fam20A to serve as an allosteric activator of Fam20C. That is, Fam20A Q258E evidently binds ATP, whereas wild-type Fam20A probably does not. Whether Fam20A binds ATP or not presumably affects the stability of the protein, which in turn could affect (positively, one would think) its activator capability.</p><p>I also have a few minor questions of my own that could serve as discussion points:</p><p>1) Does Fam20C phosphorylate Fam20A?</p><p>2) Does reactivated Fam20A phosphorylate Fam20C? Is Fam20C itself phosphorylated, based on MS analysis, and could this be regulatory?</p><p>3) Is Fam20A more tightly anchored in the Golgi than Fam20A, and could it serve as the main retention signal for the Fam20C/Fam20A holoenzyme in cell types that co-express the two proteins?</p><p>4) Is the Fam20C/Fam20A association regulated in any way, and could this be used as a means to modulate Fam20C activity?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06120.020</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>The authors show that Fam20A and Fam20C co-elute by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) consistent with a molecular weight of ∼200 kDa, which they speculate is a 2:2 complex.

This new alignment shows that all the catalytic residues are conserved between Fam20A and Fam20C except for the Q/E. We also added an additional alignment, which includes other atypical kinases as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2–figure supplement 1</xref>. We did not include the conserved E306 of Fam20C in the alignment shown in the 2012 Science paper, because this E is a unique feature of Fam20C and we did not realize its catalytic importance until we solved the Fam20C structure. Further, this E is localized before the αC helix within a long loop that is also Fam20-specific. To provide the reader with a better understanding about the spatial relationship of this E to the canonical kinase ion pair, ion interacting, and catalytic residues, we added a figure of the Fam20C active site as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>.</p><p><italic>2) The gel filtration experiments are interesting and deserve some more comment.

Why does it then require 15X excess of FAM20A to reach full activity as shown in Figure 5–figure supplement 2? One would expect this just to be dependent on the affinity of the interaction</italic>.</p><p>Fam20C eluted as a dimer on gel filtration. Although the major peak on gel filtration appears as a monomer, Fam20A exhibits high heterogeneity and can be found in fractions consistent with a dimer. We believe that Fam20A purified from insect cells equilibrates between monomer and dimer formats, and Fam20C likely stabilizes the Fam20A dimer, which in turn forms the Fam20A/C tetramer. We incorporated these comments in the Results section. We also tested whether or not Fam20A could dimerize in the secretory pathway. We stably co-expressed Flag-tagged and V5-tagged Fam20A in mammalian cells and found that they co-immunoprecipitated from detergent soluble extracts. These results suggest that Fam20A can form a dimer in cells. These results are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>.</p><p>We would like to clarify that not all the Fam20A and Fam20C are in the tetramer on gel filtration. We noticed that the UV trace of Fam20A/C complex was slightly asymmetric with a lag on the lower molecular weight side, indicating heterogeneity and partial dissociation of the complex. Consistent with the gel filtration result, the Fam20A/C complex curve of the analytical ultracentrifugation assay also show a lag towards lower molecular mass (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Notably, the concentration of Fam20C used in the kinetic assay is 500 to 1000 fold lower than that in the gel filtration assay, which would result in more complex dissociation. Also, Fam20A purified from insect cells likely switches between monomer and dimer without Fam20C, which makes Fam20A/C complex formation even more difficult at low protein concentration. It might also take a longer time for the complex formation to reach equilibration. Thus, excessive amount of Fam20A would be beneficial for the complex formation under the kinetic assay condition.</p><p><italic>3) It would be interesting to add to the Discussion some speculation as to what some of the advantages of a system like this would be. Potentially, phosphorylation of proteins in the ER might not be desirable and perhaps assembly of the complex only occurs in the Golgi? This could function to control spatially and temporally when kinase activity is present? Is Fam20A targeted differently than Fam20C</italic>?</p><p>We added some speculation regarding the potential benefits of the Fam20A-Fam20C system. We speculate that the major function of Fam20A is to boost the phosphorylation capacity of Fam20C within the secretory pathway. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>, Fam20A increases the turnover number (<italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub>) of Fam20C by almost 20 fold. Because proteins destined to secretion only reside for certain amount of time within the secretory pathway, higher turnover number enables the Fam20A/Fam20C complex to catalyze more phosphorylation reactions before the substrates are secreted outside the cell. This regulatory mechanism will be advantageous during the processes like enamel formation and lactation, when lots of secreted proteins need to be phosphorylated to high stoichiometry.</p><p>We notice that unlike Fam20C, which is ubiquitously expressed, the expression of Fam20A is tissue-specific and perhaps highly dynamic. Thus, controlling the transcription of Fam20A appears to be a mechanism to spatially and temporally regulate Fam20C kinase activity.</p><p>Fam20A does not appear to be targeted differently than Fam20C. Our previous results indicate that similar to Fam20C, Fam20A is predominantly localized in the Golgi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Tagliabracci et al., 2012</xref>, Science). Further, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>, secretion of Fam20A is as efficient as Fam20C and co-expression of Fam20A has little effect on secretion of Fam20C. It is therefore unlikely that Fam20A serves as a major mechanism to redistribute Fam20C activity subcellularly.</p><p><italic>4) Several of the figures of the paper (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1 fig2 fig3 fig4 fig5"><italic>Figures 1-5</italic></xref><italic>) have supplementary panels that go with the figure. In our view many of these panels contain quite important data that could be included in the main figures rather than being in a supplementary figure</italic>.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2 fig4 fig5">Figure 2A, 4B, 4C and 5B</xref> in the revised manuscript were moved from the figure supplements of the previous manuscript.</p><p><italic>5) The authors may wish to consider expanding slightly their general discussion on pseudokinases activating protein kinases in the Discussion section. The Fam20A-FAM20C system seems to have similarities with other pseudokinase-kinase pairs such as STRAD and LKB1 that are associated with disease that the general readers may not be aware of. Clearly it seems that major roles for pseudokinases are emerging as activators of protein kinases</italic>.</p><p>We have incorporated discussions about pseudokinase-kinase pairs in the revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>6) The authors show that the Fam20A mutation Q258E restores weak catalytic activity to Fam20A. It would be interesting to know whether the mutation has any effect on the ability of Fam20A to serve as an allosteric activator of Fam20C. That is, Fam20A Q258E evidently binds ATP, whereas wild-type Fam20A probably does not. Whether Fam20A binds ATP or not presumably affects the stability of the protein, which in turn could affect (positively, one would think) its activator capability</italic>.</p><p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, the thermal stability of Fam20A increased in the presence of ATP, indicating that Fam20A could bind ATP. We speculate that binding to ATP may stabilize a conformational state of Fam20A that is preferred for the allosteric activation of Fam20C. This mechanism has been reported for other pseudokinases, including STRAD. In the crystal structure of the LKB1-STRAD-MO25 complex, STRAD adopts an active conformation by binding to ATP and MO25, and engages LKB1 as its ‘pseudo-substrate’. In agreement with our hypothesis, Fam20A Q258E, which is able to hydrolyze ATP and therefore will not be locked in an ATP-binding conformation, is less potent than WT Fam20A to activate Fam20C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2 fig4">Figure 2E and 4G</xref>). Our speculation about Fam20A binding ATP is stated in the Discussion section.</p><p><italic>I also have a few minor questions of my own that could serve as discussion points</italic>:</p><p><italic>1) Does Fam20C phosphorylate Fam20A</italic>?</p><p>When relative high concentration of purified Fam20A and Fam20C were incubated in vitro with ATP and Mn<sup>2+</sup>, Fam20A could be phosphorylated. Whether Fam20C also phosphorylates Fam20A under physiological conditions has not been studied. Also, the functional significance of Fam20A phosphorylation is unclear. As demonstrated by <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, increase of Fam20C activity does not require Fam20A being phosphorylated. Although the potential function of Fam20A phosphorylation by Fam20C is an interesting topic, we think it falls beyond the scope of this manuscript.</p><p><italic>2) Does reactivated Fam20A phosphorylate Fam20C? Is Fam20C itself phosphorylated, based on MS analysis, and could this be regulatory</italic>?</p><p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4–figure supplement 3</xref>, reactivated Fam20A does not phosphorylate Fam20C. Phosphorylation of Fam20C has been discussed in another manuscript, which is currently under consideration of another journal. In brief, Fam20C undergoes autophosphorylation. But mutations of the SxE motifs within Fam20C do not appear to affect Fam20C activity.</p><p><italic>3) Is Fam20A more tightly anchored in the Golgi than Fam20A, and could it serve as the main retention signal for the Fam20C/Fam20A holoenzyme in cell types that co-express the two proteins</italic>?</p><p>We addressed this question in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>. When stably expressed in mammalian cells, Fam20A and Fam20C are secreted into the conditioned medium at comparable levels, indicating that Fam20A is not primarily retained within the Golgi. Also, we did not observe a redistribution of Flag-tagged Fam20C to the intracellular compartment when co-expressed with V5-tagged Fam20A. These results suggest that Fam20A does not serve as a retention mechanism for the Fam20A/Fam20C complex.</p><p><italic>4) Is the Fam20C/Fam20A association regulated in any way, and could this be used as a means to modulate Fam20C activity</italic>?</p><p>The formation of Fam20A/Fam20C complex is at least regulated on the transcriptional level. Fam20C is ubiquitously expressed; the expression of Fam20A is tissue-specific and perhaps highly dynamic given the large increase in Fam20A expression during lactation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Thus, controlling the transcription of Fam20A appears to be a mechanism to spatially and temporally regulate Fam20A/Fam20C complex formation and therefore Fam20C kinase activity. It is also possible that Fam20A/Fam20C complex formation is regulated post-translationally. Although currently we do not have evidence to support such post-translational regulations, it would be an intriguing direction to pursue in the future.</p></body></sub-article></article>
