located in the 5'-untranslated regions of messenger RNA requires the temporal synchronization of RNA synthesis and ligand binding-dependent conformational refolding. Ligand binding to the aptamer domain of the riboswitch induces premature termination of the mRNA synthesis of ligand-associated genes due to the coupled formation of 3'-structural elements acting as terminators. To date, there has been no high resolution structural description of the concerted process of synthesis and ligand-induced restructuring of the regulatory RNA element. Here, we show that for the guanine-sensing <italic>xpt-pbuX</italic> riboswitch from <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic>, the conformation of the full-length transcripts is static: it exclusively populates the functional off-state but cannot switch to the on-state, regardless of the presence or absence of ligand. We show that only the combined matching of transcription rates and ligand binding enables transcription intermediates to undergo ligand-dependent conformational refolding.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.21297.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.21297.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>RNA</kwd><kwd>riboswitches</kwd><kwd>meta-stable structures</kwd><kwd>folding</kwd><kwd>transcription</kwd><kwd>kinetics</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>B. subtilis</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFB902</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schwalbe</surname><given-names>Harald</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>State of Hesse</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BMRZ</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schwalbe</surname><given-names>Harald</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The discontinuous speed of transcription enables riboswitch molecules to adopt meta-stable structures in response to the presence of their cognate ligand, thereby gene-regulation by means of structure induced transcription termination can occur.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Riboswitches are cis-regulatory RNA elements controlling cellular processes, in particular transcription and translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mironov et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nahvi et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Mandal et al., 2003</xref>). They exert their function via a conformational switch between mutually exclusive base-paired structures. This conformational switch is induced by binding to a low-molecular weight ligand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Batey et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Noeske et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Serganov et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>Riboswitches regulating transcription control gene expression by connecting ligand-dependent and ligand-independent RNA folding processes with the concomitant synthesis of the RNA by the RNA polymerase.</p><p>It has been increasingly recognized that the folding of RNA is intimately linked to transcription kinetics, which are directly dependent on transcriptional pausing. The synthesis of the RNA is not performed at a constant speed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Maizels, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Darlix and Horaist, 1975</xref>). Instead, slow conformational changes, from a more competent to a less competent transcription state, lead to a variation of the transcription speed of the elongation complex (EC) between 2–30 nt/s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Davenport et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Neuman et al., 2003</xref>). The less competent transcription state can be adopted at any point during transcription and can slow down the EC by inhibiting nucleotide addition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adelman et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kireeva and Kashlev, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Strobel and Roberts, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Weixlbaumer et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, transcription rates vary during transcription. This elemental pausing occurs frequently, but typically lasts only for 1–6 s on average, making the overall transcription movement the sum of more and less competent transcription states averaged over the number of RNA polymerases (RNAP) molecules observed. In contrast to short elemental pausing, long pausing events occur at defined template sequences (pause sites) or upon interaction with protein factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Roberts et al., 1998</xref>). At pause-sites, the RNAP speed decreases by a factor of 100 compared to its maximal transcription speed (max. 75 nt/s, measured on a specialized DNA template) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Vogel and Jensen, 1994</xref>). Pause sites can slow RNAP through backtracking of the enzyme relative to the nucleic acids or by the formation of a pause RNA hairpin after the EC has entered an initial elemental pause state which makes elemental pausing an obligatory intermediate from which longer pausing can occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Reeder and Hawley, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kireeva et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Artsimovitch and Landick, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Landick, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nudler, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hein et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Pausing can also facilitate the folding of certain RNA structures and allow a stabilizing interaction between the nascent RNA and the transcription machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pan et al., 1999</xref>). Pausing can be important for effective riboswitch-mediated regulation where co-transcriptional folding is influenced by the transcription speed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wickiser et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Perdrizet et al., 2012</xref>). The modulation of the available conformational space by altering the transcriptional speed was demonstrated for the <italic>btuB</italic> riboswitch where the use of a mutant RNA polymerase with deficient pause behavior caused the riboswitch to adopt a non-native structure and to be deficient in ligand binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Perdrizet et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Here, we investigate the <italic>xpt-pbuX</italic> riboswitch from <italic>Bacillus</italic> and identify and characterize conformational sub-states and the kinetics of their inter-state conversion. Our work provides insight into how RNA polymerase residence time and the intramolecular refolding kinetics must be fine-tuned to allow riboswitch-based regulation of transcription. In this contribution, we apply high resolution structural and kinetic techniques to decipher the full co-transcriptional folding pathway, enabling monitoring the behaviour of the decisive structural units during synthesis for the first time.</p><sec id="s1-1"><title>Results</title><p>The guanine-sensing riboswitch from <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> (GSW) negatively regulates the transcription of the <italic>xpt</italic>-gene by the premature termination of RNA synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Mandal et al., 2003</xref>). In this riboswitch, the regulatory output signals of maintaining or repressing transcription require two conformational states with different base-pairing interactions of four complementary sequences P, A, T and H (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). In the off-state, the 5’-aptamer-strand (P) pairs with the aptamer-stabilising strand (A) and the switching strand (T) forms the terminator helix together with the terminator strand (H). By contrast, in the putative on-state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>), A and T pair and form the antiterminator conformation, and the P and H strands are unpaired.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21297.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Conformational states of the guanine-sensing riboswitch depending on transcript length.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Secondary structure of the full-length guanine-sensing riboswitch (GSW<sup>PATH</sup>).

These transitions are frequently found to be slower than the timescale of the relevant biological process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Solomatin et al., 2010</xref>). In addition, RNA chains can be trapped in a stable conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Treiber et al., 1998</xref>). The terminator conformation of GSW represents such a ‘super’ stabilised structure. Regardless of the presence or absence of the cognate ligand, the RNA adopts a single conformation in which the terminator helix (TH) is formed as inferred from NMR signals (for assignment, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) arising from the stable GU base-pairs (U129-G147 and U130-G146) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c,d</xref>).

If the thermodynamic stable conformation resembles an off-state, how can the organism ever adopt the on-state to allow gene expression?</p><p>We therefore tested for accumulation of distinct transcription intermediates, occurring as shorter RNA products are produced during the synthesis of full-length riboswitches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Artsimovitch and Landick, 2000</xref>). In multiple round transcription reactions, we detected several distinct shorter RNA products (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>). Three of the detected fragments correspond to the aptamer domain (nucleotides 10–89), to the prematurely terminated form (nucleotides 10–164), and to the full-length of the mRNA-5’-UTR. Mapping of these RNA fragments to the riboswitch structure reveals that they correspond to transcription intermediates that include the strands A, T, and H at their 3’-ends, respectively. Furthermore, two additional fragments of 100 and 140 nucleotides are detected. These latter RNAs exhibit 3’-terminal stretches of U-residues and therefore represent canonical transcriptional pause sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Landick, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Larson et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Based on the detection of these fragments, we truncated GSW after strands A or T to generate transcription intermediates containing either only the aptamer domain (GSW<sup>PA</sup>) or the aptamer domain and the subsequent sequence region of the antiterminator (GSW<sup>PAT</sup>).

This GSW<sup>PA</sup>-T<sup>trans</sup> complex was disrupted by the addition of ligand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>), restoring formation of helix PA. In contrast, the presence of ligand stabilised GSW<sup>PA</sup> so that subsequent addition of T<sup>trans</sup> did not disrupt helix PA in the aptamer domain within the GSW<sup>PA</sup>-ligand-complex and formation of the antiterminator helix was suppressed.

Indeed, ligand binding to GSW<sup>PA</sup> either in the absence or in presence of the terminator helix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3f and g</xref>) was fast, with a <italic>k</italic><sub>1</sub> of (2.4 ± 0.3) 10<sup>−1</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>, and induced a slower tertiary structure rearrangement (<italic>k</italic><sub>2</sub> = [1.8 ± 0.2) 10<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>] within the aptamer, consistent with previous experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Vogel and Jensen, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Reeder and Hawley, 1996</xref>). Subsequent formation of the terminator helix from single strands was also rapid (<italic>k</italic><sub>1</sub> = [1.4 ± 0.8] 10<sup>−1</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3h</xref>).</p><p>In the absence of ligand, GSW<sup>PA</sup> and T<sup>trans</sup> anneal rapidly to form the antiterminator complex (<italic>k</italic> = [9 ± 5] 10<sup>−3</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). Subsequent formation of the terminator helix TH was observed if H<sup>trans</sup> was added to the GSW<sup>PA</sup>-T<sup>trans</sup> complex (antiterminator conformation) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>). Under these conditions, the dissociation of the antiterminator helix AT was rate-limiting and slow (<italic>k</italic><sub>1</sub> = [0.5 ± 0.2] 10<sup>−3</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>; <italic>k</italic><sub>2</sub> = (1.1 ± 0.4) 10<sup>−4</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>[T<sup>trans</sup> intrinsic unfolding, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>]). Importantly, the dissociation of helix P4 was accelerated by the presence of ligand, but in a concentration-independent manner above equimolar ratios (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>; <italic>k</italic> = [0.89 ± 0.09] 10<sup>−3</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>) and was stimulated to a higher degree if ligand binding and annealing of H<sup>trans</sup> occurred simultaneously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e</xref>). Under the latter conditions, the formation of the terminator conformation was described by two rate constants, <italic>k</italic><sub>1</sub> = (2 ± 1) 10<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> reporting on the ligand-induced refolding of the aptamer domain and <italic>k</italic><sub>2</sub> = (1.2 ± 0.4) 10<sup>−3</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> characterising the rate-limiting dissociation of helix AT.</p><p>From these kinetic data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3i</xref>), we conclude that the AT conformation represents a meta-stable state that slowly refolds into the thermodynamically stable terminator state (which represents the state of lowest free energy). The dissociation of PA is slow compared to the polymerase transcription speed. Therefore, during mRNA synthesis, transcriptional resting states are required to slow transcription to ensure sufficient time for the refolding of conformations [PA]T to P[AT] to enable riboswitch function. We are aware that in this applied experimental strategy some of the kinetics are measured in trans, although the riboswitch is a cis-acting element. However, at the applied concentrations of 0.1 mM, the most relevant conformational transition of ligand-dependent [PA] is slow and if the rate may possibly be overestimated by this method, which would not impact the fundamental conclusion as discussed below.</p><p>Transcription rates between 12 to 90 nucleotides per second have been reported in prokaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adelman et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Vogel and Jensen, 1994</xref>). However, rates of synthesis vary during transcription. 5’-untranslated regions (5’-UTRs) for example often contain several U-rich sequences that have been shown to constitute transcriptional pause sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Artsimovitch and Landick, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gusarov and Nudler, 1999</xref>). Other sequences can also induce pausing of RNA polymerase, in particular in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Larson et al., 2014</xref>). In any case, pausing has been reported to assist co-transcriptional folding e.g. of the FMN- and coenzyme B<sub>12</sub>-sensing riboswitches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wickiser et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Perdrizet et al., 2012</xref>). Within the sequence of GSW, a U<sub>6</sub>-stretch (U107-U112) is suspiciously located between the aptamer domain and the terminator helix (pause site 1, PS1) and between the A and T stretches of the antiterminator (U135-U141, pause site 2, PS2) (for analysis of the distance between aptamer and terminator sequences in purine riboswitches see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). We analysed the synthesis rate of the RNA polymerases form <italic>E. coli</italic> (EcRNAP) and <italic>B. subtilis</italic> (BsRNAP) in a time-resolved single-round transcription assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Seven transcribed RNAs could be identified, suggesting that the formation of the shorter products after transcription of the aptamer domain and PS1 accumulate at a later time point during the overnight multi-round transcription. The seven RNA fragments were identified as FL (214 nt), GSW<sup>PATH</sup> (164 nt), PS2 (141 nt), PS1 (between 107 and 112 nt, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>), and three additional paused RNA fragments. Two of these additional pauses were seen with transcription with EcRNAP and were mapped as RNA95 and RNA77 (transcripts 95 nt and 77 nt in length, respectively). Transcription with BsRNAP through the same sequence showed the same pausing at RNA77, pausing at a different position, RNA90 (transcript 90 nt in length), but no pausing at RNA95. The FL and GSW<sup>PATH</sup> fragments accumulated over time and reached their maximum at 300 s and more than 600 s, respectively, for both the Ec and Bs RNAPs. The GSW<sup>PATH</sup> concentrations did not reach their maximal values within the observed 600 s. For the determination of transcription rates, the maximum values were included in the fitting procedure. Upon ligand addition, the intensity of GSW<sup>PATH</sup> increases whereas the intensity of FL decreased. The intensities of the pausing transcription intermediates appear unaffected by ligand addition. The data indicate that the riboswitch maintains its ligand-response function during the in vitro transcription assays, as the termination efficiency is increased by 24.8% for EcRNAP and by 30.3% for BsRNAP. The intensities of the PS2 and PS1 RNA also show an exponential growth, reaching maximum value after 120 s, indicating that under low NTP-concentrations, the poly-U sequences act more as a polymerase blocking point than a pause-site. This could be observed for both RNAPs. The intensity of PS2 is near the level of noise for BsRNAP, making quantitation of the amount of transcript difficult for this fragment. However, the pausing values could be determined, and these are of higher importance for the simulations. Furthermore, the intensity of PS1 is stronger for BsRNAP transcription, indicating that PS1 has a higher influence on the elongation complex for the BsRNAP. In addition, the determined pausing-parameters (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>) show that both RNAPs pause longer at PS1 than at PS2. This effect is increased for the EcRNAP when ligand is added whereas pausing of the BsRNAP shows no ligand dependency. Relative to the pausing observed at PS1 and PS2, pausing at RNA77, RNA90, and RNA95 was of shorter duration for both RNAPs. For EcRNAP-mediated transcription in the absence of ligand, pausing at RNA77 could not be clearly determined as the relative intensities show a linear than an exponential decay. However, as four pausing events are observed for each RNAP, at least in the presence of ligand, even these brief pauses can have a high impact on the overall transcription kinetics. The apparent transcription rates were determined to range from 0.4 ± 0.1 nt s<sup>−1</sup> and 2.0 ± 0.5 nt s<sup>−1</sup> (FL and GSW<sup>PATH</sup>) to 1.3 ± 0.6 nt s<sup>−1</sup> and 47.0 ± 53.3 nt s<sup>−1</sup> for the synthesis of the shorter transcription intermediates at 37°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Upon ligand addition, the apparent transcription rate decreased by at least a factor of two for PS2 and PS1 but was nearly identical for RNA95/RNA90 and RNA77. However, the multiple pausing events during transcription drastically decrease the apparent transcription rates of the longer RNAs FL and GSW<sup>PATH</sup>.<fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21297.010</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Time resolved Transcription: 8% PAGE of time resolved transcriptions using the <italic>E.coli</italic> (EC holo) and the <italic>B. subtilis</italic> (BS holo) RNAPs in the absence (-ligand) and presence (+ligand) of ligand.</title><p>The time points of transcription stops are indicated in (s).

This value is based on the apparent rates of transcription determined in the transcription assays for <italic>B. subtilis</italic> polymerase but taking into account the cellular concentrations of nucleotides, that are approx. 10 times higher than those used in the in vitro transcription reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Buckstein et al., 2008</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). In the absence of ligand, there is no major change as the intermediate conformations occur in a linear succession. In both cases, with and without transcriptional pausing, RNA synthesis is fast enough to allow for formation of the functional on-state apo-form conformation P[AT] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b–e</xref>). Refolding to the thermodynamic most stable functional off-state conformation [PA][TH] in its apo-form only occurs after the polymerase has passed the regulatory point of decision. In presence of the ligand the conformational space is described as a branched succession of intermediates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>). Without pausing of the transcription machinery, riboswitch synthesis is fast compared to its own refolding reactions from apo- to holo-conformations. Therefore, the GSW does not reach a substantial population of conformations with the formed terminator [TH] and the polymerase escapes termination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5f,g</xref>). In contrast, pausing of transcription at pause site 1 opens a time window that allows for refolding of the riboswitch from the apo- to the holo-form. Consequently, the [PA] conformation is formed which is stable over the time window of regulation. In continuation of transcription strand T is synthesized but because it can no longer rapidly associate with strand A to form an anti-terminator conformation, it will form the terminator hairpin conformation [TH] with strand H, as the elongation of the riboswitch by the polymerase occurs with rates not allowing dissociation of the [PA] helix. Therefore, a reduced rate of transcription after formation of the aptamer nucleotides of the riboswitch due to pausing at PS1 in conjunction with a comparative slow conformational transition from [PA]T to P[AT] results in higher population of off-states during synthesis before the polymerase leaves the point of decision (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5h,i</xref>).<fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21297.014</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Simulation of co-transcriptional folding pathways.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Conformational states of GSW in context of the transcription progress are shown from left to right.<italic> K</italic><sub>d</sub> values of the transcript intermediates are indicated.

Monitoring the dose-dependence of the wild-type riboswitch compared to the M3 and M4 mutants indicated that the loss of pause site integrity reduced the switching efficiency, whereas extended pausing of the RNA polymerase led to increased repression of reporter gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>). Hence, pausing of the polymerase at PS1 temporarily decouples the continuous synthesis of the downstream antiterminator sequence, assists in folding of the aptamer domain and allows for sufficient time for the ligand to bind at the structural decision point.<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21297.015</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>In vivo Pause site characterisation.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Regulation of ß-galactosidase reporter gene expression by wt-GSW and pause site 1 mutants. Nucleotide exchanges or insertion of residues to generate the PS1 mutants M1–M4 are indicated.

These findings and our proposed model are consistent as both conclude that the formation of the base-paired PA-stem is the committed-step in the off-pathway. Our experiments complement the previous data, however, by investigating the full-length riboswitch, which is important to map out the coexistence of ligand-dependent and ligand-independent functional off-states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Helmling et al., 2017</xref>). For this, we show that one of the two proposed functionally important conformational states of transcriptional riboswitches, the antiterminator state, represents a metastable conformation. The structural analysis using static and dynamic experiments performed close to the thermodynamically equilibrium indicate that an additional kinetic component is needed for adoption of the antiterminator conformation during transcription to allow full biological function of the riboswitch. Pausing during RNA synthesis and the inherent influence on the conformation of the nascent RNA chain is likely required for formation of the antiterminator. Without this additional kinetic component, the terminator would always form and transcription of the adjacent genes would never occur. This is reminiscent of the notion that transcriptional riboswitches are kinetically driven, as here the folding of the RNA has to compete with the speed of the transcribing polymerase. For the FMN switch from <italic>Bacillus subtilis,</italic> it was shown that FMN binding and subsequent folding into the terminator conformation requires pausing of the bacterial polymerase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wickiser et al., 2005</xref>). Unexpectedly, our simulations show that without pausing, the antiterminator conformation is always adopted, independently of ligand concentration. Without pausing, effective regulation could not be achieved by the riboswitch because gene expression could not be turned off. Under these conditions, the thermodynamically favored terminator conformation is not adopted. The presence of the multiple pausing events between the formation of the binding competent aptamer and the transcription of the switching T-strand allow the terminator to form and fulfill its regulatory purpose. In addition we showed that the polymerases of <italic>B. subtilis</italic> and <italic>E. coli</italic> utilize different pausing sequences (e.g. RNA95 and RNA90) and therefore differently affect conformational change in the synthesized RNA. Thus, the effective biotechnological application of transcription-regulating riboswitches in heterologous organisms may require a match between polymerase pausing sequences and the conformational space of the riboswitch. Our work significantly extends our understanding of the previously introduced concept of kinetic control of riboswitches, and reveals the importance of matching discontinuous transcription rates to folding rates of transient conformations in order to facilitate RNA-based regulation of gene expression.</p></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>RNA constructs</title><p>RNA constructs GSW<sup>PATH</sup>, GSW<sup>PAT</sup>, GSW<sup>PA</sup>, dGSW and FSW were synthesised by in vitro transcription using T7 polymerase and purified as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fürtig et al., 2003</xref>).

The time for colour change was noted and absorbance at 420 nm and 550 nm was measured. ß-galactosidase activity was calculated in Miller units, i.e. 1000 x [<italic>A</italic><sub>420</sub> – 1.75 x <italic>A</italic><sub>550</sub>] / [<italic>t</italic> x <italic>V</italic> x <italic>A</italic><sub>600</sub>]. Three independent cultures were measured in parallel. The measurements were repeated twice.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was funded by the German funding agency (DFG) in Collaborative Research Center 902: Molecular principles of RNA-based regulation.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by John Kuriyan (Senior Editor) and four reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Kathleen Hall (Reviewer #4).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript describes a detailed set of biochemical, biophysical and biological analyses to understand the mechanism used by a guanine riboswitch to control gene expression. The work involves a series of ligand binding studies and folding kinetics that were carried out using truncated riboswitches. This study expands on the original observations that some riboswitches are influenced more by kinetic processes (speed of aptamer folding, rate constant for ligand association, speed of RNA synthesis) than by thermodynamic equilibria. The NMR study in this manuscript is well executed, in particular the characterization of secondary structures of sub-state conformations. One of the reviewer’s comments on the beautiful NMR data and the creative use of imino protons to monitor structure formation. Indeed, all of the reviewers were impressed with the NMR work.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) All of the reviewers were concerned about the fact that the authors did not succeed in establishing how their results go beyond what is currently understood and also that they have not tied their results with those published previously. For example, the authors claim that &quot;Up to now, a high-resolution structural depiction of the concerted process of synthesis and ligand-induced restructuring of the regulatory RNA is missing.&quot;. However, there is excellent single-molecule biophysics data from the laboratory of Steven Block for adenine riboswitches (a close relative of guanine riboswitches) (Science [2012], 338:397). This previous paper should be cited and the authors should compare their findings with this prior work. In particular, what is new from this study? Work from the Micura and Block labs that leads to similar conclusions about the importance of kinetics should also be cited. The authors also state that the RNA &quot;…exclusively populates the functional off-state but cannot switch to the on-state, regardless of the presence or absence of ligand.&quot;. However, similar claims have been made for FMN riboswitches (Wickiser et al., 2005) and probably others. This brings up an important point: maybe many riboswitches do not switch between the on- and off-states, but choose a folding pathway based on ligand binding early after the full aptamer has been made. The authors should consider this possibility. As indicated above, the mechanism of the guanine-sensing riboswitch described here is very similar to that of the FMN riboswitch, including the number of pause sites and half time of a pause site. However, in this manuscript, little is discussed regarding the mechanism of the FMN riboswitch and there is no comparison between the two riboswitches. The authors need to provide more detailed discussions about the similarity between the two riboswitches and again why this work goes beyond what is currently understood.</p><p>2) Related to point 1 is that there is currently no Discussion. Addressing point 1 could be done in a Discussion format although the authors must clarify the novelty in the Introduction as well more clearly.</p><p>3) The authors use separate oligonucleotides that act as surrogates for the actual base-paired interactions that occur in a unimolecular riboswitch. It is not clear that these interactions will have kinetic properties that accurately reflect analogous interactions that occur in the natural construct during RNA synthesis. If not, then the author's conclusions (such as those made in the eighth paragraph of the Results) might be flawed.</p><p>4) Related somewhat to 3: The associations between PA and T and between T and H are bimolecular reactions in the NMR experiments. However, during co-transcriptional folding, these associations are intramolecular reactions. It is not clear in the manuscript whether the authors have considered differences between these two types of reactions and corrected the NMR-determined associations rates for simulation. Further, the authors did not provide clear descriptions in this manuscript how the simulation was performed, how the pausing was implemented, and what rates were used. For example, t0,1~5s and t0,2~61s were labeled for ligand binding at the aptamer in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>. These values seem to be calculated from NMR determined k1 and k2 values. Again since the association rate is ligand concentration dependent was it corrected for simulation?</p><p>5) One of the major concerns of the current study is how transcription intermediates and pause sites were identified. It is possible that a transcription intermediate gives an aborted product in multi-round transcription, but the appearance of an aborted product in multi-round transcription can be a result of many other factors. The appropriate approach for identifying a transcription intermediate is to measure accumulation in time-resolved single-round transcription assays, such as what the authors have done to confirm pause site 2 (PS2). In this regard, in contrast to PS2, the identity of pause site 1 (PS1) is not clear, as no transcription intermediate at PS1 was detected in the time-resolved single-round transcription assay. However, in this manuscript, PS1 has been a critical intermediate for designing truncated riboswitch constructs, performing kinetic measurements, and simulating co-transcriptional pathways (see below). If PS1 is a true pause site, the authors need to clearly confirm the presence of PS1 and characterize its pausing properties.</p><p>6) Similar to the above concern, it is not appropriate to compare aborted products in multi-round transcription reactions to evaluate transcription intermediates between <italic>E. coli</italic> transcription and <italic>B. subtilis</italic> transcription. For example, there are five major products in the <italic>E. coli</italic> transcription, but there are least eight major products shown in the <italic>B. subtilis</italic> transcription. If aborted products were all transcription intermediates, this would suggest there are many more pause sites for the <italic>B. subtilis</italic> polymerase than for the <italic>E. coli</italic> polymerase, which is not likely. To properly evaluate transcription systems, the authors need to perform time-resolved single-round transcription assays and compare differences in transcription intermediates.</p><p>7) In the figure for simulation, the authors labeled pausing at PS1 but did not label pausing at PS2. In the manuscript, the authors specifically discussed pausing at PS1 but did not discuss pausing at PS2. The experimental data identified PS2 but did not identify PS1. It is not correct to simply assume the presence of PS1 and ignore PS2. In addition, it is also not clear whether the half time at PS2 was used in the simulation, or whether it was used for PS1.</p><p>8) Similar to the above concern, since PS1 was not identified in the in vitro assay, while mutating PS1 sequences do affect in vivo gene expression, it is difficult to evaluate these influences as mutation-induced changes in pausing or other factors, such as folding. The authors need to clearly confirm the presence of PS1 and may also need to characterize pausing properties of these mutations.</p><p>9) Regarding the Bacillus and <italic>E. coli</italic> RNAPs: These enzymes are quite different, and they are not considered to be indistinguishable on the basis of their pause kinetics. However, if the authors have new information on their comparative properties, they need to reference it. The authors are using <italic>E. coli</italic> RNAP on a B subtilis riboswitch, which is quite ok, but they need to be clear that they are measuring properties of EC RNAP.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your revised article &quot;Pausing guides RNA folding to populate transiently stable RNA structures for riboswitch-based transcription regulation&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

One of the reviewers comments about the utility of the simulations of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> that summarize the importance of ligand binding and pausing to the general function of riboswitches. Additional experiments are not required, but both reviewers do provide suggestions for improvements that you will wish to consider including aspects that would clarify some of the points made in the paper. Please modify your text to address the concerns of the reviewers. We expect to make a decision on this manuscript without needing to re-engage the reviewers.</p><p>1) The authors wrote in their response that there are no quantitative models to describe transcriptional regulation by riboswitches. This statement is not correct. While the kinetic model established in the current study represents one of the few quantitative models and has its own merits in advancing the understanding of transcriptional regulation by riboswitches, a similar regulatory model with quantitative kinetic parameters has been previously reported for the FMN riboswitch (Wickiser et al., 2005). The authors need to revise their Introduction to be consistent with the literature.</p><p>2) One major concern of the original manuscript was the application of multi-round transcription assays to evaluate transcription intermediates. In the revised manuscript, the authors have performed time-resolved single-round transcription assays to properly establish transcription intermediates. However, despite having these appropriate measurements, it is somewhat surprising that the authors have kept applying the multi-round transcription data to evaluate transcription intermediates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). The authors need to update the text and figure with proper data from their new single-round transcription assays.</p><p>3) In the revised manuscript (Results, fifth paragraph), the authors changed the length of one of the transcription intermediates from the original 125 nucleotides to 140 nucleotides. Since this RNA fragment was proposed to represent pause site 2 (PS2), this new length will mark PS2 around nucleotide A150, which is different from PS2 at nucleotide U141 shown in both <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>. The authors need to make sure the location of PS2 is consistent throughout the manuscript.</p><p>4) Similar to the above concern, the labels for PS1 and PS2 are confusing in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>. For example, PS1 is labeled as 110; however, the RNA band marked as PS1 clearly migrates between the 110 and 123 bands of the sequencing ladder. In addition, the RNA band marked as 141:PS2 migrates right below the 147 band of the sequencing ladder in the Bs RNAP assay. However, in the Ec RNAP assay, there are no apparent RNA bands at similar locations; instead, there is a major RNA band that seems to migrate between the 123 and 147 bands of the sequencing ladder. The authors need to have proper labels for the transcription intermediates in both the Ec RNAP assay and the Bs RNAP assay.</p><p>5) In the new supplementary Table 8 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>), the authors reported transcription rates and pause site characteristics from time-resolved transcription assays. While the majority of the reported values are reasonable, some measurements are quite confusing. For example, the average appearance time of PS2 (141 nts) is shown to be 3.0 seconds in the third table. However, this time value is even less than the average appearance time of the shorter RNA77 (77 nts) fragment (13.2 seconds). In addition, an appearance time of 3.0 seconds is also less than the shortest time point (5 seconds) of the time-resolved assay. Another outlier is the average appearance time of Gsw-PATH, which is shown to be 775.9 seconds in the fourth table. However, it can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> that the RNA band for Gsw-PATH starts appearing around 20 – 30 seconds for the Bs RNAP assay. In addition, this appearance time is more than the longest time point (600 seconds) of the time-resolved assay. The authors need to go through the tables and make sure these values are properly reported. If these outliers are authentic, the authors need to comment on them.</p><p>6) One other concern of the original manuscript was the lack of details for the co-transcriptional folding simulation. While the authors have provided more details in their revised manuscript, a key aspect of the simulation remains not clear. The authors need to describe in the method how pausing was implemented in the simulation.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21297.018</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) All of the reviewers were concerned about the fact that the authors did not succeed in establishing how their results go beyond what is currently understood and also that they have not tied their results with those published previously. For example, the authors claim that &quot;Up to now, a high-resolution structural depiction of the concerted process of synthesis and ligand-induced restructuring of the regulatory RNA is missing.&quot;. However, there is excellent single-molecule biophysics data from the laboratory of Steven Block for adenine riboswitches (a close relative of guanine riboswitches) (Science [2012], 338:397). This previous paper should be cited and the authors should compare their findings with this prior work. In particular, what is new from this study? Work from the Micura and Block labs that leads to similar conclusions about the importance of kinetics should also be cited. The authors also state that the RNA &quot;…exclusively populates the functional off-state but cannot switch to the on-state, regardless of the presence or absence of ligand.&quot;. However, similar claims have been made for FMN riboswitches (Wickiser et al., 2005) and probably others.</italic> </p><p>We do not agree with the statement that the single-molecule work by Steven Block can be compared in its resolution to NMR structural work where each base-paired nucleotide can be determined. We are not aware that the previous reports would have tried to develop a quantitative model to describe transcriptional regulation, from measurement of ligand binding, RNA refolding from time-resolved NMR and transcription speed. Such studies, even though within reviewing process of this work over the last four years such claims are repeatedly put forward, have not been conducted nor conceptualized before. It is a fundamental difference to put forward a schematic picture or to develop a quantitative kinetic model. Therefore, our work substantially advances the field of transcriptional regulation by riboswitches. From a fundamental point, we find that the regulatory ON state is achieved by a metastable state! This has not been shown before. To highlight this we have extended the Introduction: “<italic>In this contribution, we apply high resolution structural and kinetic techniques to decipher the full co-transcriptional folding pathway, enabling monitoring the behaviour of the decisive structural units during synthesis for the first time.”</italic> Nevertheless, we have included reference to the Block paper and point out the new findings in our study: “In single molecule force extension experiments it could be shown that the structurally similar aptamer domain of the adenine-sensing riboswitch folds co-transcriptional in a hierarchical manner and that the closure of the PA is the last step in accommodation of the ligand in the holo-form (Greenleaf et al., 2008). Although this finding supports our derived model that puts the formation of the base-paired PA-stem to be the committed-step in the off-pathway, the single- molecule force extension experiments are not investigating the full length riboswitch, which is important to map out the coexistence of ligand-dependent and ligand-independent functional OFF-states (Helming et al., 2017).”</p><p><italic>This brings up an important point: maybe many riboswitches do not switch between the on- and off-states, but choose a folding pathway based on ligand binding early after the full aptamer has been made. The authors should consider this possibility. As indicated above, the mechanism of the guanine-sensing riboswitch described here is very similar to that of the FMN riboswitch, including the number of pause sites and half time of a pause site. However, in this manuscript, little is discussed regarding the mechanism of the FMN riboswitch and there is no comparison between the two riboswitches. The authors need to provide more detailed discussions about the similarity between the two riboswitches and again why this work goes beyond what is currently understood.</italic> </p><p>In order to address this point and to include a discussion in the light of the new results from transcriptional analysis we have rewritten the entire Discussion section that reads now: “In single molecule force extension experiments it could be shown that the structurally similar aptamer domain of the adenine-sensing riboswitch folds co-transcriptional in a hierarchical manner and that the closure of the PA is the last step in accommodation of the ligand in the holo-form (Greenleaf et al., 2008). […] Our work significantly extends our understanding of the previously introduced concept of kinetic control of riboswitches, and reveals the importance of matching discontinuous transcription rates to folding rates of transient conformations in order to facilitate RNA-based regulation of gene expression.”</p><p><italic>2) Related to point 1 is that there is currently no Discussion. Addressing point 1 could be done in a Discussion format although the authors must clarify the novelty in the Introduction as well more clearly.</italic> </p><p>In new single round transcription assays, we show accumulation of several transcriptional intermediates, with pausing and stalling events be present. We were able to do so because the Schwalbe group sent a postdoc to the lab of Landing to conduct such single round transcription in <italic>B. subtilis</italic>. Previously, the Schwalbe lab was able to conduct these experiments for <italic>E. coli</italic> polymerase but not with the more demanding <italic>B. subtilis</italic> polymerase. From this work, we show different transcription rates and utilization of different pause sites. This has not been done before.</p><p><italic>3) The authors use separate oligonucleotides that act as surrogates for the actual base-paired interactions that occur in a unimolecular riboswitch. It is not clear that these interactions will have kinetic properties that accurately reflect analogous interactions that occur in the natural construct during RNA synthesis. If not, then the author's conclusions (such as those made in the eighth paragraph of the Results) might be flawed.</italic> </p><p><italic>4) Related somewhat to 3: The associations between PA and T and between T and H are bimolecular reactions in the NMR experiments. However, during co-transcriptional folding, these associations are intramolecular reactions. It is not clear in the manuscript whether the authors have considered differences between these two types of reactions and corrected the NMR-determined associations rates for simulation. Further, the authors did not provide clear descriptions in this manuscript how the simulation was performed, how the pausing was implemented, and what rates were used. For example, t0,1~5s and t0,2~61s were labeled for ligand binding at the aptamer in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>. These values seem to be calculated from NMR determined k1 and k2 values. Again since the association rate is ligand concentration dependent was it corrected for simulation?</italic> </p><p>Clearly, our experimental setup does not completely reflect the co-transcriptional RNA folding scenario in vivo. Instead, we present the structural basis for folding of the different transcription intermediates, which occur during riboswitch transcription in the cell. We show that the individual base-pair interactions of hybridized oligos represent the RNA structural motifs of the unimolecular RNA of the corresponding size. At the RNA concentrations used for NMR (&gt;0.1 mM), we are confident that we mimick a scenario very close to the unimolecular situation. In a previous study (Warhaut et al., NAR 2017), we could show that for translational riboswitches, the aptamer domain and the expression platform are conformationally decoupled. Therefore, the intramolecular effect in RNA refolding is small. Further: our data from biophysical studies, mainly NMR, are fully consistent with the single-round transcription experiments that we can conduct under full control. This consistency makes us confident that our data will advance the field.</p><p>The values in the simulation that have to be adapted for concentration are accordingly adapted to match cellular concentrations comparable to Buckstein 2008, as referenced in the text.</p><p><italic>5) One of the major concerns of the current study is how transcription intermediates and pause sites were identified. It is possible that a transcription intermediate gives an aborted product in multi-round transcription, but the appearance of an aborted product in multi-round transcription can be a result of many other factors. The appropriate approach for identifying a transcription intermediate is to measure accumulation in time-resolved single-round transcription assays, such as what the authors have done to confirm pause site 2 (PS2). In this regard, in contrast to PS2, the identity of pause site 1 (PS1) is not clear, as no transcription intermediate at PS1 was detected in the time-resolved single-round transcription assay. However, in this manuscript, PS1 has been a critical intermediate for designing truncated riboswitch constructs, performing kinetic measurements, and simulating co-transcriptional pathways (see below). If PS1 is a true pause site, the authors need to clearly confirm the presence of PS1 and characterize its pausing properties.</italic> </p><p>In order to identify the transcription intermediates, we performed time-resolved single-round transcriptions with the <italic>E. coli</italic> and the <italic>B. subtilis</italic> RNAPs in collaboration with the Landick lab. These assays gave distinct signals for the run-off transcript (or full length), for premature transcription termination at the terminator (GswPATH), and the pause-sites PS2 and PS1. In addition, we could identify further pause-sites (RNA77 and RNA95 for <italic>E. coli</italic> and RNA77 and RNA90 for <italic>B. subtilis</italic>). For both RNAPs, the ratio between full-length and terminator varied in a ligand dependent manner and the intensities of PS1 were higher than for PS2. We therefore conclude that PS1 plays a more crucial role for the co-transcriptional pathways. However, due to its strong pausing effect on the EC, which leads to a strongly halted complex, the determination of the pausing properties was rather difficult.</p><p><italic>6) Similar to the above concern, it is not appropriate to compare aborted products in multi-round transcription reactions to evaluate transcription intermediates between E. coli transcription and B. subtilis transcription. For example, there are five major products in the E. coli transcription, but there are least eight major products shown in the B. subtilis transcription. If aborted products were all transcription intermediates, this would suggest there are many more pause sites for the B. subtilis polymerase than for the E. coli polymerase, which is not likely. To properly evaluate transcription systems, the authors need to perform time-resolved single-round transcription assays and compare differences in transcription intermediates.</italic> </p><p>We share the concerns of the reviewers and therefore performed time-resolved single-round transcription assays, as mentioned above, which revealed the nature of the transcription intermediates. We could show that PS1 plays an important role in the transcriptions using both, the <italic>E. coli</italic> and the <italic>B. subtilis</italic> RNAPs.</p><p><italic>7) In the figure for simulation, the authors labeled pausing at PS1 but did not label pausing at PS2. In the manuscript, the authors specifically discussed pausing at PS1 but did not discuss pausing at PS2. The experimental data identified PS2 but did not identify PS1. It is not correct to simply assume the presence of PS1 and ignore PS2. In addition, it is also not clear whether the half time at PS2 was used in the simulation, or whether it was used for PS1.</italic> </p><p>We share the concerns of the reviewers and therefore performed time-resolved single-round transcription assays, as mentioned above, which revealed the nature of the transcription intermediates.

However, if the authors have new information on their comparative properties, they need to reference it. The authors are using E. coli RNAP on a B subtilis riboswitch, which is quite ok, but they need to be clear that they are measuring properties of EC RNAP.</italic> </p><p>As outlined above we have performed optimized transcription assays (static and time resolved) using <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>B. subtilis</italic> RNA-polymerase, only the PS found for BS and their properties were included in the simulation of the riboswitch folding trajectory.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p><italic>[…] 1) The authors wrote in their response that there are no quantitative models to describe transcriptional regulation by riboswitches. This statement is not correct. While the kinetic model established in the current study represents one of the few quantitative models and has its own merits in advancing the understanding of transcriptional regulation by riboswitches, a similar regulatory model with quantitative kinetic parameters has been previously reported for the FMN riboswitch (Wickiser et al., 2005). The authors need to revise their Introduction to be consistent with the literature.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewers for this comment. In the previous work, the effect of transcription speed and pausing on the FMN riboswitch from <italic>B. subtilis</italic> was analyzed and it was postulated that transcription speed plays a major role in the regulation mechanism of certain riboswitches. However, the K<sub>D</sub> values were measured by comparing the termination rates under different conditions. Therefore, only the overall apparent rates were determined. In addition, no transcription rates were quantified. In our work, we combine measuring exchange rates and K<sub>D</sub> values at nucleotide level with quantified transcription and pausing rates. We can therefore determine the conformational with base pair resolution and gain a more detailed view. In addition, we use a simpler transcription system consisting of only the template, the RNAP and the RNA. This overcomes the problem that additional transcription factors could alter the interaction between RNAP and the riboswitch which was also mentioned in Wickiser et al., 2005.</p><p><italic>2) One major concern of the original manuscript was the application of multi-round transcription assays to evaluate transcription intermediates. In the revised manuscript, the authors have performed time-resolved single-round transcription assays to properly establish transcription intermediates. However, despite having these appropriate measurements, it is somewhat surprising that the authors have kept applying the multi-round transcription data to evaluate transcription intermediates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). The authors need to update the text and figure with proper data from their new single-round transcription assays.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewers for this comment. When we synthesized the full-length riboswitch sample by T7 mediated in vitro transcription, the analytic PAGE showed several abortion products. NMR data of the full-length riboswitch revealed that it was unable to switch. When we investigated this phenomenon, we realized that the abortion fragments on the gel could correspond to stable transcription intermediates, which caused the T7 RNAP to abort transcription. Comparison to the <italic>E. coli</italic> RNAP showed similar results. These results were taken into account when the shortened riboswitch and the trans added RNAs were designed for the time resolved NMR experiments.</p><p><italic>3) In the revised manuscript (Results, fifth paragraph), the authors changed the length of one of the transcription intermediates from the original 125 nucleotides to 140 nucleotides. Since this RNA fragment was proposed to represent pause site 2 (PS2), this new length will mark PS2 around nucleotide A150, which is different from PS2 at nucleotide U141 shown in both <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>. The authors need to make sure the location of PS2 is consistent throughout the manuscript.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewers for this comment. Compared to the wild type sequence, the NMR construct is missing 10 nt and therefore starts with G10.</p><p><italic>4) Similar to the above concern, the labels for PS1 and PS2 are confusing in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>. For example, PS1 is labeled as 110; however, the RNA band marked as PS1 clearly migrates between the 110 and 123 bands of the sequencing ladder. In addition, the RNA band marked as 141:PS2 migrates right below the 147 band of the sequencing ladder in the Bs RNAP assay. However, in the Ec RNAP assay, there are no apparent RNA bands at similar locations; instead, there is a major RNA band that seems to migrate between the 123 and 147 bands of the sequencing ladder. The authors need to have proper labels for the transcription intermediates in both the Ec RNAP assay and the Bs RNAP assay.</italic> </p><p>One transcription intermediate was identified as 110 which migrates between the bands 110 and 123 of the sequencing ladder. In order to clarify the length of this fragment, a 3’-mapping of the transcriptions was performed using 3’-deoxynucleotides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). The gel shows several transcription abortion products which end with a 3’-deoxy U and which migrate slightly faster than the 110 RNA fragment. When compared to the sequence, this poly U sequence corresponds to the bases T107 to T112. However, it can’t be clearly stated on which nucleotide the 110 RNA ends. We’ve therefore chosen to call this fragment 110. For the simulations and for the transcription rate determination, the results don’t change when the length of this fragment is varied from 107 to 112 nucleotides. We apologize for the badly indicated band at 141 nt. The label in the figure was displaced. We changed it to the original position.</p><p><italic>5) In the new supplementary Table 8 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>), the authors reported transcription rates and pause site characteristics from time-resolved transcription assays. While the majority of the reported values are reasonable, some measurements are quite confusing. For example, the average appearance time of PS2 (141 nts) is shown to be 3.0 seconds in the third table. However, this time value is even less than the average appearance time of the shorter RNA77 (77 nts) fragment (13.2 seconds). In addition, an appearance time of 3.0 seconds is also less than the shortest time point (5 seconds) of the time-resolved assay. Another outlier is the average appearance time of Gsw-PATH, which is shown to be 775.9 seconds in the fourth table. However, it can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> that the RNA band for Gsw-PATH starts appearing around 20 – 30 seconds for the Bs RNAP assay. In addition, this appearance time is more than the longest time point (600 seconds) of the time-resolved assay. The authors need to go through the tables and make sure these values are properly reported. If these outliers are authentic, the authors need to comment on them.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewers for this comment and have improved discussion of the results in the paper. The mentioned values were determined from signal intensities close to the noise which is also indicated by the high error. However, the transcription speed for the <italic>E. coli</italic> RNAP was also determined in the previous version of this paper. The values were in accordance with literature and could therefore be considered for the simulations.</p><p><italic>6) One other concern of the original manuscript was the lack of details for the co-transcriptional folding simulation. While the authors have provided more details in their revised manuscript, a key aspect of the simulation remains not clear. The authors need to describe in the method how pausing was implemented in the simulation.</italic> </p><p>We have corrected this and included the details of simulation in the Materials and methods section by including the following paragraph:</p><p>“Two sets of simulations were performed, in the first set the transcription rate was adjusted to the experimental value for transcription without any pausing events, while the second set simulated a pausing event between states PA/<sup>lig</sup>PA and PAT/<sup>lig</sup>PAT. […] Thereby, the reduction of the transcription rate over the pause site corresponds to a factor of ≈70 in the simulations.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
