To explore dynamic changes in the abundant proteins present in differentiating hair cells, we used nanoliter-scale shotgun mass spectrometry of single cells, each ~1 picoliter, from utricles of embryonic day 15 chickens. We identified unique constellations of proteins or protein groups from presumptive hair cells and from progenitor cells. The single-cell proteomes enabled the de novo reconstruction of a developmental trajectory using protein expression levels, revealing proteins that greatly increased in expression during differentiation of hair cells (e.g., OCM, CRABP1, GPX2, AK1, GSTO1) and those that decreased during differentiation (e.g., TMSB4X, AGR3). Complementary single-cell transcriptome profiling showed corresponding changes in mRNA during maturation of hair cells. Single-cell proteomics data thus can be mined to reveal features of cellular development that may be missed with transcriptomics.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>actin</kwd><kwd>hair cells</kwd><kwd>mass spectrometry</kwd><kwd>single cells</kwd><kwd>RNA sequencing</kwd><kwd>development</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Chicken</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 DC011034</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Barr-Gillespie</surname><given-names>Peter G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 DC015201</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Heller</surname><given-names>Stefan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R33 CA225248</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kelly</surname><given-names>Ryan T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000015</institution-id><institution>U.S. Department of Energy</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Laboratory Directed Research and Development Program (Earth &amp; Biological Sciences Directorate Mission Seed)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhu</surname><given-names>Ying</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100002046</institution-id><institution>Hearing Health Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Hearing Restoration Project</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Heller</surname><given-names>Stefan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Stanford Initiative to Cure Hearing Loss</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Heller</surname><given-names>Stefan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Protein mass spectrometry can be used to uncover developmental trajectories in small single cells of differentiating tissues.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Hair cells, the sensory cells of the inner ear, carry out a finely orchestrated construction of an elaborate actin cytoskeleton during differentiation. Progenitors of vestibular hair cells, the supporting cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Roberson et al., 1992</xref>), have an unremarkable actin cytoskeleton. By contrast, differentiating hair cells express a wide array of actin-associated proteins, including crosslinkers, membrane-to-actin linkers, and capping molecules, and use them to rapidly assemble mechanically sensitive hair bundles on their apical surfaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Shin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ellwanger et al., 2018</xref>). Hair bundles consist of ~100 stereocilia each, filled with filamentous actin (F-actin) and arranged in multiple rows of increasing length; by maturity, stereocilia contain &gt;90% of the F-actin in a hair cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tilney and Tilney, 1988</xref>).</p><p>Along the axis of the chicken cochlea, stereocilia systematically decrease in maximum height (from &gt;5 to 1.5 µm) and increase in number per cell (from 30 to 300) as the frequency encoded increases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tilney et al., 1992</xref>). Despite these changes, a quantitative analysis suggested that within experimental error, hair cells use the same amount of actin to build these disparate hair bundles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tilney and Tilney, 1988</xref>). There is little evidence of substantially increased expression of actin genes during hair cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ellwanger et al., 2018</xref>), suggesting that hair cells use the existing monomeric actin that is available during differentiation to build a bundle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tilney and Tilney, 1988</xref>).</p><p>The number of hair cells in the chick utricle increases 15-fold from embryonic day 7 (E7) to posthatch day 2, with hair-cell production peaking at E12 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Goodyear et al., 1999</xref>). Because of this asynchronous development, at any given age, cells are in distinct states along the pathway from progenitors to hair cells. While bulk sampling of cells averages over these developmental distinctions, sampling and analyzing individual cells of the E15 chick utricle allowed for transcriptomics examination of a large portion of the developmental trajectory for forming hair cells from supporting cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ellwanger et al., 2018</xref>), and should allow for a corresponding trajectory analysis using proteomics.</p><p>We sought to understand how supporting cells, with their modest F-actin cytoskeletons, could transform rapidly into stereocilia-endowed hair cells without significant upregulation of actin gene transcription. We used a highly sensitive single-cell proteomics approach to assess the concentrations of the abundant proteins in cells isolated from the E15 chick utricle. We found that hair cells were readily distinguished from supporting cells based on only 50–75 proteins identified in each. Notably, the actin monomer binding protein thymosin β4 (TMSB4X) was abundant in supporting cells but not in hair cells, and its expression decreased as progenitors developed into hair cells, which we revealed using trajectory analysis based on the proteomics data. Single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) analysis showed that <italic>TMSB4X</italic> transcripts are downregulated when transcription of <italic>ATOH1</italic>, a key regulator of hair cell differentiation, is activated. These data are consistent with a model that suggests that existing monomeric actin is made available for hair-bundle assembly by the degradation of TMSB4X.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Single-cell proteomics applied to E15 chick utricle hair cells</title><p>Recent reports demonstrated that extensive shotgun mass spectrometry characterization of the proteins of single cells is possible when samples are processed in nanoliter-scale volumes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zhu et al., 2018b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhu et al., 2018c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhu et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zhu et al., 2018d</xref>). About 700 proteins or protein groups could be detected from a single HeLa cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhu et al., 2018a</xref>), which is estimated to have a volume of a few picoliters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zhao et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Park et al., 2008</xref>). We analyzed single cells from E15 chicken utricle; by using peeled epithelia for cell dissociation, we limited the cell types analyzed to hair cells and supporting cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Herget et al., 2013</xref>), each of which is smaller than a HeLa cell. To distinguish the two cell types, we labeled utricle cells with FM1-43, which labels hair cells more strongly than supporting cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Herget et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ellwanger et al., 2018</xref>). After cell dissociation, we collected single cells and pools of 3, 5, and 20 cells in nanowells using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). As expected, collected cells with high levels of FM1-43 (FM1-43<sub>high</sub>) had hair bundles and elongated cell bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), both of which are characteristic of hair cells; FM1-43<sub>low</sub> cells—mostly supporting cells—were round after FACS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). We measured cell volumes after cell sorting. FM1-43<sub>high</sub> cells averaged 1.01 ± 0.20 picoliters (mean ± SD; <italic>N</italic> = 9), while FM1-43<sub>low</sub> cells averaged 0.67 ± 0.15 picoliters (<italic>N</italic> = 8). For comparison, using the same method, we measured the volume of HeLa cells to be 4.9 ± 1.1 picoliters (<italic>N</italic> = 5).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.50777.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Mass spectrometry of single cells and small cell pools from E15 chick utricle.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Experimental design.

After protein extraction, reduction, alkylation, and proteolysis, digested peptides were collected and separated using nano-liquid chromatography on a 30-µm-i.d. column (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zhu et al., 2018b</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The separated peptides were delivered to an Orbitrap Fusion Lumos Tribrid mass spectrometer and were analyzed using data-dependent acquisition. Peptides were identified, quantified, and assembled into proteins with Andromeda and MaxQuant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cox and Mann, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cox et al., 2011</xref>), using Match Between Runs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tyanova et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zhu et al., 2018b</xref>) to identify unmatched peptides based on their accurate masses and liquid chromatography retention times. To quantify proteins based on molar abundance, we used intensity-based absolute quantification (iBAQ), calculated from the sum of peak intensities of all peptides matching to a specific protein divided by the number of theoretically observable peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Schwanhäusser et al., 2011</xref>). All mass spectrometry data are deposited at ProteomeXchange, and analyzed data are reported in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>.</p><p>About 200 unique peptides were identified in each single FM1-43<sub>high</sub> cell; about half were identified by MS/MS scans and half by matching (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). The total number of unique peptides increased to ~2500 in pools of 20 cells, with about 70% identified by MS/MS scans (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Only ~1200 peptides were identified in pools of 20 FM1-43<sub>low</sub> cells, with about 60% identified by MS/MS scans (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Total iBAQ rose nonlinearly with the number of cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>), suggesting that some protein was lost to surface adsorption; while small relative to typical sample wells, the volume of the nanowell is still 50,000-fold larger than the volume of a utricle cell. Because sample processing occurred in a protected nanowell environment using robotic liquid handling, the total iBAQ attributed to keratins (e.g., human skin contamination) was only ~0.1% of the total, far less than &gt;50% occurring in some mass-spectrometry experiments with small amounts of protein.

To interpret the latent structure in the single-cell mass spectrometry data, its lower-dimensional manifold was investigated using CellTrails’ robust nonlinear spectral embedding on the submatrix of the 37 highest variable identifications (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Appropriately, most cells segregated according to their FM1-43 uptake (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).

Our assay was biased for hair-bundle genes, and at least half of the cells isolated were hair cells, so it is unsurprising that the final trajectory revealed not only the transition from progenitor (supporting) cells to hair cells, but also further developmental branching. One major branch was supporting cells, as these cells expressed markers like <italic>TECTA</italic> and <italic>OTOA</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata1">Figure 5—source data 1</xref>).

Similarly, enrichment of <italic>SYN3</italic>, <italic>SKOR2</italic>, <italic>CALB2</italic>, and <italic>TMC1</italic> indicated the branch projecting up and to the right is from extrastriolar cells, which we named TrES.

The lower-right branch was populated nearly entirely by lateral cells, which confirms that it represents striolar hair cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D–E</xref>). We conclude that the scRNA-seq experiment accurately replicated our previous experiment using a multiplex RT-qPCR approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ellwanger et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>We next examined the genes highlighted in the proteomics experiments, including <italic>TMSB4X</italic>, <italic>AGR3</italic>, <italic>GSTO1</italic>, <italic>GPX2</italic>, <italic>CRABP1</italic>, and <italic>AK1</italic>. As predicted from the proteomics and localization experiments, the CellTrails analysis showed that <italic>TMSB4X</italic> and <italic>AGR3</italic> were specific to progenitor (supporting) cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>), while <italic>GSTO1</italic>, <italic>GPX2</italic>, <italic>CRABP1</italic>, and <italic>AK1</italic> were specific to hair cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref>). The CellTrails maps indicated that <italic>GPX2</italic> and <italic>AK1</italic> were concentrated in striolar hair cells, while <italic>CRABP1</italic> was enriched in extrastriolar cells, particularly TrES* (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref>). Cells observed with high levels of CRABP1 in immunocytochemistry experiments could be the TrES* cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G,I</xref>). <italic>GSTO1</italic> was expressed at similar levels in both hair cell types. Available antibodies against GPX2, AK1, and GSTO1 were insufficiently reliable to check their hair-cell specificity. Examining databases in gEAR, however, we noted that <italic>Gpx2</italic> and <italic>Ak1</italic> are predicted to be substantially enriched in hair cells as compared to non-hair cells in mouse utricle; by contrast, <italic>Gsto1</italic> is expressed at higher levels in mouse utricle non-hair cells than in hair cells.</p><p>The scRNA-seq results corroborated the expression dynamics of TMSB4X on transcriptional level. High in progenitor cells, its transcriptional activity decreased substantially during hair cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>), and was nearly undetectable in striolar hair cells. Interestingly, <italic>TMSB4X</italic> was expressed at detectable levels, albeit relatively low, in cells along TrES as compared to TrES* (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>).</p><p>We also noted a striking decrease in <italic>ACTB</italic> expression as hair cells differentiated; the CellTrails maps suggested that <italic>ACTB</italic> was &gt;10 fold higher in progenitor cells than in hair cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5K</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata1">Figure 5—source data 1</xref>). <italic>ACTG1</italic> increased modestly in expression, especially in TrES cells, but overall was present at lower levels than <italic>ACTB</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5K</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata1">Figure 5—source data 1</xref>). Similar trends for these actin isoforms were also seen in our previous data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ellwanger et al., 2018</xref>). ACTB and ACTG1 differ by only four amino acids, however, and we only detected one of the peptides that distinguish the isoforms (Ac-EEEIAALVIDNGSGMCK from ACTG1) in single mass spectrometry run. We were therefore unable to accurately measure the relative abundance of the two actin isoforms in our protein mass spectrometry experiments.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Global analysis of proteins from single cells has previously been thwarted by nonspecific adsorption of proteins to surfaces and the lack of a scheme to amplify proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Couvillion et al., 2019</xref>). Recent development of nanowell sample processing with nanoPOTS, coupled with extremely sensitive mass spectrometers, permits detection of abundant proteins of even very small cells (&lt;1 picoliter). We exploited this method to characterize the abundant proteins of FACS-sorted supporting cells, the hair cell progenitors, and hair cells from embryonic chick utricles. Remarkably, we were able to use the mass spectrometry data from single utricle cells to reconstruct a developmental trajectory from protein-expression values alone.</p><p>In addition, we identified several proteins not previously highlighted as specific for hair cells (CRABP1, GSTO1, GPX2, AK1) or for supporting cells (AGR3, TMSB4X). TMSB4X was present at nearly equimolar levels with respect to actin in supporting cells and thus may sequester actin monomers there. By contrast, in hair cells, TMSB4X was only one-tenth as abundant as actin. This developmental change was characterized in more depth using single-cell RNA sequencing, which showed that the drop in <italic>TMSB4X</italic> was greater in extrastriolar hair cells than in striolar hair cells. Together, these data are consistent with the hypothesis that downregulation of TMSB4X allows differentiating hair cells to construct their hair bundles with newly available actin monomers.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Single-cell proteomics detection</title><p>While fewer proteins were identified from single hair cells than were identified in a recent report using the same technique with single HeLa cells and primary lung cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhu et al., 2018a</xref>), hair cells have a volume of ~1 picoliter, while HeLa cells are five times larger in volume. Given this difference, detection of fewer proteins in hair cells than in HeLa cells was not surprising. The 700 proteins detected in HeLa cells are also a substantial underestimate of the total that are present there; using two-dimensional separation prior to mass spectrometry, over 11,000 proteins or protein groups can be detected from these cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Geiger et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kulak et al., 2017</xref>), and analyses with a one-dimensional separation, like that used here, typically yield ~3000 proteins. The total number of proteins in hair cells and supporting cells is similarly large; using separation in only one chromatographic dimension, we identified ~3000 proteins from E15 chick utricle sensory epithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Shin et al., 2013</xref>). Note that even these numbers are underestimates of the total number of genes expressed; for example, we detected expression from 13,643 genes in our scRNA-seq experiments. The range of protein expression is enormous and the dynamic range of mass spectrometers is limited, which prevents proteomic detection of all expressed genes.</p><p>While the nanoPOTS approach is useful for characterizing abundant proteins in small cells or more proteins in larger cells, without further increases in sensitivity, the small number of proteins detected in single hair cells will prevent characterization of low-abundance proteins or deeply categorizing developmental pathways using protein expression. Because the relationship between cell number and total protein signal intensity was nonlinear, especially for 1–3 cell samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>), we concluded that we lost significant amounts of protein to adsorption to the nanowells. These results indicate that further improvement of protein recovery is critical to increase proteome coverage and quantification performance of single-cell proteomics technology employing nanoPOTS. Fabricating nanowells with smaller dimensions would be straightforward; however, dispensing single cells by FACS to yet-smaller wells would be difficult to carry out reproducibly. In addition, the nanowell surfaces could be coated chemically with antifouling materials such as polyethylene glycol or poly(2-methyl-2-oxazoline) polymers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Weydert et al., 2017</xref>). An alternative strategy for single-cell protein analysis uses TMT multiplex labeling with one channel utilized by a sample of several hundred carrier cells, which will reduce the relative error due to protein loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Budnik et al., 2018</xref>). Indeed, coupling of TMT multiplex labeling approach with nanoPOTS significantly increases proteome coverage and analysis throughput of single cell proteomics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dou et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>We detected much higher levels of small proteins (&lt;20 kD) here than in previous experiments using the same tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Shin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Shin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Shin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Herget et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wilmarth et al., 2015</xref>). We attribute this improved detection to the processing of samples in nanoPOTS nanowell without transfer steps; other sample preparation methods included steps (e.g., SDS-PAGE gel separation or filter washes) that facilitated loss of small proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Krey et al., 2016</xref>). Our new data indicate that on a molar basis, OCM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3M–O</xref>), which was formerly known as parvalbumin 3 in the chick (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Heller et al., 2002</xref>), is the most abundant protein in E15 chick hair cells, accounting for &gt;10% of the total number of protein molecules.</p><p>Although we see high levels of small proteins, we do not think that they are over-represented in our data. Moreover, levels of cytoskeletal proteins like actin and tubulin are similar to those seen in bulk proteomics experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Shin et al., 2013</xref>). By contrast, as in most shotgun mass spectrometry experiments, membrane proteins are underrepresented relative to their presence in the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kar et al., 2017</xref>). Membrane proteins are generally expressed at low levels, however, which also contributes to our inability to see more than a few such proteins (e.g., ATP1A1, SLC17A8, and ATP2B2). Challenges in detecting membrane proteins are not restricted to single-cell proteomics, however.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Single-cell proteomics trajectory analysis</title><p>We report here the first example of the use of single-cell protein mass spectrometry data to construct a developmental trajectory, in this case from progenitors to hair cells. While limited by having only 30 cells for this analysis, CellTrails nevertheless was able to generate a developmental trajectory that discriminated distinct expression patterns of transitioning cells. The proposed trajectory for the single cells studied here accounted for protein expression levels at the endpoints, which represented supporting cells and hair cells; moreover, expression levels of many of the endpoint-selective proteins systematically increased or decreased across the trajectory, as expected. Although we did not detect the branching trajectories of hair cells along the TrS, TrES, and TrES* trails that were seen using multiplex RT-qPCR approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ellwanger et al., 2018</xref>) or scRNA-seq (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), the small number of cells analyzed for protein-based trajectories likely precluded their detection.</p><p>Although application of trajectory-analysis methods to single-cell proteomics is very much in its infancy, we show here that CellTrails is suitable for this purpose. The analysis was limited by sensitivity, as proteins detected by mass spectrometry were limited to those expressed at relatively high levels. Improvements of the nanoPOTS method that lead to increased sensitivity and reproducibility will enhance future protein-based trajectory analyses. Nevertheless, while robotic manipulation allows for increased sample-preparation output, the number of cells analyzed presently must remain low because of slow throughput of the mass spectrometry steps. Single-cell RNA-seq approaches are likely to continue to offer much higher throughput and depth for the foreseeable future. That said, analysis of developmental pathways using single-cell proteomics allows the identification of key proteins that change in protein expression level without alternations in transcript levels. Moreover, future single-cell proteomics approaches will allow analysis of posttranslational modifications like phosphorylation, which will expand our ability to probe developmental cascades.</p><p>Interestingly, GAPDH was found to increase during hair cell maturation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E–F</xref>), while its mRNA was reported to remain at a constant level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Avenarius et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ellwanger et al., 2018</xref>); this discrepancy suggests that GAPDH undergoes post-transcriptional regulation, either from increased translation efficacy or by protein stabilization following translation. Because GAPDH concentrates in stereocilia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Shin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Shin et al., 2013</xref>), protein stabilization there is the most likely explanation for the increasing GAPDH levels during hair-cell differentiation. This observation highlights the power of the protein-based trajectory analysis; because of the poor correlation between transcript levels and protein levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liu et al., 2016</xref>), understanding how proteins change during a developmental process will require their direct measurement, not inferring their levels as is done with scRNA-seq experiments.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Actin expression dynamics</title><p>During formation of hair cells, we observed a substantial downregulation of <italic>ACTB</italic> during differentiation to hair cells, with the largest decrease in extrastriolar cells; this decrease was partially compensated by an increase in <italic>ACTG1</italic>, especially in extrastriolar cells.

An alternative model dictates that the final amount of actin used in a hair bundle depends on the expression level of crosslinkers like PLS1 and ESPN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Höfer et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sekerková et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Krey et al., 2016</xref>). A plausible hypothesis incorporating observations reported here is that ACTB is sequestered with TMSB4X in supporting cells; upon differentiation to hair cells, ACTB is made immediately available for stereocilia elongation by degradation of the actin buffer TMSB4X, while ACTG1 expression is increased to provide actin for other assemblies, including the cuticular plate and circumferential actin

Utricles were incubated with 10 µM FM1-43FX (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA) for 20 s, then treated with thermolysin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) to remove the sensory epithelium; cells in the epithelium were dissociated by treating with Accutase (Innovative Cell Technologies, San Diego, CA) with mechanical trituration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ellwanger et al., 2018</xref>). Cells were sorted with a BD Influx Instrument (BD Biosciences) set to ‘‘single cell’’ mode and equipped with a 85 µm nozzle. To enable the direct cell sorting into nanowells, a customized template was built with the BD FACS software environment (Sortware) to match the format of nanowell array. SPHERO Drop Delay Calibration Particles (Spherotech, Lake Forest, IL) were used to confirm the drop targeting, as well as the parameter optimization. Prior to sorting onto the final collection chip, a separate preparation of E15 chick cells was used to optimize drop delay settings in order to verify alignment of droplets within the well and cell numbers within each well by visual inspection under an epifluorescence microscope. Debris was removed based on forward scatter (FSC) versus side scatter (SSC) and doublets were excluded based on forward scatter (FSC) versus trigger pulse width. SYTOX Red Dead Cell Stain (Thermo Fisher) was added to cells prior to sorting and was used to identify live and dead cells. Based on our final gating approach, which compared 638–1 (SYTOX Red) versus 488–1 (FM1-43), single SYTOX Red-negative FM1-43<sub>high</sub> or FM1-43<sub>low</sub> cells were deposited into individual nanowells.</p><p>NanoPOTS chips were fabricated on standard microscopy slides as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zhu et al., 2018b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhu et al., 2018a</xref>). An arrangement of 5 × 13 hydrophilic nanowells was created, each 1 mm diameter with 2.25 mm on-center spacing, and the surrounding chip surface was treated with 2% (v/v) heptadecafluoro-1,1,2,2-tetrahydrodecyl)-dimethylchlorosilane (PFDS) in 2,2,4-trimethylpentane to render it hydrophobic. A glass spacer and cover plate were fabricated for each nanowell chip, allowing the chip to be sealed so that evaporation was minimized during sample incubation. A home-built robotic liquid handling system, capable of subnanoliter dispensing, was used to dispense sample preparation reagents into nanowells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zhu et al., 2018b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhu et al., 2018a</xref>). To lyse cells, and to extract and reduce proteins, 100 nl of 0.2% dodecyl β-D-maltoside containing 5 mM DTT in 0.5x PBS and 25 mM ammonium bicarbonate were added to a nanowell containing FACS-sorted single cells or pools of cells; the chip was then incubated at 70°C for 1 hr. Next, proteins were alkylated using 50 nl of 30 mM iodoacetamide in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate in the dark at 37°C for 30 min. Lys-C and trypsin (each from Promega, Madison, WI, USA) were added sequentially using 50 nl of 5 ng/μl enzyme solutions in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate for 4 hr and 6 hr, respectively. Finally, the peptide sample was acidified with 50 nl of 5% formic acid and then collected into a fused-silica capillary (200 μm i.d., 5 cm long). To maximize sample recovery, each nanowell was re-extracted twice, each with 200 nl of 0.1% formic acid in water. The sample collection capillaries were sealed on both ends with Parafilm and stored at −70°C until use.</p><p>Two single-cell proteomics experiments were carried out.

We used FM1-43 to label the isolated cells after fixation; here, the dye’s propensity to insert into the extracellular leaflet of the membrane was used rather than its ability to enter transduction channels. Cells were fixed for 10 min, then a PBS solution containing DAPI (4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, 1 µg/ml, Thermo Fisher, D1306) and 10 µM FM1-43FX was added to the slide for 10 min.

The Analyze Particles tool was then used to determine the cell area in each slice. The volume for a slice was calculated as the product of the single-slice area multiplied by the z-stack interval; all slice volumes were added together to estimate total cell volume.</p><p>To count stereocilia per hair bundle, Airyscan z-stack images of E15 chicken utricles stained with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated phalloidin (1:1000, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, A12379) were obtained using a Zeiss LSM 880 microscope; images were acquired near the base of bundles to ensure that all stereocilia were in each image.

Mobile phase was delivered at 60 nl/min with a Dionex UltiMate NCP-3200RS pump system (Thermo Fisher). Peptides were separated with a linear 8–22% Buffer B (0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile) gradient over 60 min, followed by a 10 min increase to 45%. The column was washed with 80% Buffer B for 10 min and then equilibrated with 2% Buffer B for 15 min. An Orbitrap Fusion Lumos Tribrid mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher) was used for data collection. Peptides were ionized at a spray voltage of 2 kV and ions were collected into an ion transfer capillary set at 150°C. The RF lens was set at 30%. MS1 scans used a 375–1575 mass range, a scan resolution of 120,000, an AGC target of 3 × 10<sup>6</sup>, and a maximum injection time of 246 ms. Precursor ions were selected for MS/MS sequencing if they had charges of +2 to +7 and intensities &gt; 8,000; precursors were isolated with an m/z window of 2 and fragmented by high energy dissociation (HCD) set at 30%. Repeat sampling was reduced by using an exclusion duration of 40 s and m/z tolerance of ± 10 ppm. MS2 scans were carried out in the Orbitrap with an AGC target of 2 × 10<sup>5</sup>.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Single-cell proteomics reveals downregulation of TMSB4X to drive actin release for stereocilia assembly&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers and the evaluation has been overseen by Anna Akhmanova as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript &quot;Single-cell proteomics reveals downregulation of TMSB4X to drive actin release for stereocilia assembly&quot; presents a series of state-of-the-art protein spectrometry experiments on inner-ear hair cells that provide single-cell proteomes enabling the identification of important steps in hair-cell differentiation. The authors focus on E15 chicken utricle tissue, that includes both supporting and hair cells. Various sample preparation strategies and analysis protocols were used to identify about 600 proteins or protein groups for FM1-43<sub>high</sub> samples, and about 300 or so for FM1-43<sub>low</sub>. Several proteins specific to either presumptive hair cells or supporting cells were identified, and further experiments were done for some of these proteins to validate their localization. In addition, TMSB4X, found predominantly in supporting cells but not hair-cells, is suggested to play a key role in capturing actin in supporting cells and then releasing it during differentiation to facilitate the assembly of the characteristic actin-based sterocilia bundles of hair cells. Proteomics data also permitted the classification of cells according to a pseudotemporal ordering, and single cell RNA-seq measurements identified developmental trajectories for extrastriolar and striolar hair cells.</p><p>Overall, the reviewers felt that this study had merit and was worthy of consideration for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. In general, the most significant concern of both reviewers was the conclusion that <italic>TMSB4X</italic> actually regulates actin release related to stereocilia assembly. While this is a very reasonable hypothesis, in the absence of experimental data, it seems premature to include this idea in the title of the study.</p><p>In addition, one of the reviewers requested some additional clarification regarding the types of proteins that might not be detected in hair cells and supporting cells.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) While the authors suggest that their results show that <italic>TMSB4X</italic> plays a role in releasing actin that can then be used to build stereocilia bundles, there is no evidence for this beyond changes in <italic>TMSB4X</italic> expression data. In light of this, the study then fundamentally represents the demonstration of a technique, single cell proteomic analysis. The title is a clear overstep based on the data provided. There is no direct evidence that TMSB4X actually drives actin release related to stereocilia assembly. This may in fact be what occurs, but without data, it seems inappropriate to include this in the title.</p><p>The enrichment of TMSB4X in supporting cells is intriguing and well documented, yet lack of TMSB4X in hair cells is only correlated with the appearance of a hair bundle, causality is not really demonstrated although it is implied, which might be problematic. Whether TMSB4X really functions in capturing actin in supporting cells is an attractive hypothesis, and it should be referred as such (where is the immunostaining of G-actin and TMSB4X showing overlap? Is the antibody for TMSB4X really reliable? It seems to stain a lot of other stuff. Could it be that the hair bundle forms even in the presence of TMSB4X and that other factors are really governing this transition?). Mechanistic details about how the TMSB4X proteins function and get degraded during development are lacking. One can see how obtaining these mechanistic insights is likely beyond the scope of the paper, but perhaps clarifying that this is only a correlation, and that the TMSB4X function in supporting cells is hypothesized but that it has not really been established, would be helpful.</p><p>2) There are about 600 proteins identified for hair-cells, and significantly less for supporting cells. An estimate of how much is missing can be obtained by comparing to results from HeLa cells (700 proteins), and the authors do acknowledge that some proteins are missing. This needs to be discussed in more depth, both in terms of what types of proteins might be missing, and how many. For instance, are membrane/soluble proteins well represented in the list? Is the method biasing the detections of some, but not others? Is the mass spec analysis biasing the detection towards small proteins? (I assume orbitrap limits on mass are bypassed by proteolysis treatments, but this could be discussed a bit more). In addition, an upper boundary on the number of different proteins expressed in a cell could also be obtained from mRNA transcripts identified (with obvious caveats, but a good upper limit nonetheless), which could help provide another estimate of how many proteins are missing in the analyses.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.50777.029</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) While the authors suggest that their results show that TMSB4X plays a role in releasing actin that can then be used to build stereocilia bundles, there is no evidence for this beyond changes in TMSB4X expression data.

The reviewers may be noting the strong staining in the stroma cells in Figure 3H-I and Figure 3—figure supplement 2. However, we also note that there are two groups of cells in the scRNA-seq experiment (clusters S8 and S9 in Figure 5A) that have high expression of TMSB4X (Figure 5A). These cells were removed for the subsequent analysis of scRNA-seq data, but they at least partially corroborate our suggestion that the antibody is specific. The antibody has been validated in knock-down experiments, as indicated in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Could it be that the hair bundle forms even in the presence of TMSB4X and that other factors are really governing this transition?).

We also are convinced by the reviewers to indicate clearly that the role we propose for TMSB4X is hypothetical as well.</p><p>Last half of Abstract changed to: &quot;The single-cell proteomes enabled the de novo reconstruction of a developmental trajectory using protein expression levels, revealing proteins that greatly increased in expression during differentiation of hair cells (OCM, CRABP1, GPX2, AK1, GSTO1) and those that decreased during differentiation (TMSB4X, AGR3). […] Single-cell proteomics data thus can be mined to reveal features of cellular development that may be missed with transcriptomics.&quot;</p><p>Last sentence of Introduction changed to: &quot;These data are consistent with a model that suggests that existing monomeric actin is made available for hair-bundle assembly by the degradation of TMSB4X.&quot;</p><p>Discussion:&quot;TMSB4X was present at nearly equimolar levels with respect to actin in supporting cells and thus may sequester actin monomers there. […] Together, these data are consistent with the hypothesis that downregulation of TMSB4X allows differentiating hair cells to construct their hair bundles with newly available actin monomers.&quot;</p><p>Discussion: The section titled &quot;TMSB4X dynamics and assembly of stereocilia&quot; was nearly completely removed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) There are about 600 proteins identified for hair-cells, and significantly less for supporting cells.

This needs to be discussed in more depth, both in terms of what types of proteins might be missing, and how many.</p></disp-quote><p>Most cells are thought to express ~10,000 different proteins, not accounting for splice variants; mass spectrometry only detects this many proteins with substantial protein loads, however. Using 20 µg of starting material and two-dimensional separation, the Mann group identified 11,148 proteins or protein groups from HeLa cells (Geiger et al., 2012; Kulak et al., 2017). With a single separation dimension, ~3000 proteins can usually be detected.</p><p>For example, in our experiments carrying out proteomics measurements on whole chick utricle sensory epithelia at E20 (Shin et al., 2013), which used far more material, we detected 2753 proteins in at least two of four replicates. We used ~10 utricles per sample, which represents ~400,000 cells. These preparations will contain both hair cells and supporting cells, but very few other cell types.</p><p>Of course, the dynamic range of protein expression is enormous (10<sup>7</sup>- to 10<sup>10</sup>-fold) and so most techniques only a capture a slice of the range. The single cell experiments, because they use so little input protein, are necessarily biased against detecting rare proteins. Nevertheless, we can gain significant insight into the function of a cell just by looking at its abundant proteins, as we show here.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>For instance, are membrane/soluble proteins well represented in the list? Is the method biasing the detections of some, but not others?</p></disp-quote><p>Despite accounting for ~1/3 of all proteins, as with most mass spectrometry approaches, membrane proteins are not represented well on our list of detected proteins. Their hydrophobic peptides do not perform well on reverse-phase liquid chromatography, are not efficiently ionized before introduction into the mass spectrometer, or both. Soluble and cytoskeletal proteins are well represented, but they are also typically of much higher concentration than are membrane proteins.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Is the mass spec analysis biasing the detection towards small proteins? (I assume orbitrap limits on mass are bypassed by proteolysis treatments, but this could be discussed a bit more).</p></disp-quote><p>Most mass spectrometry sample preparation methods are biased against small proteins, as those methods typically include sieving steps like gel or filter-based purification. Thus we suggest that our sample prep method provides a more accurate estimate of the levels of these small proteins.</p><p>Because of high intrinsic variability for detection efficiency from peptide to peptide, where only a fraction of peptides (5-10%) perform exceptionally well in the mass spectrometer, small proteins can be missed if none of their tryptic peptides are well behaving. Again, normally mass spectrometry analysis is biased against small proteins, so anything that levels the field – like single-pot sample prep – gives a better representation of small proteins.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition, an upper boundary on the number of different proteins expressed in a cell could also be obtained from mRNA transcripts identified (with obvious caveats, but a good upper limit nonetheless), which could help provide another estimate of how many proteins are missing in the analyses.</p></disp-quote><p>In the scRNA-seq experiments, we detected expression of 13,643 genes, not accounting for splice variants, again in the combination of hair cells and supporting cells. Note that all of the concerns raised in point #2 are good ones, and so we have added an additional text to the Discussion that discusses the depth of protein sequencing and biases for and against certain classes of proteins.</p></body></sub-article></article>
