pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26280.001</object-id><p>Opioids, agonists of µ-opioid receptors (µORs), are the strongest pain killers clinically available. Their action includes a strong central component, which also causes important adverse effects. However, µORs are also found on the peripheral endings of nociceptors and their activation there produces meaningful analgesia. The cellular mechanisms downstream of peripheral µORs are not well understood. Here, we show in neurons of murine dorsal root ganglia that pro-nociceptive TRPM3 channels, present in the peripheral parts of nociceptors, are strongly inhibited by µOR activation, much more than other TRP channels in the same compartment, like TRPV1 and TRPA1. Inhibition of TRPM3 channels occurs via a short signaling cascade involving Gβγ proteins, which form a complex with TRPM3. Accordingly, activation of peripheral µORs in vivo strongly attenuates TRPM3-dependent pain. Our data establish TRPM3 inhibition as important consequence of peripheral µOR activation indicating that pharmacologically antagonizing TRPM3 may be a useful analgesic strategy.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26280.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>There are very few treatments available for people suffering from strong or long-lasting pain. Currently, substances called opioids – which include the well-known drug morphine – are the strongest painkillers. However, these drugs also cause harmful side effects, which makes them less useful.</p><p>Like all drugs, opioids mediate their effects by interacting with molecules in the body. In the case of opioids, these interacting molecules belong to a group of receptor proteins called G-protein coupled receptors (or GPCRs for short). These opioid receptors are widely distributed in the nerve cells and brain regions that detect and transmit pain signals. It was poorly understood how activation of opioid receptors reduces the activity of pain-sensing nerve cells, however several lines of evidence had suggested that a protein called TRPM3 might be involved.</p><p>TRPM3 is a channel protein that allows sodium and calcium ions to enter into nerve cells by forming pores in cell membranes, and mice that lack this protein are less sensitive to certain kinds of pain. Dembla, Behrendt et al. now show that activating opioid receptors on nerve cells from mice, with morphine and a similar substance, rapidly reduces the flow of calcium ions through TRPM3 channels. Further experiments confirmed that activating opioid receptors in a mouse’s paw also reduced the pain caused when TRPM3 proteins are activated.</p><p>GPCRs interact with a group of small proteins called G-proteins that, when activated by the receptor, split into two subunits. Based on studies with human kidney cells, Dembla, Behrendt et al. found the so-called G-beta-gamma subunit then carries the signal from the opioid receptor to TRPM3. Two independent studies by Quallo et al. and Badheka, Yudin et al. also report similar findings.</p><p>These new findings show that drugs already used in the treatment of pain can indirectly alter how TRPM3 works in a dramatic way. These results might help scientists to find drugs that work in a more direct way to dial down the activity of TRPM3 and to combat pain with fewer side effects. Though first it will be important to confirm these new findings in human nerve cells.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>TRPM3</kwd><kwd>MOP</kwd><kwd>peripheral opioid receptors</kwd><kwd>G-protein</kwd><kwd>pain</kwd><kwd>analgesia</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Emmy Noether Programm</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schmidt</surname><given-names>Manuela</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GK 1326</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Oberwinkler</surname><given-names>Johannes</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004189</institution-id><institution>Max-Planck-Gesellschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PhD fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sondermann</surname><given-names>Julia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008967</institution-id><institution>Philipps-Universität Marburg</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MARA PhD fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Goecke</surname><given-names>Christian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFB 593</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Oberwinkler</surname><given-names>Johannes</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFB 894</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Oberwinkler</surname><given-names>Johannes</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Pro-nociceptive and pro-inflammatory TRPM3 (transient receptor potential melastatin 3) channels, expressed in somatosensory neurons, are inhibited by activation of Gαi-coupled receptors, such as µ-opioid receptors, in vitro and in vivo.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Throughout the peripheral and central parts of the nociceptive system, µ-opioid receptors (µORs) are widely expressed and strongly control neuronal excitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Stein, 2016</xref>). Agonists of µORs are the most potent analgesic drugs clinically available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pasternak and Pan, 2013</xref>) and are therefore often prescribed for the treatment of severe pain. These opioid substances are especially effective against acute pain states, such as post-operative pain, but they are also used, more controversially, for the treatment of longer lasting or chronic pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Rowbotham et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chou et al., 2015</xref>). Much of the controversy around opioids arises because these substances cause important unwanted effects, such as addiction, tolerance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Volkow and McLellan, 2016</xref>), opioid-induced hyperalgesia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Roeckel et al., 2016</xref>) and, when overdosed, respiratory depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Pattinson, 2008</xref>). Because of this unfavorable profile of unwanted effects, clinically used opioids are often implicated in fatal overdosing due to drug addiction or dosing accidents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Compton et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ray et al., 2016</xref>). While many actions of opioids are triggered by activation of µORs in the central nervous system, opioid receptors are also located on the peripheral nerve endings of nociceptor neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Stein et al., 1990a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">1990b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Stein, 2013</xref>). Physiologically, in the skin, where many peripheral nociceptor nerve endings reside, opioid receptors are targeted by endogenous opioid substances, such as β-endorphin, released in the periphery from immune cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Stein et al., 1990b</xref>) or skin keratinocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ibrahim et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fell et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Activation of peripheral opioid receptors can provide clinically meaningful analgesia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Farley, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Stein and Machelska, 2011</xref>). On the contrary, inhibiting peripheral µORs by antagonist application increases pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jagla et al., 2014</xref>). Targeting peripheral µORs thus has been proposed as a strategy to provide analgesia with reduced adverse effects and an improved safety profile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Stein et al., 2003</xref>). An alternative strategy, in which not the µORs themselves but downstream effectors of µOR signaling pathways are targeted, may also prove to be beneficial. However, such strategies have received less attention, partly because the downstream targets of peripheral µOR signaling are not well documented.</p><p>At central synapses, several intracellular mechanisms leading to reduced neuronal excitation during µOR activation have been worked out in considerable detail. Activation of µORs causes inhibition of L-type voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bourinet et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Heinke et al., 2011</xref>) and activation of several types of K<sup>+</sup> channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Law et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Marker et al., 2005</xref>). Importantly, also at several central synapses, µORs have been shown to interact with TRP channels, notably TRPV1 (recently reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bao et al., 2015</xref>). The interaction of TRPV1 and µOR occurs at multiple anatomical locations in the central nervous system and its physiological consequences and mechanisms are highly diverse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Maione et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Stein, 2016</xref>). Proposed mechanisms range from influencing the cAMP-PKA pathway and the participation of several other kinases (ERK, MAPK, JNK) to β-arrestin2 and the PI3-kinase pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Law et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rowan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bao et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>In peripheral nerves and their endings, several, partially different, intracellular signaling events have been proposed to account for the effectiveness of peripherally restricted opioids, including inhibition of voltage-gated Na<sup>+</sup> channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gold and Levine, 1996</xref>), inhibition of HCN channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ingram and Williams, 1994</xref>), activation of several classes of K<sup>+</sup> channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cunha et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nockemann et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baillie et al., 2015</xref>), and, importantly, again the inhibition of TRPV1 channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Vetter et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Endres-Becker et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Spahn et al., 2013</xref>) However, despite the plethora of proposed targets, the magnitude and the interplay of these individual effects has not been determined. Furthermore, many of these ion channels are not inhibited by µOR activation per se, but rather their upregulation or sensitization by the cAMP/PKA pathway is blocked by µOR signaling. It is therefore unclear, how much each of these targets contributes to the overall effect of opioids on peripheral nerve endings, and how this contribution may vary during shifts from resting to inflamed states (and back). Further, it is unclear, and perhaps even unlikely, that all important downstream targets of µORs have already been identified.</p><p>Recently, TRPM3 channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Oberwinkler and Philipp, 2014</xref>) were described in primary nociceptive neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nealen et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lechner et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Vriens et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Straub et al., 2013a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">2013b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Held et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Usoskin et al., 2015</xref>) and it was shown that these divalent-permeable cation channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Grimm et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Oberwinkler et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Wagner et al., 2010</xref>) play an important role in noxious heat sensation since these channels are intrinsically thermosensitive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Vriens et al., 2011</xref>). Activation of TRPM3 leads to release of pro-inflammatory CGRP from peripheral nociceptor nerve terminals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Held et al., 2015</xref>), while TRPM3-deficient animals show severe defects in the development of inflammatory hyperalgesia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Vriens et al., 2011</xref>). In this context, it is interesting that inhibitors of TRPM3 channels have been identified that exhibit strong anti-nociceptive properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Straub et al., 2013b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Suzuki et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Krügel et al., 2017</xref>). Hence, TRPM3 channels in peripheral nociceptors have pro-nociceptive and pro-inflammatory properties, making them an interesting target to study the mechanism of peripheral nociception and inflammation. Here, we demonstrate that TRPM3 channels in primary nociceptive neurons are rapidly and strongly inhibited by agonists of µORs such as morphine, through an intracellular signaling cascade relaying µORs to TRPM3 channels via Gβγ proteins. We show that local activation of peripheral µORs causes strong analgesia of TRPM3-dependent pain. Our results indicate that it may be worthwhile to further investigate TRPM3 channels as potential targets for the treatment of pain with reduced adverse effects in the central nervous system.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Activation of μORs inhibits TRPM3 channels in DRG neurons</title><p>TRPM3 channels possess pro-nociceptive properties in DRG neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Vriens et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Straub et al., 2013a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">2013b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Held et al., 2015</xref>). We therefore investigated clinically used analgesic drugs for their effects on TRPM3 channels. To address this question, we first activated TRPM3 channels in isolated mouse DRG neurons by applying the known TRPM3 agonist pregnenolone sulfate (PS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Wagner et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Vriens et al., 2011</xref>). Under our recording conditions, the ensuing Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals were almost completely dependent on the presence of TRPM3 proteins, as demonstrated in control experiments with neurons prepared from TRPM3-deficient (TRPM3-knockout) mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Testing whether morphine, a traditional agonist of opioid receptors, or its synthetic, µOR-specific analog DAMGO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Handa et al., 1981</xref>), influences TRPM3 channel activity, we found that both µOR agonists strongly reduced the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals induced by PS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a–c</xref>). The reduction of these Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals was rapid and readily reversible within a time frame of 1–2 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). We ascertained that DAMGO acted via activating opioid receptors by co-applying the opioid receptor antagonist naloxone, which unspecifically blocks several opioid receptor subtypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e–g</xref>). Naloxone alone did not affect TRPM3-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in DRG neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e,g</xref>), but, when co-applied with DAMGO, it prevented the action of DAMGO completely (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f,g</xref>).

After measuring a dose-response curve by varying the concentration of DAMGO, we found that the IC<sub>50</sub> values at +80 mV and −80 mV did not differ, providing an indication that inhibition of TRPM3 channels by µOR activation was voltage-independent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). Similarly, performing patch-clamp experiments on isolated DRG neurons, we observed that the currents evoked by TRPM3 agonists were rapidly (less than 5 s) inhibited by µOR activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a–c</xref>). Upon washout of DAMGO, the inhibition was at least partially reversible. Activation of opioid receptors causes many cellular responses in DRG neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Law et al., 2000</xref>), including the activation of K<sup>+</sup> channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Yoshimura and North, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ocaña et al., 2004</xref>). Importantly, stimulation of K<sup>+</sup> channels might reduce Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in DRG neurons through hyperpolarization-induced closure of voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels. Because K<sup>+</sup> channels cannot directly be studied in Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging experiments, we continued to use the whole-cell patch-clamp technique on isolated DRG neurons. Aiming for small-diameter nociceptors, we selected cells that responded either to TRPV1- or to TRPM3-activating (or to both types of) agonists. In these cells, we could not detect outward currents upon application of the µOR agonist DAMGO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d–f</xref>). This indicates that the reduction of PS-induced currents by µOR activation is not due to the activation of outward currents. Consequently, the DAMGO-induced reduction of PS-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals observed in Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging experiments (e.g. in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a–g</xref>) is unlikely to be caused by K<sup>+</sup> channel-dependent hyperpolarization.

Conversely, only a minority of the cells without apparent effect of DAMGO on TRPM3-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals (14 of 52 DAMGO-insensitive cells, i.e. 27% of the DAMGO-insensitive cells, corresponding to 2% of all PS-sensitive cells) showed a response to capsaicin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2i</xref>). These data are corroborated by the size distribution of both, DAMGO-sensitive and DAMGO-insensitive, subgroups of PS-sensitive cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). PS-sensitive cells of both subgroups showed the typical distribution of small-diameter C- and Aδ-type neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Vriens et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Tan and McNaughton, 2016</xref>), with only very few larger cells (diameter &gt;31 µm: 26 of 614 cells, equivalent to 4.2%). On the other hand, the group of neurons that responded neither to PS nor to capsaicin appeared to contain a somewhat higher number of larger cells (diameter &gt;31 µm: 146 of 1673 cells, equivalent to 8.9%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1c,d</xref>). Together, these data show that activation of µORs is capable of rapidly and strongly reducing currents through TRPM3 channels in a subset of DRG neurons, corresponding largely, but not exclusively, to putative peptidergic nociceptors.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>TRPM3 channels are inhibited by receptors coupled to Gα<sub>i/o</sub>-containing G proteins</title><p>DRG neurons express a host of different G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gold and Gebhart, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Veldhuis et al., 2015</xref>), many of which have been implied in regulating the excitability of these neurons. µORs couple preferentially to members of the Gα<sub>i</sub> subfamily, i.e. G<sub>i/o</sub> proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Law et al., 2000</xref>).

We tested whether this process is required for inhibiting TRPM3 channels. We found that application of IBMX (to inhibit cAMP-degrading phosphodiesterases) and forskolin (to stimulate cAMP-producing adenylyl cyclases) did not influence TRPM3 channel activity in DRG neurons nor their inhibition by µOR activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e,f</xref>). We observed the same outcome in TRPM3- and µOR-overexpressing HEK cells after combined application of forskolin and IBMX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5g,h</xref>). Changing concentrations of cAMP might influence the activity of protein kinase A (PKA). However, when we dialyzed TRPM3- and µOR-expressing HEK cells with the unhydrolyzable ATP analog AMP-PNP through the pipette in patch-clamp experiments, effectively blocking the action of all kinases, including PKAs, we found no evidence that this treatment affected the inhibitory action of µOR activation on TRPM3 channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5i,k</xref>). On the other hand, when we removed Mg<sup>2+</sup> ions from the intracellular solution, the inhibiting action of DAMGO on TRPM3 channel activity was lost after 5 min of internally dialyzing the cells via the patch pipette (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5j,k</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1a</xref>), showing that under our recording conditions the exchange between pipette solution and the cytosol was sufficiently rapid. These data also support our earlier conclusion that µOR-mediated TRPM3 inhibition relies on G-protein signaling as G proteins need Mg<sup>2+</sup> ions to bind GTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gilman, 1987</xref>). We made sure that the series resistance during the patch-clamp recordings was not significantly different between the experimental groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1b</xref>). Therefore, these experiments suggest that kinases are not involved in the signaling pathway of µORs to TRPM3 channels. This conclusion was further corroborated by experiments using kinase inhibitors (H89, a relatively non-specific kinase inhibitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lochner and Moolman, 2006</xref>); KT5720, inhibitor of PKA; BIM, inhibitor of PKC), none of which abolished the inhibition of TRPM3 channels by µOR activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). However, some of these pharmacological kinase inhibitors, in particular H89 and KT5720, had unexpected and potentially unspecific effects on the measured Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals and on TRPM3 activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Importantly, the reduction of TRPM3 activity by Gβγ subunits was attenuated by the additional overexpression of (myristoylated) myr-βARKct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Koch et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Rishal et al., 2005</xref>), a Gβγ-binding peptide, indicating that the inhibition of TRPM3 channels was caused specifically by the overexpressed Gβγ subunits in an unbound state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7f,g</xref>). A suppression of TRPM3 activity by overexpressed Gβγ subunits could also be demonstrated in whole-cell patch-clamp recordings of transfected HEK cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7h,i</xref>).</p><p>We next tried to increase the concentration of free Gβγ subunits with a different approach that does not necessitate transfections and overexpression of exogenous proteins. The peptide mSIRK, when applied extracellularly, enters the cells and induces the dissociation of heterotrimeric G proteins without inducing GDP/GTP exchange in the Gα subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Goubaeva et al., 2003</xref>). Using this approach, we observed a significant reduction in TRPM3 activity in DRG neurons as well as in TRPM3 overexpressing HEK cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3</xref>). The inactive analog mSIRK-L9A did not cause this effect. However, mSIRK also induced an increased Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration in the cells at baseline, which was especially prominent in DRG neurons. It is therefore unclear if the reduction in TRPM3 activity was caused by the increased concentration of free Gβγ subunits, or if it was caused more indirectly by the increased free Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration. When we tried to manipulate the concentration of free Gβγ subunits in the opposite direction by overexpression of Gβγ-binding peptides, myr-βARKct as before or myr-phosducin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Schulz, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Rishal et al., 2005</xref>), we found that the inhibitory signaling from µORs to TRPM3 channels was severely reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>). In aggregate, these data strongly suggest a model in which TRPM3 channels are inhibited by free Gβγ dimers, but not by Gα<sub>i/o</sub> subunits. Interestingly, in the experiments where non-active Gα<sub>i/o</sub> subunits were overexpressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a–d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1a</xref>), we consistently observed an increase of the resting Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration. Possibly, this increase is due to an increased basal activity of TRPM3 channels caused by binding and thereby scavenging of free Gβγ subunits by the overexpressed Gα subunits. To test this speculation, further experimental work will be necessary.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>TRPM3 and Gβ proteins are parts of the same protein complex</title><p>To examine whether TRPM3 proteins and Gβγ subunits form a protein complex, we immunoprecipitated TRPM3 proteins equipped with a C-terminal YFP tag with anti-GFP antibodies (which also recognize YFP).

The key evidence for this assertion is that (1) overexpression of Gβγ, but not Gα proteins inhibits TRPM3 channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), that (2) TRPM3 proteins are found in the same protein complexes as Gβ proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figures 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9</xref>) and that (3) alternative pathways involving cAMP and protein kinases could be ruled out (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e–k</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).

One report linked TRPA1 channel activation to Gβγ dimers liberated after activation of the GPCR MrgprA3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Wilson et al., 2011</xref>). We tested therefore, whether µOR activation has an effect on TRPA1 channels in DRG neurons, but observed neither an inhibition nor a pronounced activation of these channels. This finding could indicate that µORs and TRPA1 channels are expressed in largely separate subpopulations of DRG neurons. However, we also failed to observe an effect of µOR activation in a heterologous overexpression system where µOR activation had a clear effect on TRPM3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4f</xref>), indicating that the regulation of TRPA1 channels by Gβγ proteins might not be direct and requires further investigation. The only other TRP channel that has been reported to be regulated by Gβγ dimers is TRPM1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Shen et al., 2012</xref>), the channel protein with the highest homology to TRPM3. TRPM1, however, is not known to be expressed in somatosensory neurons. The assertion that TRPM1 is inhibited by Gβγ dimers has been controversial since earlier work reported that purified Gβγ dimers are ineffective, while Gα<sub>o</sub> proteins inhibit heterologously expressed TRPM1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Koike et al., 2010</xref>). A recent publication apparently reconciles these findings by providing evidence that both G protein subunits bind to TRPM1 and inhibit the channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Xu et al., 2016</xref>). Still, it is an open question, which of these G protein entities is more important in regulating TRPM1 channels under physiological conditions.</p><p>In addition to the proposed regulation of TRPM1 by Gα<sub>o</sub> proteins, TRPM8 has recently been shown to directly bind Gα<sub>q</sub> proteins and to be strongly inhibited by this event (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>). It was therefore important to test whether TRPM3 binds to and whether it is regulated by Gα subunits. Our data indicate that neither is the case (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref>), reinforcing our model that the main signaling pathway from µOR to TRPM3 channels is via Gβγ proteins.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Signaling pathways employed by peripheral μORs</title><p>The intracellular pathways by which peripheral µORs reduce the excitability of primary nociceptive neurons seem diverse. A PI3Kγ/NO pathway has been described for the stimulation of K<sub>ATP</sub> channels, where PI3Kγ is activated by Gβγ subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cunha et al., 2010</xref>). Also, GIRK2 channels activated directly by Gβγ proteins have been implicated in peripheral opioid analgesia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nockemann et al., 2013</xref>). These channels are absent from mouse DRG neurons, but may play a role in human anti-nociception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nockemann et al., 2013</xref>). Other ion channels seem to be regulated by peripheral µORs via their effects on the cellular cAMP level, often through subsequently influencing PKA activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ingram and Williams, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gold and Levine, 1996</xref>). This implies that µOR activity only affects these targets when cellular cAMP levels are elevated, for instance during inflammatory conditions. Notably, TRPV1 channels are also regulated by µORs through the well-established cAMP/PKA pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Vetter et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Endres-Becker et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Vetter et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Spahn et al., 2013</xref>). Since we were studying TRPV1 channels in DRG neurons under resting, non-inflamed conditions, these considerations might explain why we observed no or only very modest effects of µOR activation on TRPV1 channel activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a,b,e</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). An entirely different, β-arrestin2-dependent pathway leading from µOR stimulation to TRPV1 activation has also been proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rowan et al., 2014</xref>). Remarkably, and in stark contrast to the published regulation of TRPV1 by cAMP/PKA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Huang et al., 2006</xref>), TRPM3 channels were largely unaffected by our attempts to manipulate intracellular cAMP levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e–h</xref>).</p><p>These results from our cellular studies are well matched by the outcome of the in vivo experiments. TRPM3-dependent pain (evoked by the injection of PS into the hind-paw) was strongly suppressed by concomitant injection of µOR agonists, while these substances did not significantly attenuate TRPV1-dependent pain due to the injection of capsaicin at any of the concentrations tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). Together, these data demonstrate that the strong and direct functional influence of activated µORs on TRPM3 channels also works in peripheral endings of primary nociceptive neurons in vivo. Our findings establish TRPM3 channels as privileged target of peripheral µORs and thus indicate that TRPM3 channels play an important role in the physiological control of nociceptor excitability.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>TRPM3 is a candidate target for anti-nociceptive pharmacological interventions</title><p>The presence of TRPM3 channels in small-diameter nociceptor neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Vriens et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Usoskin et al., 2015</xref>), their ability to release inflammatory mediators like CGRP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Held et al., 2015</xref>), some aspects of their pharmacology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Straub et al., 2013b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Suzuki et al., 2016</xref>) and the phenotype of TRPM3-deficient mice, which strongly implied TRPM3 channels in the sensation of noxious heat and in inflammatory heat hyperalgesia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Vriens et al., 2011</xref>), have previously advanced the argument that inhibition of TRPM3 might be a viable strategy to combat pain, especially inflammatory hyperalgesia. The results presented in this study provide further, strong support for this contention, because they show that TRPM3 inhibition is an important aspect of the action spectrum of µORs. Potentially, the findings presented here therefore help to explain the clinical effectiveness of peripherally acting or peripherally restricted µOR agonists. However, peripherally restricted µOR agonists still can exhibit pronounced and dose-limiting adverse effects, such as tolerance and constipation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Stein, 2016</xref>). Pharmacologically inhibiting TRPM3 channels directly might therefore be a feasible alternative to the established administration of µOR agonists. Given the unremarkable phenotype of TRPM3-deficient mice, when not challenged with painful stimuli, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Vriens et al., 2011</xref>), it is reasonable to hope that unwanted effects of TRPM3 inhibitors may be less limiting than those of µOR agonists. It will be important to elucidate in various painful conditions how strong and robust the relief is that can be obtained by antagonists of TRPM3 channels. This study provides a strong incentive for commencing such work.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>For cellular experiments, we used adult mice of a wide age range (aged 12–77 weeks) of both sexes.

For quantitative analysis and statistical testing, single cell time series traces were smoothed (running window of five values) and maximum, average or minimum values were obtained in a given time-window (typically corresponding to the application of a substance) from the smoothed single cell Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging traces. Inhibition due to a pharmacological manipulation was calculated for Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging (and electrophysiological) data by obtaining three (baseline-subtracted) values: One before (V<sub>before</sub>), one during (V<sub>during</sub>) and one after the application (V<sub>after</sub>) of the pharmacological substance. Inhibition (in percent) was calculated as: Inhibition = 100 * (1 – (2 * V<sub>during</sub> / (V<sub>before</sub> +V<sub>after</sub>)). The averaging of the values before and after pharmacological interventions was done in an effort to correct for the pronounced and inevitable reduction in response during repeated or prolonged applications of agonists, such as PS or capsaicin. Please note, however, that this way of calculating inhibition (which is a very common and standard way) still is prone to artefacts and can report inaccurate values. For example, a cell that responded to the first application of an agonists (V<sub>before</sub>), but then simply ceased to respond to any further stimulation (V<sub>during</sub> and V<sub>after</sub> would then be ‘0’), would be reported as 100% inhibited. Please note also that the formula for calculating inhibition can report negative values, when a cell responds stronger during the application of the pharmacological intervention (V<sub>during</sub> larger than the average of V<sub>before</sub> and V<sub>after</sub>). Because DRG neurons are a highly diverse population and sometimes are also prone to spontaneous activity, the individual values reported in the ‘dot clouds’ often contain a minority of cells that displayed such negative inhibitory values. Another common source for artificial values is baseline shift, which we did not attempt to correct for.</p><p>Isolated DRG cells were classified as neurons if they responded either to capsaicin or the solution with a high potassium concentration (high-K<sup>+</sup> solution), cells outside of this category were not considered further. For sorting individual DRG neurons into different categories (e.g. PS-sensitive or capsaicin-sensitive), a threshold of 0.1 ratio units was set arbitrarily (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> for a justification of this value). As an exception, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3a,b</xref>, we have taken a threshold value of 0.05, because the treatment with mSIRK has lowered the response amplitude to PS. For categorizing sensitivity to an inhibitory stimulus, a minimal inhibition of 7.5% of the agonist-induced response (calculated as above) was arbitrarily set as threshold. Traces of single cell time series corresponding to a category were averaged and are presented as mean ± SEM throughout this manuscript. Next to the representation of aggregated data, we also plotted the values from all individual neurons analyzed as ‘dot cloud’. For each reported average trace, we also show responses from ten randomly chosen neurons in the figure supplements. Calculating the response values, categorizing, averaging and plotting the randomly chosen cells was done in R.</p><p>For Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging experiments of (transfected) cell culture cells, we did not categorize individual cells as responders or non-responders, but took all cells according to transfection status or pharmacological treatment. Since these cells represent a much more homogenous group, we did not report single cell values, but only averaged responses.</p><p>Cell diameters were estimated by drawing elliptical selections manually around single DRG neurons on ratio images during a strong stimulation (in this case with high-K<sup>+</sup> solution). Subsequently, Feret's diameter was measured with the built-in function of ImageJ. The distribution of single cell Feret's diameters was represented as histograms with a bin width of 2 µm.</p><p>For Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging and electrophysiological experiments, we considered single individual cells as independent biological replicates. We additionally report the number of recordings for Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging experiments, which indicates the number of coverslips (with the attached cells) that were used in these experiments in sequential measurements. In electrophysiological experiments, we equally used the number of individual cells that were successfully recorded as the number of biological replicates. Each single, individual co-immunoprecipitation experiment was visualized on a single western blot, which was quantitatively analyzed and considered a biological replicate. Finally, in behavioral experiments, each individual mouse was recorded only once and considered a biological replicate. In all types of experiments, the number of biological replicates (determined as described above and referred to as ‘n’) was used for statistical testing and to calculate SEM values.</p><p>We did not perform any a-priori estimation of sample sizes. We followed, however, closely the standards in the field, and, accordingly, used 7–15 individual biological replicates for each data point in electrophysiological (whole-cell patch-clamping), Western blotting and behavioral experiments. Such numbers for replicates mean that we were able to detect (with a power of 80% and at a level of significance of p&lt;0.05) differences between means that were in the order of 1–2 SD. For Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging experiments, we always performed at least two separate recordings. During each recording, we typically were able to record at least from 10 cells (depending on parameters such as transfection efficiency and cell survival during pharmacological treatments), meaning that each trace in Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging recordings represents the mean of more than 20 cells. The precise number of cells is stated in the figures themselves or, alternatively, in the figure legends.</p><p>Because of the small sample sizes in some experiments, and because we observed that many of the larger data sets did not conform to Gaussian normality (as tested with Graphpad Prism, version 3.02, Graphpad software, La Jolla, CA, USA), typically due to outliers (which were never removed from any data set), we preferred non-parametric statistical tests. For comparing two groups, we used the Mann-Whitney test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b,d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7g,i</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10a–c</xref>) or the Wilcoxon signed rank test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b,e</xref>). For multiple comparisons, we used either the Kruskal-Wallis test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5k</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3a,c</xref>) or the Friedman test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1m</xref>). These two latter tests were followed by Dunn's multiple comparison test. All statistical testings were done with Graphpad Prism or R. In all cases, we accepted p-values smaller than 0.05 as statistically significant. In the figures, we use * to indicate p-values larger or equal than 0.01 and smaller than 0.05, ** for p-values larger or equal than 0.001 and smaller than 0.01 and, accordingly, *** for p-values smaller than 0.001. Unless otherwise stated in the figure legend, bar graphs with error bars always represent the mean ± SEM. Fitting Hill functions (with variable slope) to dose-response curves was done with Graphpad Prism.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Protein immunoprecipitation and western blots</title><p>For immunoprecipitation of TRPM3, HEK cells stably expressing myc-TRPM3α2-YFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Oberwinkler et al., 2005</xref>) were solubilized in a lysis buffer consisting of 25 mM Tris (pH 8), 0.5% (w/v) Triton X-100, 0.5% (w/v) Na<sup>+</sup>-deoxycholate, 50 mM NaCl and a protease inhibitor mix as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Leitner et al., 2016</xref>). All reagents for immunoprecipitation and western blotting were obtained from Carl Roth (Karlsruhe, Germany) unless stated otherwise. Non-transfected HEK cells were used as controls. After removal of debris and nuclei by centrifugation for 15 min at 13,000 g and 4°C, a known fraction of the lysate (typically 1% of the total lysate) was separated for later use as input control and the remaining lysate was incubated with GFP-Trap agarose beads (ChromoTek, Planegg-Martinsried, Germany) at 4°C over night on a tube roller. Subsequently, beads were washed once with lysis buffer and four times with binding buffer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hu et al., 2009</xref>) containing 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.4), 0.01% (w/v) CHAPS, 140 mM K<sup>+</sup>-aspartate, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 mM EGTA and 0.04 mM dithiothreitol. Input and immunoprecipitated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (GE Healthcare, Solingen, Germany). For protein visualization, we used fluorescence (ODYSSEY Sa, LI-COR Biosciences, Bad Homburg, Germany) or chemiluminescence (ChemoCam Imager, Intas, Göttingen, Germany) detection systems together with the following antibodies: anti-GFP (Santa Cruz, sc-8334, 1:500), anti-Gβ (Santa Cruz, sc-378, 1:500), anti-Gα<sub>i3</sub> (1:1000; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gohla et al., 2007</xref>]), anti-Gα<sub>q/11/14</sub> (Santa Cruz, sc-365906, 1:500), anti-rabbit IgG-IRDye-800CW (LI-COR, #926–32211, 1:10,000), anti-mouse IgG-HRP (Santa Cruz, sc-2031, 1:10,000), anti-rabbit IgG-HRP (Santa Cruz, sc-2030, 1:10,000). Immunoprecipitation experiments were quantified densitometrically using ImageJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abràmoff et al., 2004</xref>), the density values for the immunoprecipitated Gβ proteins were subsequently normalized to the density values obtained for Gβ proteins from the total lysate.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Mass spectrometry</title><p>TRPM3 protein isolation was performed essentially as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Uchida et al., 2016</xref>). In brief, seven to eight 10 cm culture dishes with HEK cells stably expressing myc-TRPM3α2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Uchida et al., 2016</xref>) were grown to ~80% confluence and used for a single immunoprecipitation probe. Cells were washed and collected with cold phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and resuspended in NCB buffer, containing (in mM): 500 NaCl, 50 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 20 HEPES and 10% (v/v) glycerol (pH 7.5), with addition of 1 mM protease inhibitor phenyl-methyl-sulfonyl-fluorid and 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol. Next, the cells were lysed by freezing/thawing and centrifuged at 40,000 g for 2.5 hr. The pellet was resuspended in NCB buffer with the addition of a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche), 0.1% (w/v) Nonidet P-40 (Roche) and 0.5% (w/v) dodecylmaltoside (Calbiochem). The suspension was incubated overnight on a shaker with gentle agitation, and then centrifuged for 1 hr at 40,000 g. The supernatant was incubated with magnetic beads (Pierce, Thermo Fisher) conjugated with anti-myc antibodies (Sigma-Aldrich). All steps of incubation were performed at 4°C. TRPM3 proteins were eluted from the beads with SDS-loading buffer by boiling. The eluted proteins then were separated by SDS-PAGE on 10% polyacrylamide gels and Tris-glycine-SDS buffer (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) at a constant voltage of 180 V. Proteins were visualized by Coomassie blue staining.</p><p>Besides the heavy and light chain antibody bands derived from immunoprecipitation, the gel showed a profound band at approx. 212 kDa, corresponding to the molecular weight of TRPM3 monomers. From each gel (corresponding to one experiment), 12–14 bands were excised and digested with trypsin for mass spectrometry analysis according to a published protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Shevchenko et al., 2006</xref>), with some modifications. The protein digests were analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) using a nano flow liquid chromatography system (Ultimate3000, Thermo Fisher) interfaced to a hybrid ion trap-orbitrap high resolution tandem mass spectrometer (VelosPro, Thermo Fisher) operated in data-dependent acquisition mode, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Uchida et al., 2016</xref>). Data analysis were performed on ProteomeDiscoverer 2.1 (Thermo Fisher) using SequestHT (0.1% false discovery rate) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Tabb, 2015</xref>) and Percolator for peptide/protein identification and validation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Käll et al., 2007</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Behavioral testing</title><p>After acclimatization for at least 1 hr in transparent plastic boxes, the mice were injected subcutaneously with 10 µl of the respective experimental agent into the midplantar region of the left hind paw. The total duration of nocifensive behavior (paw lifting, shaking and licking) during a 20-min observation period was measured. For PS-induced pain mice received either 5 nmol PS together with 2 µg DAMGO, both dissolved in PBS or 5 nmol PS and the vehicle. For dissolving PS in PBS, the solution was heated to 30°C and sonicated for 20 min. For capsaicin-induced pain, mice were injected with 0.5 µg capsaicin (dissolved in 3% ethanol/PBS) together with 2 µg DAMGO or 0.5 µg capsaicin and vehicle (PBS). Experiments were done with a minimum of three independent mouse litters. Whenever possible, littermates were used as controls (vehicle injection) on the same experimental day.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors thank D Wagner, S Plant and M Portz for excellent technical support during different phases of this project.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Anti-nociceptive action of peripheral µ-opioid receptors by Gβγ-mediated inhibition of TRPM3 channels&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Kenton Swartz as the Reviewing Editor and Richard Aldrich as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Thomas Voets (Reviewer #1); László Csanády (Reviewer #2); Alexander Chesler (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript is one of three that reports exciting new findings on the mechanism of inhibition of TRPM3 channel activity in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) sensory neurons by stimulation of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Although all three manuscripts received favorable reviews, the essential revisions will require different amounts of time to address, and we encourage the authors to coordinate submission of their revised manuscripts.</p><p>The main conclusion of this study is that inhibition of TRPM3 activity by stimulation of GPCRs (in particular mu-opioid receptors) is mediated through a direct interaction of the channel protein with Gβγ dimers released from G-α subunits of the G<sub>i/o</sub> subfamily. This finding is a breakthrough in understanding the regulation of TRPM3 channel activity, as well as the involvement of TRPM3 channels in peripheral nociception. Overall this is a very carefully conducted study, which combines Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging and whole-cell patch-clamp recordings performed in dissociated DRG neurons, and in a heterologous expression system (HEK-293 cells) in which individual components of various GPCR signaling pathways are overexpressed together with TRPM3. In addition, co-immunoprecipitation is used to demonstrate (or rule out) direct interaction between TRPM3 and various G-protein subunits. Finally, in vivo experiments demonstrate significant reduction in TRPM3-dependent pain by stimulation of peripheral opioid mu receptors. Most figures are accompanied by one or more supplementary figures which illustrate careful control experiments. Overall, this is an exciting and thorough study that is very appropriate for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Much of the data in paper is from calcium imaging experiments. To fully evaluate the quality and robustness of calcium imaging data it is helpful to have representative images and representative traces. This would allow the reader to appreciate the density and health of the cells and neurons as well as the robustness of individual responses. Additionally, it is unclear to us how the data are averaged/presented and the error bars were confusing. Please consider the presentation and make it clear to the reader what is being presented.</p><p>2) The involvement of TRPV1 in mu-opioid mediated inflammatory analgesia (e.g. Maione et al. 2009) is well-established, as mentioned in the Discussion, and it is not clear to what extent this form of analgesia is mediated through TRPM3. We request that the authors reframe the manuscript with a more balanced Introduction and Discussion that includes the other well-known MOR-modulated pathways and places TRPM3 within this broader context.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26280.035</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) Much of the data in paper is from calcium imaging experiments.

In order to do so, we had to re-analyze all of the data sets. We now provide:</p><p>– A “dot cloud” next to each bar of a bar graph. The bars still represent mean +/- SEM values. In the “dot-clouds”, each point represents a single, individual cell. Therefore these graphs represent faithfully the whole data set and show the variability of the measurements.</p><p>– Additionally, we show for each averaged trace ten randomly chosen cells in the same time-series representation (y-axis: fura2 signal, x-axis: time). We have taken ten cells as a compromise to show enough traces to allow an impression of the variability, but not too many traces to still allow following individual traces. Please note that since these cells were randomly chosen, they might not be representative of the mean value after averaging the traces of all cells. However, by choosing the cells randomly, we believe that we have avoided selection biases. These graphs are all in supplement figures.</p><p>– For the data set of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G – I</xref>, we also provide so-called “heat maps”, for which the cell responses are ordered and represented in a false color code. This allows visualizing all cells analyzed (614 in this case) without overlap.</p><p>– In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>, we show a set of representative images of the isolated DRG cells on coverslips, taken under various stimuli and illumination conditions.</p><p>Please note that compared to the data submitted previously, we have changed the fura-2 threshold value that we used for categorizing the cells as responders or non-responders (was previously 0.05, we now use 0.1). This change appeared useful, because the single cell analysis allowed us to look at the response statistics of wild-type and TRPM3-deficient (“TRPM3 knock-out”) animals. This analysis is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D, E</xref> and shows that a threshold of 0.05 is too liberal and allows too many false-positive cells in the responder categories. Please note that all our conclusions and statistical tests were confirmed when using the new analysis with the new threshold values (i.e. our analysis turned out to be rather robust), however, obviously, the number of neurons in the “responder” categories is now reduced.</p><p>Because responses of (transfected) cell culture lines are much more homogenous, and no categorization is necessary in these experiments, we did not perform the single cell analysis for experiments with cells from cell culture lines.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><italic>Additionally, it is unclear to us how the data are averaged/presented and the error bars were confusing.

We hope that the new text is better and easier to understand. We have also changed the representation of the error bars on the averaged traces, in as much as we have removed the horizontal “handles” of the error bars. Additionally, we have made the error bars “lighter” in color. This allows now to differentiate visually between the averaged mean value and the SEM values. We hope that these changes have improved our presentation sufficiently.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><italic>2) The involvement of TRPV1 in mu-opioid mediated inflammatory analgesia (e.g. Maione et al. 2009) is well-established, as mentioned in the Discussion, and it is not clear to what extent this form of analgesia is mediated through TRPM3.

By citing recent reviews on this topic, we hope to guide interested readers into this somewhat complex and controversial field, while hoping to maintain readability and conciseness of the Introduction.</p><p>We realize that our claim that TRPM3 is a key target of µOR signaling is somewhat surprising. Because we feel that this point is important, we have additionally performed new experiments in which we again tested the effects of DAMGO on TRPV1-dependent responses.
