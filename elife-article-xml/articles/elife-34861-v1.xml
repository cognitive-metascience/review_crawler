pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34861.001</object-id><p>Recent evidence suggests that capillary pericytes are contractile and play a crucial role in the regulation of microcirculation. However, failure to detect components of the contractile apparatus in capillary pericytes, most notably α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), has questioned these findings. Using strategies that allow rapid filamentous-actin (F-actin) fixation (i.e. snap freeze fixation with methanol at −20°C) or prevent F-actin depolymerization (i.e. with F-actin stabilizing agents), we demonstrate that pericytes on mouse retinal capillaries, including those in intermediate and deeper plexus, express α-SMA. Junctional pericytes were more frequently α-SMA-positive relative to pericytes on linear capillary segments. Intravitreal administration of short interfering RNA (α-SMA-siRNA) suppressed α-SMA expression preferentially in high order branch capillary pericytes, confirming the existence of a smaller pool of α-SMA in distal capillary pericytes that is quickly lost by depolymerization. We conclude that capillary pericytes do express α-SMA, which rapidly depolymerizes during tissue fixation thus evading detection by immunolabeling.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34861.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Blood vessels in animals’ bodies are highly organized. The large blood vessels from the heart branch to smaller vessels that are spread throughout the tissues. The smallest vessels, the capillaries, allow oxygen and nutrients to pass from the blood to nearby cells in tissues. Some capillaries, including those at the back of the eye (in the retina) and those in the brain, change their diameter in response to activity in the nervous system. This allows more or less oxygen and nutrients to be delivered to match these tissues’ demands. However, unlike for larger blood vessels, how capillaries constrict or dilate is debated.</p><p>While large vessels are encircled by smooth muscle cells, capillaries are instead surrounded by muscle-like cells called pericytes, and some scientists have suggested that it is these cells that contract to narrow the diameter of a capillary or relax to widen it. However, other researchers have questioned this explanation. This is mostly because several laboratories could not detect the proteins that would be needed for contraction within these pericytes – the most notable of which is a protein called α-smooth muscle actin (or α-SMA for short).</p><p>Alarcon-Martinez, Yilmaz-Ozcan et al. hypothesized that the way samples are usually prepared for analysis was causing the α-SMA to be degraded before it could be detected. To test this hypothesis, they used different methods to fix and preserve capillaries and pericytes in samples taken from the retinas of mice. When the tissue samples were immediately frozen with ice-cold methanol instead of a more standard formaldehyde solution, α-SMA could be detected at much higher levels in the capillary pericytes. Treating samples with a toxin called phalloidin, which stabilizes filaments of actin, also made α-SMA more readily visible. When α-SMA was experimentally depleted from the mouse retinas, the capillary pericytes were more affected than the larger blood vessels. This finding supports the idea that the pericytes contain, and rely upon, only a small amount of α-SMA.</p><p>Finding α-SMA in capillary pericytes may explain how these small blood vessels can change their diameter. Future experiments will clarify how these pericytes regulate blood flow at the level of individual capillaries, and may give insights into conditions such as stroke, which is caused by reduced blood flow to the brain.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>alpha-smooth muscle actin</kwd><kwd>retinal pericytes</kwd><kwd>capillary</kwd><kwd>F-actin</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004963</institution-id><institution>Seventh Framework Programme</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>112C013</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Alarcon-Martinez</surname><given-names>Luis</given-names></name><name><surname>Dalkara</surname><given-names>Turgay</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004410</institution-id><institution>Türkiye Bilimsel ve Teknolojik Araştirma Kurumu</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>112C013</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Alarcon-Martinez</surname><given-names>Luis</given-names></name><name><surname>Dalkara</surname><given-names>Turgay</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004410</institution-id><institution>Türkiye Bilimsel ve Teknolojik Araştirma Kurumu</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>114S190</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yemisci</surname><given-names>Muge</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001818</institution-id><institution>Research to Prevent Blindness</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Career Development Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schallek</surname><given-names>Jesse</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001818</institution-id><institution>Research to Prevent Blindness</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Unrestricted Grant to the University of Rochester Department of Ophthalmology</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schallek</surname><given-names>Jesse</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>The Schmitt Program on Integrative Brain Research and NIH</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schallek</surname><given-names>Jesse</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Ruth L.

However, this idea was later challenged based on findings that microcirculatory blood flow is largely regulated by upstream arterioles rich in α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), the contractile protein present in vascular smooth muscle cells. A number of studies in the past three decades reported that most capillary pericytes in the central nervous system contained little or no α-SMA, whereas α-SMA was detected in pericytes located on pre-capillary arterioles and post-capillary venules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bandopadhyay et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Nehls and Drenckhahn, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kur et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kornfield and Newman, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Armulik et al., 2011</xref>). In contrast, recent in vitro and in vivo functional studies have demonstrated that a subgroup of capillary pericytes are contractile in the brain and retina, and have the capacity to regulate the microcirculation by contracting and relaxing in response to physiological (i.e. neurovascular coupling) as well as pharmacological stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kornfield and Newman, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hall et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Peppiatt et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fernández-Klett et al., 2010</xref>). Importantly, Hall et al. showed that capillaries covered by pericytes dilate before arte-rioles in response to neuronal stimulus in situ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hall et al., 2014</xref>). Recently, an increase in astrocytic calcium was shown to mediate brain capillary changes in response to metabolic demand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Mishra et al., 2016</xref>). Similarly, Biesecker et al. showed that calcium signaling in Müller cell endfeet was sufficient to evoke capillary dilation in the retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Biesecker et al., 2016</xref>). Kisler et al. reported that transgenic mice with a decreased number of pericytes had deficient neurovascular coupling and reduced oxygen delivery to the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kisler et al., 2017</xref>), providing additional evidence for the importance of pericytes in blood flow regulation. Collectively, these experiments strongly suggest the presence of a bona fide contractile machinery in capillary pericytes. However, a recent paper dismisses the idea of pericytes being contractile by redefining α-SMA-expressing pericytes as smooth muscle cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hill et al., 2015</xref>). To address this paradox between functional and histological findings, we hypothesized that small amounts of α-SMA in capillary pericytes may be rapidly depolymerized during transcardial perfusion and fixation thus evading detection by immunolabeling. Consistent with this idea, α-SMA in pericytes has been detected by electron microscopy in which small amounts of α-SMA can be identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Toribatake et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Le Beux and Willemot, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ho, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Nakano et al., 2000</xref>) or by in vitro studies in which fixation is more rapidly achieved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Herman and D'Amore, 1985</xref>). Here, we show that when filamentous-actin (F-actin) depolymerization was prevented by F-actin stabilizing agents or by snap fixation, we detected α-SMA in a much larger fraction of microvascular pericytes, including capillary pericytes placed on the intermediate and deeper retinal vascular beds.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Pericytes on retinal capillaries express α-smooth muscle actin</title><p>To elucidate the current controversy on the presence of α-SMA in capillary pericytes and to test the hypothesis that low α-SMA immunoreactivity in pericytes could stem from a preparation artifact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), we first examined F-actin protein expression in capillary pericytes using fluorescently-tagged phalloidin. Intriguingly, we found substantial F-actin in pericyte processes surrounding capillaries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–D</xref>). Encouraged by this observation, we tested several fixation methods to enhance α-SMA detection. Snap freeze fixation of retinas with methanol at −20°C, yielded almost twice as many α-SMA-immunopositive microvessels compared to paraformaldehyde (PFA) fixation (Methanol: 441 ± 28 vessels, PFA: 254 ± 63 vessels, p=0.023; ANOVA) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1A–B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2A, C–D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3A–C</xref>). The number of α-SMA-labeled microvessels significantly increased in fourth order capillaries (Methanol: 144 ± 19 vessels, PFA: 60 ± 28 vessels, p=0.003; ANOVA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1A–B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2A, C–D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3A–C</xref>). Ethanol fixation did not improve α-SMA immunostaining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A–B</xref>), suggesting that the effect of methanol was likely due to a faster fixation and not the result of a nonspecific response (e.g. protein denaturation). No immunoreactivity was observed in negative controls when the anti-α-SMA primary antibody was omitted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>). In addition to their typical bump-on-a-log appearance detected by lectin, the α-SMA-positive pericytes on capillaries were identified by NG2 or PDGRFβ co-immunolabeling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–C</xref>), or by their red fluorescence in NG2-DsRed mice, a transgenic line that allows selective visualization of pericytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34861.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>α-smooth-muscle actin expression in retinal capillary pericytes can be visualized after rapid tissue fixation or inhibition of actin depolymerization.</title><p>(<bold>A–C</bold>) The panoramic montage of confocal images of whole–mount retinas illustrate α-SMA immunolabeling of the retinal vessels after PFA (<bold>A</bold>) or −20°C methanol fixation (<bold>B</bold>), or using specific F-actin fixing agent, jasplakinolide (<bold>C</bold>).

Previous reports relied on α-SMA immunohistochemistry involving the slow transcardial infusion of formaldehyde or PFA fixatives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Thavarajah et al., 2012</xref>), thus lack of or weak α-SMA detection was likely due to rapid F-actin depolymerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Huber et al., 2013</xref>) leading to the disruption of the antibody-binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dudnakova et al., 2010</xref>). Although antigen retrieval on PFA-fixed retinas revealed some α-SMA labeling in retinal microvessels, this signal was modest and only found in a few capillaries. Here, we show that faster tissue fixation with cold methanol strikingly increased the detection of α-SMA-positive pericytes. It is possible that the detection of the minute pool of α-SMA in small soma and processes of pericytes does not only depend on the fixation method, but might also be difficult to visualize in transgenic mice due to dispersion of the limited amount of membrane-bound reporter protein over the relatively large surface area of the pericyte membrane. Moreover, incomplete (mosaic-like) fluorescent protein expression after tamoxifen injection in inducible transgenic mice, in which Cre recombinase expression is driven by the α-SMA promoter, can also account for the failure to visualize low levels of α-SMA labeling at capillary pericytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hill et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hartmann et al., 2015</xref>). Importantly, we demonstrate that inhibition of α-SMA depolymerization in the intact eye using phalloidin or jasplakinolide, two F-actin stabilizing reagents with different pharmacological effects on F-actin, substantially increased visualization of α-SMA in retinal capillary pericytes, particularly those in the deeper retinal plexus. The ratio of α-SMA-positive pericytes was relatively lower to that found in upstream microvessels, consistent with previous reports showing less net O<sub>2</sub> delivery from distal capillaries relative to proximal ones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Sakadžić et al., 2014</xref>). Interestingly, knocking down α-SMA expression led to the disappearance of α-SMA immunostaining mainly in distal capillary pericytes, suggesting that the small pool of α-SMA in capillary pericytes is less stable than in vascular smooth muscle cells. Based on these findings, we conclude that a large population of pericytes, notably those at branching points of retinal microvessels, have the capacity to express α-SMA, which likely mediates their contraction. It has been suggested that γ-actin might contribute to pericyte contractility in cortical microvessels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Grant et al., 2017</xref>). However, our results do not support this hypothesis since we did not detect γ-actin-positive capillary pericytes on distal order branches after preventing F-actin depolymerization. The latter finding also indicates that the increase in α-SMA-positivity after phalloidin or jasplakinolide was not caused by cross-reactivity between the antibodies against γ- and α-isoforms or by accumulation of an excess amount of F-actin that might increase the immunostaining of all isoforms.</p><p>Unlike peripheral tissues where the blood flow changes homogeneously, the density of pericytes is high in the CNS and retina, where the blood flow demand varies considerably between neighboring cell layers or groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kornfield and Newman, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Armulik et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Schallek et al., 2011</xref>). In vitro studies and recent in vivo brain studies have provided a growing body of evidence that capillary pericytes contract or dilate in response to vasoactive mediators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Peppiatt et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fernández-Klett et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Puro, 2007</xref>). This blood flow regulation with fine spatial resolution may be essential for tissues with high functional specialization such as the brain and retina. The retinal capillary dilation in response to light stimulus is reportedly layer-specific (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kornfield and Newman, 2014</xref>). In line with our findings showing clear α-SMA expression in capillary pericytes of the intermediate plexus, the latter study reported robust capillary dilation in this region, but failed to detect α-SMA expression most likely due to the use of PFA-based fixation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kornfield and Newman, 2014</xref>). A recent study using transgenic mice expressing fluorescent proteins driven by the NG2 or α-SMA promoters also confirmed the contractile capacity of microvascular pericytes in the cortex in vivo, however, it proposed a radical redefinition by classifying the NG2- and α-SMA-expressing (contractile) cells as smooth muscle cells, rather than pericytes, as they would have conventionally been named under the original Zimmermann definition used since 1923 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hill et al., 2015</xref>). The existence of at least three sub-classes of pericytes and transitional forms from smooth muscle cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Zimmermann, 1923</xref>) has been a matter of confusion, emphasizing the need for an unambiguous definition of pericyte sub-classes and their corresponding specialized functions.</p><p>In conclusion, we identify key components of the contractile machinery in a large population of pericytes in the healthy retina. The identification of α-SMA in capillary pericytes may contribute to clarify the current paradox between functional and histological studies, and expand our understanding of the mechanisms regulating blood flow at the single-capillary level in neurodegenerative conditions including stroke, retinal ischemia, diabetic retinopathy and Alzheimer’s disease.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>Seventy three Swiss albino (21–35 g), eleven NG2-DsRed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Schallek et al., 2013</xref>) mice were housed under diurnal lighting conditions (12 hr darkness and 12 hr light) and fed ad libitum.

Thus, we analyzed an average of 140 disectors (field of view: 400 × 300 µm along Z-axis) per retina (same area between animal cohorts). The number of α-SMA-positive pericytes in each retinal plexus and the total number of α-SMA+/NG2+ pericytes were calculated using the fractionator equation as follows: total number of elements = Σ quantified elements/ssf X asf X tsf, where ssf is the section-sampling fraction (ssf = number of sections sampled/total sections), asf is the area-sampling fraction (asf = [a(frame)]/area x-y step between disectors), and tsf is the thick-sampling fraction (tsf = frame height/section thickness) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Leal-Campanario et al., 2017</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Short interfering RNA (siRNA) in vivo knockdown</title><p>A custom-designed, in vivo specific, HPLC purified α-SMA-siRNA (siRNA directed against <italic>Acta2</italic>) and a scrambled silencer select negative control siRNA were purchased (4457308 and 4404020, respectively, Ambion LifeTech, Carlsbad, CA). This α-SMA-siRNA was previously characterized in wound healing experiments in the murine liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Rockey et al., 2013</xref>). Each siRNA was injected into the vitreous using a 34-gauge Hamilton syringe (0.5 mg/ml siRNAs, total volume: 3 µl). Prior to injection, siRNAs were mixed with a transfection reagent to facilitate cell entry in vivo. Briefly, a transfection mixture composed of 3 µl In vivo-jetPEI (PolyPlus transfection, 201–10G, Illkirch-Graffenstaden, France) and 12.5 µl of 10% glucose in 9.5 µl of nuclease free water was added to the nucleic acid mixture (3.76 µl from 25 µg siRNA, 12.5 µl of 10% Glucose in 8.74 µl of nuclease free water), and incubated for 15 min at room temperature. Transfection mixture was prepared fresh before each knockdown experiment. Forty-eight hrs after intraocular siRNA delivery, mice were sacrificed. To check whether or not siRNAs were taken up by the cells, a fluorescent dye conjugated siRNA (BLOCK-iT<sup>TM</sup> Alexa Fluor 555 Fluorescent control; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) was mixed with In vivo-jetPEI and delivered to retina as described above.</p><p>Quantitative RT-PCR siRNA-treated retinas were removed precisely under sterile conditions to eliminate RNase contamination. The samples were stored in RNAlater solution (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany, 76104) at −20°C until RNA isolation. RNAs were extracted with RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, 74104) according to instructions. Five hundred ng of total RNA for each sample was used in cDNA synthesis. cDNA synthesis was performed with random hexamer primers with RevertAid First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, K1621) according to instructions. cDNAs were stored at −20°C. Quantitative RT-PCR was performed with Taqman probe-based technology. Taqman gene expression master mix (ABI, Foster city, CA, 4369016), FAM-MGB labeled Taqman probes for mouse α-SMA gene (Assay ID: Mm00725412_s1) and mouse GAPDH gene (Assay ID: Mm9999991_g1) were used. PCR was carried out in triplicates in ABI OneStep Q RT-PCR machine (ABI). Thermal cyclic conditions were as follows: 50°C for 2 min, 95°C for 10 min followed by 40 cycles of 95°C 15 s, 60°C for 1 min. The relative expression values were calculated with ΔΔCt method. α-SMA expression in scrambled-siRNA delivered retinas (n = 3) was normalized to one fold expression and then α-SMA expression in α-SMA-siRNA delivered retinas (n = 3) was compared according to control siRNA group.</p><p>Western blot analysis siRNA-treated retinas were removed and protein homogenates were isolated in the presence of a proteinase and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail containing RIPA buffer. Protein concentration was determined by Pierce BCA protein assay kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 23225), and 40 μg protein per well was loaded to NuPAGE 4–12% Bis-Tris Protein Gels (Thermo Fisher Scientific, NP0321BOX). Proteins were run and transferred to PVDF membranes, followed by incubation in blocking solution containing 5% BSA solution in TBS containing 0.5% tween-20 (TBST) overnight at 4°C. Blots were incubated with primary α-SMA antibody (2 µg/ml, Sigma, A2547-100UL) diluted in blocking solution for overnight at 4°C then with secondary goat anti-mouse HRP conjugated IgG (0.08 µg/ml, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, sc-516102) for 1 hr at room temperature. For loading control, blots were stripped with mild stripping buffer and blocked with 5% fat free milk powder solution in TBST for 1 hr at room temperature, incubated with primary β-tubulin III antibody (0.08 µg/ml, Sigma, USA, T2200) at 4°C for 20 min then with secondary goat anti-rabbit HRP conjugated IgG (0.05 µg/ml, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-2357) for 30 min at room temperature. Bound antibodies were detected with SuperSignal West Femto Maximum Sensitivity Substrate Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 34095). Densitometric analyses were performed with ImageJ software.</p><p>After extraction of whole-mount retinas, they were immunostained for α-SMA. Microvessels exhibiting continues α-SMA positivity in the superficial layer of whole mount retinas were counted based on capillary order. Counts were normalized compared to the α-SMA positive microvessel counts from scrambled-siRNA delivered retinas.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All values are provided as the mean ±standard error of the mean (SEM). We evaluated all cohorts with normality (Shapiro-Wilk test) and variance (F-test) tests. For multiple comparisons of values of the stereological quantifications, we used Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) followed by Dunnett’s or Tukey’s test where appropriate. p≤0.05 was considered significant. For Western blot and qRT-PCR, two-tailed Student’s <italic>t</italic>-test was applied for statistical analysis. To analyze the α-SMA expression relative to capillary order, we used the specific non-parametric Jonckheere-terpstra test for trend analysis.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Prof. D Williams and Prof. B Merigan for allowing us access to laboratory facilities and resources at the Center for Visual Science - University of Rochester, Prof. Y Gürsoy-Özdemir and Dr. B Dönmez-Demir for technical advice and assistance, Prof. M Hayran for his help in statistical analysis.</p></ack><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing—original draft, Project administration, Writing—review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing—original draft, Project administration, Writing—review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Writing—original draft, Project administration, Writing—review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Validation, Investigation, Methodology, Writing—original draft, Project administration, Writing—review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Data curation, Writing—original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Supervision, Methodology, Writing—original draft, Writing—review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Supervision, Methodology, Writing—original draft, Writing—review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Writing—original draft, Project administration, Writing—review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Animal experimentation: Animal housing, care, and application of experimental procedures were all carried out in accordance with the institutional guidelines and approved by the Hacettepe University Animal Experiments Local Ethics Committee (2012/63), committee guidelines on animal resources at the University of Rochester (Rochester, New York), and the guidelines of the Canadian Council on Animal Care and the Centre de Recherche du Centre Hospitalier de l'Université de Montréal (CRCHUM, Montreal, Quebec, Canada).</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec id="s6" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34861.014</object-id><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>Summary of experiments and comparisons.</title><p>The table summarizes all experiments performed including the treatment groups and number of mice used.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Eric Newman (Reviewer #3). Our decision has been reached after an extensive consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that the combinations of findings as presented are not suitable for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>However, all reviewers thought that the component of the manuscript reporting the expression of SMA in pericytes was a significant contribution after attention to the issues raised by the reviewers on that component of the manuscript. However, all reviewers thought that the other components of the manuscript concerning ischemia, calcium handling and gap junctions would require substantial additional experiments beyond the modest revisions that <italic>eLife</italic> can consider. Thus, we would be willing to consider a resubmitted brief manuscript focused exclusively on the SMA expression components.</p><p>If you decide to follow that suggestion, please address the SMA-relevant comments of the reviewers. The comments on the other components of the manuscript are included below for your information. We would have a resubmitted brief manuscript focused on the SMA component re-reviewed by one or more of the original reviewers.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1</italic>:</p><p>This paper is of interest because it addresses a key issue in our understanding of how the CNS regulates its energy supply, i.e. the extent to which capillary pericytes (in addition to arterioles) regulate blood flow. As the authors point out, there has been controversy over whether all pericytes express the α-smooth muscle actin that is assumed to regulate their tone. The authors now seem to resolve this by showing that, with appropriate fixation techniques or phalloidin application, actin can be detected in pericytes on capillaries out to the 7th branching order, i.e. almost all capillaries. The paper also suggests that ischemia induces a [Ca] rise in pericytes and that this calcium influx enters pericytes from glial cells via gap junctions. Although [Ca] is expected to rise in pericytes (indeed in all cells) in ischemia, these two parts of the paper are far less convincing.</p><p>Overall, the α-SMA detection part of the paper is a significant result (although, as explained below, it needs better documentation), but the calcium and gap junction parts are not in a state fit for publication. Thus, the paper needs either very significant work and changes to the text, or the latter sections of the text should simply be deleted.</p><p>Major points</p><p>The authors assume that α-SMA is responsible for pericyte contraction, and it is a major result that using fast methanol fixation they can detect it in pericytes on high branching order capillaries. When the same result is obtained by inhibiting actin depolymerization with phalloidin or jasplakinolide the result is less convincing because these agents may be perturbing an equilibrium between the different types of actin, allowing the formation of a significant amount of F-actin that does not usually exist. This should at least be discussed.</p><p>Furthermore, images need to be shown with the primary α-SMA antibody omitted (they are mentioned at the start of the Results section but not shown). Does the antibody cross react with γ-actin, which Grant &amp; Shih (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28933255) have suggested might mediate pericyte contraction?</p><p>It is unclear why many of the phenomena reported in the paper are reported using static images rather than by providing a time course. For example in subsection “Retinal ischemia induces α-SMA-dependent sustained pericyte contraction”, is it not possible to provide a graph showing the time course of the reduction of retinal fluorescence and its lack of full recovery?</p><p>The measurement of ischemia-evoked constrictions of capillaries and their location near pericytes are poorly documented.a) Larger magnification images are needed for the illustrations in Figure 5C and Supplementary Figure 3. In Supplementary <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> are the black regions of the vessel (i) cells in the lumen, or (ii) occlusions?b) Why are there gaps in the claudin labeling?c) When constrictions are said to localize with pericytes, do the authors mean at pericyte somata (none are visible at some of the constricted areas in Supplementary <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), or within a certain distance of somata (how far?) or do the authors just mean anywhere that they can find NG2 labeling (which may be at most capillary locations!)?d) For the graphs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>, where were the diameters measured? Was it at pericyte somata or just at randomly chosen locations? For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E and G</xref>, how exactly is a constricted vessel defined, in order to count it? Exactly what criterion was used to choose where to place the arows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>?e) in paragraph two, subsection “Retinal ischemia induces α-SMA-dependent sustained pericyte contraction”, what length of vessel or area of image is being assessed for the cited numbers of constrictions? Is it the same for non-ischemia and ischemia?f) The statement that constrictions colocalize with helical pericyte processes does not seem to be backed up by an image.g) In subsection “Retinal ischemia induces α-SMA-dependent sustained pericyte contraction”: Give the N numbers for the diameter measurements, say when they were measured precisely, and say whether they were measured at pericyte somata or as an average over capillaries.h) Are the control (pre-ischemia) measurements for phalloidin (4.7 microns diameter) significantly different from the 4.15 microns measured in ischemia? Give exact p values (not just p&lt;0.05) comparing pre-ischemia, ischemia and reperfusion, corrected for multiple comparisons.i) In places constrictions are quantified by their number (a rather subjective judgement – what% reduction in diameter implies a constriction?) and in places by the precise diameter. Please give diameter measurements for the experiments using the siRNA and do a statistical analysis to assess whether they differ from the controls.</p><p>Calcium measurements. These are poorly documented. Neither indicator used is ratiometric (and so may be affected – perhaps diminished in intensity – by ischemia-evoked swelling), and the increase in [Ca] is quantified solely as the number of cells with a value above some threshold level. Either provide a time course for the signal, or explain why one cannot be shown.</p><p>Carbenoxolone effects.a) The claim that CBX decreases pericyte [Ca] in ischemia would be better shown as a time course of [Ca]i versus time for cells with and without CBX.b) Carbenoxolone is reported to be faintly yellow (Sigma datasheet); does it affect the Ca-sensing dyes used?c) The claim that glial [Ca] rises in CBX needs quantifying properly so that it is not just an anecdote.d) CBX is a famously non-specific drug. Its effects on pericytes may result indirectly from its actions on voltage-gated calcium channels in the retina (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15028741) or on NMDA receptors (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18555495). The suggestion that it prevents Ca influx from glia to pericytes would need far more proof to establish it as plausible.</p><p>Gap junction labeling: I am not convinced by this, and the issue might be better studied by injecting dye into glia and measuring whether it spreads to the pericytes. In the insets for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3P and 3T</xref>, the apparent green label, consisting of parallel lines oriented from the pericyte to the nearby glial cell is apparently interpreted as being gap junctions coupling the two cells. I am 99% convinced that this is an artefact. Long drawn out labeling like this is classically seen in confocal images when the fluorescence saturates the photomultiplier (as the green signal appears to do here), causing its output signal to &quot;hang-up&quot; while the scan moves on to other pixels (the fact that all the green &quot;lines&quot; are in the same direction is consistent with this explanation). I would therefore predict that the inset in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3P</xref> has been rotated approximately 25 degrees anti-clockwise from the original scan direction, while that in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3T</xref> is roughly aligned with the original scan direction. It would in any case be implausible for the connexins forming a junction linking glia and pericytes to be ~ 5 microns long as those in the inset to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3P</xref> appear to be. (Alternatively, it is conceivable that the green line axis is the z axis of the original scans, with poorer resolution, and that the image has been rotated for viewing from the side, but in that case I'd expect similar poor resolution for the red and blue images in the same direction, which does not appear to be the case).</p><p>Subsection “Mechanisms of ischemia-induced pericyte contraction and pharmacological rescue”, paragraph 2. If the diameter of arterioles can be measured in adenosine, why not measure the diameter of the capillaries near pericytes?</p><p>The data with DAB support the idea that glial glycogen can delay the effects of ischemia (though not necessarily by affecting Ca movement through gap junctions), but the effect on the time course described in subsection “in vivo visualization of ischemia-induced pericyte constrictions with AOSLO” is anecdotal. If constrictions appear within 30 mins in the presence of DAB, we need a time course provided for their appearance in the absence of DAB (with a measurement at the same 30 min time point), and some kind of statistical analysis, if a rigorous conclusion is to be reached about whether DAB speeds constriction.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. Can the effect of the siRNA expression on SMA expression be quantified as a function of capillary branch order?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2</italic>:</p><p>In their manuscript &quot;Pericytes Express α-SMA and Contract During Ischemia due to Failure of Glial Metabolic Support,&quot; the authors Alarcon-Martinez et al. first utilize a new technique to visualize α-SMA in high order capillaries, adding evidence to one side of the field's ongoing debate regarding blood flow control by pericytes in the capillary bed. There is a large debate in the field of cerebrovascular biology as to whether localized blood flow is controlled only at the arteriole level by constriction of vascular smooth muscle cells, or also at the level of capillaries by contraction of pericytes. One of the major arguments against the latter is a lack smooth muscle actin in pericytes. Here the authors use novel techniques to demonstrate that these cells do express smooth muscle actin that is more labile than the smooth muscle cells. This adds a significant advancement to this debate. They then use a model of ischemia to demonstrate how a functional deficit in these microvessel pericyte contractions might affect reperfusion after injury. Lastly, they identify a mechanism by which this deficit might occur. The work is thorough, and the manuscript provides an interesting addition to a current debate. However, there are a few issues that need to be addressed:</p><p>1) There is no good evidence in the literature that the siRNA technique used in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> works. While a labeled siRNA would be more ideal, the knockdown should at least be quantified. Additionally, the title of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> should be changed as the data presented is not related to effects of ischemia.</p><p>2) In the discussion of the angiograms presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, the authors should discuss whether venule perfusion returned to baseline after recanalization. Presumably, if there is hypoperfusion in capillary beds, the difference should also be seen in the exiting venules.</p><p>3) In the text associated with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, the authors mention a difference between junctional and non-junctional pericytes. This difference should be quantified.</p><p>4) In Figure 9, there should be data for at least some of the treatments showing the effect of treatment in the absence of ischemia as well as the effect of the drugs in the recanalized tissue.</p><p>5) Also in Figure 9, the increase in gap junctions should be quantified as this is an important piece of data.</p><p>6) It should be discussed in the text that phalloidin treatment might also be affecting other cell-types and what consequences that might have in the context of these experiments.</p><p>7) In the supplementary materials, there are videos nicely showing post-ischemia arterioles and pre- and post- ischemia capillaries. However, there is no video showing pre-ischemia arterioles. This is an important control so that the reader can visualize the decrease in capillary blood flow in comparison to any change in arteriole flow.</p><p>8) The convincingness of the data would be greatly increased by videos showing live contraction of pericytes on capillaries rather than relying on measuring changes in pericyte shape. It is plausible that pericyte contractions on low order vessels change blood flow, a change that is perpetuated into small vessels and causes changes in vessel diameter and pericyte shape. This caveat should at least be addressed in the text.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3</italic>:</p><p>This paper addresses several important issues related to the regulation of blood flow in the CNS.
