Unlike yeast and plants, where DSBs are generated near gene promoters, in many vertebrates DSBs are enriched at hotspots determined by the DNA binding activity of the rapidly evolving zinc finger array of PRDM9 (PR domain zinc finger protein 9). PRDM9 subsequently catalyzes tri-methylation of lysine 4 and lysine 36 of Histone H3 in nearby nucleosomes. Here, we identify the dual histone methylation reader ZCWPW1, which is tightly co-expressed during spermatogenesis with <italic>Prdm9</italic>, as an essential meiotic recombination factor required for efficient repair of PRDM9-dependent DSBs and for pairing of homologous chromosomes in male mice. In sum, our results indicate that the evolution of a dual histone methylation writer/reader (PRDM9/ZCWPW1) system in vertebrates remodeled genetic recombination hotspot selection from an ancestral static pattern near genes towards a flexible pattern controlled by the rapidly evolving DNA binding activity of PRDM9.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>ZCWPW1</kwd><kwd>PRDM9</kwd><kwd>END-seq</kwd><kwd>co-evolution</kwd><kwd>dual histone reader</kwd><kwd>meiotic recombination</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1ZIAHD008933</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Macfarlan</surname><given-names>Todd S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM114306</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cheng</surname><given-names>Xiaodong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CPRIT RR160029</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cheng</surname><given-names>Xiaodong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Intramural Research Program</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nussenzweig</surname><given-names>André</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The meiotic recombination landscape in vertebrates was re-engineered via the co-evolution of a dual histone H3K4/H3K36 methylation 'writer' PRDM9 and its 'reader' ZCWPW1 that facilitates efficient double strand break repair.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Meiotic recombination generates genetic diversity in sexually reproducing organisms and facilitates proper synapsis and segregation of homologous chromosomes in gametes. During meiotic prophase I, recombination is initiated by programmed double strand breaks (DSBs) in DNA at thousands of specific 1–2 kb regions called hotspots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kauppi et al., 2004</xref>). DSBs are repaired as either crossovers or non-crossovers. At crossovers, DSBs are repaired using the homologous chromosome as a template, which is critical for homolog pairing, synapsis, and the successful completion of meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baudat et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Zickler and Kleckner, 2015</xref>). In many species, hotspots are distinguished by the presence of active histone marks in chromatin. For example, in yeast, plants, and birds, hotspots are located at regions enriched with histone H3 tri-methylated on lysine 4 (H3K4me3), typically at gene promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Choi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lam and Keeney, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Lichten, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Singhal et al., 2015</xref>). In contrast, in mammals hotspots are determined by the DNA binding zinc finger array of PRDM9 (PR domain zinc finger protein 9) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baudat et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Myers et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Parvanov et al., 2010</xref>). PRDM9 catalyzes tri-methylation of lysine 4 and lysine 36 of Histone 3 (H3K4me3 and H3K36me3 respectively) in nearby nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Eram et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Powers et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Wu et al., 2013</xref>). This methyltransferase activity is essential for localization of DSBs at PRDM9 binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Diagouraga et al., 2018</xref>). <italic>Prdm9</italic> loss-of-function in <italic>Mus musculus</italic> leads to sterility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hayashi et al., 2005</xref>), and <italic>Prdm9</italic> heterozygosity in some hybrid mice causes sterility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Davies et al., 2016</xref>), making <italic>Prdm9</italic> the only known speciation gene so far identified in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Mihola et al., 2009</xref>). Furthermore, single nucleotide polymorphisms in PRDM9 have been linked to non-obstructive azoospermia in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Irie et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Miyamoto et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>During meiotic prophase I, chromosomes re-organize as arrays of DNA loops stemming from an axis composed of protein complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cohen and Holloway, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Xu et al., 2019</xref>). Meiotic recombination occurs simultaneously with homologous chromosome pairing and synapsis, and the relationship between these events is complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gray and Cohen, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Santos, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Zickler and Kleckner, 2015</xref>). Recombination is achieved via homologous repair of programmed DSBs at hotspots. DSBs are initiated by SPO11 protein binding and DNA nicking at recombination hotspot sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bergerat et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Keeney, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Keeney et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lange et al., 2016</xref>), followed by DNA end resection. Single strand DNA binding proteins DMC1 and RAD51 are then recruited to facilitate homologous strand invasion, formation of Holliday junctions, and subsequent resolution as either a crossover or non-crossover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baudat et al., 2013</xref>). Synapsis is achieved simultaneously with meiotic recombination by connecting the two proteinaceous cores of each homolog axis through a central region containing the synaptic protein SYCP1, which self assembles via its N-terminus, facilitating the closure of the synaptonemal complex (SC) like a zipper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fraune et al., 2012</xref>). In mice, a fully assembled SC is required for later steps in recombination and crossovers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">de Vries et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hamer et al., 2008</xref>). Thus, the formation of the SC may facilitate meiotic recombination by physically connecting the two chromosomes. Likewise, SC formation and proper synapsis requires meiotic recombination machinery including Dmc1, Rad51, and Mre11 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Buis et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dai et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Yoshida et al., 1998</xref>).</p><p>Despite PRDM9’s role in specifying hotspots in mice, DSBs are still produced in <italic>Prdm9</italic> knock-out (KO) mice, but they are re-positioned to the ‘default’ position at promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brick et al., 2012</xref>). However, these DSBs are not repaired efficiently, leading to meiotic arrest and partial asynapsis. In F1 hybrid mice, the presence of symmetric PRDM9 binding motifs on both homologs improves recombination rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hinch et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Li et al., 2019b</xref>), suggesting that PRDM9 itself, and perhaps its downstream factors, play important roles beyond merely initiating DSBs.</p><p><italic>Prdm9</italic> first evolved in jawless vertebrates, and it has been either completely or partially lost in several lineages of vertebrates, including several fish lineages, birds, crocodiles, and canids, indicating it is not absolutely required for meiotic recombination, synapsis, and fertility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baker et al., 2017</xref>). Furthermore, <italic>Prdm9</italic> KO mice crossed into other strain backgrounds partially restores fertility in male mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Mihola et al., 2019</xref>). Nonetheless, the evolution of PRDM9 in vertebrates replaced a pre-existing hotspot selection system based on the presence of single H3K4me3 marks at promoters with a new selection system based on the presence of dual H3K4me3/H3K36me3 marks at PRDM9 binding sites. In yeast, the histone reader Spp1 links H3K4me3 sites at promoters with the meiotic recombination machinery, promoting DSB formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adam et al., 2018</xref> ). However, in mice, the Spp1 orthologue CXXC1 which also interacts with PRDM9 is not essential for DSB generation or meiotic recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Tian et al., 2018</xref>). It remains unknown whether species with PRDM9 (like mammals) evolved a specialized histone reader (equivalent for Spp1 in yeast) to recognize the dual histone marks catalyzed by PRDM9. Here, we identify Zinc Finger CW-Type and PWWP Domain Containing 1 (ZCWPW1) as a dual histone methylation reader specific for PRDM9 catalyzed histone marks (H3K4me3 and H3K36me3) that facilitates the repair of PRDM9-induced DSBs. Our study reveals a novel histone methylation writer/reader system that controls patterns of meiotic recombination in mammals.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>ZCWPW1 is a dual histone methylation reader co-expressed with PRDM9 in spermatocytes</title><p>To identify PRDM9 co-factors that may play a role in meiotic recombination, we searched for <italic>Prdm9</italic> co-expressed genes in single cells during meiosis from a published dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2018</xref>). As expected, the top <italic>Prdm9</italic>-correlated genes are known factors in spermatogenesis or DNA metabolism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>), however the most correlated gene in our analysis was <italic>Zcwpw1</italic> (rho = 0.519, p-value=2E-6). Similar to <italic>Prdm9</italic>, <italic>Zcwpw1</italic> mRNA is highly expressed exclusively in the testis in both mouse and human (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>). To detect endogenous expression of ZCWPW1 protein, we generated polyclonal rabbit antibodies against full-length ZCWPW1. We confirmed that ZCWPW1 expression is mostly restricted to the testis in mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). We also ruled out the possibility of cross reactivity of our antibody with ZCWPW2, a paralog for ZCWPW1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Liu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Mouse ZCWPW1 has three recognizable domains from the NCBI conserved domain (CD) database: SCP1, zf-CW and PWWP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The PWWP domain found in multiple proteins binds specifically to histone H3 containing the H3K36me3 mark (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Qin and Min, 2014</xref>), while the zf-CW domain of ZCWPW1 was found to possess H3K4me3-specific binding activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">He et al., 2010</xref>). The SCP1 domain has homology to the synaptonemal complex protein 1 (SYCP1), the major component of the transverse filaments of the synaptonemal complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">de Vries et al., 2005</xref>). The N-terminal region of SYCP1 homologous to the SCP1 domain of ZCWPW1 plays a role in SYCP1 dimerization that facilitates synaptonemal complex assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Seo et al., 2016</xref>). It is notable that the NCBI CD database does not recognize the SCP1-like domain in other ZCWPW1 orthologs, including human (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>ZCWPW1 tissue expression and methyl histone binding activity in vitro.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Heatmap of the top 25 genes co-expressed with PRDM9 during meiosis in single cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2018</xref>).

Therefore, we reasoned that ZCWPW1 may link the PRDM9-induced histone marks to the meiotic recombination machinery by binding to the dually marked histone tails. Using in vitro biotin-streptavidin pulldown assays, we determined that recombinant ZCWPW1 (residues 1–440) binds with higher affinity to H3K4me3 and H3K36me3 than non-methylated biotinylated H3 peptides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Importantly, dual-modified H3K4me3/K36me3 peptides had the highest binding affinity for ZCWPW1 compared to peptides with either single modification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).

In sum these results indicate that ZCWPW1 is a meiosis specific histone methylation reader for the unique dual methyl marks catalyzed by PRDM9, suggesting that ZCWPW1 and PRDM9 have complementary roles in meiosis.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Co-evolution of <italic>Zcwpw1</italic> and <italic>Prdm9</italic> in vertebrates</title><p>PRDM9 has an extraordinary evolutionary pattern as it possesses a rapidly evolving zinc finger array leading to distinct hotspots even among species belonging to the same genus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baker et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Oliver et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Thomas et al., 2009</xref>).

To determine the evolutionary pattern of <italic>Zcwpw1,</italic> we retrieved <italic>Zcwpw1</italic> orthologs from three databases: (1) NCBI HomoloGene, (2) Ensembl and (3) OrthoDB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kriventseva et al., 2019</xref>). We then performed a motif analysis in these orthologs using the ScanProsite tool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">de Castro et al., 2006</xref>) and NCBI CD search, and excluded orthologs lacking a zf-CW or PWWP domain. Using this strategy, we identified 174 vertebrate species with ZCWPW1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>). To find additional <italic>Zcwpw1</italic> orthologs, we extended our search by performing BLAST (blastp and tblastn) searches using the NCBI nr and nt databases respectively against all vertebrate genomes. We used sequences of zf-CW and PWWP domains from mouse ZCWPW1 as a query for our search. BLAST hits were then scanned for presence of both zf-CW and PWWP domains, and only hits with the two domains present were considered for further analysis. In addition to ZCWPW1, our analysis uncovered orthologs for ZCWPW2, a ZCWPW1 paralog which also contains zf-CW and PWWP domains and diverged from ZCWPW1 in the last common ancestor of vertebrates. To differentiate between ZCWPW1 and ZCWPW2 orthologs in our BLAST results, we added known orthologs for both proteins (ZCWPW1 and ZCWPW2) to our candidate sequences from BLAST, and performed a multiple sequence alignment and built a maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree. ZCWPW1 and ZCWPW2 orthologs clustered into two distinct branches, and their branching node was supported by a bootstrap value of 99% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). BLAST hits which clustered with ZCWPW1 are considered as novel orthologs in our analysis. Using this approach, we identified an additional 19 species with ZCWPW1 orthologs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>). Next, we looked for sequence conservation of ZCWPW1 by performing multiple sequence alignment of all identified orthologs.

To determine whether ZCWPW1 binds to these chromatin sites in vivo, we performed Cleavage Under Targets and Release Using Nuclease (CUT&amp;RUN) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Christoph and Siegenthaler, 2016</xref>) using custom polyclonal ZCWPW1 antibodies on mouse spermatocytes. We identified 4,487 ZCWPW1 peaks (p&lt;0.001). Most ZCWPW1 peaks overlap with previously identified hotspots defined by the presence of the single-strand (ss) DNA binding protein DMC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brick et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) or released SPO11-oligos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lange et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>) (89% and 58% respectively). Additionally, ZCWPW1 signal exhibits positive correlation with SPO11-oligo density, DMC1-SSDS and PRDM9 binding signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). PRDM9 binding generates a nucleosome-depleted region with nucleosomes organized symmetrically around PRDM9 binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baker et al., 2014</xref>). When centering our CUT&amp;RUN signals around PRDM9 motifs, we also found a central region which lacks both ZCWPW1 and H3K4me3 signals. This H3K4me3/ZCWPW1 depleted region is surrounded by symmetrically distributed peaks of H3K4me3 and ZCWPW1 indicative of nucleosome positioning around the hotspots’ central nucleosome depleted region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). It is notable that DSB hotspots that fail to overlap with ZCWPW1 peaks still show ZCWPW1 signal that is below the peak detection threshold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3A</xref>). Next, we looked for ZCWPW1 overlap with functional regions in the genome: Transcription Start Sites (TSS), Transcription End Sites (TES) and CpG islands (CGI), and we found only 8%, 9% and 5% of our ZCWPW1 called peaks overlap with these sites respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3B</xref>). Despite ZCWPW1 peaks overlapping with these sites, there was no significant ZCWPW1 enrichment genome-wide in these functional sites compared to IgG control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3C</xref>). The weak ZCWPW1 recruitment around transcriptionally active regions (rich in both H3K4me3 and H3K36me3 marks which rarely overlap) suggests that the mere presence of either of these modifications alone is not associated with recruitment of ZCWPW1 in spermatocytes. To investigate whether the presence of both H3K4me3 and H3K36me3 marks is associated with higher ZCWPW1 recruitment to chromatin in vivo, we used a published ChIP-seq dataset of H3K4me3 and H3K36me3 binding in prophase I spermatocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lam et al., 2019</xref>). While ZCWPW1 binding strength showed positive correlation with H3K4me3 signals, the correlation with H3K36me3 was weaker, probably because the H3K36me3 signal at hotspots is notably weaker than that of the other commonly used DSB metrics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). The vast majority of ZCWPW1 peaks overlapped with regions containing both H3K4me3 and H3K36me3 marks (85%), with significantly less peaks overlapping with regions marked by either mark alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). In agreement with in vitro binding assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), we found that ZCWPW1 CUT&amp;RUN signals are significantly stronger in peaks with H3K4me3/H3K36me3 dual marks compared to regions with a single mark (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Finally, we did not observe any enrichment of ZCWPW1 relative to control in the pseudo-autosomal region (PAR) of sex chromosomes, which undergoes PRDM9-independent recombination in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brick et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>).

De novo motif discovery in the hybrids revealed two motifs identical to PRDM9<sup>Cast</sup> and PRDM9<sup>Dom2</sup> (p=1e-768 and 1e-60 respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata2">Figure 4—source data 2</xref>).

This central peak region largely reflects a recombination intermediate with covalently bound SPO11 resulting from single strand invasion into the unbroken homologous chromosome, whereas the flanking peak regions reflect the extent of end-resection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Paiano et al., 2020</xref>).

However, given that asynapsis is only partial in <italic>Zcwpw1</italic> KO, and the END-seq signal is representative of both a heterogenous cell population and many hotspots, we can’t exclude a potential role of ZCWPW1 in facilitating homolog invasion at some hotspots. In sum these data indicate that unlike PRDM9, ZCWPW1 is not required for the positioning of DSBs, rather it is required exclusively for efficient DSB repair and homologous recombination.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we used a computational approach to identify PRDM9 co-expressed genes and identified a novel factor, ZCWPW1, that is critical for the repair of PRDM9-induced DSBs during meiosis. Like PRDM9, ZCWPW1 is expressed at very low/undetectable levels in most tissues but becomes expressed at high levels prior to and during meiotic prophase I. <italic>Zcwpw1</italic> is necessary for fertility in male mice, as <italic>Zcwpw1</italic> KO mice are azoospermic, similar to <italic>Prdm9</italic> KO. In contrast, <italic>Zcwpw1</italic> KO females are initially fertile, but suffer from ovarian insufficiency as they age, likely due to delayed meiosis in fetal ovaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Li et al., 2019a</xref>). This is also in contrast to <italic>Prdm9</italic> KO females, which are completely infertile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hayashi et al., 2005</xref>). These data highlight the distinct checkpoint sensitivities in males and females for meiotic progression defects. Furthermore, the distinct phenotypes of <italic>Prdm9</italic> and <italic>Zcwpw1</italic> loss-of-function in females suggest that PRDM9 has ZCWPW1 independent function in females that will require additional exploration.</p><p>PRDM9 is a unique SET domain containing histone methyltransferase in several respects. First, it contains its own specific DNA binding domain, a rapidly evolving C2H2 zinc finger array that binds to target sequences with high specificity. Second, it contains a dual specificity histone methyltransferase activity for histone H3 K4 and histone H3 K36 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Eram et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Powers et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Wu et al., 2013</xref>). Likewise, ZCWPW1 is a unique protein that possesses dual histone methylation reader domains; a zf-CW domain that has previously been shown to bind to the H3K4me3 mark (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">He et al., 2010</xref>), and a PWWP domain, which has been shown on multiple proteins including DNMT3a and DNMT3b to bind to the H3K36me3 mark (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Rondelet et al., 2016</xref>). ZCWPW1 can bind to histone H3 peptides with double H3K4me3 and H3K36me3 marks in vitro with high affinity at a 1:1 ratio. Furthermore, PRDM9 predominantly methylates H3K4me3 and H3K36me3 on the +1, +2,–1 and –2 nucleosomes flanking its binding sites, which provides a short platform for ZCWPW1 interaction with chromatin at sites in vivo. Thus, we prefer a model in which ZCWPW1 interacts with both marks on the same H3 peptide, but it cannot be ruled out that ZCWPW1 binds to the two marks on separate H3 molecules on the same or adjacent nucleosomes. Resolving these possibilities will require additional biochemical studies.</p><p>The mapping of ZCWPW1 binding to chromatin genome-wide by CUT&amp;RUN demonstrated that the majority of binding sites overlap with meiotic DSB hotspots. Most of these sites are characterized by the concurrent presence of PRDM9-dependent tri-methylation marks: H3K4me3 and H3K36me3. This implies that ZCWPW1 plays a central role as PRDM9 co-factor. Nevertheless, we could still find weak binding of ZCWPW1 to a few functional sites in the genome including Transcription Start Sites (TSS), Transcription End Site (TES) and CpG islands (CGI). Similarly, Huang and colleagues showed that ZCWPW1 is recruited to some promoter and CGI sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Huang et al., 2019</xref>). However, Huang and colleagues found minimal gene dysregulation in <italic>Zcwpw1</italic>-null mice, including little changes in genes whose promoters were bound by ZCWPW1. Wells et al. also found ZCWPW1 recruitment to CGIs when overexpressed in 293T cells, but the binding at these sites was considerably weaker than to PRDM9-dependent hotspots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Wells et al., 2019</xref>). We conclude from these studies that ZCWPW1 may bind weakly to some promoters and CGIs which is enhanced by overexpression, but at physiological expression levels, ZCWPW1 is primarily recruited to dually marked (H3K4me3/H3K36me3) sites in a PRDM9-dependent manner. Based on these findings and the rapid evolution of PRDM9 DNA binding zinc finer array, we think it is unlikely that ZCWPW1 plays an important role as transcriptional regulator during meiosis.</p><p>Against our expectations, ZCWPW1 is dispensable for initiating DSBs at PRDM9-bound hotspots, as DSBs in <italic>Zcwpw1</italic> KO male mice are still located at PRDM9 bound sites. Our data instead suggests that ZCWPW1 is critical for the efficient repair of these PRDM9-dependent breaks. This conclusion is supported by the partial asynaptic pachytene-like meiotic arrest observed in <italic>Zcwpw1</italic> KO, which coincides with accumulation of γ-H2AX and DMC1, both characterizing failed DSB repair. The findings that PRDM9 histone methyltransferase activity is essential for DSB formation at PRDM9 binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Diagouraga et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Powers et al., 2016</xref>) would therefore seem to suggest that a yet to be described PRDM9 histone methyl reader may link PRDM9 to the DSB machinery upstream of ZCWPW1. ZCWPW2, a paralog of ZCWPW1 that diverged early in evolution, is a possible candidate.</p><p>In <italic>Zcwpw1</italic> KO spermatocytes, the END-seq profile at hotspots demonstrates the presence of a central peak comparable to WT mice. Such central peaks are lost in <italic>Dmc1</italic> KO mice which fail to undergo strand invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Paiano et al., 2020</xref>). This result might suggest that strand invasion is intact in <italic>Zcwpw1</italic> KO. However, because the asynapsis in arrested spermatocytes in <italic>Zcwpw1</italic> KO is only partial, it is difficult to infer the source of the central peak of END-seq in a heterogenous population of synapsed/asynapsed homologous chromosomes. Therefore, we conclude that ZCWPW1 is a critical factor for DSB repair, and it might act either upstream or downstream of strand invasion step in DSB repair. We propose a model in which ZCWPW1 functions as a PRDM9 specific synapsis factor that is necessary to bind both the cut and uncut homologs to link PRDM9-bound DNA loops to the SC, to facilitate later steps in meiotic recombination. This model is supported by a recent study which suggested that symmetrical PRDM9 binding is critical for meiotic recombination. But how exactly does ZCWPW1 facilitates such synapsis and repair? A hint may lie within the moderately conserved SCP1 domain found at the N-terminus of mouse ZCWPW1 which shares homology to a region of the central axis protein SYCP1 that makes a coiled-coil and facilitates dimerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Seo et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, PRDM9 bound loops could be directly tethered to the SC via ZCWPW1. Further studies are needed to explore potential interactions of ZCWPW1 with chromosomal axis and SC components.</p><p>In this study we have developed and applied two novel, independent and sensitive methods for mapping meiotic hotspots; END-seq, and ZCWPW1 CUT&amp;RUN. These methods have distinct advantages over previous methods, that include SPO11 oligo sequencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lange et al., 2016</xref>) and SSDS coupled with DMC1 ChIP-seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Khil et al., 2012</xref>). END-seq is a method of directly sequencing DSBs, and we have applied it to a single mouse testis to map thousands of hotspots. This method could therefore be applied to virtually any organism for mapping hotspots as it does not require the use of antibodies. ZCWPW1 CUT&amp;RUN also maps mouse hotspots, by mapping the occupancy of the factor ZCWPW1 that is directly downstream of PRDM9-induced histone methylation marks using a polyclonal antibody. Importantly, ZCWPW1 occupancy correlates positively with the strength of hotspots in mice. We applied ZCWPW1 CUT&amp;RUN to 300,000 bulk testicular cells from adult mice (a tiny fraction of the material obtained from a single adult testis) to sensitively map thousands of mouse hotspots. Thus END-seq provides a greater breadth of possible uses including non-model organisms, whereas ZCWPW1 CUT&amp;RUN provides greater flexibility with lower cell numbers in mice. However, both methods currently fall short in detecting the weakest DSB hotspots which could be mapped by SPO11 oligo sequencing and DMC1 SSDS. With optimizations to both techniques, they could be potentially pushed for improved sensitivity for weaker hotspots with low starting cell numbers. This would allow hotspot mapping for currently challenging situations like mouse females or in species with low meiotic cell numbers.</p><p>In yeast, plants and at least some vertebrates (those that lost PRDM9 like canids and birds); meiotic hotspots are located in the nucleosome free regions at gene promoters. However, within species that evolved PRDM9, hotspots are specified by the DNA binding activity of the PRDM9 zinc finger array. Therefore, the emergence of PRDM9 was a landmark that re-shaped patterns of meiotic recombination during evolution. The PRDM9-derived pattern of hotspot selection provided more flexibility in hotspot evolution compared to the ancestral, fixed pattern of hotspots found at promoters and within genes by decoupling hotspot selection away from functional genetic elements.</p><p>In this work, we identified ZCWPW1 as an essential factor in the PRDM9 hotspot selection system. This system evolved by co-emergence of (i) a histone writer (PRDM9) which catalyzes formation of H3K4me3 and H3K36me3 dual marks and (ii) a histone methylation reader (ZCWPW1) which recognizes these dual marks to facilitate DSB repair at the PRDM9 bound sites. The presence of these two factors is crucial for hotspot selection and successful meiotic recombination in mice.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Experimental model and subject details</title><sec id="s4-1-1"><title>Mouse models</title><p><italic>Zcwpw1</italic> knockout mouse line (<italic>C57BL/6N-Zcwpw1<sup>em1(IMPC)Tcp</sup></italic>) was made as part of the KOMP2-Phase2 project at The Centre for Phenogenomics and was purchased from the Canadian Mouse Mutant Repository.

To prepare single cell suspension, testes were dissected and chopped after tunica removal, then incubated for 30 min at 37<sup>o</sup> C in 3 ml dissociation buffer (DMEM + 2 U/ml Dispase (Worthington) + 250 U/ml Collagenase Type 1 (Worthington) + 50 µg/ml DNase I (Sigma)). Dissociation enzymes were inactivated by adding DMEM containing 10% FBS. 300,000 cells were used for each CUT&amp;RUN reaction. Initially, cells were washed twice with CUT&amp;RUN wash buffer (20 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM Spermidine, 1X cOmplete EDTA-free Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Sigma)).

After incubation, cells were washed twice via magnet stand using digitonin buffer (wash buffer + 0.025% digitonin) and resuspended in 50 µl digitonin buffer subsequently. 2.5 µl of Protein A–micrococcal nuclease (pA-MN) fusion protein was then added to the cells (final concentration of ~700 ng/ml) and mixed with rotation at 4°C for 1 hr. Unbound pA-MN was removed by washing twice using digitonin buffer. Then cells were resuspended in 150 µl digitonin buffer, and incubated on ice for 5 min to bring samples’ temperature to 0°C. Thereafter, 3 µl CaCl<sub>2</sub> (100 mM stock solution) was added to activate pA-MN micrococcal nuclease activity, and samples were incubated in ice (0°C) for 30 min.

Finally, samples were centrifuged at 16,000 g for 5 min at 4°C and were then placed on magnetic stands to collect supernatant (~250 µl) containing released DNA fragments. To extract DNA, 2.5 µl of 10% SDS and 1.875 µl Proteinase K (20 mg/ml) were added to the released DNA, with incubation and shaking at 65°C for 35 min. To precipitate DNA, 25 µl 3M Sodium Acetate, 2 µl glycoblue (15 mg/ml) (Thermo Fisher) and 687 µl cold 100% ethanol were added, and samples incubated at −20°C overnight, and then centrifuged in 4°C at maximum speed for 20 min. Supernatant was then removed, and DNA pellet rinsed with 70% ethanol, followed by another centrifugation. Ethanol was removed and the pellet resuspended in 10–50 µl TE buffer. DNA concentration was measured by Qubit (Thermo Fisher). For each sample, library prep was done with 3 ng of DNA using SMARTer ThruPLEX DNA-Seq Kit (Takara) according to manufacturer’s protocol.

We did search in both NCBI protein (nr) and nucleotide (nt) databases via BLAST blastp and tblastn tools respectively, with maximum target sequences of 10,000. For blastp search, we used zf-CW and PWWP domain region from mouse ZCWPW1 (190–234 aa) as query. We then used ScanProsite and CD search to exclude any hit lacking zf-CW or PWWP domain. For tblastn search, we used two queries of zf-CW domain (241–295 aa) and PWWP domain (308–374 aa) in NCBI nt database. We then looked for tblastn hits (accessions) which (a) align to both query sequences (i.e. zf-CW and PWWP), (b) aligned regions show conserved domain sequence of both zf-CW and PWWP, (c) the distance between the hit’s region aligned to zf-CW and the hit’s region aligned to PWWP does not exceed 50 kb (in case of alignment to genomic regions).

The authors demonstrate in vitro binding of ZCWPW1 to methylated histones. Evidence for co-evolution of ZCWPW1 and PRDM9 is presented. Patterns of ZCWPW1 chromatin binding are assessed (corresponding to PRDM9 binding sites). Phenotypes of ZCWPW1 KO are presented both in terms of immunofluorescence staining of certain factors, and in the assessment of DSB patterns using END-seq, which is used here for the first time to detect DSBs in meiocytes.</p><p>This study provides novel and interesting information about meiotic DSB control in mice.

(Discussion paragraph three).</p><p>We don’t find a discrepancy between Huang et al. results and ours. The percentage of TSS/Promoters bound by ZCWPW1 could vary based on how TSS/Promoter are defined (i.e. database, region length) and parameters of peak calling for ZCWPW1 (see our responses for comments 3 and 36). ZCWPW1 peaks overlapping TSS/promoters are weaker compared to peaks overlapping hotspots (response for comment 3). Furthermore, Huang et al. performed RNA-seq in <italic>Zcwpw1</italic> KO spermatocytes, and found most of the differentially expressed genes were not the genes whose promoters overlapped with ZCWPW1 binding sites. Therefore, we think it is unlikely that ZCWPW1 plays a critical role as transcriptional regulator during meiosis, though that can't be completely ruled out.</p><p>Regarding the Wells et al. results, we also observe ubiquitous ZCWPW1 binding to CpG islands (CGI) when over-expressing ZCWPW1 in 293T cells using CUT&amp;RUN (data not shown). But in vivo we find only 5% of ZCWPW1 peaks overlapping with CGIs in spermatocytes (Figure 3—figure supplement 3B), yet there was no significant ZCWPW1 enrichment genome wide at CGIs. In addition, Wells et al. suggest that ZCWPW1 binds chromatin independently of PRDM9, based on over-expression in 293T cells. We believe this is not the case for endogenously expressed ZCWPW1 in spermatocytes. Huang et al. found that endogenously expressed ZCWPW1 mutant (which lacks zf-CW H3K4me3 reader activity) lacks DNA binding affinity. Based on these results in sum, we conclude that ZCWPW1 chromatin binding in spermatocytes is entirely mediated via its histone H3 reading domains, and mainly in a PRDM9-dependent manner.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) To show the specificity of the antibody for ZCWPW1 vs ZCWPW2.</p></disp-quote><p>We generated purified recombinant ZCWPW1 and ZCWPW2 in bacteria, and performed western blotting using ZCWPW1 antibody. We found no cross reactivity of our ZCWPW1 antibody with ZCWPW2 protein. These results are now shown in the revised manuscript in Figure 1—figure supplement 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Test affinity with peptides of identical lengths (i.e. H3 (1-44)).</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the suggestion. In the biotin-streptavidin pulldown assays (Figure 1D), we already used peptides of identical lengths for no-modification, single-modification at either H3K4 or H3K36 and dual-modification at both K4 and K36. We concluded the binding affinities in the order of double &gt; single &gt; no modification. These peptides had to be specially synthesized because they were not commercially available. In the quantitative ITC experiments (Figure 1E), which require much larger amounts of highly purified protein and peptides (that again had to be specially synthesized and purified at large costs), we compared binding of double modification to that of no modification in the context of peptides of identical length H3(1-44). We found no binding to peptide without modification. We thus used shorter peptides (mainly for cost saving, as these were commercially available at the large quantities required for ITC) including methylated K4 or K36 for measuring the binding affinities of single modification. It is exceedingly unlikely that the unmodified portion of peptide would affect the binding.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Analysis of ZCWPW1 binding: explain data, normalization, analyze throughout the genome including TSS, enhancers, CpG islands, along genes; analyze quantitatively and correlate with other landmarks (H3K4me3, H3K36me3, Spo11, DMC1, PRDM9…), analyse in the PAR (Prdm9 independent DSB sites). Discuss potential impact on transcription activity.</p></disp-quote><p>We made the code and pipeline used for data analysis of ZCWPW1 CUT&amp;RUN publicly available at DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.3740571.</p><p>Details of peak calling are given in methods (below). Using these thresholds, ~ 90% of autosomal ZCWPW1 peaks in both B6 and B6xCAST, are at DSB hotspots. Furthermore, both in B6 and B6xCAST, the ZCWPW1 CUT&amp;RUN signal is very weak at the remaining 10%, perhaps indicating that a substantial fraction of these are false-positive peak calls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>). ~5 to 9% of ZCWPW1 peaks coincide with “functional” sites (TSS, TES or CGIs); it is possible that ZCWPW1 has weak affinity for these sites, however there is no enrichment relative to the GFP control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref> and manuscript newly added Figure 3—figure supplement 3C). Thus, we think that it is unnecessarily speculative to discuss the potential impact on transcription given these results alone. We now include heatmaps of the raw ZCWPW1 signal compared to H3K4me3 and the GFP control at TSS, TES and CGIs for B6 (Figure 3—figure supplement 3A) and for B6/CAST B6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig3">Author response image 3</xref>)</p><fig id="sa2fig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>ZCWPW1 peaks overlapping hotspots are stronger than non-hotspots.</title><p>Left panel: B6, Right panel B6xCAST.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-53360-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><fig id="sa2fig2"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>ZCWPW1 CUT&amp;RUN shows very little enrichment at functional sites in the genome.</title><p>Sequencing reads (q &gt; 30) at each set of genomic intervals were counted for our four CUT&amp;RUN experiments as well as for H3K4me3 ChIP-Seq data in 12dpp testis.

ZCWPW1 strength exhibits a positive correlation with H3K4me3, PRDM9 ChIP-seq intensity (Grey et al., 2017), Spo11-oligo density and DMC1-SSDS signal. While ZCWPW1 CUT&amp;RUN signal correlates best with H3K4me3 derived from ChIP-seq in 12dpp mice (Baker et al., 2014), noise in all of these strength estimates precludes us from inferring which of these readouts is truly the closest correlate of ZCWPW1 activity.</p><fig id="sa2fig4"><label>Author response image 4.</label><caption><title>ZCWPW1 CUT&amp;RUN signal correlates with other metrics of recombination at DSB hotspots.</title><p>Data are shown for ZCWPW1 CUT&amp;RUN in B6 mice. For all panels, only autosomal hotspots that coincide with a ZCWPW1 peak were used. Strength for SSDS and H3K4me3 12dpp are taken from Brick et al., Nature 2018. CUT&amp;RUN strength for H3K4me3 and ZCWPW1 is calculated as the sum of in-peak sequencing reads at each hotspot. The strength of H3K36me3 is calculated as the sum of all reads at the SSDS-defined hotspot. ZCWPW1 signal correlates best with H3K4m3 ChIP-Seq data from 12dpp mice. Notably however, it correlates less well with H3K4me3 from isolated Zygotene spermatocytes. This variation is likely a reflection of variation in ChIP / experimental enrichment and highlights the difficulty of attributing any of these measures as being “best” correlated with ZCWPW1 binding. ZCWPW1 appears to correlate equally well with Spo11-oligo and DMC1-SSDS measures of DSB frequency. Interestingly however, the correlation with DMC1-SSDS is notably improved in mice that lack the ability to repair DSBs (Hop2ko). The correlation with H3K36me3 is relatively lower, however the H3K36me3 signal at hotspots is notably weaker than that of the other metrics. Thus, the low correlation may be strongly influenced by background noise.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-53360-resp-fig4-v2.tif"/></fig><fig id="sa2fig5"><label>Author response image 5.</label><caption><title>This figure is simply to provide a comparison point to Author response image 3.</title><p>Spo11-oligo signal correlates with other metrics of recombination.
