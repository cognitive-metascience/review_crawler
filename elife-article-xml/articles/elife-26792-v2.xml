Their movement is propelled by cell division and elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Beemster and Baskin, 1998</xref>). The plant root tip comprises a stem cell niche giving rise to all cell types that build up the root. Root tips of <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> became an ideal model organ to study various aspects of developmental processes such as the control of the cell cycle, cell division orientation patterning, cell differentiation, cell elongation, cell polarity, gravitropism, hydrotropism, and hormone signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dolan et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Malamy and Benfey, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Friml et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Moriwaki et al., 2014</xref>). The temporal scale of these processes ranges from minutes (e.g. response to gravity) to hours (e.g. cell divisions) and days for cell differentiation (e.g. columella cell maturation). The rise of fluorescent live cell imaging and confocal laser scanning microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Stephens and Allan, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Oparka, 1994</xref>) enables the visualization of the dynamics of these processes with high spatio-temporal resolution. In practice, however, there is a trade-off between the resolution and the size of the field of view. This leads to the problem that a root growing in optimal condition will rush through the field of view in far less time than necessary to capture the process of interest. While the roots of 4–5 days-old plants grow up to 300 micrometers per hour (see below and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Beemster et al., 2002</xref>), cytokinesis and cell plate formation require approximately 30 min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Berson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fendrych et al., 2010</xref>), the complete cell cycle of transit-amplifying epidermal cells has been estimated to take between 10 and 35 h (Figure 6C and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Yin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bizet et al., 2015</xref>), whereas a maize cell located in the quiescent centre requires approximately 200 h to complete a cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Clowes, 1961</xref>). While the position of the root tip during short periods—timescales of minutes—can be corrected by registration of the images post-acquisition, longer events require repositioning of the microscope stage to keep the root tip in focus and within the field of view. Manual repositioning is an option, but it is not very convenient. Several automatic solutions for root tip tracking have been published (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Campilho et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Sena et al., 2011</xref>); however, the authors did not provide a comprehensive documentation of the setups that were used.</p><p>Another very important aspect of plant live imaging is the control of environmental signals perceived by the plant, such as light, temperature, availability of nutrients, and gravity. The latter is constant and plant organs are influenced by the vector of gravity. During gravistimulation, the plant hormone auxin gets depleted from the upper side of the organ and accumulates in the lower side of the root, triggering the inhibition of growth. The root bends because the upper part of the root continues to grow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Rakusová et al., 2015</xref>). When gravitropic responses are the focus of the research, the position of the plant during live imaging becomes crucial. Most microscope setups keep the sample in a horizontal position, leading to a constant gravistimulation of plant organs. This feature was utilized to analyze calcium signaling after gravistimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Monshausen et al., 2011</xref>) by imaging the lower and upper sides of roots using either an upright or an inverted microscope setup in order to observe differences between these areas.</p><p>Nevertheless, horizontal sample positioning imposes serious limitations on any long-term imaging as the root continually attempts to bend downwards. In particular, as the orientation of the root with respect to the vector of gravity is fixed, it limits the way gravitropism can be studied.</p><p>Likewise, light, another crucial environmental cue for plant development, is usually not optimized for plant growth in conventional microscopes. Plant organs perceive light and show phototropic behavior. In fluorescence microscopy, light is used to excite fluorophores. This was harnessed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lindeboom et al. (2013)</xref>, who used the excitation light as the stimulus to reorient the cortical microtubule array. Illumination of the leaves is crucial to keep the plant in a photosynthetically active state, in particular when performing long-term experiments. Optimal growing conditions are provided by a microscope setup that combines an illumination system with a vertical sample mounting, as has been established for light-sheet microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">von Wangenheim et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Maizel et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Sena et al., 2011</xref>). In confocal microscopy, vertical sample mounting was achieved with the introduction of a periscope tube in the optical path (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Monshausen et al., 2009</xref>), however, this is at the expense of control of the motorized stage.</p><p>Here, we describe in detail a confocal microscope setup with vertical sample mounting and integrated illumination that we developed for the optimal imaging of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). We additionally developed a rotation stage that enables rapid gravistimulation while imaging with minimal disturbance of the plants. Further, we present TipTracker – a MATLAB-based program that enables the user to follow growing root tips or other moving samples and record time-lapse series over prolonged periods of time. TipTracker also outputs the coordinates of the individual root tips over time that can be used to reconstruct the trajectory of individual root tips and calculate their growth rates during the experiment. We demonstrate the performance of the system by several case studies focusing on root growth, cell division, cell lineage establishment and gravitropism. Additionally, we demonstrate that TipTracker can be used for any other type of specimen, for instance, Zebrafish embryos. TipTracker can interact with the graphical user interfaces of various commercial microscope software programs. We provide the source code for the implementation of TipTracker and associated scripts for two different microscope platforms (Zeiss LSM700, LavisionBiotech TriM Scope II), making it a versatile tool that can be easily modified and adapted.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26792.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Overview of the vertical microscope setup.</title><p>The vertically mounted confocal microscope enables long-term imaging of plant roots growing along the gravity vector under controlled illumination.

A stand supports the transmitted light illumination carrier of the microscope (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,D</xref>, and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>). Since the transmitted light illumination carrier could no longer be flipped back, two problems arose: (1) sample insertion became difficult and (2) the automatic laser shut-off was no longer working, thus laser safety was not guaranteed during sample exchange. To resolve this, we remounted the laser safety plate with magnets and connected the automatic laser shut-off mechanism to it (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,C</xref>). Now, before inserting the sample, the user must remove the laser safety plate entirely in order to have free access, which turns the lasers off automatically. Furthermore, the standard fluorescent light coupling port could no longer be used and needed to be replaced with a 90° adapter. A detailed description of the required modifications is part of the supplementary documentation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). The scan head was raised, but retained its orientation. In this way, the functionality of the entire system is unaffected. A microscope that is suitable for turning 90° should have several features: The scan head needs to be connected to the side port of the microscope body. The flange that connects the scanhead to the body has to be rotationally symmetric. The distance between the scanhead and the microscopy body has to be large enough not to interfere with the stage or other components of the body. Microscopes that employ piezo focusing (stage or objective) could be problematic as piezos are sensitive to lateral forces. The microscope body needs to incorporate a z-drive that actively moves the objective down and does not rely on gravity for the downward motion. As far as we can tell, this is the case for all modern microscopes of all the major manufactures. If the z-drive features a position encoder and closed loop operation, then this is given.<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26792.003</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>The vertically-mounted microscope setup.</title><p>The microscope body (Zeiss Axio Observer) was rotated by 90° and mounted to an optical table using a strong angle bracket.

At the same time, directional illumination is a spatial clue that triggers plant tropisms. Therefore, to satisfy the seedlings’ need for light and to enable directional photostimulation, we implemented a custom illumination system. The spectral quality and intensity matches the one in our growth room – LED illumination with blue maxima at 453 nm and red at 625 nm with intensity optimized for <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E,F</xref>). Red and blue LEDs are arranged in a square facing the specimen that is mounted on the safety laser interlock plate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–D</xref>). Each side of the lamp can be switched on individually for directional illumination, and the intensity of illumination can be set to any value between 40 and 180 µmol m<sup>−2</sup>s<sup>−1</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Initially we intended to shutter the light during image acquisition, but it turned out that when choosing proper filter settings, we do not detect any light coming from the LEDs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G,H</xref>). This allows for keeping the illumination on during image acquisition.<fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26792.005</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Integrated sample illumination setup.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Photograph of the LED illumination system attached to the microscope.

The system keeps the entire functionality of the CLSM microscope, including the motorized stage. This is essential for the acquisition of multiple positions during time-lapse experiments and also for the tracking of the root tips, as described below. One limitation of the system is that the usage of immersion objectives becomes complicated as the immersion solution flows down. We overcame this by using a viscous hair gel with a refractive index similar to water. The microscope is, however, mainly intended for the acquisition of multiple position and long time-lapse experiments, thus the use of any immersion liquid is problematic in a standard microscope setup as well. Therefore, for this type of experiments, we primarily employ a 20x/0.8NA or a 40x/0.95NA dry objective.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Rapid gravistimulation experiments using the rotation stage</title><p>For gravistimulation experiments, it is important that the sample is securely fixed. Also for the long-term time-lapse experiments, the seedlings need to be well adapted to the experimental conditions. We grow the seedlings in a Nunc Lab-Tek chambered coverglass. While the roots grow between the glass and a block of agar, the cotyledons remain free to the air (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref>). A detailed sample preparation protocol is provided in the Materials and methods section. Ideally, the sample preparation is performed a few hours before imaging to give the plants time to acclimate and recover from the stress of transfer. Plants can be cultured in the chambers for a period of several days. To test whether the roots grow well in such a setup, we compared the growth between the block of agar and the coverslip with the growth of roots in the same chamber on the surface of the agar block. Roots between agar and glass grew 88% of the ones growing on the surface (87.94% + −10.5% STDEV, control 100% + −10.9% STDEV, n = 21 and 20, respectively), which can be attributed to the mechanical impedance of the setup.<fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26792.006</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Gravistimulation of samples using the sample rotation stage.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Roots grow in chambered coverslips between the coverglass and a block of agar.

It involves the asymmetric distribution of the phytohormone auxin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Went and Thimann, 1937</xref>) and has been used to study the plant’s perception of gravity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baldwin et al., 2013</xref>), cellular polarity of the PIN auxin transporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adamowski and Friml, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Friml et al., 2002</xref>), targeted protein degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baster et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abas et al., 2006</xref>), and other signaling processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Shih et al., 2015</xref>). The horizontal arrangement of objective lenses allows for mounting the sample in a vertical position; the roots can then grow down along the gravity vector. Since the gravity vector cannot be modified easily, we developed a microscope sample holder that can be rotated by any degree around the axis of the light path (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). In this way, the roots can be observed before and shortly after the gravistimulation, and due to the axis of rotation, the ‘upper’ and ‘lower’ root sides are equally accessible to imaging. The rotation stage is an aluminium frame with a rotating inset that holds the sample chamber. The inset and the frame are connected by a number of rings made of Teflon to provide smooth and precise sliding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E,F</xref>). <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref> contains a 3D CAD file of the rotation stage designed for a motorized stage (Märzhäuser Scan IM). In order to minimize the time the user spends finding the roots after rotation of the inset, we developed a MATLAB-based script that calculates the new positions of the root tips (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>). The experimental procedure was as follows: First, the motor coordinates of the mechanical centre of rotation had to be determined. To this end, the inset holding the sample chamber was replaced with a disk into which a small hole (diameter 200 µm) had been drilled, which coincides with the centre of rotation. The hole was centred in the field of view and the motor position was saved in a file. Then, the disk was replaced with the sample holder and the positions of the root tips were saved. After imaging the first part of gravistimulation experiment (roots in vertical position), the rotation was applied. The MATLAB script (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>) was executed, and output the new position of root tips. The mechanical precision was good enough that the calculated positions deviate only slightly from the actual ones and imaging could be continued within approximately 3 min after the rotation, which is the time needed to reposition and restart the time series.</p><p>Thus, our rotating stage enables the user to select any sequence of gravistimulations desired, and subsequently a very rapid image acquisition, providing the setup necessary for high-resolution studies of gravitropism.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>TipTracker automatically recognizes and follows root tips during growth</title><p>A root tip of a 4–5 day-old <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> seedling grows approximately 50–300 µm per hour (see below). This means that it moves through the field of view of a 20x objective within 1–2 h. To be able to observe the root tips for a longer period of time, we developed the root tip-tracking program TipTracker. Importantly, TipTracker makes it possible to observe multiple samples independently over long periods of time regardless of the individual behaviour. Besides imaging, TipTracker outputs a file with the coordinates of the individual positions that can be used to measure the growth rate of the individual roots as well as to retrace the path of growth.</p><p>The acquisition of multiple channels, z-stack and positions is set up in the microscope’s software, while the time series is managed by TipTracker, which also handles image file loading, motion tracking evaluation, the generation of the new position list, and displaying the root growth history. Once the images of a time point are saved a maximum intensity projection is generated for each specimen. A region of interest is cropped, filtered (mean and median) and compared to the corresponding image of the previous time point. The maximum of the direct cross-correlation of both time points yields a lateral shift ∆ that is used to update the lateral sample displacement δ. This method makes no assumptions about the shape or brightness of the samples or the type of movement and is thereby not limited to roots; it is, in fact, entirely independent of the specimen and can be used for all samples that move autonomously or through external forces. The growth of a root between two time points is then predicted by δ (t)= δ (t-1)+ ∆. Finally, a new list <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>P</mml:mtext><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>x</mml:mtext><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mtext>y</mml:mtext></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>Tn</mml:mtext><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mtext>P</mml:mtext><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>x</mml:mtext><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mtext>y</mml:mtext></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>Tn</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>δ</mml:mi><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> of the predicted positions of the roots is generated and loaded into the microscope control software and the next acquisition is started (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). This process is repeated for each step in the time series. The growth kinetics of each root can then be derived from the history of the recorded positions. More elaborate position prediction methods such as autoregressive motion or Kalman filter-based approaches could easily be implemented, but proved unnecessary in the case of root growth, since the change in growth speed and direction is slow compared to the interval between two time steps. Likewise, tracking in 3D, which can be accomplished in a straightforward manner by cross correlating different slices from the stacks or by maximum intensity projections in the x- and y- directions, were also found to be redundant, as the roots are confined between the coverslip and the agar block.<fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26792.007</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Working cycle of the TipTracker program.</title><p>A region of interest is selected from a maximum intensity projection of a z-stack. Mean and median filters are applied. A direct cross-correlation is performed between the current and the prior time point on the differently filtered and non-filtered images. Note that this procedure is purely based on the similarity of the images within the region of interest and makes no assumption about the sample. The median of the three results is used as the shift to make the calculation more robust. The calculated shift is added to the current position and is used as a prediction of the position of the root in the subsequent time point. The new position list is saved and then loaded at the start of the next acquisition time step.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.26792.007">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.26792.007</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="postscript" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-26792-fig5-v2"/></fig></p><p>TipTracker interacts with the microscope control software (e.g. ZEN) by generating mouse and keyboard inputs by means of AutoIt scripts, which is a freeware scripting language designed for automating the Windows GUI. This solution has crucial advantages: First, it can be used with any type of microscope system since it does not rely on vendor-supplied programming interfaces. Furthermore, both experts and non-experts can easily adapt the system from one setup to another (e.g. ZEN Black -&gt; ZEN Blue). We used TipTracker mainly in conjunction with the Zeiss ZEN2010 software controlling the LSM700 inverted microscope, but we have also successfully implemented TipTracker on an upright two-photon microscope (LaVision Biotech TriM II) to track the movement of cells within the enveloping layer during zebrafish epiboly. This also demonstrates that the tracking algorithm is not limited to roots and can be used for all moving samples. In order to exemplify the modifications necessary to adapt TipTracker to a new platform, we also included this version in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>. For each new system, the AutoIt scripts must be modified to correctly interact with the crucial control buttons of the software GUI, and we provide an illustration of this process within the commented AutoIt scripts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>). We also provide a compiled version of TipTracker for usage with Zeiss ZEN2010 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>). When the ZEN-based setup is used, separate images for each time point are saved in the lsm file format, each containing multi-position, multi-color z-stacks. We provide a script for the open-source software Fiji (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>) that converts these multi-position files into multiple hyperstacks, each containing a single position (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>).</p><p>The program is designed to follow actively growing root tips in a highly efficient manner, as we demonstrate below. In case the tracking algorithm loses a sample, this can result in excessive stage movements. In order to protect the objectives, we implemented a limit on the maximum degree of stage movement. When one of the positions exceeds this user-defined limit, the tracking of that particular position is stopped, while the other positions are further tracked.</p><p>Limitations are that the computer should not be interfered with during imaging, as this could confuse the communication between TipTracker and the imaging software. In addition, online tracking with TipTracker creates a time overhead compared to a time series that is acquired directly with the microscope control software, since at each time point the acquisition is stopped, the data stored and then read again.</p><p>In summary, our root tip-tracking program TipTracker allows for online long-term tracking of root tips or other moving samples and can be easily implemented on a wide range of microscopes.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Biological examples</title><sec id="s2-4-1"><title>Long-term imaging and tracking of root tips</title><p>To test the ability of the TipTracker software, we imaged roots expressing the plasma membrane marker UBQ10::YFP-PIP1;4 over a period of 38 h with an imaging interval of 20 min.

For this purpose, we used the Plan-Apochromat 40x/0.95 air objective lens, as the immersion liquid is not suitable for objectives in a horizontal position and multi-position acquisition. Still, with the air objective, we were able to follow the entire life cycle of the KNOLLE syntaxin that first localizes to the growing cell plate and after completion of cytokinesis relocalizes to pre-vacuolar compartments and is finally degraded in the vacuole, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Reichardt et al., 2007</xref>). In our setup, we could follow this cycle in a given cell and measured that it lasted for more than 4 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, lower panel). We successfully imaged growing roots for more than 12 h and captured a stack of 10 z-sections every 3 min using a 40x air objective. We further quantified the average duration of GFP-KNOLLE visibility in 83 cytokinesis events from a 24 h recording of six roots (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media5">Video 5</xref>, recording interval 15 min) and measured an average time period of 3 h 49 min ± 18 min. In five out of six roots we captured stem cell initials divisions. Remarkably, these cell divisions occurred within a time window of about 10 h, while before or after we did not observe any dividing initial stem cells. This suggests that stem cells synchronize their mitosis. It was reported that there is a modest correlation in timing of cell division between individual initials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Campilho et al., 2006</xref>).

In addition to root tips, it is also possible to track other moving samples on non-vertical microscope setups, as we demonstrate with the example of the prechordal plate movement in the zebrafish embryo. It is important to note that when setting up an experiment, the users should consider the magnitude of the velocity of their sample relative to the field of view of the objective being used, as well as to the temporal resolution of the acquisition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). For example, when using a 20x objective lens, we recommend specifying time intervals not larger than 30 min, otherwise the root will escape the tracking field of view before the next time point is captured.<fig id="fig10" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26792.018</object-id><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>Root tip growth rate and tracking window.</title><p>For successful tracking, it is recommended to use a spatio-temporal resolution in relation to the expected growth rate of the root.

This enables long-term (up to several days) live imaging with confocal resolution of seedlings growing in the natural, vertical position. We also built a rotation stage that makes it possible to freely adjust the plant’s orientation with respect to gravity, while preserving the ability to observe it. Together with integrated illumination, our setup provides growing seedlings with the optimal and controlled conditions necessary for long-term imaging experiments. We provide blueprints for building the setup and a description of optimized sample preparation, which is a critical step for the sensitive <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> seedlings. Together, the sample preparation, illumination and the vertical position result in healthy seedlings, even in the artificial conditions of a confocal microscope.</p><p>Furthermore, we developed the TipTracker program to automatically follow root tips for long periods of time. Importantly, it can track multiple objects simultaneously while fully preserving the functionality of the confocal, that is multiple-color imaging and z-sections. Brightfield and fluorescence channels can be used as the input for tracking. The tracking is both robust and very accurate, as exemplified by <xref ref-type="other" rid="media8">Videos 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media9">9</xref>. TipTracker tracks objects only in two dimensions since the roots are confined between the coverslip and the agar block, but if needed, 3D tracking is a straightforward extension.<media content-type="glencoe play-in-place height-250 width-310" id="media8" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-26792-media8.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26792.019</object-id><label>Video 8.</label><caption><title>Time series of a root tip growing along another root demonstrating the robustness of tracking in a spectacular way.</title><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.26792.019">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.26792.019</ext-link></p></caption></media><media content-type="glencoe play-in-place height-250 width-310" id="media9" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-26792-media9.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26792.020</object-id><label>Video 9.</label><caption><title>Time series of a root tip growing away from the objective lens inside the gel.</title><p>As a result, the root tip is no more in focus but the blurred root is still tracked by TipTracker.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.26792.020">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.26792.020</ext-link></p></caption></media></p><p>In addition to confocal microscopes, the lightsheet (LSFM, SPIM) systems are ideally suited for the imaging of roots with TipTracker because these usually already feature vertical sample mounting. As an example, the implementation of TipTracker on a Zeiss Z1 lighsheet system can be achieved rather straightforward, however, image file handling and position input would need to be modified. For home-built SPIM systems with custom software, it is easier to directly implement the tracking calculation in the acquisition software, here the TipTracker’s core algorithms can be used.</p><p>The usage of TipTracker is not limited to vertical stage microscopes and can be used on any inverted or upright microscope setup with a motorized stage. The example of zebrafish embryo development also demonstrates that the tracking algorithm is not limited to root tips and can in fact be used for all moving samples, given that the algorithm makes no assumptions about the samples, such as shape, brightness, or direction of movement.</p><p>Combining optimal growing conditions and root tip tracking, we now have been able to perform experiments that were previously very hard to conduct. Long-term image acquisition revealed previously unappreciated regularity in the cell division and elongation pattern making up the root growth. The high-resolution imaging of dividing cells enabled capturing the exact timing of several cytokinesis events while observing the whole root meristem; or the observation of the dynamic rearrangement of the auxin gradient during gravitropism making it possible to dissect the spread of auxin distribution at high spatio-temporal resolution. Our setup made these findings possible, demonstrating its versatility and application to a broad range of questions in developmental, cell biology and physiology. We have aimed for a very detailed description that will enable other labs to implement the setup or its components, and will therefore be beneficial to the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> community as well as non-plant researchers.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plant transgenic reporter lines</title><p>The transgenic reporter lines were described previously: KNOLLE::GFP-KNOLLE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Reichardt et al., 2007</xref>), DII-Venus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brunoud et al., 2012</xref>), UBQ10::H2B-RFP / UBQ10::YFP-PIP1;4 / GATA23::nls-GUS-GFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">von Wangenheim et al., 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Illumination setup</title><p>The LED illumination system is a custom-built lamp.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Christian Hardtke as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>In principal, the reviewers found the set-up reported in your manuscript useful. However, they are concerned about its scope as a resource at this point and would like to see further improvements and documentation:</p><p>While there was consensus that a resource should be rather easily implemented/applied, the conversion to a vertical microscope is not straightforward (and probably would result in loss of warranty for confocal systems). Yet, as this is of course unavoidable here, at least the tracking part should become easier to implement and we therefore would like to ask you to provide the software in an open format.</p><p>Please discuss the limitations of the set up in more depth and make each aspect very transparent such that it is truly informative for the community.</p><p>An important point is that the resource should demonstrate that its use leads to new insight into root development beyond what was previously possible. This might be achieved by a more in depth analysis of KNOLLE behavior, or by additional pertinent experiments. For example, can it be used to follow markers in inner tissue layers across time?</p><p>For details, refer to the reviews below, and please also address all other points brought up by the reviewers.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>This is an exciting and innovative manuscript which addresses a key imaging obstacle in plant biology. While other solutions to the extended imaging of gravity-sensitive roots have been provided previously, this work provides significant advances beyond these enabling this to be achieved for far greater time periods.</p><p>The text is clearly written and the methods are well described. The quality of the videos provided is outstanding.</p><p>Concerns with the manuscript lie principally within the experimental validation of the technology, and a couple with the method itself.</p><p>In order to encourage this technology to be adopted, it would be preferred to have the software work in the freely available Octave software as opposed to MatLab. This would remove a financial obstacle in the form of licence-based software. In a best case scenario the existing code will run seamlessly within Octave.</p><p>The extent to which plants are experiencing a hypoxic response under agar within the Lab-Tek chambered coverglass should be examined. Imaging the ADH1::GFP reporter would answer this.

This and differences between what is observed here and what has been reported previously requires further detailed discussion.</p><p>Verification of cell tracking in zebrafish through some form of quantification is lacking. A clear validation of the method and the ability to derive novel insight into this biological process is missing.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>Von Wangenheim and coworkers describe a vertical confocal setup and developed a custom software for automatic tracking of moving/growing objects. The authors very nicely explain how to convert a &quot;normal&quot; confocal into a vertical one. They have supplied all the needed information for the transformation and for the construction of the rotation stage, illumination setup and the scripts to implement the TipTracker software. They have used this system to show that it can give high resolution information on cell differentiation, division and gravitropic responses. Although all experiments are performed to the highest standards and the data is represented in a beautiful and clear manner, to me it falls short to be considered as a resource. The conversion to a vertical confocal system is not straightforward and needs experts in optics and also experienced workshops. This is not readily available for most laboratories. Also when comparing the manuscript to other resource papers such as Barbier de Reuille et al., 2015 and Rabe et al., 2016 this manuscript will have less impact on the community as in my opinion is it limited to only a few groups. It might be an idea to expand the Tiptracker idea also to light sheet microscope setups. I feel that in its current state it falls short of being a resource for the community.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>The authors present a methodology how to convert an upright confocal microscope into vertical imaging system where the growth and movement of biological samples can be tracked and recorded in a high resolution.</p><p>Imaging in vertical orientation facilitates studying of gravity responding samples in their natural orientation e.g. plant root tips.</p><p>The article describes in detail how to adapt the upright microscope for its new function. Additionally, the authors provide a tracking program that enables the process of long time-course scanning to be automated for several samples at the same time. Importantly, the authors provide also the information on how to provide good light necessary for undisturbed growth.</p><p>This methodology will facilitate more accurate studies of gravity influenced processes in the growing root.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26792.024</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>While there was consensus that a resource should be rather easily implemented/applied, the conversion to a vertical microscope is not straightforward (and probably would result in loss of warranty for confocal systems).

The confocal scan head is not modified in any way. Therefore, we see no reason why this would affect the warranty. The situation concerning the microscope body is indeed different: No commercial manufacturer designs and tests its microscopes in the vertical configuration. In this version of the manuscript (in the TipTracker part) we list the prerequisites of the setup to be verticalized.</p><p>We added a compiled version of the TipTracker program, which enables the users who do not need to modify the code to run it without a license. But we argue that MATLAB has several crucial advantages over the freeware software solutions; mainly the graphical user interface that in fact crucially facilitates the implementation of TipTracker. Please see our detailed response to the ‘open format’ issue with MATLAB under the respective reviewer’s comment</p><p><italic>Please discuss the limitations of the set up in more depth and make each aspect very transparent such that it is truly informative for the community.</italic> </p><p>We tried to make the limitations of the system more clear in this version of the manuscript.</p><p> <italic>An important point is that the resource should demonstrate that its use leads to new insight into root development beyond what was previously possible.

It is important to note that our setup does not in any way change the original properties of the given microscope setup; therefore imaging of inner tissues will be similar on the vertical or horizontal microscopes. The major advantage is the ability to image over time without the need of the user to reposition the sample; therefore we focused on the temporal dimension of the KNOLLE behavior in this version of the manuscript.</p><p> <italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p> <italic>Concerns with the manuscript lie principally within the experimental validation of the technology, and a couple with the method itself.</italic> </p><p>With the presubmission to Biorxiv all software has already been provided as open source licensed under CC BY-NC 4.0 (creative commons, Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0). This means that all our software can freely be copied and redistributed in any medium or format, as well as remixed, transformed and built upon. Part of the software is written in Matlab which is indeed a proprietary programming language. However, we cannot agree that this would hamper the implementation of TipTracker:</p><p>1) Since the entire TipTracker software is already open source, anyone is free to port it to her preferred programming language such as Python, Java (for Micromanager), Octave etc. With regards to Octave as an alternative to Matlab, Matlab was chosen because it has several advantages: Matlab offers solid, well tested and documented functionality as well as a great debugging environment. Octave is principally a batch or command-line language. While it is theoretically possible to create a graphical user interface (GUI) with octave, doing so would add a lot of complexity to the code. The code we provide is intentionally kept as basic as possible in order to facilitate modification and extension. In contrast to Octave, Matlab has “guide” that makes building GUI front ends very easy. We felt that having a point-and-click control for TipTracker and thus eliminating the need to type commands in order to run the application was important for the user acceptance.</p><p>2) No Matlab license is required to run TipTracker as is. We added a compiled version of TipTracker, which enables royalty-free deployment to users who do not need to modify the code.</p><p>3) Investment as well as running costs are about two orders of magnitude higher for a confocal microscope than for Matlab, hence the requirement of having a motorized microscope and not Matlab is the real bottleneck for adaptation.</p><p> <italic>In order to encourage this technology to be adopted, it would be preferred to have the software work in the freely available Octave software as opposed to MatLab. This would remove a financial obstacle in the form of licence-based software. In a best case scenario the existing code will run seamlessly within Octave.</italic> </p><p> <italic>The extent to which plants are experiencing a hypoxic response under agar within the Lab-Tek chambered coverglass should be examined. Imaging the ADH1::GFP reporter would answer this. Knowing whether plants are experiencing hypoxia will impact the interpretation of data obtained using this technology.</italic> </p><p>We ordered the ADH::GFP marker line and tested it in the setup and we never observed induction of GFP signal. However, we failed to induce its expression also by other means (24h submersion in water, mild vacuum, removal of oxygen by oxygen absorbers, which actually lead to growth arrest), and we lack the sophisticated tools to precisely control oxygen content in the air. Therefore we do not feel comfortable showing such negative data without a proper positive control. Instead, we compared the growth of roots in the chamber between the block of agar and the coverslip with the growth of roots in the same chamber on the surface of the agar block. Roots between agar and glass grew 88% of the ones growing on the surface (87.94% +-10.5% STDEV, control 100% +-10.9% STDEV, n=21 and 20, respectively), which can be attributed to the mechanical impedance of the setup. We added this analysis into the text.</p><p><italic>More detail on the novel insights arising from imaging KNOLLE would strengthen this part of the text.</italic> </p><p><italic>We performed an additional 24-hour imaging of GFP-KNOLLE marker line and quantified the duration of GFP-KNOLLE appearance during cytokinesis (83 cytokinesis events) and we focused on the stem cell divisions. We added an additional supplemental video and describe the results in the text.</italic></p><p> <italic>DII and gravity stimulation has been performed previously using a periscope in the PNAS paper &quot;Root gravitropism is regulated by a transient lateral auxin gradient controlled by a tipping-point mechanism&quot;. This and differences between what is observed here and what has been reported previously requires further detailed discussion.</italic> </p><p>We included the discussion of this paper into our text, reanalyzed the data to be comparable to the Band et al., 2012 paper and we modified the figure accordingly.</p><p> <italic>Verification of cell tracking in zebrafish through some form of quantification is lacking. A clear validation of the method and the ability to derive novel insight into this biological process is missing.</italic> </p><p><italic>We have to respectfully disagree here: This experiment was done to demonstrate that TipTracker is able to run on a completely different setup than a vertical confocal and is able to track the movement of a sample that is not a root tip. This shows that users can use TipTracker without the need of verticalizing their microscopes, with minimal interference with the existing setups. We believe that tracking animal cells on a horizontal microscope is an ideal demonstration of this ability.</italic></p><p> <italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p> <italic>Von Wangenheim and coworkers describe a vertical confocal setup and developed a custom software for automatic tracking of moving/growing objects. The authors very nicely explain how to convert a &quot;normal&quot; confocal into a vertical one. They have supplied all the needed information for the transformation and for the construction of the rotation stage, illumination setup and the scripts to implement the TipTracker software. They have used this system to show that it can give high resolution information on cell differentiation, division and gravitropic responses.

It might be an idea to expand the Tiptracker idea also to light sheet microscope setups. I feel that in its current state it falls short of being a resource for the community.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewer for appreciating the quality of our experiments. We however cannot agree that our manuscript should not be considered a resource. We believe that our manuscript is in fact a collection of tools, and as such fits the “tools and resources” category of <italic>eLife</italic> articles. We share tools and protocols with the community that can be used altogether as we did, but also each of them separately:</p><p>Detailed description of the ‘verticalization’ of a confocal microscope</p><p>Detail description and blueprints for plant illumination for a microscope</p><p>Detailed description of a microscope rotation inset</p><p>The TipTracker software that enables live tracking of roots, but also other moving samples.</p><p>Detailed protocol of Arabidopsis seedling sample preparation for long-term live imaging</p><p>Of course the confocal microscope is an expensive tool and therefore needs to be handled by experts, but the conversion of an inverted microscope to a vertical system involves no modification of the optics. Likewise, neither the microscope body, nor the confocal scanhead are altered in any way. Solely, the mounting is changed: The microscope body is screwed onto a custom plate and the scan head and the transmitted light arm are raised by support platforms. As platforms simple commercial labjacks suffice. Since we provide a CAD file for the mounting plate it can be readily ordered from any third party machine shop. The modification of the laser safety is a matter of convenience and furthermore quite simple.</p><p>With the example of zebrafish embryogenesis, we were aiming to demonstrate that TipTracker can be implemented on ANY microscope with a motorized stage with controllable positions, not only to verticalized setups. Also any live root imaging longer than 20-30 minutes suffers from the growth of the root tip, given that the sample is in a good condition. Therefore in case of imaging roots in a horizontal position the tracking will be more than useful, and can be implemented without any modifications to existing setups.</p><p>The usage on lightsheets – SPIMs is a good point: SPIM systems usually already feature vertical sample mounting. Therefore they are ideally suited for the imaging of roots with TipTracker. As an example, adapting TipTracker to a Zeiss Z1 lighsheet system can be achieved however image file handling and position input would require modification. For home-build SPIM systems with custom software it is easier to directly implement the tracking calculation in the acquisition software, but for this the tracking algorithm that is in the TipTracker’s core can be used.</p><p>We discuss the above-mentioned points at the end of the TipTracker chapter of the manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
