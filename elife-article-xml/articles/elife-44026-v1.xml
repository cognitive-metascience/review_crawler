However, whether preweaning paternal deprivation (PD) affects emotional and social behaviors and their underlying neural mechanisms remain unexplored. Using monogamous mandarin voles, we found that PD increased anxiety-like behavior and attenuated social preference in adulthood. PD also decreased the number of oxytocin (OT)-positive neurons projecting from the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) and reduced the levels of the medial prefrontal cortex OT receptor protein in females and of the OT receptor and V1a receptor proteins in males. Intra-prelimbic cortical OT injections reversed the PD-induced changes in anxiety-like behavior and social preferences. Optogenetic activation of the prelimbic cortex OT terminals from PVN OT neurons reversed the PD-induced changes in emotion and social preference behaviors, whereas optogenetic inhibition was anxiogenic and impaired social preference in naive voles. These ﬁndings demonstrate that PD increases anxiety-like behavior and attenuates social preferences through the involvement of PVN OT neuron projections to the prelimbic cortex.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.44026.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Parental care early in life is essential for normal development of the brain in humans and some other animals. It also lays the ground work for healthy behaviors later in life. Many studies have looked at the importance of a mother’s care, but less attention has been paid to the role played by fathers. Research shows that children who grow up without a father are at risk of emotional and behavioral problems later in life. But it is not clear how missing a father’s care affects brain development.</p><p>Oxytocin, a chemical produced by a part of the brain called the paraventricular nucleus, plays a key role in parental bonding. Another part of the brain called the prelimbic cortex regulates many emotions and many complex behaviors. Studying animals, like the mandarin vole, that form strong bonds with both parents is one way to learn more about how the loss of paternal care affects oxytocin or emotional and behavioral health.</p><p>Now, He et al. show that mandarin voles raised without a father are more anxious and socialize less with other voles than those raised with a father. The voles deprived of paternal care also have fewer oxytocin-producing cells in the paraventricular nucleus and fewer receptors for oxytocin in the prelimbic cortex. Injecting oxytocin into the prelimbic cortex eliminated the anxious and antisocial behavior seen in the voles lacking paternal care. Using a technique called optogenetics to restore the release of oxytocin in the prelimbic cortex reduced anxious behavior and restored normal social interactions. Using the same approach to interfere with communication between the paraventricular nucleus and prelimbic cortex in voles raised with a father also triggered anxious and antisocial behavior.</p><p>The experiments reveal that fathers play an important role in brain and behavioral development in mandarin voles. He et al. show that a lack of paternal care leads to deficits in oxytocin and a poor communication between the paraventricular nucleus and prelimbic cortex that contribute to emotional and social abnormalities in the voles. More studies are needed to determine father’s care has similar effects in humans. But if this relationship is confirmed, it might lead scientists to develop new strategies for treating psychiatric disorders in people deprived of paternal care.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Mandarin voles</kwd><kwd>oxytocin</kwd><kwd>prelimbic cortex</kwd><kwd>anxiety</kwd><kwd>social preference</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Fundamental Research Funds for Central University of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GK201903065</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>He</surname><given-names>Zhixiong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P50MH100023</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Young</surname><given-names>Larry</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007667</institution-id><institution>Yerkes Regional Primate Research Center</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P51OD11132</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Young</surname><given-names>Larry</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31372213</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tai</surname><given-names>Fadao</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31670421</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tai</surname><given-names>Fadao</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The PVN-mPFC OT circuit is an important target for the treatment of disorders related to early adverse experiences.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Social attachments can facilitate reproduction, increase survival, provide a sense of security and reduce feelings of stress and anxiety in many species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Coria-Avila et al., 2014</xref>). In humans, attachment is especially important during early development because disruption of filial attachment in children (e.g., abuse, neglect or the death of a parent) increases their vulnerability to emotional disorders at a later age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agid et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Reinherz et al., 1999</xref>).</p><p>By the end of 2013, it was estimated that over 61 million children in rural hometowns were missing one or both parents (more often the father) throughout China (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">All-China Women's Federation, 2013</xref>). Neonatal social or paternal deprivation (PD) has been proven to exert a profound and persistent inﬂuence on the physiological and behavioral development of offspring. Neonatal rodents physiologically and emotionally depend on their parents. For example, PD impairs sociability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bambico et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jia et al., 2009</xref>) and social recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cao et al., 2014</xref>), reduces parental behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jia et al., 2009</xref>) and alloparental behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ahern and Young, 2009</xref>), and inhibits the formation of pair bonding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Yu et al., 2013</xref>). Lack of paternal care can also affect emotional behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ovtscharoff et al., 2006</xref>). In humans, PD impairs psychological and mental development and increases the risk of substance abuse and personality disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Grossmann et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jablonska and Lindberg, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sobrinho et al., 2012</xref>). Despite emerging evidence on the impact of PD, the primary focus of research has been on father–offspring relationships from postnatal day (PND) 0–21 in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gos et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ahern and Young, 2009</xref>).</p><p>Mandarin voles (<italic>Microtus mandarinus</italic>) are socially monogamous and exhibit extensive biparental investment and high offspring survival and growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tai et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tai and Wang, 2001</xref>). Mandarin voles are furred by around PND 7, suggesting that their thermoregulatory ability is well developed. Mandarin voles open their eyes and begin to eat solid food around PND 13. Paternal care (e.g., licking, retrieving and nest building) gradually decreases from PND 14 to PND 20 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wang et al., 2018</xref>). Pups of age PND 1–13 and PND 14–21 have different needs, and the effects of disrupting father–offspring bonds during the latter period may not be the result of disrupted direct care but the result of disrupted emotional attachment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">He et al., 2017</xref>). Mandarin vole pups have high levels of attachment to their fathers from PND 14–21 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">He et al., 2017</xref>).

Previous studies have found that PD alters the levels of OT receptor (OTR) mRNA in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cao et al., 2014</xref>), and neonatal OT treatments have long-term effects on behavior and physiology in mandarin voles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jia et al., 2009</xref>). OT binds to OTRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burkett et al., 2016</xref>) or vasopressin 1a receptors (V1aR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Song et al., 2014</xref>) to affect social behavior. If preweaning PD changes sociability and emotion, we predict that it should also affect the levels of OT and OTR.</p><p>OTRs and V1aRs are found in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Smeltzer et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lieberwirth and Wang, 2016</xref>). Several studies suggest that the mPFC is critical for the expression of anxiety-like behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lisboa et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Saitoh et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wang et al., 2015</xref>) and social behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sabihi et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lee et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Murugan et al., 2017</xref>). This brain region is a heterogeneous cortical structure composed of subregions, including the anterior cingulate (Cg), prelimbic cortex (PrL) and infralimbic cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Heidbreder and Groenewegen, 2003</xref>). Several studies have shown the involvement of the PrL in the regulation of anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sabihi et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wang et al., 2015</xref>) and social behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Young et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Carrier and Kabbaj, 2012</xref>). A recent report found that a subset of mPFC neurons elevated discharge rates when approaching a strange mouse but not when approaching non-social objects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lee et al., 2016</xref>), indicating the involvement of the mPFC in social behavior. However, whether OT in the PrL is involved in the effects of preweaning deprivation on emotion and sociability remains unclear. In addition, whether the PVN-mPFC OTergic neural circuit mediates mood and social behavior has not been determined. Therefore, we investigated whether optogenetic activation of the PVN (OTergic)-mPFC projections can rescue the changes in emotion and social approach-avoidance induced by PD to reveal the involvement of PVN OTergic projections in these processes.</p><p>Using socially monogamous mandarin voles, we investigated the effects of PD from PND 14–21 on emotion and social preference and the levels of OT and OTR in specific brain regions. We then tested whether a microinjection of OT into the PrL and optogenetic activation of PVN (OTergic)-mPFC projections can recover the effects of preweaning PD. We hypothesized that disruption of early emotional attachment between pups and fathers affects anxiety-like behavior and social preference in mandarin voles in adulthood and that the OT system is probably involved in this process.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Effect of pre-weaning PD on anxiety-like behavior and social preference</title><p>It has previously been shown that offspring that experience neonatal maternal separation or early deprivation display high levels of anxiety-like behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sachs et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wei et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Koe et al., 2016</xref>).

Optical activation of PD voles expressing ChR2-mCherry increased social preference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7J and K</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig7sdata1">Figure 7—source data 1</xref>).

However, a main effect of the absence/presence of a stimulus mandarin vole was found (F(1,20) = 13.350, p&lt;0.01), such that optogenetically activated PVN OT neuron terminals in the PrL of ChR2-expressing PD males induced more investigations of the social stimulus than of the object stimulus (p&lt;0.025). In addition, the treatment produced a main effect in males (F(1,20) = 5.785, p&lt;0.05). There was no significant interaction in males (F(1,20) = 2.011, p=0.172). Two-way ANOVA showed a significant effect of the interaction between treatment and the absence/presence of a stimulus mandarin vole on the percentages of time in females (F(1,20) = 6.771, p&lt;0.05).

PD decreased the neuronal activity in the PrL and NAc shells and reduced the percentage of c-fos/OT-labeled cells in the PVN during the social approach test. PD also reduced the number of PVN OT-IR neurons and decreased the amounts of mPFC OTR protein in females and the OTR and V1aR proteins in males. We then demonstrated that an intra-PrL OT injection restored the anxiety-like behavior and social preference altered by preweaning PD. For the first time, we showed that optogenetic activation of the PVN-PrL OT terminals reduced anxiety-like behavior and increased social-preference behavior in PD mandarin voles. Optogenetic inhibition of PrL-projecting PVN OTergic neurons elicited anxiety-like behavior and decreased social preference in naive mandarin voles.</p><p>The finding that PND 14–21 PD increased anxiety-like behavior and reduced social preference in both sexes is consistent with studies in humans and other animals that showed that early severe deprivation is associated with behavioral abnormalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rosenblum and Harlow, 1963</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rutter et al., 2001</xref>). The current result is also supported by one of our previous studies that indicated that PND 14–21 offspring show emotional attachment to their fathers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">He et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, PND 14–21 PD should disrupt emotional attachment to fathers and should adversely affect emotion and sociability. These effects are similar to previous findings that indicated that neonatal PD during PND 1–21 increases anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Yu et al., 2011</xref>) and reduces sociability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bambico et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Farrell et al., 2016</xref>). We infer that the disruption of attachment between pups and fathers during PND 14–21 increases the level of anxiety and reduces the level of sociability.</p><p>The present study found that PND 14–21 PD reduced mPFC OTR protein in both sexes but did not affect AVP levels. The mPFC may receive long-range axonal projections from OT-producing neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Knobloch et al., 2012</xref>). A previous study found that OT in the PrL region of the mPFC decreased anxiety regardless of sex and that neither AVP nor OTR-A affected anxiety-like behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sabihi et al., 2014b</xref>). Blocking OTR in the PrL enhances postpartum anxiety but has no effect on anxiety in virgin females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sabihi et al., 2014a</xref>). OTR knockout mice display deﬁcits in social-approach behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nishimori et al., 2008</xref>) and social memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lee et al., 2008</xref>). Thus, OTR in the mPFC may play different roles under different physiological and pathological conditions. PVN OT neurons predominantly express vesicular glutamate transporter 2, suggesting that depolarization of these neurons is coupled with synaptic glutamate release in their projections, such as those to the mPFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kawasaki et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Johnson and Young, 2017</xref>). In addition, a specific class of interneurons (OxtrINs) in the mPFC is critical for the modulation of social and emotional behaviors in both sexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li et al., 2016</xref>). It is likely that the release of glutamate by OT neurons activates local GABA-interneurons in the mPFC, leading to reduced anxiety and regulated social behavior. Thus, we conclude that disruption of the attachment between pups and fathers increases the levels of anxiety and impairs social preference, possibly by decreasing the OTR protein in the mPFC.</p><p>PND 14–21 PD decreased the V1aR protein in males but had no effect on the level of the V1aR protein in females. Sex differences in the OT system may, therefore, be implicated in sex-speciﬁc regulation of impaired social behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Smeltzer et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dumais and Veenema, 2016</xref>). V1aR and OTR show distinct and largely nonoverlapping expression in the rodent brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dumais and Veenema, 2016</xref>). Female prairie voles have greater densities of OTR binding but lower densities of V1aR binding than males in the mPFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Smeltzer et al., 2006</xref>). Intracerebroventricular (ICV) injections of OT induce social communication by activating V1aR in male Syrian hamsters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Song et al., 2014</xref>). Studies have shown that some of the prosocial effects of OT may be mediated by V1aR in males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sala et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ramos et al., 2013</xref>) and that V1aR knockout mice have impaired social interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Egashira et al., 2007</xref>). V1aR is a G protein-coupled receptor, similar to OTR. We speculate that OT might regulate anxiety-like behavior and social preference in males via OTR and V1aR in the PrL.</p><p>PND 14–21 PD did not affect the density of OTR-IR in either sex, which isinconsistent with the previous finding that PD (PND 1–21) alters the level of OTR mRNA in the NAc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cao et al., 2014</xref>). These discrepancies may result from different deprivation periods. Nevertheless, this suggestion requires further study.</p><p>A major finding of the current study is that microinjection of OT directly into the PrL of males (10 ng) and females (1 ng and 10 ng) restored the changes to anxiety-like behavior and social preference caused by PD, whereas voles treated with OT plus either dose of OTA did not exhibit a reversal of any kind (except for the male 10 ng OT/10 ng OTA group). For the first time, we found that stimulation of endogenous OT fibers by optogenetic in the PrL also rescued emotion and social-preference behavior. However, optogenetic inhibition of endogenous OT release was anxiogenic and decreased social preference in naive voles. This result is consistent with previous findings that OT in the PrL reduces anxiety-like behavior in both sexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sabihi et al., 2014b</xref>). Injection of highly speciﬁc OTA into the PrL region of the mPFC increases anxiety-like behavior in postpartum females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sabihi et al., 2014a</xref>), and OTR blockade in the postpartum PrL impairs maternal care behavior and enhances maternal aggression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sabihi et al., 2014a</xref>). OxtrINs have been identified in the mouse mPFC that express OTR and were shown to be activated in response to OT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nakajima et al., 2014</xref>). OxtrINs are important for the modulation of social and emotional behaviors in males and females and are involved in a molecular mechanism that acts on local mPFC circuits to coordinate responses to OT and corticotropin-releasing hormone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li et al., 2016</xref>). Similarly, OT infusion into the PrL reverses amphetamine-induced deficits in social bonding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Young et al., 2014</xref>). OT and dopamine (DA) interactions regulate affiliative social behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Liu and Wang, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Shahrokh et al., 2010</xref>). Absence of the father in the monogamous California mouse impairs social behavior and decreases pyramidal neuronal responses to DA in the mPFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bambico et al., 2015</xref>). Injection of oxytocin into the ventral tegmental area increases the extracellular DA concentration in the dialysate from the mPFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sanna et al., 2012</xref>). Therefore, there is likely that there is a reciprocal interaction between OT and DA that regulates social behavior in the mPFC, and that mPFC OT may be a promising target for treating emotional and social disorders that are induced by adverse early experiences.</p><p>Changes in OT pathways that are induced by severe early life stress can be transmitted to the next generation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Toepfer et al., 2017</xref>). Dysfunction of OT system in adulthood caused by early life stress can reduce affiliated contact with offspring and consequently can result in changes in the OT systems of the offspring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rilling and Young, 2014</xref>). In the present study, preweaning paternal deprivation reduced OT neurons in the PVN, reduced levels of OTR in the mPFC and affected relevant behaviors. Consistent with previous reports, PD from weaning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Feng et al., 2019</xref>) to adolescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wang et al., 2017</xref>) decreased the number of OT-positive neurons in the PVN of mandarin voles. Thus, parental deprivation impacts the oxytocin system of the offspring on a permanent basis. We also found that disruptions of early emotional attachment reduced the number of OT-IR neurons in the PVN of males and females. Maternal separation is known to decrease the number of PVN OT-IR neurons in females but not in males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Veenema et al., 2007</xref>). These discrepancies may result from the different treatments (maternal separation and PD) and different sensitivities to neonatal stress in different species. Furthermore, we showed that activation of the PVN-PrL OTergic projection improved anxiety-like behavior and social preference. Previous studies found that social approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Peñagarikano et al., 2015</xref>) and mood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Grund et al., 2017</xref>) were improved by activating endogenous oxytocin neurons in the PVN with chemogenetics. We speculate that these changes were also partly due to activation of the PVN-PrL OT pathway.</p><p>Mandarin voles can be used as an animal model to investigate the effects of early emotional attachment disruption on the adult brain, on behavior and on the underlying mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">He et al., 2017</xref>). Disruption of the early emotional attachment between pups and fathers impairs emotional and social behaviors and leads to OT system dysfunction in the brain. We provide intriguing evidence that the site-speciﬁc action of OT in the PrL projected from the PVN has potential beneﬁcial effects on the recovery of the emotional and social dysfunction induced by the disruption of early emotional attachment. The modulation of OT on emotion and social behaviors was sex-specific. Therefore, OT can be potentially targeted to ameliorate the social and emotional deﬁcits resulting from early adverse experiences.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials

id="s4-1"><title>Subjects</title><p>Animals were a laboratory-reared offspring originating from a wild population of mandarin voles in Henan, China. Animals were maintained on a 12:12 light:dark cycle with unlimited access to food (carrot and rabbit chow) and were provided with water and cotton nesting material in polycarbonate cages (44 cm x 22 cm x 16 cm). All procedures were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of Shaanxi Normal University and were in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of China.</p><p>For the paternal deprivation (PD) treatment, fathers (F<sub>1</sub> generation) were removed permanently from the home cage after pups (F<sub>2</sub> generation) were 14 days of age until weaning at PND 21. For the biparental care control group (PC), all family members were housed in their home cage and left undisturbed until pups were weaned at 21 days of age. Offspring at 70 days of age were tested using the behavioral paradigms below. For females, only experimental data from diestrous individuals were included to avoid effects from the estrous cycle.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Open field test</title><p>F<sub>2</sub> mandarin voles were observed in the open field. Subjects were placed in a center of an open-ﬁeld arena (50 cm x 50 cm x 25 cm), and the duration and distance moved within the center or periphery was recorded using an automated system (SocialScan 2.0, Clever Sys, Reston, VA, USA). Measures include the proportion of time spent in the central area and total distance moved in the open field test (OFT).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Light and dark test</title><p>The light and dark apparatus was divided into two chambers: white compartment (2/3) and dark compartment (1/3). Voles were released into the center of the light compartment and have 5 min to explore the arena. Videotracking equipment (SuperMaze) was used for the voles’ duration in the light arena.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Social-preference test</title><p>Immediately after the open field test, the social preference test (SPT) was carried out. The SPT was based on the social approach-avoidance paradigm described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Qiao et al., 2014</xref>). Briefly, prior to testing, voles were placed in a box. The test box (50 cm length x 50 cm width x 24 cm height) was constructed of white glacial polyvinylchloride. After 5 min of habituation, an empty wire-mesh cage (object stimulus; 10 cm length x 10 cm width) was placed near one side wall of the arena for 10 min, which was then exchanged for a cage containing an stranger same-sex con-specific (social stimulus) for an additional 10 min. Behavioral responses to an empty cage or to a cage with a stimulus individual were videotaped, and scored and quantified afterwards using OBSERVER v5.0 (vNoldus, NL). Measures included the time spent investigating the object and social stimulus. Data are presented as investigation time/total time (10 min) x 100%.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Social approach test</title><p>The social approach test was a modified version of that described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gunaydin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hung et al., 2017</xref>). After 5 min of habituation, a stranger same-sex conspecific juvenile vole (3–5 weeks) or novel object (a Rubik's cube) was then placed in the home cage for 10 min. The 5-cm-wide area in front of the wire-mesh cage and the 8-cm-wide area in the left and wire-mesh cage were considered to be zones of olfactory, visual and acoustic contact between subjects and stimulus voles. Duration of olfactory investigation was also recorded and analyzed in real time using an automated system (SuperMaze).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Immunohistochemistry</title><p>Experimental mandarin voles were anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium. Brains were removed from the skull and placed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 3 d. Brains were then dehydrated in 30% sucrose solution until saturated at 4°C.</p><p>Thick coronal slices were prepared on a cryostat (CM1950, Leica, Germany). Sections were rinsed with 0.01 M phosphate buffer solution (PBS) for 10 min following incubation with 0.6% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> for 20 min, and rinsed for 3 × 5 min with 0.01 M PBS. Sections were then preincubated for 60 min with normal goat serum. Sections were incubated for 48 hr at 4°C in OT, c-fos and AVP diluted in antibody diluent. Next day, sections were rinsed in 0.01 M PBS for 3 x 5 min and incubated with the secondary antibody for 60 min in a 37°C water bath. The nuclei were stained by DAPI dye for 10 min. Afterwards, sections were rinsed for 3 × 5 min with 0.01 M PBS and fixed with antifade solution.</p><p>Image acquisition was performed with a microscope and Nikon camera. For each vole, the number of OT-IR neurons (PVN) were counted, three representative sections from anterior to posterior that were anatomically matched between subjects were chosen to minimize variability. The count of OT-IR cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Song et al., 2010</xref>) followed the method described in the previous report. Six brain sections for each vole were counted to quantify the c-fos-positive cells and the OT/c-fos-positive cells. All immunohistochemistry procedures were also performed on negative-control sections (the primary antibody was not added). An observer blind to experimental conditions performed the entire analysis. The number of OT-positive neurons were quantified from images acquired under a 10X objective using the cell counter; for c-fos-positive cells and OT/c-fos-positive cells, image acquisition was performed under a 20X objective; these were averaged across three nonoverlapping sections in an evenly spaced series for each animal.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Western blotting</title><p>Voles from the PC and PD groups were sacrificed by rapid decapitation at 70 days of age. Brains were immediately extracted and frozen in dry ice. Coronal sections (200 µm) were cut on a cryostat and frost mounted onto microscope slides. Bilateral tissue punches with a 1 mm diameter were taken from the entire mPFC (Cg and PrL), NAc and PVN and stored at −80°C until processing. Total proteins were extracted with RIPA lysis buffer containing protease inhibitors. Protein samples (20 μg/lane) were separated by sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to PVDF membranes. The membrane was incubated with the following diluted primary antibodies: OTR, V1aR, AVP and β-tubulin, at 4°C overnight. Following washing, the membrane was incubated with horseradish-peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies; membranes were revealed with ECL and exposed on Luminescent Imaging (Tanon 6200 Luminescent Imaging Workstation, Tanon). Quantification was performed using ImageJ software, and all signals were normalized within the same membrane to β-tubulin.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Stereotaxic cannulation and microinjection</title><p>At 70 days of age, mandarin voles in the PD group were anesthetized by isoflurane, and 26-gauge bilateral steel guide cannulae (R.W.D. Life Science, Shenzhen, China) were stereotaxically implanted aimed at the PrL (coordinates from bregma: anterior, 2.2 mm; bilateral, ±0.5 mm; ventral, 2.2 mm). Voles were allowed 3 d of post-operative recovery. One of three solutions — CSF (200 nl/side), CSF containing OT (1 ng/200 nl/side or 10 ng/200 nl/side), or CSF containing OT (male 10 ng OT; female: 1 ng OT) plus OTA (10 ng/200 nl/side or 100 ng/200 nl/side) — was injected into the PrL. All microinjections were made with a 33-gauge needle that extended 1 mm below the guide cannula and were delivered at a rate of 0.1 μl/min as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Young et al., 2014</xref>). Data were excluded if the tips were located in other brain regions. The final size of each group was six except for the 10 ng OT/100 ng OTA male group which numbered five, and the 1 ng OT/10 ng OTA and 1 ng OT/100 ng OTA female groups (both n = 5).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Optogenetics and behavioral tests</title><p>At 28 days of age, mandarin voles were anesthetized with 0.2% pentobarbital sodium and placed in a stereotaxic apparatus (R.W.D. Life Science, Shenzhen, China). After craniotomy, the PD voles were injected (40 nl /min) with rAAV-Ef1α-DIO-ChR2-mCherry: rAAV-Oxytocin-Cre (1:1, total 300 nl) or rAAV-Ef1α-DIO-mCherry: rAAV-Oxytocin-Cre (1:1, total 300 nl) into the right PVN (coordinates from bregma in mm: −0.7 posterior, 0.1 lateral, −5.4 ventral); the naive voles were injected (40 nl /min) with rAAV-Ef1α-DIO-eNpHR3.0-mCherry: rAAV-Oxytocin-Cre (1:1, total 300 nl) or rAAV-Ef1α-DIO-mCherry: rAAV-Oxytocin-Cre (1:1, total 300 nl) into the bilateral PVN (coordinates from bregma: −0.7 mm posterior, ±0.1 mm lateral, −5.4 mm ventral). AAV titers were about 10<sup>12</sup> gc/ml. All injections were kept in place for an additional 10 min to allow the virus diffusion from the injection needle. Five weeks after virus injection, voles were implanted with optical fibre (OD = 250 μm, 0.37 NA; Shanghai Fiblaser) targeted to the right PrL (coordinates from bregma: anterior, 2.2 mm; lateral, −0.3 mm; ventral, 1.8 mm) or the bilateral PrL (coordinates from bregma: anterior, 2.2 mm; lateral, ±0.32 mm with a 5° angle; ventral, 1.81 mm). Optogenetic behavioral tests started 6 weeks after virus injection.</p><p>For the activation or inhibition of oxytocinergic terminals in the PrL, optogenetic parameters (ChR2: 10 ms, 30 Hz, 8 s on and 2 s off cycle, 15 ~ 20 mWatts; eNpHR3.0: 5 ms, 30 Hz, 8 s on and 2 s off cycle, ~10 mWatts) were modified as in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Marlin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hung et al., 2017</xref>) with a blue light laser (473 nm) or a yellow light laser (593 nm). In behavioral tests, voles were placed in the open field and allowed to explore freely for 5 min. Next, the social approach-avoidance test was carried out immediately. Subjects received total 25 min blue laser pulses in during whole test phase. After two days, to detect the c-fos expression actived by the optogenetic stimulus, voles were placed in an open field for 5 min and were sacrificed 90 min later.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Data analysis</title><p>Parametric tests were used because all data were normally distributed according to one-sample Kolmogorov–Smirnov tests. Independent sample t-tests (two-tailed) were used to assess differences in behavior in the open field (PC vs. PD; Ctrl vs. ChR2; and Ctrl vs. eNpHR3.0), levels of OTR, V1aR and AVP protein (PC vs. PD) in different brain regions, and the number of c-fos-IR positive neurons (Ctrl vs. ChR2; Ctrl vs. eNpHR3.0). The signiﬁcance level was set at p&lt;0.05. The social preference test (factors: treatment × stimulus); the social approach test (factors: treatment × stimulus); the behavioral changes following optogenetic activation (factors: treatment × stimulus); PVN OT-IR (the number of positive neurons) (factors: treatment × sex); and the number of c-fos-IR-positive neurons (factors: treatment × stimulus) were analyzed using two-way ANOVA. Paired t-tests (two-tailed) were used to compare approach/avoidance with Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. The open field (pharmacology and the behavioral changes following optogenetic activation) was analyzed using one-way ANOVA. Data were presented as mean + SEM, all statistical procedures were performed using SPSS 17.0.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grants 31372213 and 31670421) and Fundamental Research Funds for Central University (GK201903065).

The novelty of the report is the time period explored and the use of a highly social mammal in which parental bonds extend beyond the period of physical dependence. The authors find that anxiety following parental separation can be reduced by oxytocin infusions into the PLC and report a decrease in oxytocin innervation of the same area following depravation. The review of the literature is highly scholarly and the findings are appropriately placed in the context of the field.</p><p>The weakness of the report is the lack of novelty. Oxytocin is arguably the most intensely investigated peptide on the planet for its role in social bonding and anxiety. Indeed the authors make such a compelling argument that the anxiety induced by the loss of a parent must be mediated by oxytocin that any finding to the contrary would have been truly surprising, and interesting. But as it stands, the current report only modestly adds to the existing and extensive literature.</p><p>What would be an advance would be some mechanistic insight into how oxytocin innervation is impacted by early life depravation of a parent. Do the oxytocin neurons die? Or is expression of the gene repressed? Are there enduring epigenetic modifications? Etc. However before that line of inquiry were to be pursued it would also be important to provide far more convincing evidence that the innervation has in fact changed. The images provided here are not reassuring from a quantitative standpoint.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>He et al. examined the effects of paternal deprivation (PD) of Mandarin voles on anxiety and social preference of adult males and females. Such effect has been reported before and the present manuscript focuses on PD during pre-weaning period. The main findings are: 1) Voles subjected to PD at prenatal days (PND)14-21 display heightened anxiety and reduced social preference. 2) PD males and female voles have reduced OT-positive fibers in the mPFC. PD males have reduced oxytocin (OT)-positive neurons in the PVN, while females display the opposite phenotype. 3) PD also affected the levels of OT and AVP receptors (OTR and V1a) in different brain regions and the levels of serum corticosterone (CORT) and OT were altered in females. 4) injection of oxytocin into the mPFC could somewhat reverse the anxiety and social behavior phenotypes.</p><p>On a positive note, the Mandarin voles are, as mentioned in the manuscript, a good model for the investigation of PD, and the establishment of the PND 14-21 PD paradigm separates the emotional deprivation from the physiological. However, in my opinion, the contribution of this manuscript to the field is incremental to what is already known for this and other species. As mentioned by the authors, the effects of PD on both the behavioral and anatomical phenotypes reported in this manuscript were shown before. The effects of neonatal paternal deprivation or early deprivation on anxiety and social behaviors adults and juveneille Mandarin voles [Wang et al., 2012, and Jia et al., 2009]. Moreover, the reduced number of OT-IR neurons in the PVN following PD was previously shown in juvenile mandarin voles [Wang et al., 2012]; Lower serum OT was previously found in both juvenile [Wang et al., 2012] and adult PD female voles [Cao Y. et al., 2014]; Lack of significant increase in serum CORT in PD males was previously established [Yu et al., 2015].</p><p>In sum, the novelty of the present manuscript is limited to a specific paradigm of PD of Mandarin voles at PND 14-21. Moreover, the manuscript does not provide sufficient data regarding the mechanism of the behavioral and neuroanatomical deficits. The behavioral rescue with OT injection (Figure 7) is somewhat novel but very limited and preliminary in terms of identifying the exact neuronal circuit which is affected by OT administration. I also have some major technical concerns which are listed below.</p><p>Specific major concerns:</p><p>Figure 1: Additional anxiety-related behavioral assays (i.e. elevated plus maze, Dark-light transfer assay) would assist in further characterization of anxiety in PD voles, and could contribute to establishing the differential response to PD in females vs. males.</p><p>Figure 3: The images showing the effect of PD on PLC OT-IR fibers are of very poor quality and not convincing. The reader will find it hard to believe that hundreds of OT-IR fibers were reliably quantified.</p><p>Figure 4: This figure is all about a negative result (no difference in nucleus accumbens OT fibers) and it is not necessary to show as a main figure. It will be more appropriate as either a supplementary figure or as part of Figure 3.</p><p>Figure 5: The quality of the Western blots showing the levels of OTR and V1aR is unacceptable. Firstly, the gels are cropped so the specificity of the antibodies (which are known to be problematic) cannot be appreciated. Secondly, some of the protein bands are so weak and close to the background level, at some panels and the loading controls of anti-Tubulin are not equal and therefore the experimental evidences regarding the effects of PD on OTR (Figure 5A and B) and V1aR (Figure 5C) are not sufficiently supported.</p><p>Figure 6: This figure demonstrates the effects of PD on OT serum levels in females. Measuring OT serum levels using ELISA kits is criticized in the field [see: Leng and Sabatier J Neuroendocrinol. 2016 Oct;28(10). doi: 10.1111/jne.12413].

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Andrew King as the Senior and Reviewing Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The reviewers agreed that the additional experiments carried out have strengthened this paper, overcoming several of the issues that were raised previously, as well as providing a more direct link between the effects of parental deprivation and activity in the projection from oxytocinergic PVN neurons to the mPFC. They differed, however, in their views about the significance of these findings.</p><p>The reviewers' comments are included below. In addition, the following points have been made by the Reviewing Editor and need to be addressed in any revision:</p><p>1) The optogenetic experiments require further information and important controls are missing. These include making injections that omit ChR2 from the viral construct to demonstrate the specificity of the effect; quantifying the co-localization of ChR2-mCherry and oxytocin expression in the PVN; providing more details about the overall duration over which optogenetic stimulation was delivered. How long do the behavioral changes last following optogenetic activation? This is particularly important if you wish to argue that abnormal social behavior can be rescued in this fashion, and relates to the concern raised by reviewer 1 about the permanence (or otherwise) of the effects of parental deprivation. Can the behavioral changes be rescued by providing PD voles with increased social interactions in later life? The optogenetic experiments would also be strengthened if the behavioral consequences of expressing an inhibitory opsin in the PVN-mPFC axons were measured.</p><p>2) The quality of the writing is poor and in places does not make sense. The meaningless expression 'socially mandarin vole' is still in the Abstract. The reference list is also incomplete.</p><p>3) There are many plots in which histograms with error bars are used; individual data points should be shown rather than error bars.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The authors have done some additional work and corrected some weaknesses but my initial concern was that the finding was predictable and so novelty is low. Understanding how parental deprivation impacts the oxytocin system on a permanent basis would be an advance. That advance is not made here.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The authors have addressed the majority of my comments to the extent that I now in opinion that the manuscript is suitable for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. In particular they have added new experiment showing to investigate the effect of pre-weaning PD on neuronal activities of PrL, NAc using anti-Fos staining as well as activity of OT neurons following exposure to a juvenile vole using double staining ot OT and c-Fos. They also added a rescue experiment showing that optogenetic activation of OT terminals in the mPFC decreased anxiety social preference and decreased anxiety-like behaviors that were induced by PD. The quality of the figure was also greatly improved.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.44026.029</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the first round of peer review follow.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The reviewers noted that this study addresses an interesting topic and agreed that Mandarin voles represent a good model for the investigation of paternal deprivation.

Most research in rodents has focused on the effects of early life stress using maternal separation from postnatal day (PND) 0 to 14. In contrast, the effects of paternal deprivation (PD) on adult behavior and brain are still poorly understood. The neural mechanisms underlying effects of disruption of the pre-weaning father-offspring attachment on offspring behavior remain elusive and circuit mechanisms are poorly understood. Our result revealed that pre-weaning PD increases anxiety and diminishes social preferences. The prelimbic cortex OT system may be involved in this process. For first time, we found that PD-induced anxiety-like behavior and social preference impairment could be rescued by optogenetics activation of the PVN-PrL OTergic fibers. Altogether, these results provide a new pathway via which PD possibly affects emotion and social behavior, and suggest a critical target for treatment of mental disorders associated with PD.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>What would be an advance would be some mechanistic insight into how oxytocin innervation is impacted by early life depravation of a parent.

We have clarified that in the figure captions “Effects of PLC OT administration on anxiety-like behavior and social preference of PD mandarin voles”.</p><p>[Editors' note: the author responses to the re-review follow.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Summary:</p><p>The reviewers agreed that the additional experiments carried out have strengthened this paper, overcoming several of the issues that were raised previously, as well as providing a more direct link between the effects of parental deprivation and activity in the projection from oxytocinergic PVN neurons to the mPFC. They differed, however, in their views about the significance of these findings.</p><p>The reviewers' comments are included below. In addition, the following points have been made by the Reviewing Editor and need to be addressed in any revision:</p><p>1) The optogenetic experiments require further information and important controls are missing. These include making injections that omit ChR2 from the viral construct to demonstrate the specificity of the effect; quantifying the co-localization of ChR2-mCherry and oxytocin expression in the PVN;</p></disp-quote><p>As reviewer suggested, more details about the optogenetic experiments were added to the Materials and methods and the Results. The viral construct that omits the ChR2 has been injected and specificity of the effects has been demonstrated.</p><p>ChR2-mCherry expression neurons coexpressed OT have been quantified and it is found that the majority of neurons were ChR2 and OT coexpressed. In male, percentage of ChR2 and OT coexpressed neuron in ChR2 is 60.6% (132/218, from 2 voles) and that in female is 70.9% (190/268, from 2 voles).</p><p>We have added data about colocalization of OT/mCherry of PD voles (Figure 7—figure supplement 3) and naive voles (Figure 8—figure supplement 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Providing more details about the overall duration over which optogenetic stimulation was delivered.</p></disp-quote><p>Detailed information has been added in the Materials and methods. During optogenetic experiments, the durations of optogenetic stimulation in both the social preference test and social memory were 10 min based on one previous study (Hung et al., 2017). Thus, subjects received about 25 minutes blue laser pulses during whole test phase.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>How long do the behavioral changes last following optogenetic activation?</p></disp-quote><p>Blue light photostimulation produced obvious changes in behavior and this change disappeared 8 hours after photostimulation in PD voles (Figure 7—figure supplement 4). The naïve voles still exhibited changes in anxiety-like behavior and decreased social preference (except male) 8 hours after yellow light illumination, the effect of yellow light stimulation disappeared within 8-24hours (Figure 8—figure supplement 2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>This is particularly important if you wish to argue that abnormal social behavior can be rescued in this fashion, and relates to the concern raised by reviewer 1 about the permanence (or otherwise) of the effects of parental deprivation.</p></disp-quote><p>We added the further discussion according to the reviewer’s suggestions.</p><p>“Changes in OT pathways induced by severe early life stress can be transmitted to the next generation (Toepfer et al., 2017). […] Thus, parental deprivation impacts the offspring oxytocin system on permanent basis.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Can the behavioral changes be rescued by providing PD voles with increased social interactions in later life?</p></disp-quote><p>Because amicable social interaction may increase release of oxytocin and change the OT system, and possibly rescue the behavioral changes induced by PD with involvement of OT system. It is good suggestion. We can test that in the future study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The optogenetic experiments would also be strengthened if the behavioral consequences of expressing an inhibitory opsin in the PVN-mPFC axons were measured.</p></disp-quote><p>As reviewer suggested, the naive voles were injected with virus with promotor gene of inhibitory opsin (rAAV-Ef1α-DIO-eNpHR3.0-mCherry+ rAAV-Oxytocin-Cre) or control virus (rAAV-Ef1α-DIO-mCherry+ rAAV-Oxytocin-Cre) into the bilaterally PVN. We also found that optogenetic inhibition of the PVN (OTergic)-PrL pathway impaired the social preference and increased levels of anxiety-like behavior in the naïve voles displaying the effects of preweaning PD (Figure 8).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The quality of the writing is poor and in places does not make sense. The meaningless expression 'socially mandarin vole' is still in the Abstract. The reference list is also incomplete.</p></disp-quote><p>As reviewer suggested, the manuscript has been edited by a native English editor. We have deleted “socially mandarin voles” in the Abstract and checked the reference one by one.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) There are many plots in which histograms with error bars are used; individual data points should be shown rather than error bars.</p></disp-quote><p>Based on the reviewer’s suggestion, we have added individual data points in histograms.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>The authors have done some additional work and corrected some weaknesses but my initial concern was that the finding was predictable and so novelty is low. Understanding how parental deprivation impacts the oxytocin system on a permanent basis would be an advance. That advance is not made here.</p></disp-quote><p>We added further discussion according to the reviewer’s suggestions.</p><p>“Changes in OT pathways induced by severe early life stress can be transmitted to the next generation (Toepfer et al., 2017).
