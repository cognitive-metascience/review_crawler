The accumulation of DNA damage during aging has been linked to altered cell cycle dynamics and the failure of cell cycle checkpoints. Here, we use single cell imaging to study the consequences of increased genomic instability during aging in budding yeast and identify striking age-associated genome missegregation events. This breakdown in mitotic fidelity results from the age-related activation of the DNA damage checkpoint and the resulting degradation of histone proteins. Disrupting the ability of cells to degrade histones in response to DNA damage increases replicative lifespan and reduces genomic missegregations. We present several lines of evidence supporting a model of antagonistic pleiotropy in the DNA damage response where histone degradation, and limited histone transcription are beneficial to respond rapidly to damage but reduce lifespan and genomic stability in the long term.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>aging</kwd><kwd>replicative lifespan</kwd><kwd>senescence</kwd><kwd>extrachromosomal rDNA circles</kwd><kwd>microfluidics</kwd><kwd>histones</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000049</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Aging</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32AG000057</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Crane</surname><given-names>Matt</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000049</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Aging</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AG056359</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kaeberlein</surname><given-names>Matt</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000049</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Aging</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P30AG013280</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kaeberlein</surname><given-names>Matt</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Activation of a DNA-damage cell cycle checkpoint during aging causes genome instability and senescence in yeast mother cells.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Each cell cycle involves a delicate choreography of duplicating genetic material and cellular organelles, with active mechanisms for apportioning them appropriately between mother and daughter cells. Failures of cell cycle regulation can result in severely compromised fitness or cells that respond improperly to environmental cues and emerge as cancerous precursors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hanahan and Weinberg, 2011</xref>). In particular, aneuploidy (the gain or loss of partial or whole chromosomes) can be deleterious to fitness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beach et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Sunshine et al., 2016</xref>) and has been implicated in many different types of cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gordon et al., 2012</xref>) as well as developmental diseases such as Down Syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Nagaoka et al., 2012</xref>). Recent work has also documented extensive damage and genomic rearrangements that can result following formation of micronuclei or from telomeric crisis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Maciejowski et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>), and identified the ribosomal DNA (rDNA) sequences as particularly vulnerable to genomic damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Flach et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Xu et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>All cells are constantly challenged by DNA damage, both from external environmental sources such as radiation and internal sources such as errors during replication. To cope with DNA damage, cells have robust surveillance mechanisms which arrest the cell cycle and promote repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Smith and Rothstein, 2017</xref>). Double-stranded breaks are a particular challenge to cells and multiple breaks will quickly result in cell death if not corrected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Mehta and Haber, 2014</xref>). The recognition of a double stranded break by the DNA damage checkpoint (DDC) is consistent across the cell cycle, but there are subtle differences between repair mechanisms depending on the cell cycle stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Shaltiel et al., 2015</xref>). Activation of the DDC by a double stranded break causes a host of changes to aid in DNA repair, including increased chromatin mobility as a result of histone degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dion et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hauer et al., 2017</xref>). Extended activation of the DDC, however, is detrimental to cells and has been linked to genomic instability and tetraploidization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Davoli et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Davoli and de Lange, 2012</xref>).</p><p>Genome instability is a hallmark of aging that occurs in many different species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">López-Otín et al., 2013</xref>). This increase in instability is characterized by elevated rates of DNA mutations, loss of silencing, transposon activation, double-stranded DNA breaks, and changes to telomere maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Sen et al., 2016</xref>). Furthermore, many progeric diseases which display apparent increases in the rate of aging are characterized by increased genomic damage and a reduced ability to repair DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Burtner and Kennedy, 2010</xref>). Chromosomal instability that results in aneuploidy is also common during aging and could predispose cells to oncogenic transformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Naylor and van Deursen, 2016</xref>).</p><p>Budding yeast has served as a powerful model for cellular aging by studying how individual cells change during both their replicative and chronological lifespans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Longo et al., 2012</xref>). Replicative lifespan is defined as the number of daughter cells produced by a mother cell prior to irreversible cell cycle arrest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Mortimer and Johnston, 1959</xref>). Several types of molecular damage have been associated with replicative aging in yeast mother cells, including mitochondrial dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Veatch et al., 2009</xref>), loss of vacuolar pH homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hughes and Gottschling, 2012</xref>), protein oxidation and misfolding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hanzén et al., 2016</xref>), and instability at the rDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ganley et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Sinclair and Guarente, 1997</xref>).</p><p>The rDNA, in particular, is a locus that experiences genome instability during replicative aging due to its makeup of 100–200 tandemly arrayed copies of an identical 9.1 kb repeat. These repeats are prone to recombination events that can lead to the formation of self-replicating, asymmetrically inherited extrachromosomal rDNA circles (ERCs), which accumulate in old mother cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Sinclair and Guarente, 1997</xref>). Recombination at the rDNA locus increases dramatically with age and has been strongly associated with loss of Sir2-dependent rDNA silencing and ERC accumulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Li et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Morlot et al., 2019</xref>). Whether ERCs directly cause replicative aging or simply reflect underlying rDNA instability, perhaps caused by transcription of non-coding sequences within the rDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Saka et al., 2013</xref>) or excess rRNA production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Morlot et al., 2019</xref>), remains a point of inquiry; however, reducing the formation of ERCs and enhancing rDNA stability through deletion of the gene encoding the replication fork block protein Fob1 is sufficient to increase lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Defossez et al., 1999</xref>). Overexpression of the sirtuin deacetylase Sir2, which also promotes rDNA stability and silences transcription within the rDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Saka et al., 2013</xref>), is similarly sufficient to increase lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kaeberlein et al., 1999</xref>), further supporting the model that rDNA instability contributes to replicative aging in yeast.</p><p>Beyond rDNA, the loss of genomic stability during yeast replicative aging results in altered cellular function with wide ranging consequences. Changes in silencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kaeberlein et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">McMurray and Gottschling, 2003</xref>) and alterations in nucleosome occupancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hendrickson et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hu et al., 2014</xref>) and chromatin remodelling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dang et al., 2014</xref>) are thought to underlie some of the large-scale changes in gene expression during aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Janssens et al., 2015</xref>). Among these changes in gene expression is a reduction in the levels of key homologous recombination proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Pal et al., 2018</xref>), however mutation accumulation does not appear to be a cause of replicative aging in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kaya et al., 2015</xref>). These prior studies have largely focused on cross-sectional, population-level dynamics of yeast aging. By using microfluidic tools to enable single cell, whole lifespan experiments, we have probed genomic instability over the entire lifespan of individual cells. This has revealed striking age-associated genomic instability that can result in the complete loss of genomic content in aging mother cells and is a direct consequence of how the DDC functions to ensure rapid repair of DNA damage.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Reversible genome missegregation is common during mother cell aging</title><p>In order to begin to understand the impact of aging on cell cycle dynamics and nuclear structure, we measured genome replication and partitioning throughout the mother cell’s replicative lifespan by imaging cells expressing fluorescently tagged histone 2B (Htb2:mCherry). To do this, we utilized a microfluidic device which retains mother cells for their entire lifespans while removing daughters via fluid flow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Crane et al., 2014</xref>). During each cell cycle, the amount of Htb2 in the mother cell nucleus increases during S-phase as histones are transcribed, and then drops as the cell enters mitosis and chromosomes are segregated to the newly formed daughter. The vast majority of cell divisions in young cells follow this characteristic pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). As cells age, however, abnormal segregation events become common (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Videos 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="video" rid="video4">4</xref>, please ensure volume is on for all video playback to hear audio explanation). The single cell trace shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, for example, shows a cell undergoing multiple cell cycles with proper division until an abnormal segregation occurs in which the majority of detectable histones are sent to the daughter cell. These genome-level missegregation (GLM) events result in cell cycle arrest that can range from a few minutes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>-top) to many hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>-middle), before they are usually corrected by returning the aberrantly segregated genetic material to the mother cell. If corrected, mother cells are able to proceed through subsequent divisions, but if not, the mother cells will terminally exit the cell cycle and senesce (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>-bottom).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.50778.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>During replicative aging cells frequently undergo dramatic genomic missegregation events.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic showing the process of a normal cell division where chromatin (red) doubles during S-phase and is divided between mother and daughter during mitosis.

The positive correlation indicates that prior events are predictive that cells will experience a GLM at a given age.

These periodic, elongated cell cycles have been long known to occur during replicative lifespan analysis by manual microdissection of yeast cells under a light microscope, often described in the literature as ‘symmetric divisions’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Jazwinski et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kennedy et al., 1994</xref>), but the underlying molecular mechanisms have been, until now, completely unknown. In our device, GLM dynamics were not influenced by the fluorophore used or which histone is tagged, as the dynamics of both Htb2:mCherry and histone 2A tagged with GFP (Hta2:GFP) did not differ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). GLM frequency is not an artifact of our imaging protocol, as modifying the fluorescence excitation power or the cumulative excitation energy had no effect on these observations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). GLMs are not caused by the tagging of histones, as imaging strains containing only GFP tagged microtubules showed similar GLM rates and age-related dynamics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). For clarity, the strain containing Htb2:mCherry is referred to as wild-type hereafter. To confirm that the histones do indeed co-localize with DNA during these events, we imaged old mothers and observed the dynamics of Htb2 in cells exposed to the DNA stain Hoechst 3342. As can be clearly seen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video5">Video 5</xref>), both the DNA and histones move in concert during these events.</p><media id="video5" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-50778-video5.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.50778.012</object-id><label>Video 5.</label><caption><title>DNA co-localizes with tagged histones through mitosis and during a GLM.</title><p>Cells expressing Htb2:mCherry were stained with Hoechst 3342, a live DNA stain.

Co-expression of Htb2:mCherry with Nup49:GFP allowed us to observe the nuclear periphery during GLM events, and compare normal divisions with GLMs that are either corrected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>-top, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>) or result in terminal GLMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>-bottom, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). The dynamics of the histone missegregation and recovery can be clearly seen in these time-lapse series, and strikingly the mother cells retain an intact nuclear envelope during these events – even when they appear to lose all of their chromatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Passage of the histones fully into the daughter cell is evident from cells co-expressing a bud neck marker (Myo1:GFP) along with Htb2:mCherry (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">Video 3</xref>). Interestingly, during these events, both spindle poles often fully enter the daughter rather than remain at the bud neck (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), as can be seen by following the spindle component Spc72 (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>). Spindle poles frequently move far away from the bud neck (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). In uncorrected, terminal GLMs, both spindle poles remained in the daughter cell during all observed events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>). This can also be observed in videos where tubulin is tagged with GFP (Tub1:GFP), and all of the detectable nuclear microtubules enter the daughter cell during GLMs (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video4">Video 4</xref>).</p><p>To quantitatively determine the frequency and penetrance of GLMs during aging, we imaged several hundred mother cells over their entire replicative lifespans, with birth events, GLMs and corrections manually annotated. When cells are young, they have a low probability of experiencing a GLM; however, approximately three quarters of mother cells experience one or more GLMs during their replicative lifespan. Furthermore, as cells approach the end of life, the probability of a GLM increases dramatically (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). The range of arrest durations is broad, with most events resolved within an hour, but some lasting many hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Interestingly, the duration of each event is not affected by the age of the mother cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). About 90% of GLMs are corrected successfully, allowing individual mother cells to live approximately 30% longer on average than if all GLMs were terminal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). However, even when corrected, mother cells that undergo a GLM are more likely to die in the near future than cells of the same age that have not experienced such an event, and GLMs become increasingly predictive of impending mortality with increasing age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). Similarly, cells that have undergone prior GLM events are more likely to undergo an additional event, indicating that there is a history dependence to GLM events and they do not occur in a completely stochastic manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). To determine whether changes in cell cycle time, specifically G1 duration, influenced or predicted GLM events, we imaged cells containing HTB2:mCherry and WHI5:GFP. Using the localization of Whi5 to the nucleus as a measure of G1 duration, we confirmed earlier reports that both G1 duration and the fraction of the cell cycle spent in G1 increases during aging. No difference in G1 duration, however, was identified between cell cycles that underwent GLMs and those that did not. The heterogeneity of age-associated mitotic breakdown at the single-cell level can be easily seen when observing the dynamics of all GLM events as a function of age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>rDNA instability is associated with, but not causal for, the age-related increase in genome missegregation</title><p>In order to confirm that individual chromosomes are segregated to daughter cells during GLMs, we directly imaged chromosome positioning in live cells by utilizing a system where TetO repeats are located near the centromere of each chromosome, and TetR:GFP is expressed in the same cell and binds to these repeats allowing visualization of chromosomes throughout the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Rohner et al., 2008</xref>).

The continued localization of Cdc14 to the nucleolus during a GLM event indicates that the FEAR network has yet to initiate anaphase, and Cdc14 activation by FEAR precedes the return of genomic material to the mother. By pooling and averaging cell cycles where mitosis occurs normally, the mother cell histone content can be seen to fall from 2N to 1N as Cdc14 exits the nucleolus following initiation of anaphase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>).

Only following Cdc14 release from the nucleolus does the chromatin exit from the daughter cell and return the mother to 1N (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>).

To further confirm the causal connection between activation of the DNA damage checkpoint and GLMs, we chemically induced DNA damage in a population of young cells using 500 µg/ml of zeocin.

Following administration of zeocin, young cells experienced a dramatic increase in GLMs compared with control cells that are not exposed to zeocin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Imaging of individual yeast cells through microfluidic trapping allowed us to observe GLMs that occur in most mother cells one or more times during their lives. These events are rare in young cells, are caused by activation of the DDC and the resulting histone degradation during metaphase, and are usually successfully resolved by retrograde transport of genomic material back to the mother cell through activation of the spindle positioning checkpoint. These observations demonstrate a dynamic and intricate set of checks and balances that act to maintain genomic integrity during cellular aging.</p><p>By providing insights into the dynamics of genomic instability during aging at the single cell level, the data presented here builds on and integrates a wealth of prior observations related to yeast aging which have generally been measured only at the population level. Genome instability, and rDNA instability in particular, has long been thought to be a major contributor to replicative aging in yeast. However, our data indicate that enhancing rDNA stability through deletion of <italic>FOB1</italic> only delays, but does not substantially alter, the prevalence of GLMs or the capacity for cells to appropriately resolve GLMs. This may reflect general genome instability arising from cascading failures during aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gottschling and Nyström, 2017</xref>). Loss of vacuolar pH has been identified as an early in life change that can result in a loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hughes and Gottschling, 2012</xref>), which in turn has been linked to increased genomic instability during aging, likely through altered iron-sulfur cluster production and the resulting DNA replication stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Veatch et al., 2009</xref>). This increased replication stress, when coupled with a loss of homologous recombination proteins with age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Pal et al., 2018</xref>), could result in the increased activation of the DDC we observe. Our data also illustrate how the previously observed decline in histone abundance during aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Feser et al., 2010</xref>) likely results from DDC activation in aged mother cells, and that this protective response, which is beneficial in young cells upon exposure to DNA damaging agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gunjan and Verreault, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hauer et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Liang et al., 2012</xref>), leads to elevated rates of genome missegregation in old cells which eventually causes terminal senescence and death.</p><p>Aging has been associated with an increased cell cycle time, and in particular an increased G1 duration. In stem cells, elongated G1 is linked to increased DNA replication stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Flach et al., 2014</xref>). In yeast it is thought to result from high levels of ERCs resulting in increased levels of the Rb analog Whi5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Neurohr et al., 2018</xref>). Intriguingly, reducing the G1 duration in yeast by overexpressing Cln2 fails to increase replicative lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Neurohr et al., 2018</xref>), but results in an improvement in single-strand annealing rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Young et al., 2019</xref>). An improvement in DNA repair efficiency might be assumed to result in a reduced frequency of GLM events. Surprisingly, however, at the single cell level we failed to find a connection between G1 duration and the occurrence of GLMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>). The G1 elongation that is a conserved hallmark of aging may serve a purpose in aged cells that has yet to be identified. For example, a short G1 phase imposes constitutive replication stress in cycling stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahuja et al., 2016</xref>). Similarly, a lengthened G1 in aging yeast could lead to improved loading of replication machinery and the improved origin firing duration may compensate for the reduced single-strand annealing.</p><p>The striking movements of the spindle pole bodies into the daughter cell during GLMs and then back to the mother cell during resolution further supports the idea that these events represent potentially catastrophic mitotic failures.

Thus, DDC-mediated histone degradation is likely to provide a selective benefit in young cells which may experience DNA damage due to environmental exposures, for example. However, activation of this response due to age-associated genomic instability becomes detrimental, and preventing histone degradation in response to DDC activation in aged cells both reduces GLMs and increases lifespan. This tradeoff explains the difference in lifespan that can be observed by affecting GLM rates in different ways. Reducing the ability of cells to sense DNA damage (<italic>rad9</italic>∆) reduces the frequency of GLMs, but the cells are unable to respond to the damage and thus die younger. Reducing GLMs by increasing the levels of histone transcription (<italic>hpc2</italic>∆) or reducing the ability of cells to degrade histones (<italic>tom1</italic>∆, <italic>ies4</italic>∆), however, increases the lifespan of cells as it reduces a negative consequence of DDC activation.</p><p>A decline in proteostasis, or the ability to ensure proper levels and folding of proteins, is one of the hallmarks of aging. In yeast, activation of the proteasome through increased expression of Rpn4 is sufficient to increase lifespan and enhance proteostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kruegel et al., 2011</xref>). It is interesting, therefore, that deletion of Tom1, which is involved in proteostatic networks including histone maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Singh et al., 2009</xref>) and ribosome quality control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Sung et al., 2016</xref>), is also sufficient to increase lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kruegel et al., 2011</xref>). This suggests a potential distinction between proteostatic processes that are helpful at all ages but decline in function with age (Rpn4/proteasome), and those that introduce tradeoffs between rapid growth in young cells and healthy aging (Tom1).</p><p>Single cell analyses like those described here begin to allow for an understanding of heterogeneity within aging populations. While most mother cells we observed experienced one or more GLMs, approximately 25% of wild type cells go their entire lives without a single event. This heterogeneity is under genetic control, as demonstrated by mutations that both increase and decrease GLM frequency and penetrance. Similarly, the likelihood that a GLM will be properly resolved in a given mother cell once it occurs also appears to be variable and under genetic control. Other recent studies have indicated that aging yeast cells can experience different trajectories or ‘modes’ of aging, as indicated by expression of reporter genes that differ within sub-populations of cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Crane and Kaeberlein, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Jin et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Li et al., 2019</xref>). This raises the interesting possibility that not all cells experience the same age-related genome instability, perhaps due to stochastic or inherited factors that influence early life cell fates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Li et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Morlot et al., 2019</xref>). Intriguingly, in the Jin, et al. study, they identified two aging paths and cells that died from the second path experienced a reduced mean lifespan, but a similar maximal lifespan to those that died from the first path. This is similar to our situation wherein the prevention of GLMs resulted in an increased mean lifespan, but similar maximal lifespan (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). We believe that there is likely to be significant overlap between the cells that follow the second aging path identified by Jin et al, and cells that undergo repeated GLMs. Similarly, GLM events do not occur in a completely stochastic fashion among all cells, as there is history dependence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). This suggests that GLM events could be linked to an underlying cellular state related to the occurrence of DNA damage or reduced repair ability. A powerful feature of microfluidic systems such as the one used here is the ability to resolve, in individual cells, age-associated phenotypes that have previously only been quantified at the population level and to study those phenomena continuously throughout life.</p><p>Although it remains unclear whether the specific mechanisms described here are shared during aging in multicellular eukaryotes, genome instability is one of the nine ‘Hallmarks of Aging’ which are broadly evolutionarily conserved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">López-Otín et al., 2013</xref>). Likewise, the DNA damage repair pathways and checkpoints are generally also broadly conserved in evolution, and defects in these processes are associated with a variety of progeroid syndromes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Burtner and Kennedy, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Lombard et al., 2005</xref>). Aneuploidy and other major chromosomal rearrangements are ubiquitous in age-related human cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Sansregret and Swanton, 2017</xref>), and there is accumulating evidence that rDNA is a key source of replication stress during aging across species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Flach et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Pal et al., 2018</xref>). The INO80 subfamily is highly conserved from yeast to humans at both the protein and network topology levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Sardiu et al., 2015</xref>), so our findings are likely to have broad relevance to aging. More generally, the antagonistic pleiotropy between rapid and efficient response to DNA damage during youth coming at the expense of age-related declines in function and disease has been proposed in mammalian aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Rodier et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Rufini et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, future studies in this area are likely to help us understand specific mechanisms of cellular and organismal aging and provide insights into age-related pathology which may uncover potential targets for intervention.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Yeast RLS microdissection</title><p>Microdissection experiments to determine replicative lifespans were done as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">McCormick et al., 2015</xref>).

The microfluidic device was composed of multiple chambers in the same fashion as (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Granados et al., 2017</xref>), which allowed individual genotypes to be exposed to identical environments and imaged in the same experiment while being physically isolated. Cells were loaded according to previously published methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Granados et al., 2017</xref>). A volumetric flow rate of 3–7 µL/min per chamber was used, with the flow rate starting low, and increasing during the experiment to improve mother cell retention and to ensure that cells do not aggregate, which can clog the device.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Microscopy</title><p>Cells were imaged using a Nikon TiE-2000 microscope with a 40X oil immersion objective with a 1.3 NA and using the Nikon Perfect Focus System. An enclosed incubation chamber was used to maintain a stable 30°C environment for the duration of the experiment. Two Aladdin syringe pumps were used for media flow. An LED illumination system (Excelitas 110-LED) was used to provide consistent excitation energies, and to minimize the exposure, illumination was triggered by the camera. Images were acquired using a Hamamatsu Orca Flash 4.0 V2. The microscope was controlled by custom software written in Matlab and Micromanager (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://bitbucket.org/matthew_crane/uscopecontrol">https://bitbucket.org/matthew_crane/uscopecontrol</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Crane, 2017</xref>).</p><p>Images were corrected for illumination artifacts in two stages. First, to correct for individual differences in the pixel biases, 1000 images were acquired with no illumination, and the individual pixel means were determined which was subtracted from each acquired image. Second, to correct for flatness of field, a fluorescent dye was added to a microfluidic device instead of using a slide with dye. Using a slide containing dye introduces a large amount of out-of-focus light, which results in an underestimation of the field curvature. In order to compensate for the microfluidic features, 1000 images were acquired each with a small offset in the x and y positions. Images were then dilated, and the median value at each location was used. Thus, for each image, the camera bias for that pixel was subtracted, and then it was multiplied by a flatness of field correction factor.</p><p>Images were acquired at 5 min intervals for bright-field and fluorescent channels. The fluorescence excitation power was set to 25% for all imaging except the GFP tagged histones, where it was set to 12%. Fluorescence and brightfield light were activated during image acquisition and all other lights in the room were turned off. For bright-field, 3 z-sections were acquired with 2.5 µm intervals, and exposure times of 30 ms were used for automated segmentation and tracking. For the fluorescent channels, 3 z-sections were acquired with 1.5 µm spacing. GFP images were acquired using a Chroma ET49002 filter set, and mCherry images were acquired using a Chroma ET49306. GFP images were acquired using exposure times of 60 ms for all proteins except Htb2 and Hta2 which were acquired using a 30 ms exposure time. mCherry images were acquired using a 60 ms exposure time. These imaging conditions were found to work as a reasonable compromise between the desire for frequent, dense imaging to enable identification of missegregations and retrograde transport, while also minimizing phototoxicity. We performed control experiments to verify that these exposure conditions did not affect the rates of genomic missegregation or replicative lifespan (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Each strain was imaged in multiple independent experimental runs, each with approximately equal numbers of cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Data processing and single cell scoring</title><p>Following data acquisition, cells were identified and tracked using previously published software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bakker et al., 2018</xref>). This identified the cell outline, and performed initial tracking of the cells through time. To ensure that only young, healthy cells were assessed, we only used cells that were identified in the first three hours of the experiment. Birth events for these cells were then manually scored, and any errors in tracking were corrected. This was all done using the bright-field images. Birth events were scored by multiple observers, and individual cells can be lost from traps prior to death. Data is presented either with or without censoring depending on what would be most appropriate. In the main text, plots aligned based on increasing age used all cells present at that age, even if they were later lost (censored) from the device. For plots aligned by death, only cells that had either died (visibly lost cell wall integrity) or senesced (failed to initiate a new cell division but did not visibly lose cell wall integrity during the experiment) were used. Because censoring in lifespan experiments relies on the assumption that losses are unbiased, we provide replicative lifespan curves both including and excluding censored cells for all strains. Censoring does not change the interpretation or statistical outcome of any of the experiments presented here.</p><p>Following annotation of birth events, the fluorescent channel containing the histones was used to observe the GLM dynamics. To ensure consistent scoring across experiments and eliminate bias, information about the experiments was masked from the scorer until after the data were evaluated. A correction event for a GLM was defined as where the histone fluorescence decreased in the daughter cell while simultaneously increasing in the mother cell. During cell cycles where cells had multiple GLMs during the same cell cycle, only the final event was scored. Events were scored as terminal GLM events if, prior to a correction, the daughter cell visibly separated from the mother cell (indicating cytokinesis) or if the mother died.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Fluorescence quantification</title><p>Quantification of the level of protein localized to the nucleolus (Cdc14) was done using a measure of how asymmetrically distributed the fluorescent signal was. Specifically, we used average brightness of the top 2% of pixels, divided by the cell median. By normalizing to median fluorescence, we corrected for any changes in fluorescence that could occur as a result of photobleaching. This method has been used previously as an accurate measure of the fraction of protein that is nuclear localized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cai et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Granados et al., 2017</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Yeast strains and growth</title><p>The GFP strains were all acquired from the yeast GFP collection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Huh et al., 2003</xref>).

Cells were grown overnight, and then diluted 1:200 in fresh media and grown for 5–6 hr. Prior to loading into the microfluidic device, 0.5 mL of SC 2% dextrose with 0.5% BSA was added to each 5 mL culture to prevent the cells from adhering to the PDMS during loading. During experiments, SC media with 2% dextrose and 0.1% BSA was used, and cells were imaged for 72 hr.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Error bars in the figures which contained bar plots were generated by bootstrapping with replacement, and then determining the 95% confidence intervals. Error bars in figures with line plots are standard error. Statistical significance for lifespan was determined using the log-rank test. Log-rank test was performed with, and without, censored cells that were lost prior to senescence or death. To compare distributions (such as numbers of GLM events over the lifespan), a two-tailed t-test assuming equal variance was used. Correlations between GLM events and remaining replicative lifespan were calculated with the Spearman correlation using the population of cells alive at each replicative age. Cochran’s q-test was used to determine whether there was an age-related increase in GLM rates for individual strains.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Differences between censored and uncensored survival data</title><p>Frequently in experiments or clinical studies that involve the generation of survival curves, some samples will be removed from the population under observation. For example, a patient may leave a study not because of death, but because they move to a different country. This can be treated in a relatively straightforward manner statistically by including these individuals in the analysis until the point that they are lost (or censored). This relies on the assumption that there is no bias in whether a sample is lost or retained. A recurring concern with microfluidic aging experiments involving yeast is whether there is a bias in how cells are lost or retained. This appears especially important when the mutation or transgene affects cell morphology or cell cycle, as this can result in a bias in which cells are lost from the traps. To reduce the likelihood that our observations were directly affected by loss rates, in the main text we have plotted all cells that were present at that replicative age for plots from birth. Thus, if a cell was lost at replicative age 20, it was included in the plots until age 19. For all plots that are aligned by death, only cells that die in the device are used. Given that this is an altered population distribution and smaller number of cells, these plots are slightly different, but they do not affect the conclusions. For bar charts showing the fraction of cells that die from a terminal missegregation, only cells that die in the device are included. For the survival curves in the main text that show individual cells and cell cycles that had a GLM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref> for example), only cells that die in the device are included. For replicative lifespans shown in the supplementary, we include survival curves with and without censored cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Aligning cells from birth or from death</title><p>Cells can be aligned either by birth (counting up from replicative age = 0), or by death (counting back from death). Either processing makes some assumptions about how similar cells are to one another. If cells are most similar to each other when they are born, aligning by birth makes sense, and as the replicative age increases, the number of samples decreases because cells are removed by death or senescence. In contrast, assuming that cells are similar at death implies that the phenotype of interest is most similar as cells approach death. For example, the average time cells take to proceed through each cell cycle increases geometrically when cells are aligned by birth, but exponentially when aligned by death. To demonstrate the increase in GLM rates as individual cells approach death, we align the cells by death in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. To show the increase in GLM rates during aging, cells are aligned by birth for the rest of the figures.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Effect of fluorophore and histone tagged to visualize chromatin</title><p>In order to determine the effect of tagging different histone proteins, we compared the effect of tagging different histone proteins, and compared the effects of using two different fluorophores (GFP and mCherry). Both of Hta2:GFP and Htb2:mCherry strains were found to have similar numbers of missegregation events during their lifetimes, and similar fractions of these events were corrected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Similarly, both the strain containing Hta2:GFP, and that containing Htb2:mCherry experience a similar increase in GLMs as they approach the end of their lives. The most notable distinction between the strains are the replicative lifespans, with Hta2:GFP experiencing what we consider to be a normal lifespan for the BY background (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). The strain with Htb2:mCherry, however, had a somewhat shorter lifespan (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Removing FOB1, however, results in an increase of the replicative lifespan of the Htb2:mCherry strain by ~30%, which is in line with results from literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">McCormick et al., 2015</xref>). Furthermore, the increase in replicative lifespan as a result of increased histone transcription has been less thoroughly studied, but our results are in line with those previously reported by another group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Feser et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kruegel et al., 2011</xref>). In order to determine whether the primary cause of the lifespan reduction in the Htb2:mCherry strain was the histone selected, or the fluorescent reporter, we also obtained lifespans for Htb2:GFP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Tagging Htb2 with GFP results in a lifespan that is statistically indistinguishable from the Hta2:GFP strain (p&gt;0.05 logrank test). Thus, although there is an unexpected reduction in lifespan for the Htb2:mCherry strain, we do not believe that it affects our results.</p><p>Likewise, we determined the correlation between missegregation events and remaining lifespan at the single cell level. The correlation is between the binary presence or absence of a missegregation event at a specific age, and the remaining lifespan. Strikingly, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>, for both strains, the correlation between missegregation events and remaining replicative lifespan is the same for both Htb2:mCherry and Hta2:GFP. This is in spite of the difference in absolute lifespan between the two strains.</p><p>Because GFP fluorescence is much more affected than mCherry fluorescence by changing pH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Shaner et al., 2005</xref>), and the pH of the cytoplasm in aging yeast has previously been shown to increase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Henderson et al., 2014</xref>), we chose to perform the majority of the experiments using mCherry. This ensured that any changes in pH homeostasis during aging would not affect our histone imaging.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would particularly like to thank S Biggins, B Brewer and M Raghuraman for constructive discussions.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Nan Hao as the Reviewing Editor and Jessica Tyler as the Senior Editor.

This is not the first study to do so, but it is the first one to carefully monitor the segregation of the genetic material from generation to generation. They make an interesting finding that aging cells undergo occasional chromatin missegregation events during cell cycle (defined as &quot;GLMs&quot;). They further show that the frequency of missegregation increases during aging and, by combining the histone reporter with other reporters and knockouts, they claim that age-associated DNA damage and activation of the DNA damage checkpoint (DDC) leads to a drop in histone levels, which in turn triggers missegregation of the entire nucleus. The reviewers think this paper is a significant advance for studying cellular aging and cell division, but also raise a number of concerns that must be adequately addressed before the paper can be accepted.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) It has been long observed that almost every aging cell undergoes late-life cell cycle extension. It seems that GLMs, which features abnormal segregation of whole chromosomes, only occur in a fraction of cells and can only account for a part of age-dependent cell cycle extension events. Related to that, while their data support a role for DNA damage, we are not sure that DNA damage may be the only way to get to GLMs. As they point out, GLMs were also reported in aging cells by Neurohr et al. But those authors invoked dysregulation of the G1/S transition in their model (i.e., much earlier in the cell cycle than the metaphase DDC). Likewise, some of the phenotypes the authors see (e.g., both SPBs moving in the daughter cell) have also been seen in nuclear positioning mutants, which starts in G1 and also involves cortical attachment processes, well before the metaphase DNA damage and spindle positioning checkpoints are engaged. Furthermore, in Figure 5, the same life-long reduction in GLMs is observed in <italic>ies4</italic>∆ and <italic>tom1</italic>∆ cells. It seems that there are multiple routes increasing GLMs, which may or may not depend on DDC. Finally, a recent Cell Reports paper argues that 'Cell-cycle regulation is involved in the age-associated DNA repair inefficiency' and points also to G1 length as a key determinant (Young et al., 2019). From their existing datasets, it may be informative to break down the duration of individual cell cycle phases and also measure nuclear positioning from G1 onwards, as the mother cells progress in the cell cycle. We request data re-analysis of cell cycle kinetics and careful discussions to clarify the relationship among DDC, GLMs and age-dependent cell cycle extension in general.</p><p>2) The authors claim that the activation of DDC causes GLMs. Could DDC activation in young cells also lead to GLMs, or some age-related factors are also required? We would request an experiment to induce DDC in young cells using chemical or radiation agents and observe whether GLMs will occur. This will help to establish the causality between DDC and GLMs, and to determine whether GLMs are a consequence of DDC, aging, or both.</p><p>3) We understand that the appearance and resolution of GLMs could be a determining factor of lifespan for some cells, but some of the data suggest that GLMs might not be a major driver of replicative potential in many cases. For example, the fraction of mothers with GLMs in two control experiments are identical (Figure 1—figure supplement 1B), yet the median/maximal RLSs appear quite different (Figure 1—figure supplements 1D and E). In addition, <italic>fob1</italic>∆ cells, which live longer than wt cells (on average), have slightly less GLMs than wt, but <italic>rad9</italic>∆ cells, which have almost no GLMs, are substantially shorter-lived than wt. Related to these, in Figure 1—figure supplement 4, the effect of GLM resolution is only evident for the median lifespan, and not at all for the maximal lifespan. It seems that whether the cells correct GLMs or not has no effect on the maximal lifespan. Typically, for interventions that strongly and significantly extend longevity (many of which discovered over the years by the authors), it is both the maximal and the median lifespan that are extended. Why isn't this the case here? We recommend that the authors include a discussion to clarify the conditions where GLMs may or may not be a major driver of RLS potential and modify/improve the model schematic in Figure 7 that is a little unclear.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.50778.032</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) It has been long observed that almost every aging cell undergoes late-life cell cycle extension.

The activation of the metaphase DDC is the dominant cause of the age-related increase in GLM events, but it is not necessarily the sole cause. When the DDC is compromised by removal of Rad9, the number of GLMs that occurs during aging is reduced by 95%, but not completely eliminated. Compromising the spindle assembly checkpoint (Figure 3—figure supplement 2), or spindle positioning checkpoint (Figure 7) failed to affect the age-related increase in GLM rates – which further suggests that activation of the DDC is the dominant cause of age-related GLMs. We believe that the reduction in GLM rates in both the <italic>ies4</italic>∆ and <italic>tom1</italic>∆ cells is a result of their roles in the DDC, and thus in the same dominant pathway.</p><p>We agree that changes to the G1 duration during aging could be critical to the cells ability to respond to DNA damage and the frequency of GLMs. To respond to this question raised by the reviewers, we have performed additional experiments and data analysis. Using a strain with WHI5:GFP (a yeast analog of Rb that helps determine the duration of G1) and Htb2:mCherry, we imaged cells during normal aging the microfluidic device, and then annotated birth events and GLMs. Using this data, and the Whi5 traces, we determined how the G1 duration changed during aging in wild-type cells, and whether cells that experienced GLMs had different G1 durations than those that did not. Given the link between extended G1 duration and reduced single strand annealing rates, we expected to find cell cycles that underwent GLMs longer G1 durations. As expected, we confirmed prior reports showing that the time spent in G1 increases in individual cells both in absolute terms, and as a fraction of the of the cell cycle. Importantly, however, we found no difference in the G1 duration between cell cycles where a cell underwent a GLM and cell cycles which proceeded normally.</p><p>This new data and analysis is included in Figure 1—figure supplement 5. A potential explanation is that although extended G1 durations reduce single strand annealing rates, that could be compensated for by increased MCM loading, and improved origin firing. This, or other beneficial aspects of extended G1 durations, may compensate and explain why we fail to identify a connection between G1 duration and GLM frequency. We include additional commentary on this in the revised Discussion. The relationship between cell cycle duration and age will continue to be an exciting area of research, but further work is beyond the scope of this paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors claim that the activation of DDC causes GLMs. Could DDC activation in young cells also lead to GLMs, or some age-related factors are also required?

We placed cells expressing Htb2:mCherry in the microfluidic device, and allowed them to grow and acclimate for 3 hours. Then the media was changed and cells were exposed to 500 µg/ml zeocin for 7 hours. Zeocin intercalates into DNA and causes double stranded breaks, and was used by the Gasser lab in their studies of histone degradation following DNA damage. We used dose of 500 µg/ml zeocin based on their work. During the 7 hours of exposure, cells were imaged every 5 minutes, and following the experiment GLMs were scored. The continuous exposure to zeocin resulted in a high rate of GLMs, with the average time to GLM being three hours following initial exposure. The number of GLMs was dramatically higher in the zeocin treated cells compared with the control cells.</p><p>We have included this new experiment and data in the revised version of the paper in Figure 3—figure supplement 1. This experiment reinforces the causal link between DNA damage and GLMs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) We understand that the appearance and resolution of GLMs could be a determining factor of lifespan for some cells, but some of the data suggest that GLMs might not be a major driver of replicative potential in many cases. For example, the fraction of mothers with GLMs in two control experiments are identical (Figure 1—figure supplement 1B), yet the median/maximal RLSs appear quite different (Figure 1—figure supplements 1D and E). In addition, fob1∆ cells, which live longer than wt cells (on average), have slightly less GLMs than wt, but rad9∆ cells, which have almost no GLMs, are substantially shorter-lived than wt. Related to these, in Figure 1—figure supplement 4, the effect of GLM resolution is only evident for the median lifespan, and not at all for the maximal lifespan.

We address each of the points in detail below.</p><p>With regard to the <italic>control experiments</italic>, and the frequency of GLMs. Comparing the Hta2:GFP, Htb2:GFP and Htb2:mCherry tagged strains, there is a difference in lifespan, in that the GFP tagged strains live consistently longer than the mCherry tagged strain; however, the total fraction of cells that experience GLMs, appears equal between the strains (Figure 1—figure supplement 1B). On average, however, the total number of GLMs experienced by the shorter lived mCherry strain is higher (Figure 1—figure supplement 1C). The GLMs do occur in close proximity to the end of life in both GFP and mCherry strains (Figure 1—figure supplement 1A).</p><p>With regards to the <italic>reduced GLM rate in rad9∆ cells</italic>. The extended activation of the DDC can be deleterious and result in GLMs and terminal missegregations wherein the mother cell loses its genome and terminally senesce. Activation of the DDC when DNA damage has occurred, however, is necessary for a full lifespan. A simple analogy to DDC activation would be hospital visits. We want to decrease hospital visits (extended DDC activation that results in GLMs) by improving care, not by removing hospitals (<italic>rad9</italic>∆ cells). In the case of <italic>fob1</italic>∆, <italic>hpc2</italic>∆, <italic>tom1</italic>∆ and <italic>ies4</italic>∆ cells, the DDC is still capable of activating if/when necessary – it simply isn’t required to activate for extended periods of time. The reduced ability of the DDC to activate in the presence of DNA damage in <italic>rad9</italic>∆ cells results in an increased mortality rate.</p><p>With regards to the <italic>increased median lifespan, but unchanged maximal lifespan</italic> in Figure 1—figure supplement 4. This is an extremely interesting point the reviewers raise, and one which we believe deserves additional scrutiny in the future. Recently several labs have demonstrated population heterogeneity in aging trajectories at the single cell level in yeast. With a single isogenic population, the individual cells may die from different physiological failures. In the recently published Jin et al., 2019 paper cells that died from the second aging trajectory had a reduced mean lifespan, but identical maximal lifespan. Thus, similar to our analysis of GLMs, shifting cells from aging path 2 to aging path 1 in Jin et al. would increase the mean lifespan, but not change the maximal lifespan. We believe that there is going to be significant overlap between the cells that experience GLMs, and the aging trajectories identified by Jin et al. We have modified the Discussion to include commentary on this likely relationship.</p></body></sub-article></article>
