PMS is a relatively common monogenic and highly penetrant cause of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and intellectual disability (ID), and frequently presents with attention deficits. The underlying neurobiology of PMS is not fully known and pharmacological treatments for core symptoms do not exist. Here, we report the production and characterization of a <italic>Shank3</italic>-deficient rat model of PMS, with a genetic alteration similar to a human SHANK3 mutation. We show that <italic>Shank3</italic>-deficient rats exhibit impaired long-term social recognition memory and attention, and reduced synaptic plasticity in the hippocampal-medial prefrontal cortex pathway. These deficits were attenuated with oxytocin treatment. The effect of oxytocin on reversing non-social attention deficits is a particularly novel finding, and the results implicate an oxytocinergic contribution in this genetically defined subtype of ASD and ID, suggesting an individualized therapeutic approach for PMS.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.18904.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.18904.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18904.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Phelan-McDermid syndrome is a genetic disorder on the autism spectrum that affects how children develop in several ways, with additional symptoms including attention deficits, delays in learning to speak and motor problems. This syndrome is known to be caused by changes in a single gene known as SHANK3 that disrupt communication between brain cells involved in memory and learning. However, we do not know how these changes relate to the symptoms of Phelan-McDermid syndrome.</p><p>To understand how genetic changes affect the human brain, researchers often carry out experiments in rats or other small rodents because they have brains that are similar to ours. Harony-Nicolas et al. genetically modified rats to carry changes in the SHANK3 gene that reflect those found in people with Phelan-McDermid syndrome. The rats had disabilities related to those seen in Phelan-McDermid syndrome, including limits in long-term social memory and reduced attention span. They also showed changes in the connections between important parts of the brain. Therefore, studying these rats could help us to understand the link between molecular and cellular changes in the brain and how they affect people with Phelan-McDermid syndrome, and associated symptoms.</p><p>Previous studies have shown that a chemical called oxytocin, which is naturally produced by the brain, helps to form bonds between individuals and can cause positive feelings in relation to certain memories. Harony-Nicolas et al. found treating the rats with oxytocin boosted social memory and led to improvements in other symptoms of Phelan-McDermid syndrome. In particular, oxytocin treatment helped to increase the attention span of the rats.</p><p>Rats with changes in the SHANK3 gene will be a useful tool for future research into Phelan-McDermid syndrome, particularly in understanding how it affects the connections between brain cells, leading to the symptoms of Phelan-McDermid syndrome. A future challenge will be to find out whether oxytocin has the potential to be developed into a therapy to treat Phelan-McDermid syndrome in humans. Since there is evidence that SHANK3 is involved in other forms of autism, these rats will also be useful in understanding the other ways in which autism can develop.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link

McDermid syndrome (PMS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by intellectual disability (ID), absent or delayed speech, neonatal hypotonia, attention deficits and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The neurobehavioral manifestations of PMS are caused by heterozygous mutations/deletions in the <italic>SHANK3</italic> gene leading to a reduced expression of the SHANK3 protein. Shank3 is a key structural component of the glutamatergic postsynaptic density (PSD), and interacts with glutamate receptors and cytoskeletal elements to regulate glutamate signaling and synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kreienkamp, 2008</xref>). It has been estimated that more than 80% of individuals with PMS meet ASD diagnostic criteria and that ~0.5–1% of ASD cases, 1–2% of ID cases, and up to 2% of cases with both ASD and ID harbor a <italic>SHANK3</italic> mutation, which makes it one of the more common single locus causes of ASD and ID (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gong et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Soorya et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Leblond et al., 2014</xref>). Despite its prevalence, PMS is less well studied than other single locus genetic disorders such as Fragile X or Rett syndromes. To date, no pharmaceutical compounds targeting core symptoms of PMS are available. To address this lack of effective therapeutics, several mouse lines with distinct <italic>Shank3</italic> gene mutations have been developed to help understand the neurobiology of the syndrome and as a means of ultimately developing and assessing potential therapeutics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bozdagi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Peça et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Yang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kouser et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kloth et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bidinosti et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mei et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wang et al., 2016</xref>). The various <italic>Shank3</italic>-deficient mouse models have displayed PMS and ASD-related behavioral phenotypes including impaired social behavior, increased repetitive behaviors, and motor deficits, as well as altered synaptic transmission and neuronal morphology in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bozdagi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Peça et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Yang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kouser et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Drapeau et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wang et al., 2016</xref>). Recently, the translational relevance of these mouse models has been highlighted by our observation that the hormone IGF-1 improves motor and synaptic deficits observed in a <italic>Shank3</italic>-deficient mouse line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bozdagi et al., 2013</xref>), a result which directly led to a safety and preliminary efficacy clinical trial of IGF-1 in children with PMS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kolevzon, 2014a</xref>).</p><p>Here, we report the generation and characterization of the <italic>Shank3</italic>-deficient rat, representing a novel genetic model of PMS, which demonstrates clear PMS-related behavioral and electrophysiological phenotypes that can be ameliorated by intracerebroventricular (ICV) oxytocin administration.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Production and developmental phenotyping of the Shank3-deficient rat model</title><p>Founder <italic>Shank3</italic>-deficient rats were generated using zinc-finger nucleases (ZFN) technology, targeting exon 6 of the ankyrin repeat domain. This domain was targeted because five patients had been described with mutations in it (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Durand et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Moessner et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hamdan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boccuto et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Yuen et al., 2015</xref>). Interestingly, the predicted truncated protein generated upon ZFN targeting of the rat <italic>Shank3</italic> gene is quite similar to one of the human mutations that have been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hamdan et al., 2011</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, middle sequence). In rat, this mutation leads to a significant reduction in the number of <italic>Shank3</italic> transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>) and reduces expression levels of the full-length Shank3a protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). We also observed that the levels of the PSD scaffolding protein Homer1 are decreased in the <italic>Shank3</italic>-deficient rats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>), consistent with changes in the PSD and with well-replicated findings from <italic>Shank3</italic>-deficient mice. We noted that, at weaning, there was a modest reduction in the number of homozygous knockout (KO) animals from Heterozygous (Het) x Het matings, compared to expectation (292:555:200, corresponding to ratios of 0.53:1:0.36).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18904.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Gene-targeting of the rat <italic>Shank3</italic> gene.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The top schematic shows the Shank3 protein domains [ankyrin repeats domain (ANK), a Src homology 3 (SH3) domain, a PDZ domain, and a sterile α-motif (SAM) domain] and indicates the published de novo mutations observed within the ANK domain in PMS patients (light blue text, top schematic) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Durand et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Moessner et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hamdan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boccuto et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Yuen et al., 2015</xref>). The 68 bp deletion that we introduced in exon 6 of the <italic>Shank3</italic> rat gene (middle schematic) produces a stop codon in exon six that truncates the Shank3 protein.

To assess short-term SRM, the SD test was performed 30 min after the subject encountered the familiar rat for 5 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), while, in the more challenging long-term SRM, which requires longer exposure to the social stimulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gur et al., 2014</xref>), the same test was performed 24 hr after a 1 hr encounter with the familiar rats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).

In our genetically modified rat model of PMS, we found that <italic>Shank</italic>3 deficiency impairs social memory and attention. These impairments are accompanied by attenuated synaptic plasticity within the hippocampus and in the monosynaptic pathway connecting the hippocampus to the PFC. Hippocampal synaptic plasticity deficits have also been reported in <italic>Shank3</italic>-mouse models and were associated with impairments in actin cytoskeleton remodeling and with changes in the levels of glutamatergic receptors and other PSD scaffolding components including Homer, which we also found to be decreased in the <italic>Shank3</italic>-deficient rat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bozdagi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Duffney et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kouser et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wang et al., 2016</xref>). The fact that long-term social memory was selectively impaired, in contrast to more general memory processes, may reflect the complexity of the information involved in social memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adolphs, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wiley, 2013</xref>), which may require more elaborate synaptic mechanisms than simpler forms of memory. These results may also relate to previous findings that correlate ASD-associated episodic memory deficits with the complexity of the memoranda (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lind, 2010</xref>), which suggests that sub-optimal thresholds for synaptic plasticity interfere with the ability of complex stimuli, such as social stimuli, to activate memory formation. Deficits in attentionally demanding tasks, like the 5-CSRT task, may also result from blunted synaptic plasticity, where brief events must be rapidly encoded and reliably stored by neural circuits to promote appropriate and timely behavior.</p><p>It is interesting, and important, to compare findings in different rodent models of PMS and relate them to symptoms observed in patients. In particular, while there is some overlap between the social communicative deficits observed in PMS and those observed in what is considered more classical autism, there are important differences. In contrast to the more typical conception of ASD (whether accurate or not), PMS-associated ASD is <italic>not</italic> associated with a social aversion or lack of social approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Soorya et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kolevzon, 2014b</xref>). A recent study of functional neuroimaging showed that differential fMRI changes in response to social versus non-social sounds are preserved in PMS, in contrast to studies of idiopathic autism (iASD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wang et al., 2016</xref>). These findings, together with the fact that not all individuals with PMS are diagnosed with ASD, indicate that animal models for PMS should not necessarily present with social behavioral deficits and imply that behavioral phenotypic diversity in PMS patients may reflect additional processes.</p><p>This may explain some of the discrepancies that have been reported across distinct <italic>Shank3</italic>-mouse models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Harony-Nicolas et al., 2015</xref>), and those that we report here in the <italic>Shank3</italic>-deficient rat. These discrepancies could be attributed to (1) mutations/deletions in existing rodent models were targeted to different parts of the <italic>Shank3</italic> gene, (2) varying genetic background, (3) different behavioral paradigms, (4) varying age and sex, (5) a focus on heterozygotes or knockouts, or other factors. Beyond these methodological issues, from an evolutionary perspective, mice and rats are separated by millions of years, which likely explain many of the observed discrepancies in behavioral repertoires between the two species. Just as mice and rats differ, so do mice and rats greatly differ from human, and thus one should be careful not to overly anthropomorphize these model systems or look for perfect overlap across species.</p><p>Further investigation of the mechanisms underlying synaptic plasticity deficits and the molecular pathways affected by <italic>Shank3</italic> mutation and the consequent synaptic changes in rat and mouse <italic>Shank3</italic> models will likely provide new targets for therapeutic treatments and allow comparison between two different species, thus providing more reliable molecular targets for future drug development studies. Although all the mutations that have been studied, including the one we introduced to the rat model, lead to the deletion of the longest <italic>Shank3</italic> isoform, most leave intact other shorter isoforms, whose role is still unclear. Because many patients lack the entire <italic>SHANK3</italic> gene, understanding the role of different Shank3 isoforms is of great interest, and contrasting existing rodent models will be useful in clarifying this important question.</p><p>To date, treatment strategies for PMS are non-specific and do not address key issues of cognition, language, motor development, etc. There are approaches that are applied in PMS that are adopted from the general population. For example, when ASD is present, one might make use of behavioral interventions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kolevzon et al., 2014b</xref>), but these strategies need to be improved and designed for the specific needs of PMS patients. Recently, the field has begun to translate basic neurobiological findings gleaned from rodent models into promising pharmacological treatments for a host of genetic disorders such as Fragile X syndrome, Tuberous sclerosis, Rett syndrome, and PMS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bear et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ehninger and Silva, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tropea et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kolevzon et al., 2014a</xref>).</p><p>The peptide oxytocin is a powerful regulator of mammalian social behavior, which has been shown to improve various aspects of social cognition and social behavior in human and non-human primates, by increasing social memory, enhancing social reward, and modulating social attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Guastella et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Parr et al., 2016</xref>). Oxytocin has been also studied in clinical trials as a potential therapeutic for iASD-associated social impairments, yet these efforts have led to equivocal results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Guastella et al., 2016</xref>). Hitherto, the effect of oxytocin has not been investigated in PMS or in animal models of PMS, and its effect on non-social ASD and PMS-associated deficits has not been evaluated. Given the evidence for a key role for oxytocin in SRM, we tested this compound and observed important effects on both behavioral and electrophysiological deficits. Interestingly, an ameliorative effect of oxytocin treatment on autism-like behaviors has recently been reported in other genetically defined mouse models of ASD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tyzio et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Peñagarikano et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Our results show, for the first time to our knowledge, a beneficial effect of oxytocin on attention to non-social stimuli. Social and attention deficits are often co-morbid in PMS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Soorya et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kolevzon, 2014b</xref>), which is perhaps reflective of a shared etiology and may explain why oxytocin improved both deficit types in <italic>Shank</italic>3 deficient rats. The ameliorative effect of oxytocin treatment on the long-term social memory, attention and synaptic plasticity deficits in <italic>Shank3</italic>-deficient rats, support a mechanism whereby deficits in synaptic plasticity across hippocampal-prefrontal circuitry may underly the behavioral deficits we observed. These results also imply that exogenous oxytocin administration might have therapeutic potential in human PMS patients.</p><p>In our view, genetically modified rat models are especially valuable for behavioral and functional studies. They have several species-specific advantages over mouse models, including a more complex behavioral repertoire and larger brains that readily facilitate high-density electrophysiological recordings. Moreover, rats remain the primary choice of the pharmaceutical industry for studying the pharmacokinetic properties of novel drugs that may have therapeutic potential in human. Our production of a <italic>Shank3</italic>-deficient rat model, which demonstrates both construct and face validity, will pave the way for future studies that investigate the mode by which <italic>Shank3</italic> mutations alter brain activity during behavior and to further study the effects of oxytocin and other potential therapeutics for PMS. Our findings open new avenues of research to study the effect of <italic>Shank3</italic>-deficiency on the development and function of oxytocin neurons. Future studies should investigate if <italic>Shank3</italic>-deficiency affects hypothalamic processes that regulate oxytocin production and secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Brownstein et al., 1980</xref>) or whether it perturbs pathways further downstream. Additionally, it would be important to determine if oxytocin treatments during critical developmental windows could ameliorate PMS-associated behavioral deficits, and whether other forms of ASD, defined either etiologically or by the presence of specific biomarkers, may show such broad response to oxytocin. These, and other experiments, would support the use of oxytocinergic agonists for multiple forms of ASD, including additional genetically defined forms of ASD.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Generation of Shank3-deficient rats</title><p><italic>Shank3</italic>-deficient rats were generated using zinc-finger nucleases (ZFN) on the outbred Sprague-Dawley background.

The total amount of time that the subjects spent investigating the social and non-social stimuli was measured by an experienced observer who was blind to genotype and the results are show in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6-4"><title>Juvenile social play</title><p>Social play behavior, in WT and <italic>Shank3</italic>-KO rats, was measured at 26–30 days of age, in a manner similar to what has been previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hamilton et al., 2014</xref>). Briefly, after weaning at 21 days of age, rats were pair-housed. Prior to the juvenile social play test each rat was individually habituated to the test cage for 10 min for three consecutive days. After this third habituation session, rats were socially isolated for 24 hr before the juvenile social play test began. On test days, two non-littermate rats, of the same gender, were placed into the 45×45 × 40 cm test arena for 10 min. The play partner was always a WT rat with no more than 10 g difference in body weight when compared to the test subject. The behavior of the animals was videotaped and analyzed post hoc using video tracking software (Ethovision XT, Noldus). Several aspects of social play were assessed, including approaching, chasing, crawling, nape attacking, pinning, and boxing of the conspecific rat. Other forms of social, but non-play behaviors, were also measured such as licking, grooming, and body or anogenital sniffing of the play partner. Approaching was included in both play and non-play social behaviors as it cannot be considered solely as part of the play sequelae. Behaviors were scored independently by two trained observers who were blind to the test animal’s genotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6-5"><title>Habituation-dishabituation social recognition memory</title><p>The habituation-dishabituation social recognition memory test was also carried out as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Spiteri and Agmo, 2009</xref>), but with several modifications. Briefly, following 1 hr habituation to the experimental cage (60 × 40 × 20 cm), 9–11 week old male test rats were exposed for 5 min to the same social stimulus over four consecutive sessions separated by intervals of 30 min. In a fifth session they were exposed to a novel social stimulus of a different strain. In each session, the duration of investigation was measured, including any contact between the subject’s nose and the juvenile’s body or any other investigatory behavior displayed by the adult subject was measured by a trained observer, who was blind to genotype. Juveniles (3 week old , 30–35 g) male Wistar-Hanover or Wistar-Hola rats were used as social stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6-6"><title>Long- and short-term social discrimination tests</title><p>Long- and short-term social discrimination tests were performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gur et al., 2014</xref>). Briefly, in the long-term SRM, the test rat (9–11 week old) was unrestrictedly exposed to a novel juvenile (3 week old, 30–35 g) of a different strain (Wistar Hannover/Hola) for 1 hr in an experimental cage (60 × 40 × 20 cm). The test rat was placed alone, 24 hr later, in the same test cage, but which now contained two transparent plastic corrals (9 cm in diameter). These corrals contain five horizontal slots per side (1 × 13 cm each), which allow physical contact between test subjects and rats that are subsequently placed in the corrals. After a 1 hr habituation period to the plastic corrals inserted in the chamber, the test animal was simultaneously exposed to the same juvenile that it encountered the day before and to a novel juvenile of a different strain for 5 min. In this encounter, each of the juvenile rats was confined to one of the two transparent plastic corrals. The duration of investigatory behavior of the adult test subject toward each juvenile was measured as previously described (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gur et al., 2014</xref>). The short-term social memory test, was carried out similarly to the long-term social discrimination test except for three differences: (1) the time between the first and second encounter was 30 min (compared to 24 hr in the long-term social discrimination test), (2) the test rat was habituated to the corrals for 1 hr before the first encounter (instead of the second encounter) to prevent the novelty of the environment from interfering with the expression of social behaviors, and (3) The first encounter was conducted for 5 min while the juvenile was held in one of the corrals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Investigation time was scored by an experienced observer who was blind to genotype.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6-7"><title>Object location memory</title><p>Test rats (9–11 week old) were placed for 1 hr in a chamber (60 × 40 × 20 cm), which contained two identical LEGOs. The locations of the LEGOs were fixed by being firmly magnetized to the chamber. The same animals were placed 24 hr later in the same chamber for 1 hr for habituation and then exposed for 5 min to the same LEGOs they encountered the day before. However, during this session the location of one of the LEGOs was different than during the first session. The duration of investigatory behavior toward each of the LEGOs was measured, including any contact between the subject’s nose and the object or any intended touch of the object by the adult test subject (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). These subject-object interactions were scored by an experienced observer who was blind to genotype.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6-8"><title>Contextual fear memory</title><p>The contextual fear memory test was carried out as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kritman and Maroun, 2013</xref>). Briefly, adult rats (9–11 week old) were placed in fear conditioning chambers (Panlab, Harvard Apparatus; Holliston, MA), which are outfitted with electrified ﬂoor-grids, black methacrylate walls, and a transparent front door. On conditioning days, the rats received three 0.5 s foot-shocks delivered through the grid at an intensity of 0.8 mA. The three shocks were administered 90, 210, and 330 s after the subjects were placed in the chamber. After delivery of the third shock, freezing behavior was measured for 2 min to evaluate the success of the fear conditioning protocol. 24 hr after fear conditioning, the rats were placed in the same chamber for 5 min without being subjected to foot-shock. Freezing behavior during a 5 min test period was quantiﬁed offline, averaged and presented as a percentage of the total session time spent freezing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Testing and quantification were performed by an examiner blind to subject genotype.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6-9"><title>5-Choice serial reaction time (5-CSRT) task</title><p>Eight-week-old rats were habituated to being handled by the experimenter and were food deprived to achieve ~85% of free feeding weight. 5-CSRT task training occurred in a manner similar to what has previously been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mar et al., 2013</xref>). Briefly, rats were trained to touch the location of an illuminated white square that is presented at 1 of 5 locations on a Bussey-Saksida capacitive touchscreen system (Lafayette Instrument Company; Lafayette, IN, USA). If a capacitive screen touch occurred at the illuminated location during or up to 1 s after stimulus presentation a sugar pellet was delivered in the reward receptacle located across the chamber from the touch screen. Training occurred in stages where the duration of the light stimulus was slowly decreased from 32 to 1 s by halving the stimulus duration across sessions once criterion performance was met (~80% accuracy and less than 20% of trials omitted). 4 WT, 5 Het, and 3 KO rats were unable to reach performance criterion at 1 s and therefore were excluded from analysis of 5-CSRT task performances. Analysis of these data was performed with custom routines written in the R statistical programming environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">R Development Core Team, 2006</xref>) and the results are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>.

The brain was removed and quickly placed in ice-cold cutting solution containing the following (in mM): 215 sucrose, 20 glucose, 26 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 4 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 4 MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 1.6 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 1 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, and 2.5 KCl. Hippocampi were mounted on an agar block, and transverse slices 400 μm thick were prepared with a DTK-2000 microslicer (Dosaka EM). Slices were placed in a hot water bath at 30°C, in a holding chamber containing 50% cutting solution and 50% artificial CSF (ACSF) recording solution, which contained the following (in mM): 124 NaCl, 26 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 10 glucose, 2.5 KCl, 1 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 2.5 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, and 1.3 MgSO<sub>4</sub>. After 30 min, the 1:1 solution was switched to ACSF at 30°C and the holding chamber was removed from the water bath. Slices recovered in ACSF at room temperature for at least 1 hr, and then were transferred to a submersion-type, temperature-controlled recording chamber (TC-344B, Warner Instruments) and perfused with ACSF at 2 ml/min using a peristaltic pump (Dynamax RP-1, Rainin). Experiments were performed at 28°C. All solutions were equilibrated for at least 30 min with 95% O<sub>2</sub> and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, pH 7.4. Conventional field recordings were performed using a MultiClamp 700B amplifier (Molecular Devices). For field experiments, a recording electrode fabricated on a two-step micropipette puller (PP-830 or PC-10, Narishige) filled with a solution containing 5 M NaCl. This electrode was placed ∼150 μm deep in the stratum radiatum. To elicit synaptic responses, paired, monopolar square-wave voltage or current pulses (100–200 µs pulse width) were delivered through a stimulus isolator (Isoflex, AMPI) connected to a broken tip (∼20–40 μm) stimulating patch-type micropipette filled with ACSF. In some experiments, a bipolar stimulating electrode was used. As both stimulations produced comparable results, the results were averaged together in the final analysis. Typically, stimulating electrodes were placed in the middle of CA1 stratum radiatum. Stimulus intensity was adjusted to give comparable magnitude synaptic responses across experiments (∼1 mV for extracellular field recordings). Baseline stimulation was delivered at 0.1 Hz, before and after the induction of long-term plasticity. All neurophysiological data were acquired and analyzed blind to genotype.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7-2"><title>Extracellular recordings</title><p>Hippocampal slices (350 µm, Cohort 1; 400 µm, cohort 2) were prepared from 4-6 week old (cohort 1) and 6-8 week old (cohort 2) Het and KO rats and their wild-type littermate controls. As previously described, stimulation electrodes were placed in CA3 of stratum radiatum and field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) were recorded from CA1 of stratum radiatum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bozdagi et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Klein et al., 2015</xref>). Test stimulus intensity was adjusted to obtain fEPSPs with amplitudes that were one-half of the maximal response. The EPSP initial slope (mV/ms) was determined from the average waveform of four consecutive responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Paired-pulse responses were measured with inter-stimulus interval (ISI) of 50 ms, and are expressed as the ratio of the average responses to the second stimulation pulse (FP2) to the first stimulation pulse (FP1) (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Long-term potentiation (LTP) was induced by either a high-frequency stimulus (four trains of 100 Hz, 1 s stimulation separated by 5 min, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) or a single 100 Hz stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>) .

For the 5-CSRT task, surgery occurred after baseline performance was measured for 10 sessions (after criterion performance was first met on with a 1 s cue duration). For surgery, rats were deeply anesthetized by subcutaneous injection of 10% ketamine (0.09 ml/100 g) and Dormitor (0.05 ml/100 g) or with isoflurane. Anesthetized animals were fixed in a stereotaxic apparatus with the head flat, and a small hole was drilled in the skull to facilitate implantation of guide cannula. The cannula was inserted 0.1 mm (SRM task) or 1.25 mm (5-CSRT task) above the left lateral ventricle. The coordinates were AP = −1 mm, ML = 1.5 mm, DV = −3.6 mm (SRM experiments) or AP = −0.75 mm, ML = 1.75 mm, DV = −4 mm (5-CSRT task) both targeting the left lateral ventricle. Cannula were secured in position with acrylic dental cement and stabilized by at least two bone screws. A dummy cannula was placed in the guide cannula to prevent the tube from clogging. Antibiotics (amoxicilin 15%, 0.07 ml/100 g) and a pain killer (Calmagin 0.03 ml/100 g) were administered directly before and immediately following surgery and one day post-surgery. Animals were allowed to recover for at least 7 days before experimentation began. Post-surgery, 5-CSRT task rats were retrained to stable performance before being subjected to microinjections. In the oxytocin 5-CSRT experiments, two implanted KOs, 1 Het and WT were not subjected to microinjections because they failed to achive pre-surgery performance levels. In the long-term SRM task, 1 WT and 2 KOs lost their caps, 1 Het and 1 KO died during surgery, and 1 Het was extremely stressed and thus was not subjected to oxytocin injection.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior Editor and three reviewers, one of whom, Peggy Mason (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and another one is Karen Bales (Reviewer #2).</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Obtaining mechanistic insight into autism and related conditions through the analysis of rodent models of this disease is of major importance. Thus, the topic of this manuscript, that the <italic>Shank3</italic>-KO rat is a model of PMS, is of great interest and timeliness. Unfortunately, the reviewers were not convinced that the <italic>Shank3</italic> rat has face validity with PMS. The deficits that were explored appear to be in memory and possibly perception more so than in social behavior. Additional concerns that we hope will aid the authors are detailed in the reviews appended below.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>This manuscript shows that oxytocin ameliorates several of the differences between <italic>Shank3</italic>-Het and KO rats and WT rats. Several issues concern this reviewer.</p><p>The short-term vs. long-term SD tasks are termed in a confusing or even misleading fashion. In the short-term SD, rats interact for 5 mins and then are tested 30 mins later. In the long-term SD, they interact for 60 mins and then are tested a day later. Which of the changes is relevant – the time of exposure or the interval before testing? And which change – both of which lengthen – does the short vs. long refer to? This is not a trivial point as the Het/KO rats are fine at the short-term and not at the long-term. And this is interpreted as a difference in memory. It could be due to a difference in exploration or perception.</p><p>The perception vs. memory difference is potentially important. The fact that they do better after a 5 s light CSRT than a 1 s one suggests that there may be a deficit in perception. 1 s is too short for them to interpret correctly. In the last paragraph of the subsection “Social memory and attentional deficits in <italic>Shank3</italic>-deficient rats”, it is unclear how this result is interpreted as it is lumped with an unrelated finding that speaks to the motivation for food reward.</p><p>The object location task is not exactly parallel to the SD task. Location rather than identity is tested. Why? Why not make the tasks entirely parallel?</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>. Is there enough power (6 rats per genotype) to say that there is no difference? Of note the rank order is WT&gt; Het&gt; KO for both NMDA and AMPA. In contrast it looks as though the n per group for LTP is as much as 60 (6 rats and 10 slices /rat). The actual number of data points in 4B should be stated.</p><p>How are the numbers of rats tested determined? E.g. for the oxt studies with CSRT, 15 HETs and 8 KOs were studied. Of concern was that the numbers were not pre-set.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>This paper behaviorally and neurobiologically characterizes the <italic>Shank3</italic> rat, as a model for autism, and examines the effects of oxytocin administration on the behaviors. In addition, it examines LTP in hippocampal slices in the <italic>Shank3</italic> rat and shows that oxytocin restores normal LTP in vitro. This paper makes a large contribution to the literature on oxytocin through its thorough behavioral characterization and also in that it showed a neural mechanism for oxytocin to ameliorate behavioral deficits.</p><p>I have two large concerns:</p><p>Whereas the main therapeutic use for oxytocin in humans is via intranasal administration, in this study it was via intracerebroventricular administration. This is not clear unless you look at the methods. Please modify the Results/Discussion to indicate this mode of administration, and that results might differ from intranasal administration.</p><p>Also:</p><p>The Methods say that the EPM was performed (subsection “Elevated plus maze”), but I could not find these results in the text.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>In this manuscript Harony-Nicolas et al. describe the successful generation of <italic>Shank3</italic>-deficient rats, modeling the Phelan-McDermid syndrome (PMS) in humans. They report that these rats show several behavioral impairments related to social memory and attention that are associated with PMS, and then go on to show that electrophysiological phenotypes in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex are present in these rats that may serve as potential mechanisms for the observed behavioral deficits. These phenotypes were reversed by in vitro or in vivo administration of oxytocin. These novel findings are of high interest to the field as using rats as model organisms for ASD could be beneficial for translating potential treatment options. However, there is a disconnect between the presented findings and the authors' claims that these rats serve as an animal model of ASD – these rats do not show any of the core behavioral symptoms of ASD (repetitive behavior, social interaction deficits, etc.). The phenotypes are more related to learning and memory, which are affected in patients with <italic>Shank3</italic> mutations. Thus, the title and Abstract are misleading. Overall, a more transparent and accurate assessment of the Results is necessary, rather than trying to fit this model into the &quot;ASD box. &quot; In fact, it is quite interesting that these animals do not mirror the mouse models, and do not have behavioral manifestations expected in a model of ASD, but rather a model of ID.</p><p>1) The title of the paper suggests that these rats display &quot;social deficits&quot; – this should be changed to &quot;memory deficits&quot; since these rats do not appear to have a generalized social deficit. This is a general theme throughout the paper that needs to be seriously addressed</p><p>2) Many of the behavioral phenotypes exhibited by several types of <italic>Shank3</italic>-deficient mouse models of ASD, for example elevated anxiety, repetitive behavior, reduced social interest (e.g. Peca et al., 2011 Nature; Mei et al., 2016 Nature; Wang et al., 2016 Nat. comm.) are not seen in these <italic>Shank3</italic>-deficient rats. Do these rats develop compensatory mechanisms that protect from these behavioral phenotypes associated with ASD? Does the function of corticostriatal circuits remain intact?</p><p>3) The presented dataset suggests that there is a specific impairment in hippocampal synaptic plasticity, and not areas involved in social cognition, such as frontal lobe – at the same time object location memory remains intact in the rats. Are other hippocampal plasticity-dependent tasks impaired in these mice? Given the uncertainty as to which circuits are involved, this needs to be presented clearly.</p><p>4) We have no real insight into mechanisms, which is the reason to use the model system. What are the mechanisms of impaired LTP in the hippocampus? Are there postsynaptic components, as expected from <italic>Shank3</italic>'s role as a postsynaptic protein?</p><p>5) The recovery of behavioral impairments by i.c.v. oxytocin is an exciting finding. However, the authors have not addressed which receptor type, expressed in which brain region(s), is responsible. Oxytocin can activate both vasopressin and oxytocin receptors, and these receptors are widely expressed throughout the brain. Since the authors have shown that the synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus is impaired whereas it remains intact in the PFC, oxytocin is presumably acting on the hippocampus to recover the attentional deficits and memory. Is there any experimental evidence to support this?</p><p>Again, social memory and attention while sometimes disrupted in ASD are not core features of ASD. The hippocampal deficits that are suggested here speak more to learning and memory and therefore, ID, in humans.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what now follows is the decision letter after the authors submitted for further consideration.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Oxytocin improves behavioral and electrophysiological deficits in a novel <italic>Shank3</italic>-deficient rat&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

The authors say that the samples were largely constrained by the 25-50-25 inheritance pattern of WT-Hets-KOs. Yet the samples don't show this 25-50-25 distribution. They are very close to 1:1:1 overall. In the early tests – where mortality does not figure and where the distribution should be closer to Mendelian – the rats are at 9-15-12 which is a ratio of 0.6-1-0.8. However, in the core social memory tests (conducted later) the distributions are 12-13-9, 22-20-11, 9-17-14, 31-37-25, averaging 0.9-1-0.7. Then in the oxytocin rescue experiments (which are if anything more time consuming and subject to loss), the ratio is again very close to 1:1:1.</p><p>These ratios close to one are not easy to understand and are not explained by the authors' letter. The reason that this is important is because of the need to set sample size targets for behavioral tests prior to conducting the tests in order to avoid unconscious bias to creep into the experiment.</p><p>It might be of help to discuss how many animals in each pool and of each type were lost to surgery or some other fatality.</p><p>Was the person conducting the e-phys blind to the rat's genotype?

It could be due to a difference in exploration or perception.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewer for raising this point. To avoid further confusion, we have now clarified in the Results section that the long- and short-term refer to the interval between exposures and not the exposure time (subsection “Social memory and attentional deficits in <italic>Shank3</italic>-deficient rats”, second paragraph). This is in addition to the diagrams that we included in the original manuscript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2A and 2B</xref>), which outlined the method schematically (including showing the timing of the exposure and the interval), and the Methods section that detailed both paradigms.</p><p>We understand the reviewer’s concern and agree that, under certain circumstances (that we don't think apply here) the difference in the time spent with the social stimuli may introduce confounds that relate to exploration or perception. However, this would only be of concern if the rats showed deficits in their short-term social recognition memory (with the short interaction time) while showing intact long-term social recognition memory (with the longer interaction time). The opposite is true. The <italic>Shank3</italic> HET and KO rats show intact short-term memory on the short-term social discrimination test even with a short exploration time, indicating that their social exploration or perception is not affected. And they show an impaired behavior on the long-term social discrimination test thus suggesting that their long-term memory is affected, even when given enough time (1 hour) for exploration. Furthermore, the possibility of differences in exploration is addressed by the similarity in total exploration time between the genotypes and in their social preference. We have now added and discussed these points in the Results section (subsection “Social memory and attentional deficits in <italic>Shank3</italic>-deficient rats”, second paragraph).</p><p>Finally, it is noteworthy to mention that it is a common procedure in memory studies that a weaker stimulus is used to induce short-term memory, while a stronger stimulus are used (and often required)to produce long-term memory. As an example is the low and high doses of LiCl used in the conditioned taste aversion paradigm (Houpt&amp;Berlin 1999, PMID:<underline>10355522</underline>). This, in fact, correlates with LTP procedures where short-term LTP can be achieved with one train of tetanic stimulation while long- term LTP requires several such trains. The idea behind using distinct procedures in our experiments is to apply a minimal exposure that generates a stable memory, so if indeed any of the genotypes exhibit impaired social memory it will be easily detected on the background of such a minimal procedure. For short-term memory, exposure of 5 minutes is enough, and hence used here, while a much longer exposure (1 h in our hands) is needed for long-term SRM (in rats).</p><p><italic>The perception vs. memory difference is potentially important. The fact that they do better after a 5 s light CSRT than a 1 s one suggests that there may be a deficit in perception. 1 s is too short for them to interpret correctly. In the last paragraph of the subsection “Social memory and attentional deficits in Shank3-deficient rats”, it is unclear how this result is interpreted as it is lumped with an unrelated finding that speaks to the motivation for food reward.</italic> </p><p>We understand the concern of the reviewer and agree that changes in accuracy can be conceived as reflecting deficits in sensory perception, specifically those related to basic visual sensory function. However, it is important to note that the pattern of deficit we observe, and which is evoked by only changing the stimulus duration, is commonly interpreted as reflecting an attentional deficit, while deficits observed by changing the physical qualities of the light(brightness or illuminance) are those that reflect perceptual differences (Reviewed by Robbins TW, 2002, PMID: 12373437). In our experiment we used the same light stimulus in all sessions and found that the rats have no problem in seeing and responding to the light, implying that they have no issues with their sensory perception. We also did a decreased brightness challenge in one of the rat cohorts and did not observe any effect on performance, which further argues against the observed primary deficit being due to perceptual problems. Only when the duration of the light was shortened, the deficits were evoked and the rats had difficulties in detecting a more briefly presented light, indicating that the <italic>Shank3</italic> Het and KO rats have difficulty in vigilance or spatial attention. We have now clarified this point in the Results section (subsection “Social memory and attentional deficits in <italic>Shank3</italic>-deficient rats”, last paragraph).</p><p>We have edited the sentence that the reviewer refers to (in the original file) to clarify this point, and want to note that the sentence that follows (“These deficits were not due to decreased motivation for food reward, because latency to collect reward after a correct response was similar among genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>), as was task performance when light cues were of a longer duration” is not unrelated, but rather is important because the observed attentional findings could be also related to motivational problem, which we rule out by examining the latency of the rats to collect reward, which we found to be unaffected in the <italic>Shank3</italic>-deficient rats.</p><p>Finally, as a side comment, we want to note that the reviewer’s comments: “The fact that they do better after a 5 s light CSRT than a 1 s one suggests that there may be a deficit in perception”, if thought about more generally, supports the second point we raised for the previous comment and emphasizes the notion that perception would be an issue if the rats perform worse on shorter stimuli vs. longer ones on the social recognition memory test and not vice versa.</p><p><italic>The object location task is not exactly parallel to the SD task. Location rather than identity is tested. Why? Why not make the tasks entirely parallel?</italic> </p><p>The idea behind testing the <italic>Shank3</italic> rats on the object location memory and the contextual fear conditioning tests was not to examine a paradigm that is exactly parallel to social discrimination. Instead, the aim was to examine whether the observed deficits in social recognition memory are specific to social stimuli or that the <italic>Shank3</italic> rats have a general memory deficit. Obviously, the first choice one would think about to test non- social memory is the novel object recognition test, given the fact that it technicallyseems to be the best to parallel the social discrimination test that we applied. However, the reason we focused on the object location memory and contextual fear conditioning tests in our study is because social recognition memory is well known to be hippocampal- dependent and our findings demonstrate that the <italic>Shank3</italic> rat model has hippocampal LTP deficits. Therefore, we aimed to examine other hippocampal-dependent memory paradigms. Both the object location and the fear conditioning tests are known to be hippocampal dependent, while the dependence of the object location memory test on the hippocampus is not clear (see for example Gaskin et al. 2003, PMID: 14750658). Since the object location memory and the contextual fear conditioning tests differ in their mode (the fear-conditioning task is a reinforcement-driven task while the object location memory test depends on the animal’s natural exploratory tendency when introduced in a new stimulus or stimulating environment), we decided to include both. We have further clarified this point in the Results section (subsection “Social memory and attentional deficits in <italic>Shank3</italic>-deficient rats”, third paragraph).</p><p><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>. Is there enough power (6 rats per genotype) to say that there is no difference? Of note the rank order is WT&gt; Het&gt; KO for both NMDA and AMPA. In contrast it looks as though the n per group for LTP is as much as 60 (6 rats and 10 slices /rat). The actual number of data points in 4B should be stated.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewer for raising this point and agree that we are underpowered to exclude a real change in I/O function for NMDA. We estimate that we need 15 data points to say that reliably. We have therefore removed this figure and repeated the I/O function assessment in an independent set of experiments on WT and KO rats, focusing on overall I/O and using larger n (n=5 rats per genotype/3 slices per rat). This data is now presented as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>, and shows no significant differences in I/O function between genotypes. Understanding subtle impact of <italic>Shank3</italic> deficiency on multiple aspects of synaptic function (including AMPA and NMDA receptors) is an important study that will require multiple different approaches and analyses. Altogether, the data suggest that change in I/O function is not likely to explain the clear LTP changes.</p><p>We apologize for the typographical error in the number of animals used for LTP recording. The correct numbers were n=6 rats/1-2 slices per rat. Those numbers have been corrected in the legend of the figure and in the supplementary file (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>).</p><p><italic>How are the numbers of rats tested determined? E.g. for the oxt studies with CSRT, 15 Hets and 8 KOs were studied. Of concern was that the numbers were not pre-set.</italic> </p><p>The sample size was chosen based on the standards in the field and using on-line sample size/power calculation tools. Specifically, we followed the recommendation for the “Minimum Numbers of Mice” discussed by Professor Jacqueline N. Crawley, in her book entitled “What’s Wrong With My Mouse”, Second Edition and applied the “biomath” online tool; (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://biomath.info/power/">http://biomath.info/power/</ext-link>) for targeted calculations. Following the book’s recommendation, we determined our minimal N following <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 13.1</xref> (contributed by Professor Douglas Wahlsten) in the above-mentioned book, which describes the number of animal/per group needed to obtain specific statistical power. In general, our N for behavioral studies ranged between 9-22, therefore we were 60-80% powered to detect large effect differences (δ=1 – 1.5). As noted, we also calculated the numbers for each experiment based on its design using the “biomath” online tool. For example, for the social discrimination test, we applied a paired t-test between the novel and familiar stimuli to determine SRM (this was also applied for the Oxt treatment experiments). Since in normal conditions rats spend on average at least 60% of their total investigation time exploring the novel stimulus, with SD of 12%, a sample size of n=6 is calculated for 80% power and confidence interval of 5%. However, we always try to double this sample size so we aim for 12 animals per group, beyond the predicted sample size. This was important because, in some cases, we lost some animals during the experiment, leaving us with 7-8 animals, which is still beyond the predicted sample size. Information about the exact N and statistical method used for each experiment were detailed in the supplementary file (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>).</p><p>We understand the question of the reviewer regarding the variability of the N between the different genotypes. In all our studies we use offspring of Het x Het breeding. This is to be able to study littermates, which is optimal when carrying out behavioral studies. The fact that the numbers varied between the genotypes is hence primarily because HET x HET breeding produces a distribution of 25% WTs, 25% KOs and 50% HETs. Therefore, for each WT and KO rats we have two HET littermates that we could use and include in our data, when available, without invalidating our experiment and analysis. The 5-CSRTT requires at least two months of training after which we do surgeries to inject the OXT (in the case of the 5-CSRTT-OXT experiment). During this period and the surgeries, there is always a chance of losing one or two animals, which cannot be replaced, together with its littermates, before 4 additional months (breeding, reaching the age of testing and then training). Therefore, we tried to include as many of the available rats as possible, given the limited number of testing chambers, even if this means that we will not start or end with precisely equal numbers of animals.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p><italic>This paper behaviorally and neurobiologically characterizes the Shank3 rat, as a model for autism, and examines the effects of oxytocin administration on the behaviors. In addition, it examines LTP in hippocampal slices in the Shank3 rat and shows that oxytocin restores normal LTP in vitro. This paper makes a large contribution to the literature on oxytocin through its thorough behavioral characterization and also in that it showed a neural mechanism for oxytocin to ameliorate behavioral deficits.</italic> </p><p><italic>I have two large concerns:</italic> </p><p><italic>Whereas the main therapeutic use for oxytocin in humans is via intranasal administration, in this study it was via intracerebroventricular administration. This is not clear unless you look at the methods. Please modify the Results/Discussion to indicate this mode of administration, and that results might differ from intranasal administration.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewer for raising this point and agree that this is an important issue that should be discussed and clarified in the manuscript. We agree with the reviewer that it is totally possible that when ICV injected, the effect of oxytocin may be different than when it is intranasally administered. This is mainly due to the fact that the percentage of oxytocin that reaches the brain following intranasal administration (using tolerable concentrations) is extremely small making the brain oxytocin concentration following intranasal administration incomparable to those detected following direct ICV injection into the brain. This reality implies that the delivery approach of oxytocin to the brain should be improved to allow better comparison between direct and indirect administrations in animal studies and to optimize treatment efficacy in human subjects. We have now added a paragraph to address this issue in the Discussion section (eighth paragraph).</p><p><italic>Also:</italic> </p><p><italic>The Methods say that the EPM was performed (subsection “Elevated plus maze”), but I could not find these results in the text.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out that EPM results were missing in the text. The approach was indeed discussed in the Methods section, and the results and statistical analysis were included in the supplementary file, but not in the main text. We have now added this information to the Results section (subsection “Production and developmental phenotyping of the <italic>Shank3</italic>-deficient rat model”, last paragraph).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p><italic>In this manuscript Harony-Nicolas et al. describe the successful generation of Shank3-deficient rats, modeling the Phelan-McDermid syndrome (PMS) in humans. They report that these rats show several behavioral impairments related to social memory and attention that are associated with PMS, and then go on to show that electrophysiological phenotypes in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex are present in these rats that may serve as potential mechanisms for the observed behavioral deficits. These phenotypes were reversed by in vitro or in vivo administration of oxytocin. These novel findings are of high interest to the field as using rats as model organisms for ASD could be beneficial for translating potential treatment options. However, there is a disconnect between the presented findings and the authors' claims that these rats serve as an animal model of ASD – these rats do not show any of the core behavioral symptoms of ASD (repetitive behavior, social interaction deficits, etc.). The phenotypes are more related to learning and memory, which are affected in patients with Shank3 mutations. Thus, the title and Abstract are misleading. Overall, a more transparent and accurate assessment of the Results is necessary, rather than trying to fit this model into the &quot;ASD box. &quot; In fact, it is quite interesting that these animals do not mirror the mouse models, and do not have behavioral manifestations expected in a model of ASD, but rather a model of ID.</italic> </p><p>We appreciate and respect the reviewer’s point of view and agree that the phenotypes observed in the <italic>Shank3</italic> rat model may relate more to those affected in patients with PMS and have changed the title and text accordingly.However, we still believe that the <italic>Shank3</italic> rat is a valid model for important aspects of ASD, as mutations in this gene are associated with such high risk for ASD. As we and others have shown, not all patients with PMS have ASD, so there is no reason to expect that a specific rodent model will show ASD (see Soorya et al. 2013, PMID23758760). We added a paragraph that discusses this issue in the Discussion section (second paragraph).</p><p>But the broader point is that it has become quite clear that there are many ways to have a deficit in reciprocal social interactions and hence meet criteria in ASD, that have little to do with social aversion or lack of social approach. The simplest example is William Syndrome, known for hypersociability, where some 50 percent of individuals meet criteria for autism. They show excessive social approach but they are not able to carry out ‘typical’ reciprocal social interactions.</p><p>In the specific case of PMS, in our recent functional neuroimaging study we show quite clearly that differential fMRI changes in response to social versus non-social sounds are <italic>preserved</italic> in PMS (see Wang et al. 2016, PMID: 26909118), a difference that is absent in other studies of idiopathic autism. In addition, we show that social orientating is preserved in PMS, again, something reduced in studies of idiopathic autism. For this reason, others and we conclude that PMS-associated ASD is <italic>not</italic> associated with a social indifference or social aversion, in contrast to the more typical conception of ASD. In addition, we conclude that the primary, and most significant and pervasive deficits in PMS are cognitive and attentional, rather than social. And there is little doubt that there will be many subtypes of autism with preserved social interest. Hence we would argue that this is a good model for PMS and a reasonable model for some subtypes of ASD. However, as noted above, we have made the requested changes (Abstract; Introduction; Discussion, second paragraph).</p><p><italic>1) The title of the paper suggests that these rats display &quot;social deficits&quot; – this should be changed to &quot;memory deficits&quot; since these rats do not appear to have a generalized social deficit. This is a general theme throughout the paper that needs to be seriously addressed</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewer and have now changed the titleto better reflect the findings. However, we did not use the term “memory deficits” as suggested by reviewer. This is because we believe this would be misleading given the fact that the <italic>Shank3</italic>- deficient rats showed no deficit on two non-social long-term memory paradigms, the object location memory and contextual fear conditioning tests, and that their deficits are only on tasks that implicate social-dependent memory. Therefore, in the same way that the reviewer emphasizes that the social deficits cannot be generalized, we believe that the observed memory (social memory) deficits cannot be generalized as well.</p><p><italic>2) Many of the behavioral phenotypes exhibited by several types of Shank3-deficient mouse models of ASD, for example elevated anxiety, repetitive behavior, reduced social interest (e.g. Peca et al., 2011 Nature; Mei et al., 2016 Nature; Wang et al., 2016 Nat. comm.) are not seen in these Shank3-deficient rats. Do these rats develop compensatory mechanisms that protect from these behavioral phenotypes associated with ASD? Does the function of corticostriatal circuits remain intact?</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewer that the <italic>Shank3</italic> rat model does not display all of the phenotypes observed in various <italic>Shank3</italic>-mouse models, and we thank the reviewer for raising this issue, and helping us realize the importance of discussing it in the paper. We have now included a brief discussion about this issue in the Discussion section (third paragraph).</p><p>Finding discrepancies between the rat and mouse models is not totally surprising since such discrepancies have been already reported even between Shank3 mouse models. We have previously summarized these discrepancies in detail (Harony-Nicolas et al., 2015; PMID: 26350728), including discrepancies in reported alterations in motor function, anxiety levels, social preference, interest for social novelty, and ultrasonic vocalizations, which exemplify how difficult it is to draw a unifying phenotype when dealing with different models even of the same species.</p><p>These discrepancies within the mice models and between the mice and rat model could be attributed to:</p><p>1) The fact that different models have mutations/deletions in different parts of the Shank3 gene. Although all mutations lead to the deletion of the longest <italic>Shank3</italic> isoform, each leaves behind other shorter isoforms. The role of these shorter <italic>Shank3</italic> isoforms is not clear. They can potentially play a compensatory and protective role or, contrary; increase the deleterious effect of the introduced mutation leading to the manifestation of different phenotypes in each model.</p><p>2) The use of different behavioral paradigms to assess what is identified as the same behavior.</p><p>3) The age of the tested animal on each paradigm.</p><p>4) The sex of the tested animals.</p><p>5) Genetic differences in background strains used in the mice.</p><p>Some of the findings in mice are made in homozygous but not heterozygous animals. Moreover, mice and rats are separated by 12-25 million years in evolution and differ in complex behaviors, thus generating different outcomes in behavioral paradigms. Whether we want to relate these different outcomes to compensatory mechanisms or to an added complexity in cognition and behavior, it is an open argument.</p><p>Finally, based on our findings showing that the <italic>Shank3</italic>-deficient rats do not exhibit motor deficits or show any impulsive behavior on the 5-CSRT test, we did not have a strong rationale to focus on the corticostriatal circuits in the current study. We chose to study the plasticity in the hippocampus and the hippocampal-PFC circuit because of their <italic>direct</italic> relevance to the observed attentional and social recognition memory deficits. However, one cannot exclude the possibility that other brain circuits are affected by the <italic>Shank3</italic> mutation, especially corticostriatal circuits, which have been shown to be impaired by <italic>Shank3</italic> mutation in the mouse. Therefore, we agree with the reviewer that the integrity of other circuits should be examined as well in the frame of future studies.</p><p><italic>3) The presented dataset suggests that there is a specific impairment in hippocampal synaptic plasticity, and not areas involved in social cognition, such as frontal lobe – at the same time object location memory remains intact in the rats. Are other hippocampal plasticity-dependent tasks impaired in these mice? Given the uncertainty as to which circuits are involved, this needs to be presented clearly.</italic> </p><p>As we have previously noted in our response to comment 3 of reviewer #1 and to our response to this reviewer for comment 1, we have examined two well-known hippocampal-dependent long-term memory paradigms, the object location memory and contextual fear conditioning tests. None of these tests showed a significant difference between genotypes. The fact that socialrecognition memory, which is well known to be hippocampal-dependent, was affected in the <italic>Shank3</italic> rat model, while two other non- socialhippocampal-dependent memories were not, suggests that (1) the memory deficits are social specific and (2) social recognition memory is a more &quot;frangible&quot; type of memory that implicates more complex cues as compared to the non-social memory tested by us. Therefore, when the hippocampal circuitry is even partially impaired, the social recognition memory may be more vulnerable and more affected than other types of memory. Another possibility is that the PFC impairment is the most severe in our study and that this region is needed only for social memory.</p><p><italic>4) We have no real insight into mechanisms, which is the reason to use the model system. What are the mechanisms of impaired LTP in the hippocampus? Are there postsynaptic components, as expected from Shank3's role as a postsynaptic protein?</italic> </p><p>We indeed use animal models to gain insight into underlying mechanism, and we do that with the ultimate goal of using them for drug discovery and for the evaluation of novel and existing (FDA approved) drugs. While understanding the mechanisms underlying the LTP deficits is highly important and would shed light on affected mechanisms or pathways that can be of interest for drug discovery, the focus of the current study was on producing, validating and studying a novel rat model and to see whether some deficits could be reversed. This latter study made use of an already existing and safe clinical compound, oxytocin, to ameliorate impaired behaviors. But the choice of oxytocin arose from the specific deficits we observed (in which oxytocin has a very direct role).</p><p>As noted by the reviewer and as expected from the role of <italic>Shank3</italic> at the postsynapse, other postsynaptic components are likely to be affected by <italic>Shank3</italic>- deficiency. Indeed, findings from <italic>Shank3</italic>-mouse models support this notion and show changes in the levels of other PSD scaffolding components, subunits of glutamatergic receptors, as well as deficits in the synaptic actin cytoskeleton remodeling system, which is well associated with synaptic plasticity. Amongst the most reliable and reproducible findings from <italic>Shank3</italic> mouse models is the decrease in the levels of Homer, a scaffolding protein that interacts with <italic>Shank3</italic> at the PSD. In the <italic>Shank3</italic>-deficient rat model, we also found a significant decrease in Homer, in KO rat PFC samples, which validates the mouse models findings. We have added this finding to the Results section (subsection “Production and developmental phenotyping of the <italic>Shank3</italic>-deficient rat model”, first paragraph), Discussion, and to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> legend.</p><p>We have recently obtained preliminary data (not discussed in this paper) suggesting changes in the actin cytoskeleton components, similar to those reported in the <italic>Shank3</italic>-mouse models. While valuable, these findings are not informative by themselves and require further investigation to examine how such baseline changescontribute to the observed synaptic plasticitydeficits, so to be able to infer the direct relationship between both. This will be done by studying the dynamics of these and other synaptic components before and after in-vitro or in-vivo synaptic stimulation, and which is beyond the scope if the current study.</p><p><italic>5) The recovery of behavioral impairments by i.c.v. oxytocin is an exciting finding. However, the authors have not addressed which receptor type, expressed in which brain region(s), is responsible. Oxytocin can activate both vasopressin and oxytocin receptors, and these receptors are widely expressed throughout the brain. Since the authors have shown that the synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus is impaired whereas it remains intact in the PFC, oxytocin is presumably acting on the hippocampus to recover the attentional deficits and memory. Is there any experimental evidence to support this?</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewer that oxytocin can activate both oxytocin and vasopressin receptors, which are widely spread across different brain regions and play and essential role in translating the oxytocin signal into cellular changes. We believe this question is important mainly because by discovering which receptors are activated by oxytocin and which downstream pathways are stimulated by this activation, we will be able to uncover new therapeutic targets for treatments. While highly important and significant to the field, we feel that addressing this question is best done in an independent study.</p><p>Regarding the second point raised by the reviewer, we respectfully disagree with the statement that “the synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus is impaired whereas it remains intact in the PFC”. PFC plasticity is not intact, as we clearly show that LTP in the PFC was reduced in both <italic>Shank3</italic>-Het and KO rats. Having that explained, one can’t conclude based on current available data as to which brain region is targeted and most benefited by the oxytocin administration. PFC would certainly be the more reasonable target of attention restoration by oxytocin, yet this has to be experimentally examined. As we stated for the first point, and as the reviewer implied, identifying the target receptor activated by oxytocin and the brain region targeted will help address this issue. In this regard, brain recording as well as imaging studies (e.g., fMRI) following oxytocin administrations can also be valuable tool to be considered. Yet as we noted above, while important and significant to the field, understanding the mechanisms by which oxytocin exerts its effect is, in our opinion, best left to an independent study.</p><p><italic>Again, social memory and attention while sometimes disrupted in ASD are not core features of ASD. The hippocampal deficits that are suggested here speak more to learning and memory and therefore, ID, in humans.</italic> </p><p>This comment has been addressed at length in response to the reviewer’s general overview and in our response to his first and third comments.</p><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the re-review follow.]</p><p><italic>[…] This manuscript reports a valuable description of a Shank3 mutant rat, its cognitive deficits and rescue of the deficits tested by ICV oxytocin.</italic> </p><p><italic>The authors are asked to address the sample sizes one last time. The authors say that the samples were largely constrained by the 25-50-25 inheritance pattern of WT-Hets-KOs. Yet the samples don't show this 25-50-25 distribution. They are very close to 1:1:1 overall. In the early tests – where mortality does not figure and where the distribution should be closer to Mendelian – the rats are at 9-15-12 which is a ratio of 0.6-1-0.8. However, in the core social memory tests (conducted later) the distributions are 12-13-9, 22-20-11, 9-17-14, 31-37-25, averaging 0.9-1-0.7. Then in the oxytocin rescue experiments (which are if anything more time consuming and subject to loss), the ratio is again very close to 1:1:1.</italic> </p><p><italic>These ratios close to one are not easy to understand and are not explained by the authors' letter. The reason that this is important is because of the need to set sample size targets for behavioral tests prior to conducting the tests in order to avoid unconscious bias to creep into the experiment.</italic> </p><p><italic>It might be of help to discuss how many animals in each pool and of each type were lost to surgery or some other fatality.</italic> </p><p><italic>Was the person conducting the e-phys blind to the rat's genotype? And the person that analyzed the e-phys’ results?</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewer for raising these important questions, and we have divided our response into several sections.</p><p>Sample size:</p><p>We would like to begin by emphasizing that our minimum sample sizes for each experiment, chosen based on power analyses, were set before the experiments started, and that there were no intermediate analyses based on partial samples (and hence no alteration in sample sizes as the study progressed). Hence we do not think that there could be a source of unconscious bias that led to altered results.</p><p>We also want to apologize for the confusion that we introduced by the description of 1:2:1 ratios of WT, Hets, and KOs. This was meant to underscore that the breeding scheme, together with the focus on males, had impact on sample size because only one out of every eight pups was expected to be homozygous and male. In practice, we targeted a 1:1:1 ratio in these studies.</p><p>Mendelian ratios:</p><p>Based on this comment regarding Mendelian ratios, we have now reviewed a large series of serial litters (n=130 litters). We observed that there is a reduction in the number of homozygous knockout animals at weaning (292:555:200, corresponding to ratios of 0.53:1:0.36). It is for this reason that there are sometimes fewer animals in the KO group. This is now noted in the text.</p><p>Animal loss:</p><p>We do not think that animal loss played a biased role in the results. As we now note in the text, in the long-term SRM task, 1 WT and 2 KOs lost their caps, 1 Het and 1 KO died during surgery, and 1 Het was extremely stressed and thus was not subjected to oxytocin injection. For the 5-CSRT, 4 WT, 5 Het, and 3 KO rats were unable to reach performance criterion at 1 s and therefore were excluded from analyses. This is now noted in the text.</p><p>Binding of assessor:</p><p>Finally, we would like to also state that the electrophysiology experiments were done with the experimenter and data analyst blind to genotype. This is our standard approach for all studies and we had already noted this for some experiments but accidently omitted to note this for electrophysiology and in a few other places in the manuscript. We have now added this information to the Methods.</p></body></sub-article></article>
