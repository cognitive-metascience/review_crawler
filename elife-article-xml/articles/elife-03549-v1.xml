The effects of Zfp335<sup>bloto</sup> are multigenic and cannot be attributed to altered thymic selection, proliferation or Bcl2-dependent survival. Zfp335 binds to promoter regions via a consensus motif, and its target genes are enriched in categories related to protein metabolism, mitochondrial function, and transcriptional regulation. Restoring the expression of one target, Ankle2, partially rescues T cell maturation. These findings identify Zfp335 as a transcription factor and essential regulator of late-stage intrathymic and post-thymic T cell maturation.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03549.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03549.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03549.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>To defend our bodies against a variety of foreign microbes, our immune system makes cells called T cells that can identify these invaders and help to destroy them.

T cell development is a complex and highly regulated process that involves multiple stages of selection and maturation, both within the thymus and after thymic export. In the thymus, productive rearrangement of the TCR β-chain in CD4<sup>−</sup>CD8<sup>−</sup> double negative (DN) thymocytes drives progression to the CD4<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> double positive (DP) stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Starr et al., 2003</xref>). After rearrangement of the TCR α-chain, DP thymocytes express mature TCRs which are then used to survey self-peptide/MHC complexes presented by specialized epithelial cells in the thymic cortex (cTECs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Klein et al., 2014</xref>). A small percentage of DP thymocytes receive positively selecting TCR signals which promote their survival, in part through upregulation of IL-7Rα (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sinclair et al., 2011</xref>). Positively selected thymocytes become committed to either the CD4 or CD8 single-positive (SP) lineage and migrate to the thymic medulla, where they undergo further negative selection mediated by interactions with antigen-presenting cells such as dendritic cells (DCs) or AIRE-dependent medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTECs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hogquist et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Klein et al., 2014</xref>), during which thymocytes expressing self-reactive TCRs either undergo apoptosis or are diverted to alternative fates, such as becoming regulatory T cells (Tregs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Stritesky et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>As SP thymocytes undergo maturation, expression of the surface marker CD24 is decreased while CD62L expression is upregulated. As such, SP thymocytes may be further divided into two phenotypically distinct populations, often referred to as semi-mature (CD62L<sup>lo</sup>CD24<sup>hi</sup>) and mature (CD62L<sup>hi</sup>CD24<sup>lo</sup>). These phenotypic changes are associated with an important functional difference: semi-mature SP thymocytes are susceptible to apoptosis upon TCR stimulation, whereas mature SP thymocytes are not and respond instead by proliferating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sprent and Kishimoto, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Weinreich and Hogquist, 2008</xref>). In addition, only mature SP thymocytes upregulate sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor (S1PR1), which is required for egress from the thymus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Matloubian et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Weinreich and Hogquist, 2008</xref>). The process of SP thymocyte maturation, from entry into the SP compartment to thymic egress, has been estimated to take 4–5 days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">McCaughtry et al., 2007</xref>). New T cells, also referred to as recent thymic emigrants (RTEs), undergo a phase of post-thymic phenotypic and functional maturation before they are incorporated into the long-lived peripheral naïve T cell pool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fink, 2012</xref>).</p><p>The transition from the semi-mature to mature stage of SP thymocyte development is marked by numerous changes in gene expression. Some of these changes, including the upregulation of S1PR1 and CD62L, are mediated by the transcription factor KLF2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carlson et al., 2006</xref>). In the periphery, the process of post-thymic maturation is also associated with transcriptional changes, though on a smaller scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mingueneau et al., 2013</xref>). For instance, an increase in IL-7Rα expression during this period has been shown to promote recent thymic emigrant (RTE) survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Silva et al., 2014</xref>). Proper regulation of the transcriptional program underlying late-stage SP thymocyte and post-thymic T cell maturation is thus critically important for the establishment of a normal naïve T cell compartment. Multiple genes involved in NF-κB signaling have been reported to be required for the development of mature T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Guerin et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Schmidt-Supprian et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sato et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zhang and He, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wan et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Silva et al., 2014</xref>), primarily through mechanisms related to TCR signaling and protection from apoptosis. In addition, roles for the transcriptional repressor Nkap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hsu et al., 2011</xref>) and chromatin remodeling factor Bptf (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Landry et al., 2011</xref>) have been identified in recent years. However, the transcriptional regulators controlling these stages of T cell maturation remain largely unknown.</p><p>The C2H2 zinc finger family constitutes the largest class of transcription factors in mammalian genomes, and many key transcriptional regulators in immune cell development, such as Ikaros and Plzf, contain multiple C2H2 zinc fingers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brayer and Segal, 2008</xref>). The C2H2 zinc finger fold is classically recognized to be a DNA-binding domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wolfe et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Iuchi, 2005</xref>), although it may also participate in interactions with RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brown, 2005</xref>) or other proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brayer and Segal, 2008</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we identify a C2H2 zinc finger protein, Zfp335, as an essential regulator of T cell maturation. Zfp335, also known as NIF-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mahajan et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Garapaty et al., 2009</xref>), is ubiquitously expressed and is essential for early development, with homozygous deletion resulting in embryonic lethality at E7.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yang et al., 2012</xref>). Here, we report that an ENU-induced mutant allele of Zfp335 results in defective accumulation of naïve T cells, largely as a consequence of impaired maturation in SP thymocytes and RTEs. We show that this maturation defect is independent of thymic selection or effects on proliferation, but is associated with reduced viability. We identify a set of Zfp335 target genes in thymocytes and present evidence that decreased Zfp335 occupancy at a subset of these targets alters gene expression in mutant thymocytes. Taken together, our findings provide evidence that Zfp335 functions as a transcription factor and key regulator of a transcriptional program required for T cell maturation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The ENU mouse mutant <italic>bloto</italic> has a deficiency in peripheral T cells</title><p>As part of an <italic>N</italic>-ethyl-<italic>N</italic>-nitrosourea (ENU) mutagenesis screen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nelms and Goodnow, 2001</xref>) for lymphocyte phenotypes, we identified a variant C57BL/6 mouse pedigree with decreased frequencies of CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in peripheral blood (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), which we named <italic>bloto</italic> (blood T cells low; allele henceforth designated <italic>blt</italic>).

Its role as a transcriptional regulator in neurogenesis and neuronal differentiation has recently been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yang et al., 2012</xref>), but any immunological function has thus far been unknown. The R1092W mutation falls within the 12th zinc finger (ZF12) near the C-terminus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), at a position that is highly conserved across vertebrate evolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).

Western blotting analysis of thymocytes showed no reduction in the amount of Zfp335 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), indicating that the R1092W mutation had no adverse effect on protein expression or stability. Confocal imaging of sorted mature SP thymocytes showed that both wild-type and mutant Zfp335 localized to the nucleus, forming punctate foci within regions of euchromatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). No detectable differences in subnuclear distribution were observed. These data suggest that the <italic>bloto</italic> mutation is hypomorphic rather than null, as it results in normal levels of stable protein that can localize appropriately to the nucleus but has impaired function due to the selective disruption of ZF12.</p><p>An in vivo gene complementation test was carried out by retroviral transduction of wild-type Zfp335 into <italic>blt/blt</italic> bone marrow for hematopoietic reconstitution of irradiated hosts.

Overexpression of Zfp335<sup>R1092W</sup> yielded an intermediate rescue effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>), suggesting that supraphysiological protein expression may partially compensate for impaired function caused by a hypomorphic mutation. Interestingly, we observed that transduction frequencies for Zfp335<sup>WT</sup> in DP thymocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>) or non-T lymphocytes (data not shown) were typically low (&lt;10%) compared to transduction frequencies achieved with Zfp335<sup>R1092W</sup> or other genes, suggesting that overexpression of Zfp335 may have an inhibitory effect on early hematopoiesis, leading to poorer reconstitution of transduced progenitors.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title><italic>blt/blt</italic> mice have defects in SP thymocyte maturation and homeostasis of recent thymic emigrants</title><p>To further characterize the block in intrathymic development, we examined thymocyte populations by continuous in vivo bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) labeling, where the percentage of BrdU<sup>+</sup> cells indicates population turnover.

To assess the impact of Zfp335<sup>R1092W</sup> on naïve T cell homeostasis, we adoptively transferred <italic>blt</italic>/<italic>blt</italic> peripheral T cells together with wild-type controls into congenic lymphoreplete hosts and assessed their relative maintenance over 7 days. Surprisingly, <italic>blt/blt</italic> T cells persisted just as well as control wild-type T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>), suggesting that Zfp335<sup>R1092W</sup> does not significantly impair the survival of the bulk naïve T cell population. This led us to hypothesize that the <italic>bloto</italic> defect may be largely confined to new T cells that have recently left the thymus, otherwise known as recent thymic emigrants (RTEs). In adult mice, these cells comprise a relatively small percentage of total naïve T cells and may therefore not be significantly represented in measurements involving the bulk naïve T cell population. We initially assessed the ability of SP thymocytes to survive once introduced into the periphery, in essence behaving as surrogate RTEs. Significantly, <italic>blt</italic>/<italic>blt</italic> cells decayed more rapidly than co-transferred controls, hinting that RTE survival may be impaired in <italic>blt</italic>/<italic>blt</italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><p>In order to study the RTE population in <italic>blt</italic>/<italic>blt</italic> mice in greater detail, we crossed the <italic>blt</italic>/<italic>blt</italic> mutant to the Rag1-GFP reporter line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kuwata et al., 1999</xref>). In these reporter mice, GFP signal intensity is inversely proportional to time spent in the periphery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boursalian et al., 2004</xref>), allowing for the identification of RTEs as GFP<sup>+</sup> cells within the naïve T cell population. We found that the GFP<sup>hi</sup> subset was significantly overrepresented in <italic>blt/blt</italic> naïve T cells and was skewed towards cells with the highest GFP signal intensities that have most recently exited the thymus, consistent with a partial block in post-thymic naïve T cell maturation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). To directly assess RTE maintenance in vivo, a test population of either Rag1-GFP <italic>blt</italic>/+ or Rag1-GFP <italic>blt</italic>/<italic>blt</italic> peripheral T cells was mixed with control non-fluorescent T cells and injected i.v. into congenic lymphoreplete hosts. Consistent with previous experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>), there was no significant decline in relative numbers of total <italic>blt</italic>/<italic>blt</italic> naïve T cells recovered from the spleen 1, 3, and 5 days post-transfer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). However, the <italic>blt</italic>/<italic>blt</italic> Rag1-GFP<sup>+</sup> population declined more rapidly than <italic>blt</italic>/+ Rag1-GFP<sup>+</sup> controls, particularly within the first day of adoptive transfer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Interestingly, in contrast to the spleen, we noted a small decrease in the maintenance of total <italic>blt</italic>/<italic>blt</italic> naïve T cells, relative to <italic>blt</italic>/+ cells, that were recovered from peripheral lymph nodes. Similarly, the lymph nodes exhibited a larger decline in <italic>blt</italic>/<italic>blt</italic> Rag1-GFP<sup>+</sup> relative to <italic>blt</italic>/+ Rag1-GFP<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). These data suggest that some of the apparent decline in <italic>blt</italic>/<italic>blt</italic> RTEs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>) may be due to less efficient short-term accumulation in lymph nodes. Nonetheless, the fact that we observe in both spleen and lymph nodes a higher rate of decay in the Rag1-GFP<sup>+</sup> population as compared to the overall effect on the bulk naïve T cell pool strongly suggests that <italic>blt</italic>/<italic>blt</italic> RTEs survive less well than control RTEs.</p><p>In terms of absolute numbers, GFP<sup>hi</sup> RTEs in <italic>blt</italic>/<italic>blt</italic> mice were reduced by a magnitude largely matching that of GFP<sup>−</sup> mature naïve cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>), suggesting that most of the drop-off in cell numbers may have occurred at the earliest stages of RTE maturation. To test this hypothesis, we treated mice with FTY720, a potent inhibitor of thymic egress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Matloubian et al., 2004</xref>).

Of the ten target genes listed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref> as having significantly reduced Zfp335<sup>R1092W</sup> binding, only three (<italic>Ankle2</italic>, <italic>Nme6</italic>, <italic>Cnpy2</italic>) were downregulated in expression by more than twofold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). Since our ChIP-seq results were derived from total thymocytes, of which only a small percentage are mature CD4SP, one caveat was that we might have missed gene expression changes in the larger population, so we sorted DP thymocytes (&gt;90% of total) and tested them by RT-qPCR.

This is not an unexpected finding given that transcription factors are known to bind sites which they do not functionally regulate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Smale, 2014</xref>).

Interestingly, this small group of upregulated targets include <italic>Zfp335</italic> itself, which we confirmed by RT-qPCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), suggesting that Zfp335 participates in an autoregulatory negative feedback loop. It is probably reasonable to assume that many of these differentially expressed genes do in fact have reduced Zfp335<sup>R1092W</sup> binding at their promoters, which we failed to detect owing to limitations in ChIP-seq sensitivity and/or the inability of our approach to identify differential binding events that are not evident at the whole population level because they occur exclusively in mature CD4SP thymocytes.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Identification of a novel consensus motif for Zfp335</title><p>As a member of the C2H2 zinc finger protein family, it is highly likely that Zfp335 interacts with its genomic targets through direct binding to a specific DNA sequence motif.

By analyzing mice with a hypomorphic missense mutation in a C2H2 zinc finger of Zfp335, we reveal a selective defect in the accumulation of naïve T cells resulting from a maturation block in SP thymocytes and recent thymic emigrants. In line with another recent study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yang et al., 2012</xref>), we have shown that Zfp335 regulates transcription by binding to promoters of target genes. We have identified a set of direct targets in thymocytes and provide evidence that Zfp335 occupancy at a small subset of target sites was significantly decreased in mutant T cells. Zfp335 target genes were enriched in categories related to protein metabolism, mitochondrial function, and transcriptional regulation. In addition, we identified a new DNA recognition motif that is bound by Zfp335. Taken together, our findings suggest that Zfp335 acts as a novel transcription factor required for regulating expression of multiple genes required for late stage naïve T cell maturation.</p><p>We provide evidence that Zfp335 regulates T cell maturation in part by promoting <italic>Ankle2</italic> transcription. A study in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> and HeLa cells showed a role for Ankle2 in nuclear envelope reassembly by promoting dephosphorylation of BAF during mitotic exit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Asencio et al., 2012</xref>). As we found no significant defects in proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>) and did not detect nuclear envelope abnormalities in <italic>blt/blt</italic> mature SP thymocytes by immunofluorescence microscopy (data not shown), it is likely that the requirement for Ankle2 is dependent on some other as-yet-unknown function of this protein. To our knowledge, this is the first time an in vivo role for Ankle2 has been reported, and a more detailed understanding of its function and mechanism of action in T cells will be an important subject for future studies.</p><p>The T cell deficiency in <italic>blt/blt</italic> mice does not appear to be a consequence of defects in thymic selection, proliferation, or IL-7Rα expression, but is associated with reduced viability of mature SP thymocytes and recent thymic emigrants. Our finding that BCL2 overexpression failed to rescue the relative deficiency in <italic>blt/blt</italic> T cells, together with the unaltered expression of Bcl2 family genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref>) or other well-defined pro-apoptotic genes such as members of the death receptor family (data not shown), suggests Zfp335 has an indirect and likely multigenic pro-survival influence. Although our data do not provide support for altered thymic selection being an explanation for the reduced T cell numbers in <italic>blt/blt</italic> mice, we cannot exclude the possibility that the selection of some T cell specificities is affected by the Zfp335 mutation and future deep sequencing studies will be needed to fully address this issue. The intact proliferation of <italic>blt/blt</italic> T cells contrasts with the defective proliferation of human lymphoblastic cells and neuronal stem cells carrying a H1111R mutation in ZFP335 (ZNF335) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yang et al., 2012</xref>). We suspect that this difference is a consequence of the almost complete loss of protein caused by the H1111R mutation, compared to the more subtle influence of the R1092W mutation studied here.</p><p>Naïve T cell deficiencies have been observed in several mouse lines with deletions in genes related to NF-κB signaling, such as RelB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Guerin et al., 2002</xref>), NEMO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Schmidt-Supprian et al., 2003</xref>), c-FLIP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zhang and He, 2005</xref>), TAK1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sato et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wan et al., 2006</xref>), and IKK2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Schmidt-Supprian et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Silva et al., 2014</xref>). However, the expression of these genes was not altered in <italic>blt/blt</italic> T lymphocytes and we did not detect enrichment for NF-κB targets in the gene expression analysis (data not shown). Two other genes known to be required for T cell maturation are the transcriptional repressor Nkap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hsu et al., 2011</xref>) and Bptf, a component of the ISWI-containing chromatin remodeling complex NURF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Landry et al., 2011</xref>). Similar to what we observed in <italic>blt/blt</italic> mice, the maturation block in Nkap- and Bptf-deficient T cells was not caused by altered thymic selection and could not be rescued by Bcl2 overexpression. However, neither Nkap nor Bptf showed significant expression changes in <italic>blt/blt</italic> T lymphocytes. Moreover, we did not find a strong correlation between the expression profiles of <italic>blt/blt</italic> and Bptf-deficient SP thymocytes (unpublished observation). Nonetheless, this does not exclude the possibility of a partial overlap between genes regulated by Bptf and Zfp335—one potential mechanism could be that Bptf-dependent nucleosome repositioning is required for efficient Zfp335 binding to some of its target sites.</p><p>A small number of studies have shown that autophagy plays a role in mature T cell survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pua et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">He et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Parekh et al., 2013</xref>), possibly by ensuring the clearance of excess mitochondria to minimize the harmful impact of reactive oxygen species (ROS) as newly mature cells transition from the thymus to the periphery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pua et al., 2009</xref>). Although we observed genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation enriched amongst Zfp335 targets, our gene expression data did not reveal a clear autophagy signature, and initial experiments found no significant differences in mitochondrial content or ROS levels in <italic>blt/blt</italic> mature SP thymocytes (data not shown). However, we cannot rule out the possibility that other autophagy-dependent processes may be affected by Zfp335 deficiency.</p><p>From our microarray analyses, we found that most gene expression changes in <italic>blt/blt</italic> T lymphocytes were subtle. In our mature CD4SP thymocyte data set, of the 1504 genes passing a p-value threshold of &lt;0.05, only 16 genes, or 1% of the total had a twofold or greater change in expression, while the vast majority (93%) showed a less than 1.5-fold difference between <italic>blt</italic>/<italic>blt</italic> and WT. This may not be a surprising result, given that we were only able to detect strongly diminished Zfp335<sup>R1092W</sup> occupancy at a limited subset of target sites. However, due to the highly conservative criteria used and other technical limitations discussed earlier, this is most likely an underestimate of the true degree of differential binding, which may affect a broader range of target genes and account for many of the more subtle changes in gene expression. Consistent with this notion, we observed that 33 direct Zfp335 targets, representing ∼20% of the total, were differentially expressed in mature CD4SP thymocytes (p &lt; 0.05), and of these genes, only four (<italic>Ankle2</italic>, <italic>Cnpy2</italic>, <italic>Nme6</italic>, <italic>Tbck</italic>) met our differential binding criteria. Furthermore, several known or putative transcriptional regulators are among genes directly targeted by Zfp335 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4-data">Supplementary file 4</xref>) or differentially expressed in <italic>blt/blt</italic> thymocytes and RTEs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>), suggesting that Zfp335 operates within the context of a broader gene regulatory network. It is likely that the T cell maturation defect arises from the cumulative effects of relatively small gene expression changes within the Zfp335 regulatory network, possibly resulting in mild perturbations of multiple pathways whose functional consequences may not be individually significant but in combination may negatively impact overall T cell fitness.</p><p>It is interesting to note that survival of mature naïve T cells appears to be intact, despite RT-qPCR evidence indicating that a number of Zfp335 target genes found to be downregulated in <italic>blt</italic>/<italic>blt</italic> mature SP thymocytes and RTEs (<italic>Ankle2</italic>, <italic>Cnpy2</italic>, <italic>Sep15</italic>, and <italic>Wdr47</italic>) are similarly downregulated in the total naïve T cell population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref> and data not shown). If we extend this observation to the genome-wide level to assume that Zfp335<sup>R1092W</sup>-induced transcriptional dysregulation in mature naïve T cells approximates the situation in RTEs, one way to explain why mature T cells are less affected could be that the deregulated genes and their associated pathways are most critical during late-thymic to early post-thymic maturation, after which they become dispensable. In support of this concept, it has been reported that IKK2 is required transiently in RTEs but not in mature T cells for normal IL-7Rα upregulation and homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Silva et al., 2014</xref>), although we have no evidence that this pathway is affected in <italic>blt</italic>/<italic>blt</italic> T lymphocytes. Alternatively, stochastic variations in gene expression or upregulation of compensatory mechanisms may have resulted in comparatively ‘fitter’ cells being preferentially selected into the mature naïve T cell pool.</p><p>Zfp335 is broadly expressed in hematopoietic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Heng et al., 2008</xref>) and in a variety of non-lymphoid tissues such as brain, kidney, heart, and lung (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wu et al., 2009</xref>). Given its widespread expression and the early embryonic lethality resulting from its complete ablation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yang et al., 2012</xref>), it is highly likely that Zfp335 serves wider developmental roles. The poor contribution of Zfp335-overexpressing cells to hematopoietic lineages in BM chimeric mice also hints at a wider role. It may therefore seem remarkable that a mutation in such a ubiquitously expressed gene could produce a defect that appears to be selective for this particular stage of T cell development. It is possible that the loss of Zfp335 binding to the target sites described in our study may be unique to T lymphocytes, resulting in T cell-specific dysregulation; however, this hypothesis is not favored by preliminary evidence showing that target genes such as <italic>Ankle2</italic> were also downregulated in B cells (data not shown). As discussed earlier, our data that only a small number of target genes are significantly deregulated suggests that other aspects of the Zfp335-dependent transcriptional program may remain sufficiently intact to allow most developmental processes, except for T cell maturation, to proceed relatively normally. For future studies, it will be important to test whether a null allele has additional consequences for immune regulation beyond the selective T cell maturation effects revealed by the <italic>bloto</italic> mutation.</p><p>Genome-wide, we estimate that there are more than 2000 promoter regions containing Zfp335 motif sites. Our study detected approximately 150 ChIP-seq peaks in thymocytes, consistent with the generally accepted principle that additional molecular requirements beyond DNA sequence preference determine the stability of transcription factor binding to a given site. At this early stage, it is not known what these requirements are for Zfp335, but they are likely to involve local chromatin context and interactions with co-binding partners which remain to be defined. It is also unclear whether Zfp335 displays cell type-specific binding patterns, which may allow Zfp335 to fulfill various developmental roles by regulating different gene expression programs. Finally, although it has been proposed that Zfp335 activates target genes by recruiting H3K4 methyltransferases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yang et al., 2012</xref>), it is not clear if this is the sole mechanism, or that Zfp335 functions exclusively as a transcriptional activator. Consistent with the view that Zfp335 drives transcriptional activation, we observed that most target genes with deregulated expression in <italic>blt/blt</italic> thymocytes tended to be downregulated. However, we have noted exceptions in which some target genes—including Zfp335 itself—were modestly upregulated, suggesting the possibility that Zfp335 may also act as a repressor. Further investigations will be needed to identify the interaction partners with which Zfp335 cooperates to control gene expression.</p><p>To conclude, our findings regarding Zfp335<sup>R1092W</sup> add to other recent work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hsu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Landry et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Silva et al., 2014</xref>) to highlight unique gene expression requirements in late stage thymocytes and recent thymic emigrants for the formation of a normal sized naïve T cell compartment. In this regard, the function of Zfp335 is similar to its action in the brain where it is needed for the formation of a normal sized forebrain structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yang et al., 2012</xref>). In future work, it will be important to build from these findings to understand how this broad set of gene expression changes are integrated to promote formation of a normal sized compartment of cells. It will also be important to understand whether Zfp335 acts constitutively during late stages of T cell development or whether its function is regulated by external inputs and thus serves as a checkpoint that can influence the size and properties of the naïve T cell compartment.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p>The Zfp335<sup>bloto</sup> strain was established through ethylnitrosourea (ENU)-mediated mutagenesis of C57BL/6 (B6) mice at the Australian National University using methods previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Randall et al., 2009</xref>).

The authors have elegantly combined forward genetics, immune assays and transcriptional analysis, and the experiments were designed and performed well with convincing results presented. This is certainly an interesting study, but I have the following comments for the authors to address.</p><p>1) Although the mutant mice have reduced peripheral cells, the physiological consequences on immune responses are unclear. The authors should test this in models of T cell-dependent immune responses.</p><p>2) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, the authors showed that thymic but not peripheral naive T cells have defects in the maintenance upon adoptive transfer. They then described defect in RTE as a likely mechanism, but have not directly tested the survival or maintenance of RTE cells. This needs to be done.</p><p>3) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, the authors measured expression of Bcl2 family proteins to exclude a role of cell apoptosis. They should directly measure cell apoptosis, e.g. by caspase staining.</p><p>4) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, the authors used ChIP-Seq on total thymocytes to identify Zfp335 targets. Since the most relevant cell type is mature thymocytes, they need to validate the target genes by performing ChIP experiment using mature thymocytes followed by qPCR of the targets.</p><p><italic>Reviewer 2</italic>:</p><p>The manuscript by Han et al. describes the finding of a new Zinc finger protein Zfp335 in the development of mature thymocytes and peripheral T cells from the analysis of a mouse strain from ENU-mutagenesis. The developmental defects of T cells are restricted to the stages after DP thymocytes, particularly to mature SP, RTE, and peripheral T cells.</p><p>The causative gene was found to be a hypomorphic mutation of Zfp335 from the experiment by bone marrow reconstitution by retroviral transduction of the wild type and mutant Zfp335. By very extensive analyses using various TCR-Tg mouse models and systems, the authors suggested that the developmental defect could not be attributed to the impaired selection, cell survival, and thymic egress. To elucidate the defect by identifying the target genes of Zfp335, the authors found several possible target genes that Zfp335 directly binds. However, none of them could explain the developmental defect. One target gene Ankle2 may partly restore mature T cells.</p><p>Overall the analysis of the mutant mouse and gene demonstrated a critical role of Zfp335 in development of T cells and identify the target genes, but failed to neither reveal the mechanism of the developmental defect nor identify the function of Zfp335 gene.</p><p>1) Although Zfp335 restored mature T cell development by bone marrow reconstitution, it is recommended to confirm by the knock-in of Zfp335 because the mice may still contain other mutations and the heterogeneity of chimeric mice does not prove full restoration of development.</p><p>2) Thymic selection using OTII-Tg mice showed significant defect of development of mature TCR + T cells, the author might not simply neglect the effect on thymic selection.</p><p>3) The data for the effect of Ankle2 in the reconstitution experiment was complicated such as the analysis of Rag-GFPhigh and low population (for example why Thy1.1 expression levels were so different between Ankle2 vs. control). Simpler experiment and expression should be taken to show significant restoration from developmental arrest.</p><p><italic>Reviewer 3</italic>:</p><p>In this manuscript, Han et al., describe the analysis of the T cell compartment in the mouse mutant bloto, carrying a hypomorphic mutation in the zinc finger protein gene Zfp335. The authors identify a missense mutation in Zfp335 that alters zinc finger 12 and affects the DNA-binding ability of the protein. Homozygous bloto mice show a defect in the formation of the naive T cell compartment that cannot be attributed to altered thymic selection, cell proliferation or survival. ChIP-seq and microarray analyses to identify Zfp335-occupied and -regulated genes indicate that a very small number of genes are differentially bound and regulated in mutant and wild type thymocytes. Overexpression of one of these targets, Ankle2, in Rag1-GFP+ naive T cells showed a partial rescue of the mutant phenotyope.</p><p>The extensive analysis of the T cell defect of Zfp335bloto mice and the molecular examination of the defect in DNA binding and gene transcription are interesting and extend previous work on the function of Zfp335 in neural stem cells (Cell 151, 1097, 2012). The data are convincing and well presented. In particular, the partial rescue of the mutant phenotype by the overexpression of one of the identified Zfp335 targets provides strong evidence for the functional role of this Zfp335-regulated gene. However, the study would gain additional significance by the analysis of mice carrying a conditional null allele of Zfp335. Such mice have been published, and ES cells that harbor a conditional null allele of Zfp335 are available from a mutant mouse repository.</p><p>1) The authors need to address and/or discuss the discrepancies between the previous and current studies of Zfp335. For example, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4S3</xref> the authors show that cell proliferation and survival are not affected by the bloto mutation. However, the previous analysis of lymphoblastic cells of humans carrying a hypomorphic H111R mutation shows an impaired growth of mutant cells.</p><p>2) In the ChIP-seq analysis, shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5 fig6">Figures 5 and 6</xref>, the authors used the same anti-Zfp335 antibodies as the previous study. However, the authors identified a different sequence motif than the previously reported. Which parameters were used in the MEME analysis? What are the other significantly enriched motifs? Did the analysis detect the motif described in the Cell paper? If the motif width range is adjusted, is the other motif detected? I appreciate the inclusion of an electrophoretic mobility shift assay, which provides strong evidence for the newly identified sequence motif. The authors should also include the previously reported motif in this analysis.</p><p>3) One of the strongest points of the paper is the partial rescue of the T cell defect in bloto mice by the overexpression of Ankle2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). It would be of interest to examine the phenotype of an Ankle2 knock-down.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03549.031</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>Reviewer 1:</p><p><italic>[…] This is certainly an interesting study, but I have the following comments for the authors to address</italic>.</p><p><italic>1) Although the mutant mice have reduced peripheral cells, the physiological consequences on immune responses are unclear.

Similarly, <italic>blt</italic>/<italic>blt</italic> mice showed no significant impairment in a model of infection with PR8 influenza virus; they were able to mount a normal NP<sub>366-374</sub> tetramer-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell response despite having lower numbers of peripheral T cells.

Nevertheless, T lymphopenia negatively affects repertoire size and is generally associated with an increased risk of infection. It is likely that physiological consequences may be revealed when these mice are exposed to a broader range of infectious agents than are typically present in a barrier facility, or if they are infected with multiple pathogens simultaneously.</p><p><italic>2) In</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3</italic></xref><italic>, the authors showed that thymic but not peripheral naive T cells have defects in the maintenance upon adoptive transfer.

This suggests that <italic>blt</italic>/<italic>blt</italic> mature SP thymocytes have reduced viability, at least in vitro, which is likely to contribute to the defect in vivo. The failure of Bcl2 overexpression to rescue the peripheral T cell deficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>) suggests the involvement of cell-death pathways other than those countered by Bcl2.

Given this information and the amount of data we have supporting the causative role of the Zfp335<sup>R1092W</sup> mutation, we hope that this reviewer will agree that generating a knock-in mouse is not critical in the context of the present study. In the longer term we agree that it will be valuable for comparisons to be made between the phenotype of Zfp335<sup>R1092W</sup> mice and mice lacking Zfp335 selectively in T cells, and we make this point in the Discussion.</p><p><italic>2) Thymic selection using OTII-Tg mice showed significant defect of development of mature TCR + T cells, the author might not simply neglect the effect on thymic selection</italic>.</p><p>As correctly pointed out and as stated in the text, OTII TCR-tg <italic>blt/blt</italic> mice had reduced numbers of Vα2<sup>+</sup> CD4SP thymocytes.

If there were a thymic selection effect on top of the maturation defect, we would expect to see a greater fold reduction in OTII CD4SP thymocytes, which was not the case. However, we agree that we cannot rule out a possible influence of Zfp335<sup>R1092W</sup> on thymocyte selection and we have revised the Discussion section in an effort to clarify this point.</p><p><italic>3) The data for the effect of Ankle2 in the reconstitution experiment was complicated such as the analysis of Rag-GFPhigh and low population (for example why thy1.1 expression levels were so different between Ankle2 vs. control). Simpler experiment and expression should be taken to show significant restoration from developmental arrest</italic>.</p><p>The difference in Thy1.1 reporter levels between Ankle2 and control is one that we typically see in retroviral transduction experiments and may be explained by the fact that the control cells were transduced with an empty retroviral vector, which due to its smaller size compared to a vector containing a large gene like Ankle2 (2895 bp), is able to integrate into the host genome more efficiently and be present at higher copy numbers, resulting in a corresponding increase in reporter expression. We hope this additional explanation helps clarify what is admittedly a complex experiment as we are not aware of a simpler way to perform this analysis. We also note that the partial rescue effect of Ankle2 was not observed with five other Zfp335 target genes tested in reconstitution experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8–figure supplement 1A</xref>), involving a cumulative analysis of more than 30 retrovirally transduced <italic>blt/blt</italic> BM chimeric mice. We believe that this large comparison group adds strength to the conclusion regarding the small but significant pro-maturation effect of Ankle2.</p><p>Reviewer 3:</p><p><italic>[…] The data are convincing and well presented.

However, the previous analysis of lymphoblastic cells of humans carrying a hypomorphic H111R mutation shows an impaired growth of mutant cells</italic>.</p><p>We thank the reviewer for raising this point and have incorporated some of this discussion into the revised text. The H1111R mutation described in human patients by Yang et. al. was a far more severe hypomorph than the R1092W mutation present in our mice. The human mutation affected splicing, resulting in lower levels of normally spliced Zfp335 transcript and severely reduced protein expression in homozygous patient lymphoblastic cell lines (16% of control). In contrast, the R1092W mutation was comparatively benign: <italic>blt</italic>/<italic>blt</italic> cells have no decrease in Zfp335 expression at the transcript or protein level. A plausible reason for the discrepancy in proliferative capacity may be that H1111R mutant lymphoblastic cells express very little functional Zfp335, while <italic>blt</italic>/<italic>blt</italic> cells maintain sufficient Zfp335 activity such that they are capable of normal proliferation and growth. We now discuss this possibility in the text.</p><p><italic>2) In the ChIP-seq analysis, shown in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5 fig6"><italic>Figures 5 and 6</italic></xref><italic>, the authors used the same anti-Zfp335 antibodies as the previous study.

Furthermore, analysis of our data using an alternative motif discovery algorithm, HOMER, did not reveal significant enrichment of this motif.</p><p>The MEME analysis parameters used by Yang <italic>et. al.</italic>, differed from ours in two key aspects: 1) a maximum motif width of 20 (instead of 30) was specified; 2) discriminative motif discovery was performed using a negative set of “background” sequences contrasted against a set of target sequences extracted from the top 148 peaks in their ChIP-seq dataset.</p><p>Even after adjusting for motif width, our analysis yielded the same sequence motif that we identified, and not the previously reported motif. We have also re-analyzed the embryonic brain ChIP-seq data, extracting 400 bp sequences from the top 148 peaks identified by MACS, and running MEME with a maximum motif width of either 20 or 30. In both cases, our proposed motif emerged as the top-scoring candidate, whereas the motif reported by Yang et al., was not detected. Based on these analyses, we would argue that the discrepancy between our conclusions and that of Yang <italic>et. al.,</italic> is likely not due to true differences in the underlying biological data; instead, differences in motif finding strategy, specifically with regards to the choice of a background model by Yang <italic>et. al.,</italic> most likely account for this discrepancy.</p><p>As suggested by the reviewer, we have performed additional experiments to test the previously reported motif in an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7–figure supplement 1</xref>). The probe sequence was derived from the Zfp335 binding site at the promoter of <italic>Pdap1</italic>, a target gene identified by ChIP-seq in both embryonic brain and thymocyte ChIP-seq datasets. Our assay did not reveal evidence for Zfp335 binding to this motif in vitro: firstly, we were unable to detect formation of a gel-shift complex with labeled <italic>Pdap1</italic> probe, and secondly, addition of excess unlabeled <italic>Pdap1</italic> probe failed to compete against labeled Z1 probe (containing our identified motif) for binding to Zfp335. These new data provide further support for our newly identified Zfp335 recognition motif being a major target of Zfp335 binding.</p><p><italic>3) One of the strongest points of the paper is the partial rescue of the T cell defect in bloto mice by the overexpression of Ankle2 (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8"><italic>Figure 8</italic></xref><italic>). It would be of interest to examine the phenotype of an Ankle2 knock-down</italic>.</p><p>We agree, and in fact we had attempted to knock-down Ankle2 by transduction of bone marrow progenitors using two different shRNA constructs (selected as the best of three when tested in a cell line). Unfortunately, we were only able to achieve at most 50% knock-down of Ankle2 expression in naïve T cells as assessed by qRT-PCR. At that level of knock-down, there was no detectable effect on T cell maturation (unpublished data). In <italic>blt/blt</italic> T cells, Ankle2 expression is decreased by a far greater degree; at least ten-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>), which suggests that our shRNA knock-down efficiency was insufficient to reveal any effects of Ankle2 on T cell development. In the future, we hope to attempt this experiment again using CRISPR to achieve more efficient knock-down.</p></body></sub-article></article>
