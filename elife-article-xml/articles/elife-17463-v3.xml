While the TIM22 machinery has been well characterised in yeast, the human complex remains poorly characterised. Here, we identify Tim29 (C19orf52) as a novel, metazoan-specific subunit of the human TIM22 complex. The protein is integrated into the mitochondrial inner membrane with it’s C-terminus exposed to the intermembrane space. Tim29 is required for the stability of the TIM22 complex and functions in the assembly of hTim22. Furthermore, Tim29 contacts the Translocase of the Outer Mitochondrial Membrane, TOM complex, enabling a mechanism for transport of hydrophobic carrier substrates across the aqueous intermembrane space. Identification of Tim29 highlights the significance of analysing mitochondrial import systems across phylogenetic boundaries, which can reveal novel components and mechanisms in higher organisms.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.17463.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.17463.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17463.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Mitochondria are like tiny bean-shaped “power stations” that provide our cells with the vast majority of the energy that they need. These structures, however, are not self-sufficient and instead rely on proteins and chemicals that are imported from elsewhere in the cell. Two layers of membrane enclose the mitochondria, and transporting proteins across the inner and outer membranes requires large molecular machines embedded within the membranes.</p><p>One such complex, the TIM22 complex, organizes tunnel-like carrier proteins that in turn ferry chemicals across the inner membrane to fuel metabolism. The TIM22 complex is vitally important as it allows mitochondria to adapt their metabolism – that is, how and when they generate energy – to match the cell’s needs during development. Yet, while the TIM22 complex has been studied extensively in yeast, less is known about how it works in human cells.</p><p>Now, Kang et al. have identified a new piece of the human equivalent of the TIM22 machinery, a protein called Tim29, which helps to assemble the TIM22 complex in human cells. Experiments reveal that Tim29 also creates a link between human TIM22 and the TOM complex, a complex that serves as the general entry point through the outer mitochondrial membrane. Sequence analysis revealed that Tim29 is found in other animals, such as chimpanzees and cows, but not in yeast. This suggests that the mitochondrial machinery has changed during evolution.</p><p>Kang et al. plan to further investigate how human carrier proteins reach the mitochondria, and exactly how Tim29 helps human TIM22 to cooperate with TOM. Overall, the discovery of Tim29 highlights the importance of looking at mitochondrial machinery across different species in the hope of revealing new components and mechanisms. A future challenge will be to determine how relevant these machines are in human development and diseases.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.17463.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.17463.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>mitochondria</kwd><kwd>protein trafficking</kwd><kwd>TIM22</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001782</institution-id><institution>University of Melbourne</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Melbourne International Fee Remission Scholarship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kang</surname><given-names>Yilin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001782</institution-id><institution>University of Melbourne</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Melbourne International Research Scholarship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kang</surname><given-names>Yilin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001782</institution-id><institution>University of Melbourne</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Biochemistry Fund Fellowship, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stojanovski</surname><given-names>Diana</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A novel and metazoan-specific protein, Tim29, is identified as a subunit of the human TIM22 complex and shown to function in the assembly of hTim22 and facilitate contacts with the TOM complex.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Mitochondria cannot be created <italic>de novo</italic> and pre-existing mitochondria are used as templates for mitochondrial biogenesis. This genesis requires the ~1500 different mitochondrial proteins to be imported via dynamic translocation machines to one of four subcompartments of the organelle – outer and inner membrane, intermembrane space and matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chacinska et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Stojanovski et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dolezal et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Harbauer et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Neupert and Herrmann, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baker et al., 2014</xref>). The Translocase of the Outer Membrane (TOM) complex is described as the general entry gate to mitochondria and provides a passageway through which precursors can cross the outer membrane. The mitochondrial inner membrane contains two translocase machines that are responsible for the import of a large fraction of the mitochondrial proteome; the Translocase of the Inner Membrane 23 (TIM23) complex and the Translocase of the Inner Membrane 22 (TIM22) complex.</p><p>The TIM23 complex typically transports proteins that possess a matrix-targeting N-terminal presequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chacinska et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Neupert and Herrmann, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wagner et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mokranjac and Neupert, 2010</xref>), while the TIM22 complex mediates the inner membrane insertion of multi-transmembrane spanning proteins that contain internal targeting elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chacinska et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Neupert and Herrmann, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rehling et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Koehler, 2004</xref>). Substrates of the TIM22 complex include the mitochondrial carrier family, such as the ADP/ATP carrier (AAC) and the phosphate carrier (PiC), and multispanning inner membrane proteins like, Tim17 and Tim23 (subunits of the TIM23 complex) and Tim22 itself (pore forming unit of the TIM22 complex) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chacinska et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Stojanovski et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Koehler, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sirrenberg et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Káldi et al., 1998</xref>). In yeast cells, TIM22 is a 300-kDa complex, consisting of four membrane integral subunits, Tim22, Tim54, Tim18 and Sdh3, and a peripheral chaperone complex consisting of the small TIM proteins, Tim9-Tim10-Tim12 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adam et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gebert et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jarosch et al., 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kerscher et al., 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Koehler et al., 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kovermann et al., 2002</xref>). The small TIM proteins are a family of intermembrane space chaperones that facilitate the passage of hydrophobic membrane proteins through this aqueous environment. Tim9 and Tim10 form a soluble hexameric complex, but a fraction also interacts with the TIM22 complex via assembly with Tim12 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adam et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gebert et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baud et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Like yeast, the human TIM22 complex consists of the channel-forming hTim22 protein, along with subunits of the small TIM family, hTim9, hTim10a, and hTim10b (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mühlenbein et al., 2004</xref>), with hTim10b being the functional homologue of yeast Tim12 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Koehler et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baud et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mühlenbein et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gentle et al., 2007</xref>). However, homologues of yeast Tim54 or Tim18 are absent in human cells and there is no evidence to indicate that the Sdh3 homologue, SDHC, interacts with the human TIM22 translocase. Thus, the true architecture of the human TIM22 complex remains an open question. Given the many elaborate functions of mitochondria in human cells, including, cell death, metabolism, tumorigenicity and neurodegenerative disorders, we reasoned the composition of the TIM22 complex in human cells is likely different to yeast. This led us to investigate the subunit composition of the human TIM22 complex.</p><p>Here we report on the identification of C19orf52 as a novel subunit of the human TIM22 complex, and accordingly rename the protein as Tim29. Tim29 functions in the assembly of hTim22 and consequently the stability of the TIM22 complex. Furthermore, we propose that Tim29 links the TIM22 complex to the general entry gate of mitochondria, the TOM complex. Our findings highlight the importance of analysing mitochondrial protein import across phylogenetic boundaries, since it can reveal novel facilitators of this essential cellular process, in addition to novel mechanisms.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The previously uncharacterised protein C19orf52 is a mitochondrial protein and interacts with hTim10b</title><p>We sought to investigate the composition of the human TIM22 complex using affinity enrichment approaches.

A single protein of the expected molecular weight was detected in the eluate fraction by western blotting with FLAG-specific antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, lane 7, upper panel). Eluate fractions were then analysed by label-free quantitative mass spectrometry to reveal the interacting partners of hTim10b.

The uncharacterised protein, C19orf52, also displayed significant enrichment in the hTim10b<sup>3XFLAG</sup> sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>).</p><p>Sequence similarity searches for C19orf52 did not reveal homologs in lower eukaryotes. However, C19orf52 is conserved in metazoan species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). The previously uncharacterised protein is predicted to possess an N-terminal presequence at amino acids 1–16, based on the MitoProt II bioinformatics program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Claros, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Claros and Vincens, 1996</xref>) and a single transmembrane domain spanning amino acids 61–79 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). We first performed a mitochondrial in vitro import assay to assess import of the protein into mitochondria. [<sup>35</sup>S]-C19orf52 was synthesised in rabbit reticulocyte lysate and imported into mitochondria isolated from HeLa cells. C19orf52 could be imported into a protease-protected location and in a time-dependent manner, but we did not observe proteolytic processing of the protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, upper panel), as observed for the presequence-containing, pre-ornithine transcarbamylase (pOTC) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, lower panel). However, the import of C19orf52 was inhibited under conditions where the membrane potential (Δψ) had been dissipated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, upper panel, lane 8) in a similar manner to pOTC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, lower panel, lane 8), suggesting import via a Δψ-dependent import pathway. To confirm the mitochondrial localisation of C19orf52 and define the boundaries of the protein’s targeting information, we expressed the following constructs in HeLa cells as C-terminal FLAG-tagged fusion proteins: (i) full length C19orf52 (C19orf52<sup>WT</sup>); (ii) C19orf52 lacking the 16 amino acids that make up the predicted presequence (C19orf52<sup>Δ16</sup>); (iii) the N-terminal 89 amino acids of C19orf52, which includes the predicted presequence and transmembrane domain (aa 61–79) (C19orf52<sup>aa1-89</sup>); (iv) the N-terminal 89 amino acids of C19orf52, but lacking the predicted presequence (C19orf52<sup>aa17-89</sup>) and (v) a N-terminal truncation of C19orf52 containing amino acids 80–260 (C19orf52<sup>aa80-260</sup>).

We generated a stable tetracycline-inducible HEK293T cell line expressing C19orf52<sup>3XFLAG</sup>. Hypo-osmotic swelling and carbonate extraction treatments were performed on the isolated mitochondria. C19orf52<sup>3XFLAG</sup> was present in isolated mitochondria and only became accessible to external protease when the outer membrane was disrupted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, compare lanes 2 and 4), indicating the C-terminal FLAG tag is exposed to the intermembrane space. Outer membrane proteins Bak and Mfn2, Opa1 that is exposed to the intermembrane-space and matrix-located NDUFAF2 served as controls. C19orf52<sup>3XFLAG</sup> was resistant to carbonate treatment, like the membrane integrated Bak and Mfn2, indicating that it is likely an integral membrane protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). In a similar manner, subfractionation and carbonate extraction of mitochondria isolated from cells expressing C19orf52<sup>1-89</sup> revealed that the truncated protein is also an integral membrane protein that exposes it’s C-terminal FLAG tag to the intermembrane space (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Taken together this data indicates that C19orf52 is an integral inner membrane protein with a C-terminal domain exposed to the intermembrane space. Surprisingly, upon subfractionation and carbonate extraction of mitochondria isolated from cells expressing C19orf52<sup>△16</sup> and C19orf52<sup>17-89</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C and D</xref>) we noticed that these proteins failed to sort properly to the inner membrane, but appeared trapped in the outer membrane, most likely in the TOM complex (indicated by accessibility to protease and presence in both the pellet and supernatant fractions upon carbonate treatment). Thus, although the first 16 amino acids originally appeared to be dispensable for mitochondrial targeting, closer examination revealed that these residues are indeed crucial for subsequent sorting of C19orf52 to the inner membrane.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>C19orf52 is a subunit of the human TIM22 complex</title><p>Next we investigated the association of C19orf52 with the human TIM22 complex. Mitochondria from hTim10b<sup>3XFLAG</sup> and C19orf52<sup>3XFLAG</sup> expressing cells were solubilised in digitonin-containing buffer prior to analysis by BN-PAGE and immunodecoration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). C19orf52 specific antibodies revealed the presence of a high molecular weight complex of approximately 450-kDa, reminiscent of the TIM22 complex in both control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, lane 1) and hTim10b<sup>3XFLAG</sup> mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, lane 2). We observed a slight delay in the migration of the C19orf52-containing complex in mitochondria isolated from hTim10b<sup>3XFLAG</sup> expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, lane 2 and 4). This suggested that C19orf52 is located within a hTim10b<sup>3XFLAG</sup>-containing complex and the presence of the FLAG-tag is causing the observed delay in mobility. To interrogate this observation further, we performed antibody-shift analysis of the human TIM22 complex. In this case, [<sup>35</sup>S]-hTim22 was imported into mitochondria isolated from control, hTim10b<sup>3XFLAG</sup> and C19orf52<sup>3XFLAG</sup> expressing cells where it assembled into the mature TIM22 complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, lane 1, 4 and 7). Following import, mitochondria were isolated, solubilised in digitonin-containing buffer and incubated with anti-FLAG or anti-SDHA antibodies prior to BN-PAGE. As can be seen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, lanes 2, and 8), the FLAG antibodies shifted [<sup>35</sup>S]-hTim22 (hTIM22 complex) in both hTim10b<sup>3XFLAG</sup> and C19orf52<sup>3XFLAG</sup> containing mitochondria, suggesting the presence of all three proteins within the same complex. In an alternative approach C19orf52<sup>3XFLAG</sup> was shown to specifically immunoprecipitate hTim22 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), while C19orf52 could be co-immunoprecipitated with hTim10b<sup>3XFLAG</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). As a final source of confirmation immunoprecipitation of C19orf52<sup>3XFLAG</sup> and subsequent quantitative mass spectrometry-based proteomics analysis revealed the presence of all known TIM22 complex subunits, including hTim22, hTim10b, hTim10a and hTim9 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>). These findings confirm that C19orf52 is a <italic>bona fide</italic> subunit of the human TIM22 complex, and represents a novel metazoan specific subunit of the translocation machine. Given that the molecular weight of the protein is 29 kDa and the nomenclature of the mitochondrial protein import machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pfanner et al., 1996</xref>), we henceforth rename this protein as Tim29 and its gene as <italic>TIMM29</italic>.<fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17463.008</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>C19orf52 is a subunit of the human TIM22 complex.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Mitochondria isolated from control or hTim10b<sup>3XFLAG</sup>-expressing cells were solubilised in 1% digitonin-containing buffer and analysed by BN-PAGE and western blotting with the indicated antibodies.

Knockdown (KD) of Tim29 was assessed relative to cells transfected with a non-targeting control and we also performed KD of hTim22, which allowed us to monitor the implications of shutting down the carrier pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>). To address the global impact of Tim29 and hTim22 KD on cell health and viability we monitored the impact of Tim29 and hTim22 KD on mitochondrial respiration, cell proliferation and cell viability. We measured mitochondrial oxygen consumption rates in intact cells by high-resolution respirometry to determine if the KD of Tim29 and hTim22 affects mitochondrial metabolism. Knockdown of Tim29 significantly reduced basal mitochondrial oxygen consumption to 65% (p&lt;0.05) compared to cells transfected with a control scrambled siRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>). This reduction in basal oxygen consumption was similar to that observed in hTim22 KD cells (61% residual respiration, p&lt;0.05). Following addition of FCCP, the maximal mitochondrial oxygen consumption rate was also significantly lower in Tim29 KD cells compared to control cells (88% residual respiration, p&lt;0.05) and in hTim22 knockdown cells compared to the control (63%, p&lt;0.05). KD of both Tim29 and hTim22 did not have any significant impact on cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>), or cell viability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1E</xref>).</p><p>Next we assessed the impact of KD of Tim29 on TIM22 complex substrates at the steady state protein level. As can be seen, Tim29 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) and hTim22 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) were depleted from mitochondria while the control protein Mfn2 remained unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>, bottom panels). Specific depletion of TIM22 complex substrates, including hTim23, ANT3 and the glutamate carrier was observed in both Tim29 and hTim22 depleted mitochondria (quantifications shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>, lower panels). The depletion of Tim29 also led to a significant reduction in the levels of hTim22 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), while the lack of hTim22 had no obvious effect on the levels of Tim29, indicating Tim29 is imported in a TIM22-independent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). BN-PAGE analysis also revealed that depletion of Tim29 caused a reduction in the assembly of ANT3 and hTIM23 complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), with the latter causing a reduction in the steady state level of TIM23 complex substrates (COXIV, NDUFV2 and NDUFV1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref>) and import of [<sup>35</sup>S]-NDUFV1 and [<sup>35</sup>S]-NDUFV2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B and C</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17463.010</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Knockdown of Tim29 reduces the steady state protein levels of TIM22 substrates.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) HEK293FS cells were transfected with scrambled (control) or Tim29 siRNA targets for 96 hr.

This observation and the decrease of endogenous TIM22 complex substrates in Tim29 KD cells, prompted us to address if this decrease was due to: (i) an active role of Tim29 in the import of substrates into the inner membrane, or (ii) a role of Tim29 in the biogenesis of the TIM22 complex itself. To address this, we investigated the in vitro import and assembly of two well-established substrates of the TIM22 pathway, ANT1 and hTim23. While the assembly of ANT1 was reduced in the absence of hTim22 at 60 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>; right panel), assembly of the protein proceeded like WT in the absence of Tim29 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>; left panel). In contrast, the assembly of hTim23 was mildly reduced in mitochondria depleted of either Tim29 or hTim22 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). We next addressed the assembly of the TIM22 complex itself using the radiolabelled hTim22. In mitochondria isolated from control cells, [<sup>35</sup>S]-hTim22 efficiently assembled into the 450-kDa TIM22 complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and B</xref>, lanes 1–4), while there was a clear assembly defect into the TIM22 complex in mitochondria isolated from Tim29 KD cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, lanes 5–8). The amount of assembled TIM22 complex in Tim29 KD mitochondria was lower than that in the control mitochondria by 53%, after a 60 min-import.

Interestingly, no interaction has ever been reported between the TOM and TIM22 translocases in yeast mitochondria. Rather, the carrier pathway is described as a series of five stages, with stage 3 encompassing the transfer of substrates between the TOM and TIM22 complexes by the soluble intermembrane space Tim9-Tim10 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chacinska et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rehling et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ryan et al., 1999</xref>).</p><p>Given that Tim29 exposes a domain into the intermembrane space, we reasoned it could have a role in linking the TIM22 complex to the TOM complex in mammalian mitochondria.

We generated an N-terminally-tagged variant of TOM22, which localised to mitochondria and assembles into the TOM complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>). Upon solubilisation of the <sup>3XFLAG</sup>hTom22 mitochondria and immunoprecipitation we observed co-purification of hTom40 and hTom70 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>) as expected. We also observed a fraction of hTim9, Tim29 and hTim22 co-purifying with the TOM complex, while numerous controls of the outer membrane (hFis1), intermembrane space (cytochrome <italic>c</italic>), inner membrane (OPA1, hTim23, Glutamate carrier, COXIV) and matrix (NDUFV1, NDUFV2) did not co-elute with hTom22 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). Given that the TIM22 complex was not purified in great amounts, the data suggest the interaction between TOM and TIM22 complexes is labile in the absence of precursor protein, or under the conditions employed for the immunoprecipitation.</p><p>To explore the relationship between TOM and TIM22 further, we performed chemical cross-linking with dithiobis (succinimidylpropionate) (DSP), an amino-group-specific homobifunctional crosslinker that is cleaved by reducing agents. Mitochondria isolated from control and Tim29<sup>3XFLAG</sup> expressing cells were incubated with DSP, solubilised in SDS to dissociate non-covalent interactions and then incubated with anti-FLAG resin for purification of Tim29<sup>3XFLAG</sup>-containing species. Eluate fractions were treated under reducing conditions in order to liberate cross-linked species. Interestingly, we found hTom40 cross-linked to Tim29 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A and B</xref>), but not hTom22 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>, third panel from top). We also observed crosslinks between Tim29 and hTim9, but not hTim22 (most likely due to the lack of primary amines in the predicted Tim29 transmembrane domain, which are essential for the amine-reactive crosslinker DSP) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>). We next performed cross-linking using mitochondria isolated from cells expressing hTim10b<sup>3XFLAG</sup> and although we observed cross-links of hTim10b with both hTim9 and Tim29 we did not observe any crosslinks with hTom40 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>).

While the yeast TIM22 complex and import pathway have been extensively characterised, the human TIM22 complex has remained ill defined. Conservation of members of the human TIM22 complex (hTim22 and small TIM proteins) based on sequence homology was originally published approximately 17 years ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bauer et al., 1999</xref>). Advances and accessibility in techniques for purification of native complexes and mass spectrometry have now provided us with an opportunity to unravel the true subunit composition of the human complex. Our work brings the number of known subunits of the human TIM22 complex to five: hTim22 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sirrenberg et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bauer et al., 1999</xref>), hTim9, hTim10a, hTim10b (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mühlenbein et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gentle et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bauer et al., 1999</xref>) and Tim29 (this study). Interestingly, our immunoprecipitations and mass spectrometry data for both hTim10b<sup>3XFLAG</sup> and C19orf52<sup>3XFLAG</sup> did not reveal the presence of SDHC, suggesting the human protein is not a subunit of the human TIM22 complex, at least under the conditions in which we perform the immunoprecipitation experiments. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gebert et al. (2011)</xref> showed that the assembly of yeast Sdh3 at both Complex II and TIM22 is influenced by the formation of different sub-complexes with the highly homologous Sdh4 and Tim18. The Sdh3-Sdh4 and Sdh3-Tim18 subcomplexes subsequently deliver the protein to either Complex II or TIM22, respectively. It is feasible to suggest that the lack of Tim18 in human mitochondria could prevent the association of SDHC to the hTIM22 complex.</p><p>Tim29 was a previously uncharacterised protein, however the MitoCarta 2.0 inventory indicated the protein was a mitochondrial protein with a wide tissue distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Calvo et al., 2016</xref>). Mitochondrial subfractionation and carbonate extraction confirmed that Tim29 is an integral protein of the mitochondrial inner membrane. Given that there is only one predicted transmembrane region, we propose Tim29 is inserted into the mitochondrial inner membrane via this single transmembrane segment, with its amino-terminus facing the matrix and carboxyl-terminus exposed to the intermembrane space. Interestingly, we confirmed that targeting and proper sorting of Tim29 to the inner membrane relies on the first 89 amino acids of the protein. Although fluorescence microscopy suggested that constructs lacking the first 16 amino acids (Tim29<sup>△16</sup> and Tim29<sup>aa17-89</sup>) could be targeted to mitochondria, closer investigation using mitochondrial subfractionation and carbonate extraction reveals these proteins failed to sort to the inner membrane. Given this observation and that the knockdown of hTim22 did not influence the levels of Tim29, the protein is most likely imported via the TIM23 complex, however this needs to be experimentally verified.</p><p>Knockdown of Tim29 resulted in a reduction in the steady-state levels of ANT, but import and assembly kinetics of radiolabelled ANT were similar to control mitochondria. In contrast, hTim23, which is also a substrate for the hTIM22 complex showed an assembly defect both in vitro and at the steady state level. Such a scenario has previously been reported for the yeast TIM22 complex, with deletion of Tim18 differentially affecting the import kinetics of the AAC and Tim23 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kerscher et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Koehler et al., 2000</xref>). It is possible that depletion of Tim29 affects the activity of the human TIM23 complex by a more direct mechanism, whereas the import of ANT only requires the TIM22 complex and the residual complex remaining following knockdown is enough to import and assemble the small amounts of radiolabelled protein used in the in vitro import assay.</p><p>The depletion of Tim29 also caused a reduction in the levels of the TIM22 complex when assessed by BN-PAGE. Given that hTim22 is integrated into the membrane in mitochondria isolated from the Tim29 KD cells, we conclude that Tim29 is required for the assembly of hTim22 into the TIM22 complex. In addition to this role our data indicate that Tim29 facilitates cooperation between the TIM22 and TOM complexes, by directly interacting with hTom40. Cooperation between the TOM and TIM23 complexes is well established in yeast cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chacinska et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Waegemann et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mokranjac et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Popov-Čeleketić et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chacinska et al., 2010</xref>), however a similar interaction between the TOM and TIM22 complex has not been reported thus far. We have captured an interaction between the TOM and TIM22 complexes <italic>in organello</italic> using both Tim29 and hTom22 as bait. Furthermore, using chemical crosslinking we narrowed down specific interactions between: (i) Tim29 and hTim9; (ii) Tim29 and hTim10b; hTim10b and hTim9; and Tim29 and hTom40. We were puzzled to see an interaction between Tim29 and hTom40, since in yeast TIM23 interacts with TOM via Tom22, which exposes a domain into the intermembrane space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Waegemann et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chacinska et al., 2010</xref>). However, Shiota and colleagues (2015) recently showed that the intermembrane space chaperone, Tim10 interacts with an N-terminal region of Tom40. This suggests that the N-terminal region of Tom40 extends through the β-barrel pore into the intermembrane space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Shiota et al., 2015</xref>), and such a mechanism could be mediating the interaction between hTom40 and the intermembrane space localised region of Tim29.</p><p>In yeast the intermembrane space chaperones Tim9-Tim10 passage carrier precursors through the aqueous intermembrane space delivering them from TOM to TIM22 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chacinska et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rehling et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ryan et al., 1999</xref>). Why would a TOM-TIM22 interaction be necessary in human mitochondria? The answer could lie with the nature of the small TIM chaperones within mammalian mitochondria. Early studies by Mühlenbein and colleagues (2004) suggested that human mitochondria lack soluble Tim9-Tim10 complexes, but rather these proteins are more tightly associated with the mitochondrial inner membrane. Thus, even though the function of the small TIM proteins has been conserved through evolution, the import of carrier proteins into mammalian mitochondria is efficient even in the absence of soluble Tim9-Tim10 complexes. Therefore, it is likely that other mechanisms have evolved that serve to prevent the hydrophobic carrier proteins from aggregating in the intermembrane space. A close association between the TOM and TIM22 complexes could be one such mechanism. Our data represents a major conceptual advance and challenges the common dogma that carrier proteins are transported across the mitochondrial intermembrane space via soluble intermediates. Further investigation is necessary to tease out the precise role of the TOM-TIM22 interaction and how it is influenced by the presence of precursor protein.</p><p>In summary, by assessing the subunit composition of the human TIM22 complex, we have identified Tim29 and uncovered a novel interaction between the TIM22 and TOM complexes. This suggests that novel mechanisms are overseeing the import of carrier proteins into human mitochondria. Interestingly, Tim29 (C19orf52) was recently shown to be up-regulated in primary hepatocellular carcinoma cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Xing et al., 2015a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">2015b</xref>). Indeed, numerous human pathologies have been linked to protein import dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sokol et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Xu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sinha et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Di Fonzo et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Koehler et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Roesch et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sankala et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Davey et al., 2006</xref>).

The intensity of relevant bands was determined by subtracting the background signal to give the true relative amount of protein (assembled complexes for BN-PAGE analysis and imported proteins for SDS-PAGE analysis). Each specific time point was normalised against the value in control mitochondria with the longest import time point and were computed as a % of this control. Differences in the import of proteins between control (scrambled siRNA) and Tim29 or hTim22 knock-down mitochondria were examined using a paired two-tailed Student’s <italic>t</italic>-test on 2 d.f. based on the three log ratios (control/knockdown) of imported or assembled protein.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Measurement of mitochondrial oxygen consumption, cell proliferation and cell viability</title><p>Mitochondrial oxygen consumption was measured by high-resolution respirometry with an Oxygraph-2K oxygen electrode (Oroboros Instruments, Innsbruck, Austria) as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lim et al., 2015</xref>). Intact cells were incubated in 2 mL of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM, high glucose, pyruvate, Glutamax) (ThermoFisher) supplemented with 5% v/v fetal bovine serum and 1x penicillin/streptomycin at 37°C. Basal oxygen consumption rates were recorded, followed by the addition of 10 μM carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP) to obtain maximal oxygen consumption rates. Non-mitochondrial oxygen consumption rates were determined by the addition of 5 μM antimycin A and subtracted from basal and maximal rates. Oxygen flux was calculated using DatLab software (version 4.3.4.51, Oroboros Instruments) and expressed as pmol/s/mg of total cell protein. Each assay was performed in triplicate, with significant differences determined using a two-tailed Student’s <italic>t</italic>-test.</p><p>Proliferation of control (scrambled siRNA), hTim22 and Tim29 siRNA transfected cells was examined using the bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) Cell Proliferation ELISA kit (Abcam-ab126556). BrdU reagent was added to cells 48 hr post siRNA transfection and incubated with cells for 24 hr. BrdU incorporation into newly synthesised DNA was measured by absorbance at 450 nm and 550 nm (background) using a FLUOstar OPTIMA <italic>microplate reader</italic> (BMG LABTECH). Assays were performed in triplicate. Cell viability was determined using propidium iodide staining. Briefly, cells were harvested and washed and resuspended in FACS buffer (0.1% BSA diluted in PBS, 2 mM EDTA) followed by incubation with 3.1 µg/mL of propidium iodide (Sigma). Cells were screened by flow cytometry using Flowjo software (RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_008520">SCR_008520</ext-link>). Plots of the area of forward-scattered light (FSC-A) versus side-scattered light (SSC-A) were used as the cell gating strategy for identification of any changes in the scatter properties of the cells. Single cell events were identified using the height and width parameters in FSC and SSC. A dot plot using the area of propidium iodide (PI-A) was used to determine the relative proportion of viable and dead cells (%).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Electrophoresis and immunoblot analysis</title><p>For Blue-native gel electrophoresis mitochondrial pellets were solubilised in ice-cold digitonin-containing buffer (1% [w/v] digitonin, 20 mM Tris, pH 7.0, 0.1 mM EDTA, 50 mM NaCl, 10% [w/v] glycerol) at 1 mg/mL and incubated on ice for 15–20 min.

For mass spectrometry (MS) experiments, 5 mg of mitochondria were used. Briefly, isolated mitochondria from control cells (empty vector) and cells expressing FLAG tagged proteins were solubilised in digitonin-containing buffer (described above) supplemented with 1X complete protease (Roche) at 2 mg/mL end over end on a rotary wheel for 30–60 min at 4°C. The mitochondrial lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 16,000 <italic>g</italic> at 4°C for 30 min and diluted in solubilisation buffer (20 mM Tris, pH 7.0, 0.1 mM EDTA, 50 mM NaCl, 10% [w/v] glycerol, 1X complete protease inhibitor) so that a final digitonin concentration of 0.1% was achieved. The cleared lysates were applied to pre-equilibrated anti-FLAG agarose (Sigma-Aldrich) and incubated at 4°C for 60 min under mild agitation. Unbound material was collected and the anti-FLAG resin and bound proteins were washed X 3 in digitonin-containing buffer (0.1% digitonin [w/v], 20 mM Tris, pH 7.0, 0.1 mM EDTA, 50 mM NaCl, 10% [w/v] glycerol, 1X complete protease inhibitor). Bound proteins were eluted with 0.2 M glycine, pH 2.5. Glycine eluted fractions were electrophoretically separated using SDS-PAGE and proteins were visualised by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue stain. Gel lanes were cut into 10 x 2 mm bands using a scalpel blade and proteins were reduced, alkylated and trypsinised as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Keerthikumar et al., 2015</xref>). Briefly, the gel bands were subjected to reduction by 10 mM DTT (Bio-Rad), alkylation by 25 mM iodoacetamide (Sigma), tryptic digestion overnight with 150 ng of trypsin (Promega). Subsequently, the tryptic peptides were further extracted using acetonitrile (50% w/v) and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (0.1%). Extracted tryptic peptides were concentrated to ~10 μL by centrifugal lyophilisation and analysed by LC-MS/MS using LTQ Orbitrap Velos mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific) fitted with nanoflow reversed-phase-HPLC (Model 1200, Agilent). MGF files were generated using MSConvert using peak picking. The MGF files were searched against the NCBI RefSeq database (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2085424">AB_2085424</ext-link>) in a target decoy fashion using MASCOT (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2085424">AB_2085424</ext-link> v2.4, Matrix Science, UK). Search parameters used were: fixed modification (carbamidomethylation of cysteine; +57 Da), variable modifications (oxidation of methionine; +16 Da), three missed tryptic cleavages, 20 ppm peptide mass tolerance and 0.6 Da fragment ion mass tolerance. Peptide identifications with mascot ion score greater than the identity score were deemed significant. The relative protein abundance between the samples was obtained by estimating the ratio of normalised spectral counts (RSc) as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Keerthikumar et al., 2015</xref>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Prof. Mike Ryan (Monash University) for generously providing us with antibodies and critical reading of the manuscript, and Prof. Paul Gleeson (The University of Melbourne) for discussion and advice.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Tim29 is a novel subunit of the human TIM22 translocase and is involved in complex assembly and stability&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen Randy Schekman as the Senior Editor. One of the three reviewers has agreed to reveal his identity: Martin van der Laan (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Eukaryotes are postulated to have two specialized hetero-oligomeric protein complexes in the mitochondrial inner membrane that mediate protein import: the TIM23 complex is responsible for the import of matrix proteins and some inner membrane proteins and the TIM22 complex inserts proteins with multiple membrane-spanning regions, in particular the large number of mitochondrial metabolite carriers. Mitochondrial metabolism critically depends on these solute carrier proteins in the inner mitochondrial membrane. Global metabolic adaptations of mitochondria are cornerstones of cellular development, stress responses and pathophysiological processes, e.g. in cancer cells. In view of that, surprisingly little is known about the TIM22 protein sorting machinery (carrier translocase) that integrates metabolite carriers into the inner mitochondrial membrane. Therefore, the identification and characterization of a novel subunit of the human TIM22 complex presented in this work by Stojanovski and co-workers is of great importance for our understanding of mitochondrial biogenesis and physiology.</p><p>The authors initially identified this novel component, termed Tim29, by a proteomic analysis of affinity purified TIM22 complexes and demonstrate that Tim29 is indeed a genuine subunit of the human carrier translocase crucial for the stability and functionality of this intricate protein sorting machine. Moreover, they provide evidence that Tim29 directly contacts the general preprotein translocase of the outer membrane, the TOM complex, and may thus be involved in the formation of membrane contact sites. This finding represents a major conceptual advance in the field of mitochondrial biogenesis, because it challenges the common dogma that carrier proteins are transported across the mitochondrial intermembrane space via soluble intermediates.</p><p>Overall, the manuscript is clearly written, the experiments are of high technical quality and the conclusions are supported well by the data.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The results of the MS analysis presented in Table 1 are not very informative. What does &quot;number of peptides&quot; exactly mean? I assume it is not unique peptides? Are all the proteins listed that were detected in the analysis or were there more? Are the proteins listed according to their abundance? Thus, the complete set of data of the quantitative mass spectrometry analysis should be available and added to the supplement.</p><p>2) Does the knock-down of Tim29 in HEK293T cells have any consequences on cell proliferation and/or survival? Do the authors observe any effects on mitochondrial (energy) metabolism?</p><p>3) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, the analysis of mitochondrial protein steady state levels reveals the presence of an additional (faster migrating) band stained with antibodies against hTim22. Is this a degradation product of hTim22? If yes, it would suggest that Tim22 is proteolytically degraded if not in complex with Tim29. This may also explain, why no smaller (faster migrating) hTim22 complexes are detected in Tim29-deficient mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>)</p><p>4) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, it can be seen that the knock-down of Tim29 also decreases the levels of the TIM23 complex that mediates the import of presequence-carrying proteins into mitochondria. Does this lead to a reduction of the steady state levels or the import efficiency of TIM23 complex substrates as well?</p><p>5) The authors conclude that the critical targeting information of Tim29 resides within the amino-acid residues 17-89, but no protein construct containing only these amino acid residues was analyzed. Is Tim29(aa17-89) targeted to mitochondria?</p><p>6) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, the authors addressed a coupling function of Tim29 between the hTIM22 complex and the hTOM complex by pull down experiments. Further control proteins such as abundant outer membrane proteins (e.g. VDAC) and inner membrane proteins should be added.</p><p>The reverse IP of tagged Tom22 presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref> is not convincing. It is not possible to judge whether any of the TIM22 complex subunits gets more enriched than the control proteins SDHA and OPA1.</p><p>7) The authors performed chemical crosslinking studies to demonstrate a close proximity of Tim29 to Tom40 of the outer membrane TOM complex. In these experiments, did they also observe crosslinks of Tim29 to other TIM22 complex components that may shed light on the architecture of the human carrier translocase?</p><p>8) A quantification of several key results should be provided. Examples are:</p><p>The functional data shown in Figure 4AB: It is difficult to judge the extent of the downregulation by eye.</p><p>BN-PAGE analyses shown in Figure 5AB: The authors claim in the text that Tim22 ablation affects ANT1 assembly.

What does &quot;number of peptides&quot; exactly mean? I assume it is not unique peptides? Are all the proteins listed that were detected in the analysis or were there more? Are the proteins listed according to their abundance? Thus, the complete set of data of the quantitative mass spectrometry analysis should be available and added to the supplement.</italic> </p><p>We have removed Table 1 and have now provide the complete data set in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>.</p><p> <italic>2) Does the knock-down of Tim29 in HEK293T cells have any consequences on cell proliferation and/or survival? Do the authors observe any effects on mitochondrial (energy) metabolism?</italic> </p><p>This point has now been addressed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>. We have looked at the cellular consequences of Tim29 depletion by measuring oxygen consumption in intact cells, cell proliferation and cell survival. We show: [1] Tim29 depletion significantly reduced basal mitochondrial oxygen consumption to 65% as does the KD of hTim22 in HEK293T cells. [2] Using BrdU incorporation as a measure for cell proliferation we have established that the knockdown of both Tim29 and hTim22 has no significant impact on cell proliferation. [3] KD of Tim29 does not influence cell viability, when we measured the uptake of propidium iodide.</p><p> <italic>3) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, the analysis of mitochondrial protein steady state levels reveals the presence of an additional (faster migrating) band stained with antibodies against hTim22. Is this a degradation product of hTim22? If yes, it would suggest that Tim22 is proteolytically degraded if not in complex with Tim29. This may also explain, why no smaller (faster migrating) hTim22 complexes are detected in Tim29-deficient mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>)</italic> </p><p>To address this query we monitored the levels of hTim22 over time by western blot in mitochondria isolated from Tim29 KD cells, but established that this lower species was an irregularity of this particular experiment and not a degradation product of hTim22. To avoid confusion we have replaced the entire panel for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>.</p><p> <italic>4) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, it can be seen that the knock-down of Tim29 also decreases the levels of the TIM23 complex that mediates the import of presequence-carrying proteins into mitochondria. Does this lead to a reduction of the steady state levels or the import efficiency of TIM23 complex substrates as well?</italic> </p><p>We have now included <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref> that shows that the TIM23 substrates (COXIV, NDUFV1 and NDUFV3) are moderately reduced at the steady state level and that the import kinetics of NDUFV1 and NDUFV3 is also reduced. As suggested in point 4 we believe these effects are secondary due to the reduced levels of the TIM23 complex in the Tim29 KD cells.</p><p> <italic>5) The authors conclude that the critical targeting information of Tim29 resides within the amino-acid residues 17-89, but no protein construct containing only these amino acid residues was analyzed. Is Tim29(aa17-89) targeted to mitochondria?</italic> </p><p>We have generated a construct encoding Tim29aa17-89 fused to a 3XFLAG tag. When expressed in HeLa cells Tim29aa17-89 is targeted to mitochondria. This data has been included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>. However, as discussed below (Minor Point #1) this construct and C19ord52Δ16 are NOT properly sorted to the inner membrane. Thus, we conclude the first 16 amino acids of C19orf52 (Tim29) are essential for proper mitochondrial sorting.</p><p> <italic>6) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, the authors addressed a coupling function of Tim29 between the hTIM22 complex and the hTOM complex by pull down experiments. Further control proteins such as abundant outer membrane proteins (e.g. VDAC) and inner membrane proteins should be added.</italic></p><p> <italic>The reverse IP of tagged Tom22 presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref> is not convincing. It is not possible to judge whether any of the TIM22 complex subunits gets more enriched than the control proteins SDHA and OPA1.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewer for raising this point. To address this concern we repeated this experiment using a larger quantity of mitochondria (1.5 mg as opposed to 0.6 mg), to enhance the quality and clarity of data. We have also incorporated a large panel of control antibodies from all four mitochondrial subcompartments to show that TIM22 subunits are coming down specifically. This is now shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>.</p><p> <italic>7) The authors performed chemical crosslinking studies to demonstrate a close proximity of Tim29 to Tom40 of the outer membrane TOM complex. In these experiments, did they also observe crosslinks of Tim29 to other TIM22 complex components that may shed light on the architecture of the human carrier translocase?</italic> </p><p>Following the suggestion of the reviewer we now show crosslinks between Tim29 and Tim9 (displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>) and crosslinks between Tim10b and Tim29 and Tim10b with Tim9 (displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>). Although we did not detect a crosslink between hTim22 and Tim29 we believe this is due to the lack of primary amines in the predicted Tim29 transmembrane domain, which are essential for the amine-reactive crosslinker DSP (used in our experiments). This new data has significantly extended our understanding of the architecture of the humanTIM22 complex.</p><p> <italic>8) A quantification of several key results should be provided. Examples are:</italic> </p><p><italic>The functional data shown in Figure 4AB: It is difficult to judge the extent of the downregulation by eye.</italic> </p><p>Quantifications have now been included and displayed graphically below the panels of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>.</p><p><italic>BN-PAGE analyses shown in Figure 5AB: The authors claim in the text that Tim22 ablation affects ANT1 assembly. I fail to see that. If there is a difference, it is very small. Thus, if the authors want to make this claim, they should provide loading controls, quantify the data and provide some statistical measure of the experimental variation.</italic> </p><p>As suggested we have now included loading controls and quantifications for these gels (displayed beneath BN-PAGE gels in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and B</xref>), which do indeed support the finding that ANT1 assembly is reduced in the absence of hTim22, but not Tim29.</p><p><italic>The same also applies for Figure 6ABC. If I understood the authors correctly they want to say that import of Tim22 is not affected in the Tim29 knock down but assembly of Tim22 into the TIM complex is. This is probably correct, but the claim needs to be supported by a quantitative analysis of the SDS and the BN Gels.</italic></p><p>We have now included loading controls for the BN-PAGE experiments and quantitative analysis of the BN-PAGE (displayed beneath BN-PAGE gels in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and B</xref>) and SDS-PAGE gels (now <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A and B</xref> (NOT 6C)). Given the importance of the observation that hTim22 assembly is significantly reduced in the Tim29 KD mitochondria we analysed these experiments using a two-tailed Student’s t-test (outlined within the text) and obtained a t[2]= 6.02 (p &lt; 0.05), demonstrating a significant reduction in the assembly of hTim22 into the mature complex in Tim29 KD mitochondria. To the contrary, mitochondria isolated from hTim22 KD consistently displayed a moderate increase (~20%) in assembled TIM22 complex in (t[2]= -5.07, p &lt; 0.05).</p></body></sub-article></article>
