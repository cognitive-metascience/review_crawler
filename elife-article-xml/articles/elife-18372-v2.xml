We employed fluorescence imaging and GCaMP6 reporter mice to generate retinotopic maps, revealing additional regions of retinotopic organization that extend into barrel and retrosplenial cortices. Aligning retinotopic maps to architectonic borders, we found a mismatch in border location, indicating that architectonic borders are not aligned with the retinotopic transition at the vertical meridian. We also assessed the representation of visual space within each region, finding that four visual areas bordering V1 (LM, P, PM and RL) display complementary representations, with overlap primarily at the central hemifield. Our results extend our understanding of the organization of mouse cortex to include up to 16 distinct retinotopically organized regions.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.18372.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.18372.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18372.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Our eyes send information about the world around us to a region on the surface of the brain called the visual cortex, which is made up of a series of interconnected areas. Researchers have studied the anatomy and activity of these areas to generate maps that show how these areas are arranged. For example, architectonic borders are drawn where there are abrupt changes in the density of cells, or the degree to which they are stained by certain chemicals. Maps based on architectonics and those based on brain activity are thought to exhibit matching borders between visual areas.</p><p>Zhuang et al. used animaging approach to produce detailed maps of the visual cortex of mice. The approach uses a fluorescent protein called GCaMP6 to indicate levels of activity in the brain while the mice were exposed to visual cues. Furthermore, Zhuang et al. added a second step to this approach to reveal the architectonic borders of the areas in the visual cortex. This made it possible to compare the locations of activity-based and anatomical borders in a single mouse.</p><p>Zhuang et al. found that maps of the visual cortex based on architectonics do not completely match those based on activity. These findings help reconcile the differences between maps of mouse visual cortex produced by other studies. It is not clear whether a similar mismatch in architectonic and activity-based border locations exists in other animals, such as primates.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.18372.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.18372.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>cortex</kwd><kwd>topographic map</kwd><kwd>visual map</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Allen Institute for Brain Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhuang</surname><given-names>Jun</given-names></name><name> <surname>Ng</surname><given-names>Lydia</given-names></name><name> <surname>Williams</surname><given-names>Derric</given-names></name><name> <surname>Li</surname><given-names>Yang</given-names></name><name><surname>Garrett</surname><given-names>Marina</given-names> </name><name> <surname>Waters</surname><given-names>Jack</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS078067</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name> <surname>Waters</surname><given-names>Jack</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>An expanded map of mouse cortex reveals the expansion of retinotopic organization into barrel and retrosplenial cortices.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Mammalian visual cortex consists of a series of interconnected areas, which correspond to topographically-organized collections of neurons with similar functional properties and patterns of connectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Van Essen, 2003</xref>).

Architectonic borders are associated with changes in staining (chemoarchitectonics), cell density (cytoarchitectonics), or myelination patterns (myeloarchitechtonics). Retinotopic borders are associated with a change in chirality of the retinotopic map and have been identified anatomically by labeling projections between visual areas, and functionally by recording the responses of neurons with electrodes or imaging techniques. The architectonic and retinotopic borders of visual areas in the mouse are generally thought to be co-aligned, but the shapes and locations of visual areas can differ across studies.</p><p>We generated retinotopic maps from GCaMP6 transgenic mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Madisen et al., 2015</xref>) and compared functional retinotopic, anatomical retinotopic, chemoarchitectonic, cytoarchitectonic and myeloarchitechtonic maps. Our results revealed new regions of retinotopic organization in mouse neocortex, some within and some outside the accepted boundaries of mouse visual cortex, and a mismatch between retinotopic and architectonic maps that may help reconcile the differences between visual area maps generated by these complementary approaches.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>GCaMP6 expression patterns and fluorescence signals</title><p>We mapped visual areas in three GCaMP6 reporter lines: Ai95(RGL-GCaMP6f), Ai96(RGL-GCaMP6s) and Ai93(TITL-GCaMP6f).

Briefly, the sign map was lightly filtered and thresholded to create an initial parcellation of cortex into patches. The threshold was tuned manually, with little change in the incidence, shape, border locations and area of most patches over the range of threshold values employed (0.2â0.4, mean Â± SEM of 0.32Â Â±Â 0.004, 14 mice; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2</xref>).

Each area contains one retinotopic map and therefore appears in field sign maps as a single, distinct, positive or negative field sign patch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sereno et al., 1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">1995</xref>). Across mice these patches are arranged in a stereotyped configuration with consistent positioning relative to each other. To identify regions in our maps objectively, we used the automated image analysis approach described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Garrett et al. (2014)</xref>, which identifies field sign patches that each contain one and only one map of retinotopic space.</p><p>Most field sign patches were visible after only 15 min of imaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>; 10 sweeps of the stimulus in each direction) and maps were stable across imaging sessions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1</xref>). The ability to quickly generate maps that are comparable to those resulting from 1â2 hr of red-wavelength reflectance-based imaging under anesthesia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Garrett et al., 2014</xref>) is a practical advantage of GCaMP6 fluorescence-based mapping. Typically, we further reduced the effects on ongoing activity by presenting 20â40 sweeps of the stimulus in each direction (imaging for 30â60 min). Like previous authors, we found that maps displayed consistent structure across mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). The arrangement of areas was broadly consistent with published maps of the mouse visual system (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wang and Burkhalter, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Marshel et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Garrett et al., 2014</xref>), but differed in several respects. Key differences include additional visual field sign patches, particularly medial to AM and PM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). The narrow strip of tissue between AM/PM and retrosplenial cortex is generally termed MM or V2MM and is considered part of visual cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wang and Burkhalter, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Franklin and Paxinos, 2007</xref>), but its retinotopic structure remains uncharacterized. GCaMP6 fluorescence-based maps revealed consistent structure in MM, with a positive field sign patch medial to AM (MMA) and a negative field sign patch medial to PM (MMP). Furthermore, there were one or more positive field sign patches medial to MMA and MMP, likely in retrosplenial cortex. The most consistent was a positive field sign region which our automated segmentation routine generally failed to separate from PM. Finally, in lateral visual cortex, we observed a negative field sign patch anterior and lateral to RL, which we termed RLL.<fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18372.014</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Retinotopic organization of mouse visual cortex.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Field sign maps from six mice, illustrating differences between mouse lines and individual mice.

Across these 14 mice, the maximum numbers of patches in an individual map were nine for positive and seven for negative field sign patches. Maps from Emx1-Ai96 and Emx1-Ai93 mice were similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), with 11.75 field sign patches in Emx1-Ai96 (range 11â14, 4 Emx1-Ai96 mice) and 12 field sign patches in Emx1-Ai93 mice (range 9â14, 10 Emx1-Ai93 mice).</p><p>Our results indicate that there is retinotopic organization in regions of the mouse cortex in which retinotopy had not been reported. In our mouse lines, GCaMP6 is present in neuronal somata and dendrites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>) and presumably in axons. Accordingly, some of these new field sign patches may result from retinotopically-organized projections originating in surrounding visual areas. Since our results do not indicate whether somata in these regions are retinotopically-organized, we refer to these regions of extended retinotopic organization as 'patches' rather than visual 'areas'.</p><p>We performed further calculations to characterize and visualize mouse-to-mouse variability and test the consistency of each field sign patch. To visualize mouse-to-mouse variability, we calculated a variance map in which the intensity of each pixel represents the variance of the field sign (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Variance was lower towards the centers of field sign patches and higher towards the borders, but there was little difference in the mean variance per unit area between areas (not shown), except for V1, which displayed low variance per unit area.</p><p>To quantify mouse-to-mouse consistency in area identification, we calculated the incidence of each field sign patch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). 10 field sign patches (V1, LM, LI, AL, RL, AM, PM, MMA, MMP, P) occurred inÂ &gt;85% of Emx1-Ai93 and Emx1-Ai96 mice (â¥12 of 14 mice). LI and LLA were frequently along the lateral edge of the cranial window, which may account for the lower incidence of LLA in our maps (10 of 13 mice). Similarly, M was near the postero-medial edge of the window and was observed in 5 of 9 mice (in 4 of 7 Emx1-Ai93 and 1 of 4 Emx1-Ai96 mice). POR was absent from our maps, probably because it was invariably outside the cranial window.</p><p>Of the areas that were within the cranial window, the anterior patches A and RLL occurred least consistently. Area A is a putative negative field sign region medial to RL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wang and Burkhalter, 2007</xref>) which maps inconsistently with red-wavelength reflectance and autofluorescence imaging in anesthetized mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Marshel et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Garrett et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tohmi et al., 2014</xref>). We observed a negative field sign patch in this location in 1 of 14 mice and a positive field sign patch (which segmented separately from RL) in 3 of 14 mice (2 of 10 Emx1-Ai93 mice and 1 of 4 Emx1-Ai96 mice). The presence of area A in GCaMP6 fluorescence maps from only 1 of 14 mice probably reflects the difficulty of mapping this area, in which projections from V1 are diffuse and their topographic organization appears weaker than that of many other areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wang and Burkhalter, 2007</xref>). RLL was observed in 60% of mice (3 of 10 Emx1-Ai93 and 3 of 4 Emx1-Ai96 mice). In summary, of the three new field sign patches, MMA and MMP appeared consistently across mice, whereas RLL was less consistent.</p><p>We further tested the consistency of location of each patch in the mean sign map using k-means cluster analysis, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Garrett et al., 2014</xref>). Cluster metric (C<sub>k</sub>) values were LM 0.23; LI 0.42; AL 0.36; LLA 1.17; RL 0.42; RLL 1.29; AM 0.77; PM 0.63; MMA 0.69; MMP 1.0; P 0.39. (Maps were aligned to the centroid of V1.) Of the three new patches, MMA and MMP were each associated with a tightly-packed cluster of patch centroids that differed from a shuffled distribution. In contrast, and consistent with its relatively low incidence, RLL was associated with a non-significant cluster (C<sub>k</sub>Â =Â 1.29).</p><p>To summarize our results for the three new field sign patches, MMA and MMP mapped consistently: they appear on the mean field sign map, were present in almost every mouse and their locations relative to other field sign patches were sufficiently consistent that they were associated with a significant k-means cluster. In contrast, RLL was consistent enough to appear on the mean field sign map, but was present in only 6 of 14 mice and was associated with a non-significant k-means cluster.</p><p>Our ability to map additional regions of retinotopic organization likely results from the superior signal-to-noise ratio of GCaMP6 fluorescence-based maps relative to intrinsic signals. Consistent with this hypothesis, the amplitudes of fluorescence changes were smaller in MMA, MMP, RLL and LLA than for other visual field sign patches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Of these four patches, LLA was first mapped recently with red reflectance-based imaging and extensive averaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Garrett et al., 2014</xref>) and the remaining three have now been revealed with GCaMP6 fluorescence mapping. RLL exhibits the smallest mean change in fluorescence of any of the visual regions within our maps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>) and this weak activation, and resulting low signal-to-noise ratio, likely accounts for the inconsistency of RLL in our maps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Relationship between retinotopic and architectonic borders</title><p>The new field sign patches identified in our GCaMP6 fluorescence-based maps extend far beyond the borders of V1, in some cases byÂ &gt;2 mm. It is likely that some of these newly-mapped patches extend into architectonically-defined cortical areas surrounding visual cortex. For example, AM and PM are separated from retrosplenial cortex by V2MM. This narrow strip of tissue would appear large enough to accommodate MMA and MMP, but not the long medial extension of PM, which is likely, therefore, to be within retrosplenial cortex. Similarly, the architectonically-defined borders of V1 and barrel cortex are separated by a thin band of tissue, raising the possibility that RLL, and perhaps RL, might extend into barrel cortex.</p><p>To compare retinotopic and chemoarchitectonic borders, after retinotopic mapping we processed tissue for cytochrome C oxidase staining. We labeled surface vasculature with a fluorescent dye by transcardial perfusion immediately before fixation, used the vasculature to align images acquired in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1</xref>), after fixation (whole mount, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), after flattening (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>) and after sectioning parallel to the cortical surface and staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>) and compared retinotopic and chemoarchitectonic borders from 4 Emx1-Ai96 mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4GâJ</xref>).

The lateral border of chemoarchitectonically-defined V1 runs through functionally-defined areas RL and LM. The distance between the chemoarchitectonically-defined lateral border of V1 and that defined by functional retinotopy, measured along the LM/RL border, was 312Â Â±Â 88 Âµm (4 Emx1-Ai96 mice).</p><p>One possible explanation for the mismatch is that the cytochrome oxidase-rich region of visual cortex extends beyond the reversal in retinotopy that defines the functional border of V1. Alternatively, the apparent mismatch in border locations might be an experimental artifact arising from misalignment of the maps during fixation and subsequent histological processing, but misalignment on this scale is unlikely given our fluorescent marker-based registration process and direct alignment of images from live and fixed tissue.</p><p>To further clarify the alignment of functional and architectonic boundaries, we identified cytoarchitectonic borders in Rorb-Ai93 mice. Rorb drives expression preferentially in layer four and upper layer five pyramidal neurons, leading to stronger labeling of primary sensory areas than of surrounding cortex (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://connectivity.brain-map.org/transgenic/search?page_num=0&amp;page_size=29&amp;no_paging=false&amp;search_type=line-name&amp;search_term=Rorb-IRES2-Cre">http://connectivity.brain-map.org/transgenic/search?page_num=0&amp;page_size=29&amp;no_paging=false&amp;search_type=line-name&amp;search_term=Rorb-IRES2-Cre</ext-link>). Resting GCaMP6 fluorescence was greater in primary sensory areas than in surrounding regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), enabling cytoarchitectonic borders to be identified by thresholding GCaMP6 fluorescence images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Consequently, GCaMP6 fluorescence-based retinotopic maps were inherently aligned to cytoarchitectonic borders in Rorb-Ai93 mice, eliminating the potential for misalignment resulting from tissue processing. Comparison of cytoarchitectonic and functional retinotopic borders again indicated a mismatch, with the lateral border of cytoarchitectonically-defined V1 being lateral of the functionally-defined border and running through functionally-defined areas RL and LM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C,D</xref>). The distance between the cytoarchitectonically-defined lateral border of V1 and that defined by functional retinotopy, measured along the LM/RL border, was 120Â Â±Â 38 Âµm (10 Rorb-Ai93 mice).<fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18372.018</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Registration of functional retinotopic maps to cytoarchitectonic borders.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) GCaMP6 fluorescence image from a Rorb-Ai93 mouse.

Here again, the lateral border of cytoarchitectonically-defined V1 was lateral of the functionally-defined border of V1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>), by 236 Âµm (measured along the LM/RL border).</p><p>Three methods have been particularly influential in the generation of established maps of the mouse visual cortex: architectonics, using various stains, including cytochrome oxidase; functional retinotopy, primarily measured with electrodes; and projection-based retinotopy, in which axonal projections between visual areas were used to identify locations with matching retinotopy. Having measured the mismatch between borders based on architectonics and on functional retinotopy, we next sought to determine whether borders based on projection-based retinotopy more closely match functional retinotopic borders or architectonic borders, and particularly to determine whether there is a mismatch between the lateral border of V1 from projection-based retinotopy and that based on architectonics.</p><p>To investigate the alignment of architectonic and projection-based retinotopic borders, we used data from the Allen Mouse Brain Connectivity Atlas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Oh et al., 2014</xref>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://connectivity.brain-map.org/">http://connectivity.brain-map.org/</ext-link>). We selected projection data from 99 mice, each with a single injection of anterograde fluorescent tracer into V1. These injections, and the resulting projection maps, were registered to a three-dimensional reference atlas of the mouse brain built from serial section image data sets from 1675 mice. The reference atlas includes tissue autofluorescence images and in the top projection, the major cytoarchitectonic areas (including primary visual cortex, whisker and digit barrels in primary sensory cortex, primary auditory cortex and retrosplenial cortex) are readily visible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>) due to the enhanced autofluorescence of regions with increased myelination.<fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18372.019</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Retinotopy of projections from V1.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Locations of injections into V1 in 99 mice, selected from the Allen Brain Connectivity Atlas.

After projecting the maximum connectivity in superficial cortex to the brain surface, we plot two pseudo-colored top-views in which color indicates the location in V1 to which each pixel in the image was most strongly connected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B,C</xref>). Due to the retinotopic organization of V1, these two plots are analogous to maps of altitude and azimuth retinotopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E,F</xref>). From these plots we generated the projection-based equivalent of a field sign map, a 'projection sign map' (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>), used our numerical routine to derive area borders (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>) and overlaid these borders onto the autofluorescence top projection from the reference atlas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). Due to the registration of all images in the Connectivity Atlas to the 3D reference atlas, the projection sign map and area borders are inherently aligned.</p><p>Again, the results indicate that retinotopy extends into primary somatosensory and retrosplenial cortices, with RLL mapping to the posterior whiskers in posterior barrel cortex. LLA also appears to extend into auditory cortex. Regarding the relative positions of the borders of V1, the myeloarchitectonically-defined lateral border of V1 (here visible as a transition between relatively bright autofluorescence in V1 and dimmer autofluorescence more laterally) was lateral to the lateral border of V1 defined by projection-based retinotopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E,F</xref>). The distance between the myeloarchitectonically-defined lateral border of V1 and that defined by projection-based retinotopy, measured along the LM/RL border, was 180 Âµm.</p><p>The above comparisons of retinotopic maps with architectonic borders using three different methods lead us to two main conclusions. Firstly, retinotopic organization extends into retrosplenial and primary somatosensory cortices in the mouse. RLL is entirely within barrel cortex. The retinotopic map observed in retrosplenial cortex was often continuous with the map in PM, and was not segmented into two distinct regions by our algorithm. The lateral architectonic boundary of retrosplenial cortex extends from the posterior extent of MMP and separates the patch identified as PM into two pieces: a lateral portion that runs parallel to the medial border of V1 and is similar to PM as described previously, and a medial extension within retrosplenial cortex. In subsequent figures we separate these two portions of PM along the approximate lateral boundary of retrosplenial cortex. Secondly, there is a mismatch between the borders of V1 as defined by architectonic markers and by retinotopy, with the architectonically-defined border of V1 lateral to the retinotopic border of V1 by up toÂ ~300 Âµm (four measurements: 312, 120, 236 and 180 Âµm; mean 212 Âµm).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Single-cell retinotopy along the V1-LM border</title><p>With what precision can we locate borders with widefield imaging, which presumably reports the mean retinotopy of many neurons at each location?

To increase the effect of this additional contamination, we first multiplied the amplitude of the contaminating trace by 10. From the modified traces, we recalculated the somatic altitude and azimuth maps with and without neuropil subtraction. As expected, in the absence of neuropil subtraction, the added signal shifted all somatic tuning towards the coordinates of the added signal, whereas with neuropil subtraction enabled, the somatic altitude and azimuth maps were almost identical to the unmodified maps).

Neuropil contamination, the presence of fluorescence from surrounding GCaMP-labeled processes in the somatic pixels, is a characteristic of densely labeled tissue. We extracted fluorescence from the neuropil surrounding each neuron and, as expected, found that these local regions of neuropil displayed receptive fields (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7âfigure supplement 2</xref>). Many of the neuropil regions displayed similar retinotopy to their parent somata. To correct for neuropil contamination, for each soma we measured and subtracted neuropil fluorescence from the surrounding pixels. Numerical simulations indicated that this approach was effective in removing neuropil contamination from somatic fluorescence measurements and confirmed that the map of somatic retinotopy was not an artifact of neuropil contamination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7âfigure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>Most somata displayed On and Off receptive subfields after neuropil subtraction (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7âfigure supplement 1</xref>).

For each neuron, we summed On and Off subfields and determined the center of the summed receptive field, then created somatic altitude and azimuth maps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7I</xref>). Receptive field centers formed an orderly map of retinotopy with a progression of altitudes along the V1-LM border and azimuth changing parallel to the V1-LM border. Importantly, the gradient in somatic azimuth reversed at the border measured by widefield mapping.</p><p>For most neurons, somatic altitude and azimuth were similar to the altitude and azimuth in the local widefield maps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A,B</xref>). For a more quantitative comparison, for each neuron we plot somatic altitude and azimuth as a function of distance from the V1-LM border (defined by widefield fluorescence; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7J</xref>). Somata with zero azimuth were close to the border (distanceÂ =Â 0) and azimuth increased approximately linearly with distance from the border, into V1 and into LM. As expected, the gradient of the relationship between somatic azimuth and distance to the border was steeper in LM than in V1, indicating greater cortical magnification in V1 than in LM near the border.</p><p>Finally, we pooled results from three experiments, calculating the mean somatic altitude and azimuth as a function of distance from the V1-LM border in 20 Âµm bins.

The lowest-azimuth bin was centered at â30 Âµm, indicating that the single-cell border was 30 Âµm lateral of the widefield retinotopic border.

The exquisite signal-to-noise ratio of GCaMP6 permitted rapid mapping and also revealed several new field sign patches, enabling us to map the medial extent of visual cortex. Adding the four new field sign patches (MMA, MMP, RLL, RS) to 12 published areas (V1, LM, LI, AL, LLA, RL, A, AM, PM, M, P, POR), mouse cortex contains 16 distinct retinotopically-organized regions.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Extension of retinotopic organization</title><p>Our results indicate that retinotopic organization is more extensive in mouse cortex than previously appreciated. We observed five instances of extended retinotopy. Firstly, area P extends across the posterior extent of V1. Tracer injections into V1 have revealed projections into this region in rat and mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Olavarria and Montero, 1981</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Coogan and Burkhalter, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wang et al., 2012</xref>) and recent maps have suggested the presence of one or more positive field sign patches posterior to V1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Garrett et al., 2014</xref>). The signal-to-noise ratio of our measurements may be particularly limited in this posterior region, along the edge of our cranial window. Furthermore, at its posterior extent cortex is folded and abuts the transverse sinus, and there may be additional retinotopic structure under the sinus or in the folded region that we were unable to access. This additional region may include representation of the center of coverage of V1, which is absent from our map of coverage of P.</p><p>We identified two field sign patches in theÂ anterior and posterior aspects of MM, the narrow strip of visual cortex immediately lateral to retrosplenial cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wang and Burkhalter, 2007</xref>). These two patches were labeled MMA and MMP. Variations in the density of neurons immunoreactive for nonphosphorylated neurofilament protein across medial visual areas have led to the suggestion that MM contains multiple distinct regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Van der Gucht et al., 2007</xref>). Furthermore, MM receives direct projections from V1 that terminate in distinct anterior and posterior regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wang and Burkhalter, 2007</xref>) and likely correspond to MMA and MMP.</p><p>Retinotopy extends into retrosplenial and barrel cortices. Retinotopic organization presumably facilitates the processing of multimodal information in these areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Olcese et al., 2013</xref>). For example, like RL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Garrett et al., 2014</xref>), RLL is biased towards the nasal, lower field and may convey to barrel cortex visual information on whisker location and nearby objects. Similarly, the presence of a visual map in retrosplenial cortex is consistent with its visual responsiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Murakami et al., 2015</xref>) and its role in spatial memory and navigation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Vann et al., 2009</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Limitations of mapping with population imaging and simple visual stimuli</title><p>We used a flickering checkerboard to drive cortical activity during retinotopic mapping, but some areas might be activated more effectively, and mapped more readily, with other visual stimuli. In primates, for example, neurons in higher visual areas are more strongly activated by complex stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Nassi and Callaway, 2009</xref>). In the mouse, some higher areas are preferentially activated by high or low spatial and temporal frequencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Marshel et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andermann et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Roth et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tohmi et al., 2014</xref>), leading to the suggestion that simple stimuli with different spatial and temporal frequency characteristics might preferentially activate different regions of cortex. However, the checkerboard pattern includes sharp borders between black and white regions of the checkerboard that naturally include a broad band of spatial and temporal frequencies. Furthermore, retinotopically-organized regions occupy most of the territory between primary sensory areas in posterior cortex, suggesting that there are few additionalÂ visual areas to be discovered in the mouse. As a result, we would not expect substantial differences in maps of higher visual areas generated with checkerboards with distinct spatial or temporal frequency band characteristics.</p><p>Our maps are derived from population imaging, which naturally imposes limits on the resolution with which we can map areas and borders. Furthermore, imaging of widefield fluorescence signals at the brain surface is strongly contaminated by vasculature artifacts, which we address by focusing below the surface of cortex. Defocusing has a blurring effect and can limit effective resolution. Widefield fluorescence signals in Emx1 mice are presumably the average of fluorescence from many neurons, with dendrites and axons providing fluorescence signals far from the soma. Processes probablyÂ cross regional borders, making it likely that dendritic and axonal signals from neurons on one side of the border contribute to fluorescence on the other side of the border. It is unclear the extent to which border-crossing processes blur borders since blurring will depend on many factors, including whether stimulus-locked changes in the fluorescence of processes more closely match stimulus-locked changes of the parent soma or of the local network into which the processes extend. Given the potential for blurring of borders, it is perhaps surprising that widefield and 2-photon images give border locations which are separated by only a few tens of micrometers.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Cortical regions, field sign patches and visual areas</title><p>The cellular and laminar origins of visually-evoked changes in widefield GCaMP6 fluorescence remain unknown. GCaMP6 is likely expressed throughout excitatory neurons, including their axons, and it is possible that some of the observed retinotopic organization, such as that in retrosplenial and barrel cortices, results from retinotopically-organized axons. Indeed, the lack of retinotopy in retrosplenial and barrel cortices of Rorb-Ai93 mice suggests a lack of somatic retinotopy in layer four and upper layer five in these regions.</p><p>We have used the term 'patch' to refer to regions of cortex identified by our analysis routine. We define patches as regions of cortex with retinotopic organization that are distinct from neighboring patches, either because of a reversal of chirality in the visual map or because the neighboring patches contain redundant representations of visual space. We use the term 'patch' to avoid implying any specific mechanistic basis for the retinotopic organization, such as somatic retinotopy. We have used 'region' simply to refer to part of cortex, with no intended implications regarding structure or properties.</p><p>'Visual area' is a more established term that implies the consistent identification of borders with multiple approaches, including anatomical and functional measurements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Orban et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wandell et al., 2007</xref>). Furthermore, we consider somatic retinotopy necessary in a visual area. In the absence of evidence of somatic retinotopy and supporting evidence from other techniques, we have, where possible, avoided using 'area' to refer to some patches.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Retinotopic and architectonic borders</title><p>In maps of mouse visual areas drawn with the assistance of architectonic boundaries, the borders of V1, AL, LM and RL all intersect at a common point (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wang and Burkhalter, 2007</xref>). Our results indicate that in retinotopic maps obtained with functional imaging and with projection-based mapping, the lateral border of V1 is more medial than the architectonic boundary. As a result, V1 and AL lack a common border. The territory between V1 and AL is occupied by RL and LM, which share a border extendingÂ ~100â300 Âµm. The architectonic border of V1 runs through RL and LM and typically intersects the medial tip of AL. Hence the medial tip of AL intersects the lateral border of architectonically-defined V1, but not retinotopically-defined V1. The border mismatch helps explain why the relative positions of visual areas, and their points of intersection, can differ on maps based on results from different techniques.</p><p>The mismatch between the architectonic and retinotopic borders of V1 is consistent in our results across three methods, indicating that the architectonic border of V1 may correlate with functions other than retinotopic reversal. One possibility is that the cytochrome oxidase-rich region includes the binocular region around the lateral border of V1, which would help explain the mismatch since areas RL and LM include representations of the binocular zone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wagor et al., 1980</xref>). Another possibility is that there is a thin, largely monocular zone along the medial edge of LM and RL which is cytochrome oxidase-rich (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Laing et al., 2015</xref>). It is unclear whether there is a mismatch in the architectonic and retinotopic borders of other visual areas, such as between LM and LI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wang et al., 2011</xref>) and further studies will be required to establish the similarity of architectonic and retinotopic border locations for other visual areas.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Representation of visual space and the organization of mouse visual areas</title><p>A prominent feature of GCaMP6-based retinotopic maps is the four positive field sign areas (RL, LM, P and PM) neighboring V1 that form an almost continuous ring, broken only by the negative field sign area AM. This arrangement resembles early visual areas in primates, in which V1 is a negative field sign region surrounded by V2, and V2 is a continuous strip of positive field sign tissue broken only at a single point (anterior tip of the calcarine sulcus; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gattass et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sereno et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Warnking et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Silver and Kastner, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wilms et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Laumann et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Early studies of mouse visual cortex revealed a retinotopic map in V1 and a second map anterior and lateral to V1, leading this second region to be named V2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wagor et al., 1980</xref>). Further studies revealed several overlapping maps within mouse and rat V2, which was therefore split into several named visual areas, including LM and RL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Olavarria and Montero, 1981</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">1984</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Malach, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Olavarria et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Thomas and Espinoza, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Coogan and Burkhalter, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wang and Burkhalter, 2007</xref>). Subsequent studies have documented additional distinctions between the four positive field sign areas neighboring V1. For example, a study of the laminar termination patterns of axonal projections between cortical areas suggested that the areas around V1 occupy different positions in the hierarchy of visual areas in rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Coogan and Burkhalter, 1993</xref>). Consistent with this suggestion, medial and lateral regions of visual cortex, likely corresponding to LM, RL and PM, display different response latencies in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Polack and Contreras, 2012</xref>), and neurons in these areas differ in their mean receptive field sizes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wang and Burkhalter, 2007</xref>) and in their tuning to the spatial and temporal characteristics of visual stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andermann et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Marshel et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Roth et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Glickfeld et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tohmi et al., 2014</xref>). These studies all support the identification of multiple visual areas in the tissue bordering V1, in contrast with primates where the tissue neighboring V1 is considered a single visual area (V2).</p><p>Our results indicate that the visual field representations of the four areas around V1 (LM, P, PM, RL) are complementary, with the outline of the coverage of these four areas matching the outline of V1 coverage. Our results likely underestimate the range of visual coverage in each area and the overlap between areas. V1 included a visual coverage range ofÂ ~60Â° in altitude andÂ ~90Â° in azimuth, comparable to measurements with reflectance-based imaging (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Garrett et al., 2014</xref>) but smaller than the range measured with single-cell electrical recordings (~100Â° in altitude andÂ ~150Â° in azimuth; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wagor et al. (1980)</xref>. Single-cell recordings are likely to provide a larger range for two main reasons.</p><p>Firstly, widefield mapping identifies retinotopic position based on the peak of activity, thereby emphasizing the receptive field center. The outer limits at which visual stimuli can evoke activity in V1 will be expanded, by approximately the radius of the largest receptive fields of neurons at the edges of V1. A more pronounced expansion in effective coverage is expected in higher visual areas, where receptive field sizes are larger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wang and Burkhalter, 2007</xref>). Expanded coverage, calculated using published receptive field sizes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wang and Burkhalter, 2007</xref>) is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8âfigure supplement 1</xref>. For V1, expanded coverage includesÂ ~70Â° in altitude andÂ ~100Â° in azimuth. Mean local receptive field size may change across a visual area, which possiblyÂ accounts for the mismatch of coverage at the borders of neighboring areas (e.g. the V1-LM border, where the outer limits of the estimated V1 and LM coverage differ).</p><p>Secondly, widefield fluorescence measures the average retinotopy of the local population of neurons.Â Single-cell receptive field centers vary around the mean retinotopy. For example, in V1 most pyramidal neuron receptive fields are withinÂ ~7Â degrees of the local population average (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bonin et al., 2011</xref>). How variability relative to the mean local receptive field center changes towards the borders of V1 or in other visual areas is unknown, but an expansion of coverage of 7Â degrees at each border (in addition to the expansion due to receptive field size) would result in total coverage of V1 ofÂ ~85Â° in altitude andÂ ~115Â° in azimuth, closer to the numbers from single-cell recordings. These differences between population and single-cell coverages may explain the small apparent regions of coverage of many higher visual areas, in which receptive field sizes and perhaps also the scatter in receptive field centers are greater than in V1. Even allowing for some expansion of coverage for each visual area, our results indicate that no higher visual areas (even those immediately surrounding V1) contain a complete description of the visual hemifield. Hence information on features that subtend more than approximately a quarter of the visual field will be routed to different early visual areas, with the result that information on features in different locations within a single visual scene will be processed in regions with different functional properties. Further studies will be needed to understand the advantages and limitations of processing information from different locations in visual space in functionally distinct regions of visual cortex.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Transgenic mice</title><p>In this study we employed six mouse lines:</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Ai95(RCL-GCaMP6f): B6;129S-<italic>Gt(ROSA)26Sor<sup>tm95.1(CAG-GCaMP6f)Hze</sup></italic>/J (Jax stock number 024105; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Madisen et al., 2015</xref>)</p></list-item><list-item><p>Ai96(RCL-GCaMP6s): B6;129S6-<italic>Gt(ROSA)26Sor<sup>tm96(CAG-GCaMP6s)Hze</sup></italic>/J (Jax stock number 024106; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Madisen et al., 2015</xref>)</p></list-item><list-item><p>Ai93(TITL-GCaMP6f): <italic>Gt(ROSA)26Sor<sup>tm5(ACTB-tTA)Luo</sup> Igs7<sup>tm93(tetO-GCaMP6f)Hze</sup></italic>/HzeJ (Jax stock number 024107; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Madisen et al., 2015</xref>)</p></list-item><list-item><p>Emx1-IRES-Cre: B6.129S2-<italic>Emx1<sup>tm1(cre)Krj</sup></italic>/J (Jax stock number 005628; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gorski et al., 2002</xref>)</p></list-item><list-item><p>Rorb-IRES2-Cre (Jax stock number 023526; Allen Mouse Brain Connectivity Atlas: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Oh et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Harris et al., 2014</xref>)</p></list-item><list-item><p>CaMK2a-tTA: B6.Cg-Tg(Camk2a-tTA)1Mmay/DboJ (Jax stock number 007004; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mayford et al., 1996</xref>).</p></list-item></list><p>Ai93, Ai95, and Ai96 are floxed GCaMP6 reporter lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Madisen et al., 2015</xref>), which differ in the promoter/enhancer used to drive GCaMP6 expression and in the isoforms of GCaMP6 expressed.

The pattern subtended 20 degrees in the direction of propagation and filled the monitor in the perpendicular dimension. The checkerboard square size was 25 degrees. Each square alternated between black and white at 6 Hz. To generate a map, the bar was swept across the screen ten times in each of the four cardinal directions, moving at nine degrees per second. To ensure that stimulus-evoked activity had subsided between sweeps, a gap ofÂ â¥5 s was inserted between sweeps, resulting in repetition of the stimulus at 0.048 Hz for vertically-moving stimuli and 0.043 Hz for horizontally-moving stimuli.</p><p>During mapping, fluorescence images were acquired at 10 Hz with 2Ã2 binning, resulting in an effective pixel size of 12.9 Âµm at the sample. Across different mouse lines, fluorescence variedÂ ~100 fold for each mouse and illumination intensity was adjusted to almost fill the camera well depth during periods of activity. Mean Â± SEM illumination intensity for GCaMP mice was 89Â Â±Â 21 ÂµW/mm<sup>2</sup> (range 19â210 ÂµW/mm<sup>2</sup>).</p><p>A slight decline in fluorescence was generally observed during mapping, presumably due to photobleaching. Photobleaching was approximately linear with time and intensity, with fluorescence declining at 235% J<sup>â1</sup>mm<sup>2</sup> (11 mice). At the mean illumination intensity during mapping (89 ÂµW/mm<sup>2</sup>), resting fluorescence declined at a mean rate of 0.02% per second or 1.25% per minute.</p><p>Brief stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) consisted of a white circle 20Â° in diameter, 50 ms in duration, centered at 60Â° azimuth and 0Â° altitude, on a black background.

(2014)</xref> with minor modifications. We first created â³F movies: for each presentation of the checkerboard stimulus, from all frames of the movie we subtracted an image corresponding to the mean of the 2 s before the start of stimulation. We then created a stimulus-triggered mean â³F movie for each of the four stimulus directions, averaging 10â40 trials in each direction. To generate azimuth and altitude position maps, from fluorescence versus time data for each pixel we extracted retinotopic positions from the phase of the first harmonic component of the Fourier series, with peak frequencies of 0.043 Hz (0.022â0.065 Hz band) for azimuth and 0.048 Hz for altitude (0.024â0.072 Hz band) maps, corresponding to the periodicity of the stimulus (moving at 9Â° per second). To cancel the delay from stimulus to response, we calculated a pixel-by-pixel average of the visual response positions derived from movies for stimuli traveling in opposite directions (for altitude, we averaged bottom-to-top and top-to-bottom movies; for azimuth, nasal-to-temporal and temporal-to-nasal movies).</p><p>Azimuth and altitude maps were combined to generate a visual field sign map (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sereno et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Garrett et al., 2014</xref>), where the visual field sign at each pixel is the sine of the angle between the local gradients (derived with the numpy.gradient function) in azimuth and altitude. The visual field sign map was converted into borders as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Garrett et al. (2014)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Juavinett et al.

The visual field sign map was spatially filtered with a Gaussian kernel (standard deviation range 6â10 Âµm, mean Â± SEM of 8.14Â Â±Â 0.08 Âµm, 14 mice) then thresholded to create a binary mask. For each map the threshold was tuned manually over a narrow range (field sign values of 0.2â0.4, mean Â± SEM of 0.32Â Â±Â 0.004, 14 mice). Each suprathreshold patch was dilated to yield a border width between patches of one pixel. Isolated pixels were eliminated with open/close operations. The binary mask was converted into an initial 'raw' patch map in which each pixel value was â1, 0 or 1. Patches were further processed with a split/merge routine in which patches withÂ &gt;10% redundancy in visual coverage were split using a watershed routine at the local minimum of the visual eccentricity map and, subsequently, adjacent patches with theÂ same sign andÂ &lt;10% redundancy in visual coverage were merged.

Maps for each mouse were centered on the centroid of V1 and rotated to align the major axis of the azimuth gradient. Differences in relative positions of mouse and monitor were corrected by defining the V1, LM, RL border as 0Â° in altitude and azimuth, necessitating a correction of 0.3Â Â±Â 1.8 degrees in altitude and 14.9Â Â±Â 2.0 degrees in azimuth (14 mice). Mean azimuth and altitude maps were then calculated by vector summation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Garrett et al., 2014</xref>). To create patch borders for pooled results from the average sign map (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and C</xref>), we thresholded the sign map at 0.3 and further processed the patches as described above (split, merge, discard small patches).</p><p>For brief, circular stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1FâJ</xref>) twenty trials were averaged and F<sub>rest</sub> was calculated as the mean of the 2 s pre-stimulus period. â³F/F movies were generated by subtraction of F<sub>rest</sub> from all pixel intensities, before division by F<sub>rest</sub>. Fluorescence was extracted from the region of the image with the greatest peak â³F/F (which was generally V1): after spatial filtering with a Gaussian kernel (ÏÂ =Â 258 Âµm, corresponding to five pixels) to reduce noise, a 516 Âµm (10 pixel) square region of interest was centered on the brightest pixel in the maximum intensity projection of the movie (dimmest pixel in wild-type mice, in which fluorescence declined with stimulation).

The peri-ocular region was illuminated with an 850 nm LED (Ostar SFH4750) and an image of the right eye was reflected by a low-pass dichroic mirror (Semrock, FF750-SDi02-25Ã36) placedÂ ~3 cm from the eye and between the eye and the stimulus monitor. Distance from the eye to the camera wasÂ ~30 cm. Pupil images were acquired via a Microsoft webcam chip through a Tamron CCTV lens (23FM50SP, focal length: 50 mm) and long-pass filter (Thorlabs FEL0800). Acquisition was at 30 Hz with 320Ã240 pixels, effective pixel size 18 Âµm.</p><p>To calculate pupil position and area, we first located and tracked the corneal reflection of the infrared LED (the brightest object in the image). The LED reflection was masked to prevent it from interfering with pupil detection (e.g. in the situation that the LED reflection was inside the image of the pupil). The image was then blurred and edges were detected and exaggerated using the OpenCV 'Canny edge detection' function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Canny, 1986</xref>). The pupil appeared as a dark, approximately round object. A region containing the pupil was manually selected and all spatially separate dark objects in the selected region were outlined. Each outline was subjected to an 'open' operation and all outlines with an area of less than 0.03 mm<sup>2</sup> were discarded. For each outline, centroid location, area, average intensity and roundness were calculated and rank order similarity to the pupil in the previous frame was calculated for each parameter. The outline with the smallest summed rank across all parameters was identified as the pupil.</p><p>Mice blinked periodically. The reflection of the LED was absent from frames in which the eyelid was closed, permitting automated identification of blink events. In the absence of a previous frame containing the pupil (the first frame of the movie and first frame after a blink) the pupil was identified as the largest, most circular dark outline, again determined with a minimum rank sum criterion.</p><p>After pupil identification, pupil area was calculated by counting the number of pixels within the borders of the extracted outline and multiplying by the area of a single pixel (3.24Ã10<sup>â4</sup> mm<sup>2</sup>).</p><p>Pupil motion in retinotopic coordinates (changes in gaze angle) was calculated under the assumption that the mouse eye is spherical, with a radius of 1.7 mm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Remtulla and Hallett, 1985</xref>). First, for each frame we determined the location of the centroid of the pupil and of the reflection of the IR-LED. From these values we calculated the position of the pupil (in pixels) relative to the LED reflection in horizontal and vertical planes (X<sub>i</sub> and Y<sub>i</sub>, where i represents frame number). The cardinal axes of the camera chip, which was mounted parallel to the optical table, were used to define theÂ horizontal and vertical planes of pupil movements. Pupil positions in pixels were converted to changes in azimuth and altitude gaze angles by trigonometry: ÎÎ¸<sub>azi</sub> = arcsin(ÎX<sub>i</sub>/r); ÎÎ¸<sub>alt</sub> = arcsin(ÎY<sub>i</sub>/r), where ÎX<sub>i</sub> and ÎY<sub>i</sub> represent the deviation of X and Y position in the i<sup>th</sup> frame from the mean location during the movie, and r was set to be 1.7 mm (the average radius of mouse eye ball).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Registration of retinotopic maps to chemoarchitectonic and cytoarchitectonic borders</title><p>Detailed protocol for registration can be found at Bio-protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zhuang et al., 2018</xref>).Â Retinotopic maps were compared to chemoarchitectonic borders via cytochrome C oxidase (CO)-stained tangential sections of flattened cortex from 4 Emx1-Ai96 mice. For each mouse, the retinotopic map was aligned to the bright field image of the surface vasculature within the cranial window. The mouse was transcardially perfused, sequentially, with saline (10 ml/min for 10 min); 5 Âµg/ml DyLight 649-lectin conjugate (Vector Laboratory, 5 ml/min for 5 min, to label vascular endothelium); 5 min pause; 1% (w/v) paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS (5 ml/min for 20 min). After perfusion, a fluorescence image of labeled vasculature within the cranial window was acquired (640/690 nm excitation emission). The left cortex was isolated, flattened between glass slides, and post-fixed overnight in 4% PFA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wang and Burkhalter, 2007</xref>). The fixed cortical sheet was cut into an asymmetrical shape to aid future alignment of fluorescence and brightfield images of the flattened tissue. A fluorescence image of the surface vasculature was acquired and the tissue was cut tangentially into 50 Âµm sections. Sections were stained for CO as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tootell et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wang et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Images acquired at different stages of tissue processing were sequentially aligned to the CO image by manual warping using the TrakEm2 plug-in in ImageJ. Key registration steps included the alignment of vasculature images across live, whole-mount and flattened preps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Alignment of images of surface vasculature and CO-stained tissue, both in the flattened tissue, occurred in two steps: coarse, global alignment was via the edges of the asymmetrically-shaped tissue and fine, local alignment was by matching cross-sections of vertical blood vessels in the CO image to putative entry points of ascending/descending vessels in the fluorescence image (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). Alignment was optimized in anterior V1 and barrel cortex, with the likely result that alignment was most accurate near the visual/somatosensory border. Chemoarchitectonic borders were identified manually.</p><p>Cytoarchitectonic borders were examined in 10 Rorb-Ai93 and 11 Emx1-Ai93 mice. Cytoarchitectonic borders were identified from a fluorescence image of the cortical surface via a semi-automated process. Illumination gradients were first removed by filtering the image with a Gaussian kernel (ÏÂ =Â 1290 Âµm) and subtracting the result. A median filter was used to remove small structures such as blood vessels and edges were detected using Canny edge detection implemented in Python (OpenCV package). From the set of edges, a subset that best matched the borders of primary sensory areas were selected manually. Distances between borders were measured manually, along the axis of the LM/RL border.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Projection-based retinotopic map</title><p>The projection-based map was derived from analysis of data from the Allen Mouse Brain Connectivity Atlas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Oh et al., 2014</xref>); <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://connectivity.brain-map.org/">http://connectivity.brain-map.org/</ext-link>). The Allen Mouse Brain Connectivity Atlas is a large data set derived from many mice, each with a single injection of adenoassociated virus that drives expression of GFP, an anterograde tracer.

A size filter was employed to eliminate ROIs smaller than 59 Âµm<sup>2</sup> or larger than 395.5 Âµm<sup>2</sup>. For each somatic ROI, a neuropil ROI was created by dilating the outer border of the somatic ROI by 5 and 15 pixels to define inner and outer limits of the neuropil ROI. The union of somatic ROIs was excluded from all neuropil ROIs. For each neuron we extracted two fluorescence values per time point using the two ROIs: <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf16"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>u</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>d</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> from the somatic ROI and <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf17"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>u</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> from the neuropil ROI.

We estimated r, the contamination ratio, separately for each soma by gradient descendent regression with a smoothness regularization (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://help.brain-map.org/download/attachments/10616846/VisualCoding_Overview.pdf?version=1&amp;modificationDate=1465258498093">http://help.brain-map.org/download/attachments/10616846/VisualCoding_Overview.pdf?version=1&amp;modificationDate=1465258498093</ext-link>). The mean Â± standard deviation value of r for all neurons in our data set was 0.244Â Â±Â 0.189.</p><p>After neuropil subtraction, we calculated the stimulus-triggered average fluorescence for each stimulus pixel location and polarity. An example is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7âfigure supplement 2A</xref>). For each stimulus location, ÎF/F integrals during the 300 ms following stimulus onset were calculated for white and black squares, yielding On and Off spatial receptive fields respectively. Baseline was defined as mean fluorescence within the 0.5 s window before stimulus onset. From On and Off receptive fields we calculated On and Off z-score maps by subtracting the mean of the pixel values in the map and dividing by the standard deviation of the pixel values in the map. z-score maps were smoothed with a Gaussian filter (ÏÂ =Â 6 degrees) and up-sampled by a factor of 10 with cubic interpolation. If the maximum of either the On or Off receptive field was greater than two, the neuron was considered responsive to the stimulus and was included in subsequent analyses.</p><p>To calculate the receptive field center of each cell, for each receptive field map pixels with a z-score below a threshold were set to zero. The threshold employed was 40% of the greater of the maximum On and maximum Off z-scores. Pixels with z-scores above the threshold retained their original z-score values. On and Off thresholded receptive field maps were summed and the altitude and azimuth of the cellâs receptive field location were defined as weighted average coordinates of the combined receptive field. The soma-border distance for each soma was the shortest Cartesian distance between the border and the weighted average coordinates of the soma pixels.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Funding was provided by the Allen Institute for Brain Science and award number NS078067 from the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;An extended retinotopic map of mouse cortex&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by David Kleinfeld as Reviewing Editor and Sabine Kastner as the Senior Editor. Tim Murphy (Reviewer #1) has agreed to reveal his identity.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Overall, the imaging, and you are an expert in this arena, is carefully performed with many technical controls, e.g., autofluorescence, although reviewer 1 has additional requests on this issue. The cytochrome oxidase staining is excellent and the comparisons of this straining, as a measure of the underlying cytoarchitecture, with the functional imaging forms the kernel of the manuscript. The central claim that functional and cytoarchitecural borders do not agree is exhilarating yet at the same time troubling. For that reason, both the reviewers and the Reviewing Editor (BRE) concur that this aspect of the work needs to be both better examined and more fully explained. The BRE has summarized this issue in terms of additional experiments and analysis that should provide clarity. You are not obligated to perform all or even any of these, but you do need to convince the reviewers and BRE that the extension of activation beyond cytological borders is real. Please consider:</p><p>1) As you mention in the text, you are recording calcium signals that are very likely to have dendritic contributions that extend outside somatic boundaries. To echo the comments of reviewer 1, it is imperative to know if these extend past cytological boundaries as they do in other areas (e.g., motor nuclei, to bring up classical structures). Perhaps you can do a number of intracellular fills of somata near the calcium signal and see if these, as opposed to the dendrites, are within the cytological border. Or perhaps you can make maps based on the calcium response to more localized cells, like parvalbumen cells, for at least a few areas.</p><p>2) Related to the above, the wide field imaging technique will yield a signal that extends beyond a cytological boundary as a result of scattering of the excitation as well as emitted light. Perhaps you could examine the border with two-photon imaging of the Ca-response, which will avoid this issue, in a number of cases. A comparison of calcium signaling as captured by wide-field imaging versus 3-D (z-stacks) with two-photo imaging near a few borders would be an excellent technical contribution to the field and settle many issues regarding this and other studies of this type.</p><p>3) Echoing comments of reviewer #2, we are uncomfortable with the analysis based on &quot;visual field sign&quot;, which further needs to be clarified early on in the manuscript and not in the Methods. As you note &quot;â¦visual field sign at each pixel is the sine of the angle between the local gradientsâ¦ in azimuth and altitude. To find borders, the visual field map was converted to a binary image using a manually-defined threshold (~0.3-0.5) and the initial visual patches were further processed with a split/merge routine (Garrett et al., 2014)â¦&quot;. We assume that the threshold is on the absolute value of the visual field sign, which ranges [-1,+1] before binarization. This critical step needs to be justified with a sensitivity analysis, i.e., would a shift in threshold change the extent of overlap.</p><p>4) Related to the above, and again echoing comments of reviewer #2, we are uncomfortable with the smearing of the signal as a result of eye-movement. We appreciate that the SE of the measured mean position is small, but the range of movement is large and this smearing could also appreciably extend the border. Perhaps an extend run should be made on one map and only trials with movement of say &lt; one degree is averaged. This would demonstrate if movement does or does not contribution to a systematic extension of the borders.</p><p>Lastly, we come to the issue of the Glasser et al. (Nature 2016 PMID: 27437579) paper. As paraphrased from reviewer 2's summary: &quot;â¦the mismatch between field maps and cytoarchitectonic maps has not been convincingly demonstrated. This casts doubts on the most far-reaching conclusion that cytoarchitectonic borders cannot be considered as real borders. If true the much celebrated Brodmann 2.0 myeloarchitectonic area map of human cortex (Glasser et al., Nature 2016) should not be considered a map of functionally distinct areas. So, in the absence of conclusive evidence a more cautious conclusion would be that the registration of visual field maps to the underlying anatomy lacks sufficient spatial resolution to definitively settle the issueâ¦&quot;. We note that the maps in Glaser are based on cytological boundaries, thickness of myelin (myeloarchitectonic), past knowledge of both function projections, and the results of resting state BOLD fMRI. The BRE was surprised that the resting state data in Glasser et al. gave such similar boundaries as those found from cytology, since resting state BOLD is based on parcelating voxels that have similar ultra-low-frequency fluctuations in the BOLD signal (e.g., Smith et al. TiCS 2013). Your method for parcellation is based directly on neuronal (albeit Ca and not spiking) and yields a different result than the resting state BOLD. Thus your conclusions, properly supported, could have profound impact on our thinking of maps derived from resting state BOLD signals versus more direct measures of neuronal activity.</p><p>We also ask that you address each of the additional points raised by reviewers. Please note that we expect to receive a revision within two months time.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>By using a new generation of transgenic mice expressing highly sensitive indicators of neuronal activity and combining with multiple anatomical techniques, this study extends our knowledge of the functional organization of mouse visual cortex. This work clearly follows previous important contributions of Marshel et al. 2011 in Neuron or Garrett et al. 2014 in J. Neurosci which revealed the detailed retinotopic mapping of areas beyond primary visual cortex in mice.</p><p>The advantage/novelty of this new work is faster mapping and the identification of additional extra-striate areas and their relationship to other sensory modalities. The authors also effectively use neuronal subset lines for mesoscale mapping. Here, up to 15 putative extrastriate areas have been mapped, some of them, overlapping with territories of other modalities (e.g. barrel cortex). The overlap with other sensory modalities is a new exciting finding. The techniques used here were particularly well implemented and an appropriate amount of controls have been used to validate these findings. Beyond the important descriptive aspect of this work and the high quality of the results, the conclusions open new insight about multimodal processing operating within cortex.</p><p>The first part of the study about the mouse line validation appears out of focus and may weaken the impact. To my opinion, this paper is not a technical report to characterize the lines and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref> could be removed or put in supplementary material. There is no clear conclusion about which mice are best.</p><p>Important:</p><p>The limitation of the mesoscopic imaging on the topographic and territory boundary mapping are not discussed. What could be the influence of the spread (optical or neuropil)? Can the method reveal visually driven areas not retinotopically organized (i.e. can we evoke the same territories with full field gratings)? To validate the method, the authors should provide the consistency of retinotopic mapping within single animals between days so we can see whether these are truly relatively invariant maps or whether reflect the nuances of the statistical analysis. Is there any consistent relationship with the map borders and surface vessels, maybe an example could be shown?</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> uses anatomical projection data to predict the sign map. However, the results and methods related to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> are poorly described. The author should present individual tracing data and show how this is used to generate the projection-based maps. This seems to be a very interesting approach but we cannot understand how you go from anatomical projections to the sign map, more explanation and intermediate steps are shown. NB: the URL in the second paragraph of the subsection âProjection-based retinotopic mapâ doesn't work. Can you also provide interpretation about the absence of projection to M2/AC recently shown by Murakami et al. 2015 in Front. Mol. Neurosci.</p><p>Some information about the origin of the signal could be clarified better: subsection âGCaMP6 expression patterns and fluorescence signalsâ, third paragraph â âdecline in fluorescence that likely results from vasodilation&quot;. Do you have any proof this could not be a neuronal suppression? In the fourth paragraph of the aforementioned subsection: âpresumably because our fluorescence measurements were from large populations of neurons, which likely display a distribution of spike times&quot; and âThese kinetics are unlikely to offer the necessary temporal resolution to reliably follow the flow of visually-evoked activity through visual cortex, which occurs on a timescale of tens of milliseconds&quot;. Can you provide the information about the neuronal dynamic using 2-photon on similar mice? Describe how fast is it and how mesoscopic imaging could be considered as a simple additive model?</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> is beautiful example of how to do correlative anatomy and mesoscale imaging. It would be important to show vessels (arterioles) that are marked on the in vivo image in 5A and follow them through to the flattened and the anatomical map. Some confusion arises since not vessels are visible in the fixed prep (arterioles only?). 2-photon cellular imaging may be another way of confirming that cellular retinotopically mapped signals are present in barrel cortex. However, we recognize that it may be difficult to get the mesoscale field of view using 2P.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>The paper describes an elegant, fast and deceptively straightforward calcium imaging method for delineating retinotopically organized areas in mouse visual cortex. The results suggest a more complex parcellation scheme with 16 rather than 10 distinct areas. Three of the newly discovered visual areas reside in barrel cortex, encroach onto auditory cortex and take up space in retrosplenial cortex. The results further suggest that retinotopic and cytoarchitectonic borders are misaligned and are therefore ill-suited for delineating cortical areas. Each of the observations is eye-popping and challenges established concepts of cortical parcellation. Although field sign mapping is a powerful tool to provide a rough estimate of visual areas, I am concerned that the method overstates the spatial precision with which this can be achieved. The authors have made an impressive effort to align retinotopic maps with cytoarchitectonically defined areas, but despite the sweat have not crossed the threshold for disposing the long-held notion that cytoarchitectonic borders coincide with retinotopic borders. Three reasons may account for this. First, the eye movements account for up to 375 Î¼m error along azimuth and ~300 Î¼m along elevation, sufficient to account for the suggested misalignment of borders. Second, in the critical <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> it is difficult to match the blood vessels seen during retinotopic mapping with those seen after staining fixed sections for cytochrome oxidase. Further, it is not clear whether these procedures have been applied in all cases. None of the illustrated examples match the maps shown in A, making it difficult to accept the conclusion that borders are mismatched. Third, the patches identified in S1 and retrosplenial cortex map tiny regions of the visual field and resemble more projection fields than separate visual area. Visual projections to both of these regions are well documented. Thus, it appears premature to view RRL and retrosplenial cortex as new visual areas. In summary, the paper makes bold assertions, which if proven correct, have profound consequences.</p><p>Subsection âGCaMP6 expression patterns and fluorescence signalsâ: âGCaMP6 appears not to be evenly distributed across layersâ. The statement is in conflict with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B, D</xref>. The distribution of GCaMP6 across extrastriate visual cortex is not clearly shown.</p><p>Subsection âRetinotopic maps from GCaMP6 fluorescence reveal additional patches of retinotopic organizationâ, first paragraph: Provide a detailed description how the &quot;automated routine&quot; identified reliably areal borders. Estimate the precision with which this was done.</p><p>Figure.4: Why is RRL only present inEmx-Ai96 mice? Why is RL so much bigger in Emx-Ai96 than other lines? Why is POR absent in all the images? What is &quot;M&quot;? It seems that the &quot;mean map&quot; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>) is heavily weighted toward Emx-Ai96 and reflects a pattern that depends on the mouse line used for mapping.</p><p>Subsection âRetinotopic maps from GCaMP6 fluorescence reveal additional patches of retinotopic organizationâ, fourth-sixth paragraphs: The usage of &quot;area&quot;, &quot;region&quot; and &quot;patch&quot; for describing activated parcel is confusing and blurs the definition of an area.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>: I am unable to see the overlap in the vascular patterns and therefore cannot match the retinotopic map to the cytochrome oxidase pattern.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>: What is the evidence that <italic>Rorb</italic> is restricted to V1?</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>: The tracing &quot;experiment&quot; lacks the precision required to conclusively demonstrate that cytoarchitectonic and retinotopic maps are misaligned.</p><p>Subsection âExtension of retinotopic organizationâ, first paragraph: As proposed, area P extends all around the posterior margin of V1. The authors admit that this may be a vascular artifact. Why then is this not acknowledged in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>?</p><p>Subsection âRepresentation of visual space and the organization of mouse visual areasâ, last paragraph: It is true that none of the higher visual areas were shown to contain a complete visual hemifield representation. But I found that the reported maps are far more complete than those shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>. Thus, the statement is misleading.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18372.034</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Overall, the imaging, and you are an expert in this arena, is carefully performed with many technical controls, e.g., autofluorescence, although reviewer 1 has additional requests on this issue.

We attempted to address this question using Cre lines that drive sparse GCaMP6 labeling. We have been using primarily Cux2-CreERT2 for these experiments, principally because density of labeled neurons is controllable in Cux2-CreERT2. Unfortunately the minimum labeling density has proven too dense. We may return to this question in the near future since we have a mouse line under construction with the specific aim of controlling labeling density over a greater range. In the meantime, we are unable to answer the question of whether dendritic calcium signals extend across borders, but our widefield-2P comparison indicates that if there is extension of dendritic calcium signals across boundaries then this extension does not prevent us from accurately locating boundaries using widefield fluorescence imaging.</p><p>We have added a new section to the Discussion in which we address signals from dendrites that cross borders ('Limitations of mapping with population imaging and simple visual stimuli').</p><p><italic>2) Related to the above, the wide field imaging technique will yield a signal that extends beyond a cytological boundary as a result of scattering of the excitation as well as emitted light.

This precision is more than adequate to support the measured mismatch between architectonic and retinotopic borders of 100-300 Âµm.</p><p>The comparison is presented in a new section of the Results (âSingle-cell retinotopy along the V1-LM borderâ), with a new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> and two supplementary figures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7âfigure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">2</xref>) and we have added 2-photon results to the Github repository.</p><p><italic>3) Echoing comments of reviewer #2, we are uncomfortable with the analysis based on &quot;visual field sign&quot;, which further needs to be clarified early on in the manuscript and not in the Methods. As you note &quot;â¦visual field sign at each pixel is the sine of the angle between the local gradientsâ¦ in azimuth and altitude. To find borders, the visual field map was converted to a binary image using a manually-defined threshold (~0.3-0.5) and the initial visual patches were further processed with a split/merge routine (Garrett et al., 2014)â¦&quot;. We assume that the threshold is on the absolute value of the visual field sign, which ranges [-1,+1] before binarization. This critical step needs to be justified with a sensitivity analysis, i.e., would a shift in threshold change the extent of overlap.</italic> </p><p>The threshold is on the absolute value of the visual field sign. We performed sensitivity analysis to explore the effect of threshold on patch incidence, shape and border location. We compared segmentation of the mean sign map (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>) with thresholds of 0.2, 0.3 and 0.4. Thresholds of 0.2 and 0.4 are the limits of the range of values employed in the analysis of our data sets and a threshold of 0.3 is close to the mean value (mean = 0.32). These results are presented in a new figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2</xref>) and indicate that:</p><p>1) Borders between two patches are generally stable unless the threshold is changed enough to eliminate the border. For example, all the borders of V1 are virtually invariant across the threshold range from 0.2 to 0.4; borders between RL and LM and between LM and P are unaffected by the change in threshold from 0.2 to 0.3, but are absent at a threshold of 0.4; the borders between RL and LLA and between AL and LI are detected by at a threshold of 0.3 or 0.4, but not 0.2. Stable borders are readily identified in the images in panel B, in which persistent borders are in white.</p><p>2) Borders that mark the exterior of the map retract as the threshold is raised. This effect is most readily observed through the images in panel C.</p><p>3) Many patches persist across the range of thresholds. The patches that are lost at the extreme threshold values are merged with neighboring patches. At a threshold of 0.2, previously published areas that are lost by merger include RL and LLA, and AL and LI. At a threshold of 0.4, previously published areas that are lost by merger include RL, LM and P. One might therefore regard 0.2 and 0.4 as beyond the range of appropriate threshold values for our data sets.</p><p>4) For most patches, changing the threshold has little effect on coverage (panel D): the change in coverage is less than the difference in coverage between patches (until the threshold is raised sufficiently to eliminate the patch). As expected, the change in coverage is more pronounced for patches on the periphery of the map that display weaker changes in fluorescence to the visual stimulus, such as patches LLA and RLL.</p><p>The effects of changing the sign map threshold, including the effects on visual coverage, are addressed in the second paragraph of the subsection âRetinotopic maps from GCaMP6 fluorescence reveal additional patches of retinotopic organizationâ of the Results and in the legend to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2</xref>.</p><p>We have also made changes to the manuscript to further explain our analysis routines:</p><p>1) In the Methods, we expanded the description of the processing steps from sign map to borders, including more information on the thresholding step and values of the variables employed (subsection âWidefield image analysisâ, third paragraph).</p><p>2) We have added a supplementary figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>), illustrating with an example the analysis workflow from sign map to borders.</p><p>3) To the Methods, we have added further information about the analysis code placed on Github (subsection âWidefield image analysisâ, fourth paragraph).</p><p>4) Within the analysis code on Github, we have added descriptions of all variables and information on the values we used when processing our data sets.</p><p>5) To the Results, we have added a brief description of the analysis routine (subsection âRetinotopic maps from GCaMP6 fluorescence reveal additional patches of retinotopic organizationâ, second paragraph).</p><p><italic>4) Related to the above, and again echoing comments of reviewer #2, we are uncomfortable with the smearing of the signal as a result of eye-movement. We appreciate that the SE of the measured mean position is small, but the range of movement is large and this smearing could also appreciably extend the border. Perhaps an extend run should be made on one map and only trials with movement of say &lt; one degree is averaged. This would demonstrate if movement does or does not contribution to a systematic extension of the borders.</italic> </p><p>We added a supplementary figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2âfigure supplement 4</xref>) in which we compared maps in a single imaging session from an Ai96 mouse, sorting trials into those with and without eye movements of greater than 2 degrees. The exterior borders of the sign map displayed some differences between maps, either as a result of eye movements or of averaging across the relatively small number of trials without eye movements. Importantly, the borders between visual areas (including that between V1 and LM/RL) were largely unaffected by eye movements, leading us to conclude that eye movements are not responsible for the mismatch in border locations that we report.</p><p><italic>Lastly, we come to the issue of the Glasser et al. (Nature 2016 PMID: 27437579) paper. As paraphrased from reviewer 2's summary: &quot;â¦the mismatch between field maps and cytoarchitectonic maps has not been convincingly demonstrated. This casts doubts on the most far-reaching conclusion that cytoarchitectonic borders cannot be considered as real borders. If true the much celebrated Brodmann 2.0 myeloarchitectonic area map of human cortex (Glasser et al., Nature 2016) should not be considered a map of functionally distinct areas. So, in the absence of conclusive evidence a more cautious conclusion would be that the registration of visual field maps to the underlying anatomy lacks sufficient spatial resolution to definitively settle the issueâ¦&quot;. We note that the maps in Glaser are based on cytological boundaries, thickness of myelin (myeloarchitectonic), past knowledge of both function projections, and the results of resting state BOLD fMRI. The BRE was surprised that the resting state data in Glasser et al. gave such similar boundaries as those found from cytology, since resting state BOLD is based on parcelating voxels that have similar ultra-low-frequency fluctuations in the BOLD signal (e.g., Smith et al. TiCS 2013). Your method for parcellation is based directly on neuronal (albeit Ca and not spiking) and yields a different result than the resting state BOLD. Thus your conclusions, properly supported, could have profound impact on our thinking of maps derived from resting state BOLD signals versus more direct measures of neuronal activity.</italic> </p><p>Our new 2P data set indicates that our widefield imaging results offer sufficient precision to measure the mismatch in cytoarchitectonic and functional borders. However, the presence of a mismatch does not mean that 'cytoarchitectonic borders cannot be considered as real borders<italic>'</italic>. Architectonic borders do not necessarily match retinotopic borders, but may align with other functional borders. For example, it is possible that the retinotopic lateral border of V1 marks the lateral extent of retino-geniculate projections from the contralateral eye representing the contralateral visual field, and the architectonic border the lateral extent of retino-geniculate projections from the contralateral eye representing the ipsilateral visual field (Laing et al., 2015).</p><p>With regard to Glaser et al., who report on areas in humans, we would advocate caution when generalizing across species. Although there is evidence of a mismatch in structural and functional border locations for some higher visual areas in humans (Large et al., 2016, Cerebral Cortex 26, 3928â3944), we do not know whether there is a mismatch in the V1-V2 border locations in humans, which might be the equivalent of the V1-LM/RL border mismatch we have observed. If a V1-V2 border mismatch exists in humans, the size of the mismatch will need to be determined. Possibly it may be too small to be determined with fMRI-based functional measurements.</p><p><italic>We also ask that you address each of the additional points raised by reviewers. Please note that we expect to receive a revision within two months time.</italic> </p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p><italic>[â¦] The first part of the study about the mouse line validation appears out of focus and may weaken the impact.

However, one would need to threshold the power map to define border locations. The power map is not sensitive to retinotopy, but aligns well to the sign map, leading us to conclude that visual responsiveness and retinotopy tend to correlate. However, the relationship appears weaker in the medial part of the window, where retrosplenial cortex responded to visual stimuli but displayed relatively weak (or noisy) retinotopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> panel A, B, C). In our preparation, optical access to medial cortex is limited due to the placement of the window and the signal-to-noise ratio in this part of the window was probably poorer than in more lateral locations. Further studies, in a modified preparation, would probably be necessary to more fully understand the relationship between the amplitude of visually-evoked responses and retinotopy in medial cortex, although we should note that in a preparation with a more medial window location, the central sinus might limit optical access.</p><p><italic>To validate the method, the authors should provide the consistency of retinotopic mapping within single animals between days so we can see whether these are truly relatively invariant maps or whether reflect the nuances of the statistical analysis.

Even over this long time period, maps acquired from the same mouse appear more similar than maps from different mice (panels A and B). For each mouse, surface vasculature is stable and border positions shift little relative to the surface vasculature (panels C and D). As a simple quantification of variability, we plot patch areas (panels E and F). As expected, areas are fairly stable between sessions with variability being greatest for the small, peripheral patches.</p><p><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> uses anatomical projection data to predict the sign map.

The results suggest a more complex parcellation scheme with 16 rather than 10 distinct areas. Three of the newly discovered visual areas reside in barrel cortex, encroach onto auditory cortex and take up space in retrosplenial cortex. The results further suggest that retinotopic and cytoarchitectonic borders are misaligned and are therefore ill-suited for delineating cortical areas. Each of the observations is eye-popping and challenges established concepts of cortical parcellation. Although field sign mapping is a powerful tool to provide a rough estimate of visual areas, I am concerned that the method overstates the spatial precision with which this can be achieved. The authors have made an impressive effort to align retinotopic maps with cytoarchitectonically defined areas, but despite the sweat have not crossed the threshold for disposing the long-held notion that cytoarchitectonic borders coincide with retinotopic borders. Three reasons may account for this. First, the eye movements account for up to 375 Î¼m error along azimuth and ~300 Î¼m along elevation, sufficient to account for the suggested misalignment of borders.</italic> </p><p>As discussed above (under '(4) Related to the above, and again echoing comments of reviewer #2'), we have addressed eye movements in a new Figure 3âfigure supplement 3, concluding that eye movements had little effect on the alignment of borders between visual areas.</p><p><italic>Second, in the critical <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> it is difficult to match the blood vessels seen during retinotopic mapping with those seen after staining fixed sections for cytochrome oxidase.

We would speculate that determining whether RLL occurs preferentially in one of other mouse line would require maps from many more mice.

We can only speculate on why these posterior regions have not mapped more consistently in the past, but the additional challenges of imaging in this posterior location (the posterior sinus, the folded structure of posterior cortex and, in our experiments, the edge of the cranial window) may reduce the signal-to-noise ratio, relative to other parts of visual cortex, leading to less consistent results. In our maps, there is consistent retinotopic structure posterior to V1, with a field sign-positive strip extending across the posterior extent of V1 in almost every mouse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Possibly the high signal-to-noise ratio of GCaMP6 imaging (compared to the SNR of reflectance-based imaging employed by many previous authors) may be sufficient to resolve consistent structure posterior to V1.</p><p>We consider this topic, including comparison with the literature, more appropriate for the Discussion than the Results section, hence its exclusion from the text associated with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> and inclusion in the first paragraph of the Discussion subsection âExtension of retinotopic organizationâ.</p><p><italic>Subsection âRepresentation of visual space and the organization of mouse visual areasâ, last paragraph: It is true that none of the higher visual areas were shown to contain a complete visual hemifield representation. But I found that the reported maps are far more complete than those shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>. Thus, the statement is misleading.</italic> </p><p>The statement is:</p><p>âEven allowing for some expansion of coverage for each visual area, our results indicate that no higher visual areas (even those immediately surrounding V1) contain a complete description of the visual hemifield.â</p><p>We were careful to limit this statement to our results to ensure that it was accurate. The new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8âfigure supplement 1</xref>, in which we illustrate the effects of expanding coverage by the receptive field radius, further supports the statement. We have difficulty in seeing why this statement might be considered misleading and have therefore not changed the statement in the revised manuscript, but would of course be happy to modify the statement if there's a misleading implication that we have overlooked.</p></body></sub-article></article>
