thought to originate from progenitor cells residing in the luminal compartment of the mammary epithelium. We found that ICAM-1 efficiently marks mammary luminal progenitors comprising hormone receptor-positive and receptor-negative cells, presumably ductal and alveolar progenitors. Both cell populations strongly express Met, while HGF is produced by stromal and basal myoepithelial cells. We show that persistent HGF treatment stimulates the clonogenic activity of ICAM1-positive luminal progenitors, controlling their survival and proliferation, and leads to the expression of basal cell characteristics, including stem cell potential. This is accompanied by the induction of <italic>Snai1</italic> and <italic>Snai2</italic>, two major transcription factors triggering epithelial–mesenchymal transition, the repression of the luminal-regulatory genes <italic>Elf5</italic> and <italic>Hey1</italic>, and claudin down-regulation. Our data strongly indicate that paracrine Met signaling can control the function of luminal progenitors and modulate their fate during mammary development and tumorigenesis.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06104.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06104.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06104.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Throughout the life of a female mammal, the mammary glands undergo different phases of development to prepare for, and adapt to, feeding offspring. Luminal cells line the inside of branch-like structures throughout the mammary gland and are responsible for producing milk. When the mammary gland grows, new luminal cells develop from a kind of cell called luminal progenitor cells. However, these progenitor cells are also thought to be the source of certain types of breast cancer.</p><p>Recently, it has been suggested that luminal progenitor cells display a receptor protein called Met on their surface. When Met and ‘co-receptor’ proteins bind to a molecule called HGF, this triggers a cascade of signals that can cause certain cells to change their properties. This is known as the epithelial–mesenchymal transition. Although this transition is important for new tissues to develop, it can also result in cancerous tumors forming if it is not correctly controlled. Luminal cells do not produce HGF themselves, which suggests that Met signaling in these cells is triggered by the HGF released from neighboring cells. However, neither the mechanisms behind this signaling nor the effects of signaling on the luminal progenitor cells are well understood.</p><p>Di-Cicco et al. set out to identify where Met, its co-receptors and HGF are located in the mouse mammary gland during different phases of development. This revealed that one of the co-receptors—called ICAM-1—can be used as a marker to identify certain types of luminal progenitor cell. Di-Cicco et al. found that these progenitor cells display Met on their surface, and other types of mammary cell—called stromal cells and myoepithelial cells—produce HGF.</p><p>When exposed to HGF, luminal progenitor cells grown in culture in the laboratory proliferated and went through the epithelial–mesenchymal transition. These findings suggest that myoepithelial and stromal cells regulate luminal progenitor cells by producing HGF to activate Met signaling in these cells. Such interactions could be of great importance during mammary development and tumorigenesis. The next big challenge will be to determine the circumstances under which luminal progenitor cells stimulated by HGF can give rise to breast cancers. This work will allow us to better define the cell population that should be targeted by anti-cancer drugs.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06104.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06104.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>mammary gland</kwd><kwd>stem cell</kwd><kwd>Met signaling</kwd><kwd>epithelial–mesenchymal transition</kwd><kwd>ICAM-1</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004099</institution-id><institution>Ligue Contre le Cancer</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Equipe Labelisee 2013</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Glukhova</surname><given-names>Marina A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-13-BSV2-0001</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Glukhova</surname><given-names>Marina A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Canceropole Ile de France</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2014-1-SEIN-01-ICR-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Glukhova</surname><given-names>Marina A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-08-BLAN-0078-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Glukhova</surname><given-names>Marina A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Mammary progenitors identified by a new marker, ICAM-1, undergo epithelial-mesenchymal transition and luminal-to-basal switch in response to paracrine Met activation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The postnatal development of the mammary gland comprises two distinct morphogenetic events: the growth and branching of epithelial ducts during puberty and the lobulo–alveolar development during pregnancy. The mammary epithelium is embedded in a fatty connective tissue and organized as a bilayer, with a basal layer of myoepithelial cells and a luminal epithelial layer. During lactation, the luminal cells produce milk, whereas myoepithelial cells serve for milk expulsion.</p><p>The luminal cell layer is characterized by the expression of keratins 8/18/19 and comprises a subset of hormone-sensing cells that express estrogen, progesterone, and prolactin receptors (ER, PR, and PrlR, respectively) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brisken, 2013</xref>). Basal myoepithelial cells express keratins 5 and 14, P-cadherin, the transcription factor p63, and smooth muscle-specific contractile proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Moumen et al., 2011</xref>). This compartment specifically displays Slug/Snail2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Guo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nassour et al., 2012</xref>), a key transcription factor coordinating the epithelial–mesenchymal (EMT) transition program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Thiery et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nieto and Cano, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gonzalez and Medici, 2014</xref>).</p><p>The adult mammary basal compartment harbors multipotent stem cells able to fully regenerate the gland upon transplantation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Shackleton et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Stingl et al., 2006</xref>). The luminal cell layer contains clonogenic cells, the luminal progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Asselin-Labat et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sleeman et al., 2007</xref>). This population is heterogeneous, consisting of hormone receptor-positive and hormone receptor-negative clonogenic cells that are considered to be functionally distinct ductal and alveolar progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beleut et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Regan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Shehata et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fu et al., 2014</xref>). Considerable interest has recently focused on luminal progenitors. According to lineage-tracing studies, these cells are able to drive the expansion of the luminal cell population in mammary ducts and alveoli during postnatal development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Van Keymeulen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rios et al., 2014</xref>). Moreover, luminal progenitors are thought to be at the origin of the triple-negative, basal-like, Brca1-associated breast cancers, indicating that they display phenotypic plasticity and an ability to upregulate basal markers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lim et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Molyneux et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Proia et al., 2011</xref>). Of note, ectopic expression of Snail2 endows luminal progenitors with basal cell features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Guo et al., 2012</xref>), supporting an important role of EMT in the regulation of luminal progenitor plasticity.</p><p>The Met tyrosine kinase receptor and its major ligand, HGF, are known to control numerous epithelial cell functions and trigger EMT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Trusolino et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gherardi et al., 2012</xref>). Met signaling has been implicated in mammary development and tumorigenesis. Although not investigated in detail yet, Met-deficient mammary glands of adult MMTV-Cre:Met<sup>f/f</sup> mice showed defects in branching morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Garner et al., 2011</xref>). Aberrant Met activation occurs in breast cancers, in particular in the triple-negative, basal-like subtype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gastaldi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ponzo and Park, 2010</xref>). Expression of activated Met or over-expression of HGF in mouse mammary gland induce tumors, including those of the basal-like subtype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Graveel et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ponzo et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Holland et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Knight et al., 2013</xref>). Several in vitro studies performed with mammary organoids or immortalized cell lines have implicated HGF/Met signaling in the regulation of mammary epithelial cell growth, morphogenesis, and differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Soriano et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yang et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Haslam et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lee et al., 2011</xref>). One recent work indicated that luminal progenitors express Met and that, when forced to express HGF, display an enhanced in vivo regenerative potential, a property attributed to basal-type stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gastaldi et al., 2013</xref>). However, in situ, mammary luminal cells do not express HGF, suggesting that Met signaling in mammary epithelial cells is activated in a paracrine manner. HGF-mediated paracrine and autocrine Met stimulation can trigger distinct biological responses in epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mai et al., 2014</xref>). How Met-expressing luminal progenitors respond to the physiological paracrine action of HGF has not yet been investigated at the cellular and molecular levels.</p><p>Met activation requires adhesion molecules as co-receptors. Two co-receptors for Met have been identified in hepatocytes: CD44v6, the CD44 isoform containing the exon v6 and ICAM-1 (CD54), a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily of cell adhesion molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Orian-Rousseau et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Olaku et al., 2011</xref>). In this study, we investigated the expression of ICAM-1, CD44v6, HGF, and Met in the mouse mammary epithelium. We found that ICAM-1 is a useful marker for obtaining highly enriched preparations of clonogenic luminal progenitors that express <italic>Met</italic>, and that HGF is produced by both stromal and myoepithelial cells. Using ICAM-1 as a surface marker, we further characterized Met-expressing luminal progenitors and analyzed their cellular and molecular responses to HGF. Our data suggest that HGF can act as a paracrine regulator of luminal progenitor function and fate during mammary development and tumorigenesis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>ICAM-1 expression discriminates the basal/myoepithelial cell compartment and two distinct populations of luminal cells</title><p>We examined ICAM-1 expression at representative stages of mammary gland development, including puberty, maturity, early, and late gestation.

The differential expression of Sca-1 and CD61 was first used to obtain partial enrichment in luminal progenitor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Asselin-Labat et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sleeman et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rios et al., 2014</xref>). Subsequently, the combined use of Sca-1 and c-kit or CD49b revealed that the luminal progenitors in the mature virgin gland belong to two distinct populations, one consisting essentially of HR-positive cells and the other mostly of HR-negative cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Regan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Shehata et al., 2012</xref>). We found that in virgin glands and during early pregnancy, combined ICAM-1 and Sca-1 expression discriminated these two major luminal clonogenic cell subsets. ICAM-1 clearly appeared more efficient than Sca-1 for separating non-clonogenic and clonogenic luminal populations. Importantly, ICAM-1 marked the luminal progenitor population in different mouse strains, including C57Bl6/J, and in mixed backgrounds, such as that of BlgCre; R26 mice, whereas neither CD61 nor c-kit can be used for luminal progenitor enrichment from C57Bl6/J mouse mammary glands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Visvader and Stingl, 2014</xref>). Furthermore, differential ICAM-1 expression within the Sca-1-negative luminal cell population separated a poorly clonogenic ICAM1-negative subset enriched in HR-positive cells (Lu3) from a major clonogenic cell fraction positive for ICAM-1 and lacking HR expression (Lu4). Such separation was not possible with CD49b, the most recently described marker for characterizing luminal cell subsets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Shehata et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">De Silva et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>The clonogenic luminal cell population is thought to comprise distinct ductal- and alveolar-restricted progenitors, as yet not fully characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Regan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Shehata et al., 2012</xref>). Cells committed to the alveolar fate are expected to expand in adult females particularly at the onset of pregnancy, to express <italic>Tnfrsf11a</italic> and <italic>Elf5</italic> strongly, and most probably, to lack ER and PR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fata et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lee et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rodilla et al., 2015</xref>). Interestingly, the Sca-1-negative ICAM1-positive clonogenic cell population (Lu4) absent from prepubertal mammary epithelium fulfills these criteria. In addition, these cells have high levels of transcript for the milk protein β-casein. By contrast, the Sca-1- and ICAM1-positive clonogenic subset containing HR-expressing cells (Lu2) present throughout mammary development may preferentially contain ductal-restricted progenitors.</p><p>Thus, ICAM-1 is a new robust marker for separating basal and luminal cells and analyzing the heterogeneity of the luminal cell compartment in the adult mammary gland using flow cytometry.

A recent work reported the expression of Met predominantly in the Sca-1-negative luminal progenitor-enriched population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gastaldi et al., 2013</xref>). In agreement with these data, we found high-Met transcript levels in the Sca-1-negative ICAM1-positive clonogenic cell population (Lu4). Additionally, we observed strong Met expression in the Sca-1-positive ICAM1-positive luminal progenitors (Lu2). Thus, the two major clonogenic populations of luminal progenitors, enriched in HR-negative and HR-positive cells, are potential targets of HGF/Met signaling. Met was also expressed in the Sca-1-negative ICAM1-negative cell subset (Lu3), which was weakly clonogenic and enriched in HR-positive cells. Our data thus highlight the phenotypic diversity of Met-expressing cells in the luminal population. Consistently, a knockin mouse model with a mutationally activated Met has been reported to develop various types of mammary tumors, including ER-positive and ER-negative tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Graveel et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>We found that ICAM1-expressing luminal progenitors responded to HGF stimulation by basal marker upregulation.

In mouse hepatocytes, CD44v6 acts as main co-receptor for Met, however, ICAM-1 can trigger Met activation in the absence of CD44 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Orian-Rousseau et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Olaku et al., 2011</xref>). Our data showed that loss of ICAM-1 did not severely affect mammary development, HGF/Met signaling, and basal cell differentiation process in luminal progenitors. This suggests that CD44v6 rather than ICAM-1 serve as main co-receptor for Met in the mouse mammary epithelium and that identical compensation mechanisms may be involved in Met activation in liver and mammary gland. Distribution of Met and its co-receptors in the human mammary gland remains poorly defined; however, strong expression of Met, ICAM-1, and CD44v6 has been associated with triple-negative breast cancers and correlated with poor prognosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Charpin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gastaldi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ponzo and Park, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Schroder et al., 2011</xref>).

However, we show here that mammary myoepithelial cells also produce HGF. It is worth mentioning that in the postnatal mammary epithelium, ductal luminal cells are in direct contact with myoepithelial rather than stromal cells. In alveoli, the myoepithelial cell layer is discontinuous, so luminal cells may also come into contact with the basement membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Moumen et al., 2011</xref>). HGF produced by both myoepithelial and stromal cells may therefore contribute to the control of the luminal progenitor activity, favoring either their normal expansion during development or aberrant amplification in cancers. Paracrine basal-to-luminal signaling mediated by the Nrg1-Erbb4 ligand–receptor pair has recently been implicated in the regulation of luminal cell maturation during lobulo–alveolar development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Forster et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>We found that HGF had multiple effects on Met-expressing luminal progenitors. Early in culture, HGF promoted cell survival and proliferation. Consistent with its role in tubulogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rosario and Birchmeier, 2003</xref>), HGF then favored lumen formation. Finally, HGF treatment affected the fate of luminal progenitors, leading to the accumulation of a cell population expressing basal markers, including cells co-expressing basal and luminal keratins. Such dual luminal/basal cells are seldom in the adult mammary epithelium but are abundant in fetal mammary rudiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Spike et al., 2012</xref>). The accumulation of cells co-expressing basal and luminal keratins has been observed in the mammary epithelium of Elf5-null mice, which have high-Snail2 levels and display EMT-like phenotypic changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chakrabarti et al., 2012a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">2012b</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>HGF triggers EMT in luminal progenitors and modulates the expression of antagonistic regulators of luminal and basal fates</title><p>Several regulators of the balance between mammary luminal and basal phenotypes have recently been identified.

Consistently, alterations of the luminal progenitor phenotype did not persist in vitro after HGF withdrawal. Altogether, these data suggest that microenvironmental signals, such as HGF, may modulate the phenotype of luminal progenitors, by affecting the expression of antagonistic regulators of the basal and luminal fates.</p><p>In addition to their role in triggering EMT, transcription factors of the Snail family have been reported to attenuate cell cycle progression by increasing p21 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Vega et al., 2004</xref>).

How p21 and its major upstream regulator p53 are involved in the response of luminal progenitors to HGF remains to be unraveled. A recent analysis of transgenic mouse models showed that Met can synergize with p53 loss to promote the formation of triple-negative mammary tumors with a claudin-low, EMT-type molecular signature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Knight et al., 2013</xref>).

For secondary sphere transplantations, 5000 ICAM1-positive luminal progenitors per well were plated, grown with or without HGF for 14 days, then, dissociated and replated at 5000 cells per well as for primary spheres. After 15 days in culture, the content of each culture well was grafted in a separate mammary fat pad. To analyze the outgrowths, dissected mammary fat pads were spread onto glass slides, fixed in Methacarn, and stained with carmine alum (Stem Cell Technologies), as described elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Moumen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chiche et al., 2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction</title><p>RNA was reverse-transcribed with MMLV H(−) Point reverse transcriptase (Promega, Madison, WI, USA), and quantitative PCR (qPCR) was performed by monitoring, in real time, the increase in fluorescence of the SYBR Green dye on an LightCycler 480 Real-Time PCR System (Roche Applied Science, Basel, Switzerland).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Fiona Watt (Senior editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The general consensus is that this paper is in principle appropriate for <italic>eLife</italic> as it identifies ICAM-1 as a novel marker to discriminate between HR-positive and negative mammary gland luminal clonogenic subsets and basal cells and this finding has the potential to be of significant general interest. However, as indicated by the reviewers there are some major concerns and significant ambiguities that need to be addressed before the paper can be considered for resubmission.</p><p>1) Most of the experiments, and thus the majority of the conclusions, have been based on in vitro data including flow cytometry and various cell culture assays. The in vivo role of ICAM-1 luminal progenitor cells has only been partially addressed using a fat pad reconstitution experiment that demonstrates the dependence of ICAM-1 positive luminal progenitor cells on HGF stimulation. This one in vivo experiment is potentially very important and should be expanded upon to show some functional role of ICAM-1 in mammary gland development (Figure 3–figure supplement 5). Firstly, the number of experimental mice should be increased to obtain a meaningful statistical result. These results should then be incorporated into a main figure. Moreover, some IHC analysis to show the localisation of ICAM-1 luminal progenitor cells during mammary gland development would be useful.</p><p>2) Previous work published by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gastaldi et al., 2013</xref> has demonstrated the role of MET and HGF in the luminal progenitor cell function in vivo, albeit not specifically for the ICAM-1 positive subpopulation. Since the novelty of this manuscript relies on the identification of ICAM-1 as a marker of luminal progenitor cells and as the generation of basal-like cells is dependent on c-Met, it is important to consolidate the functional contribution of ICAM-1 to this process. Is ICAM-1 necessary for EMT/the transition of progenitor cells to basal like cells in response to HGF? Furthermore, based on the knowledge that ICAM-1 is a co-receptor of c-Met (reported in an independent publication by one of the co-authors), the novelty of the report could be substantially expanded by the assessment whether ICAM-1 also functionally contributes to the basal cell differentiation process. In vivo experiments addressing directly the requirement for ICAM-1 are therefore necessary to address this point.</p><p>3) There are also some specific ambiguities with regard to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, specifically in the E-cadherin staining. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, E-cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion does not seem to change with and without HGF-stimulation?

The in vivo role of ICAM-1 luminal progenitor cells has only been partially addressed using a fat pad reconstitution experiment that demonstrates the dependence of ICAM-1 positive luminal progenitor cells on HGF stimulation. This one in vivo experiment is potentially very important and should be expanded upon to show some functional role of ICAM-1 in mammary gland development (Figure 3–figure supplement 5). Firstly, the number of experimental mice should be increased to obtain a meaningful statistical result. These results should then be incorporated into a main figure. Moreover, some IHC analysis to show the localisation of ICAM-1 luminal progenitor cells during mammary gland development would be useful</italic>.</p><p>Fat pad reconstitution experiments:</p><p>As requested by the reviewers, we have performed additional transplantation experiments with untreated and HGF-treated luminal progenitor cultures. The data are shown in a main figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) and in Figure 7–figure supplement 1. They are described in a specific paragraph of the Results section (subsection “HGF stimulation confers regenerative potential on luminal progenitors”). The detailed protocol is presented in Materials and methods (“Transplantation assays and whole mount analysis”).</p><p>To complement the in vivo data previously obtained with cells isolated from primary spheres (ex Figure 3–figure supplement 5), we transplanted secondary spheres harvested from untreated and HGF-stimulated cultures of luminal progenitors. As described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref> (ex <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>), HGF-treated secondary spheres, when compared to untreated cultures, are greatly enriched in K5-positive cells (20% vs &lt;1%). As expected, we found that only HGF-treated secondary spheres displayed regenerative potential (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>) and developed ductal-type outgrowths comprising basal myoepithelial and luminal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C and D</xref>).</p><p>Localisation of ICAM-1 luminal progenitor cells:</p><p>As suggested by the reviewers, we have studied ICAM-1 distribution in the developing mammary epithelium, using immunohistochemical approach. The data are documented in a novel main figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). We have introduced a new paragraph in the Results section (subsection headed “ICAM-1 can serve to localize luminal progenitors in the mammary epithelium”) and implemented the Material and methods accordingly (in the subsection headed “Immunofluorescence and immunohistochemical stainings”).</p><p>The ICAM-1 distribution pattern in the mammary epithelium of pubertal and late pregnant females, as revealed by immunohistochemical staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>), was in agreement with the flow cytometry data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>. In addition, we found that ICAM-1 expression was down-regulated at the onset of lactation.</p><p>We observed that in virgin mature mice, ICAM1-positive cells formed clusters within the ducts, a property consistent with their clonogenic potential (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>). At early pregnancy, luminal cells located in large ducts were negative for ICAM-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>). In contrast, in the developing alveoli and small ducts, the luminal layer, presumably enriched in alveolar progenitors, contained clusters of cells positive for ICAM-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C-E</xref>). In agreement with the qPCR data, ER-positive cells were mostly ICAM1-negative (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9E</xref>).</p><p>In the mammary epithelium of mature virgin and early-pregnant mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B-E</xref>), ICAM-1 expression was restricted to cell-cell contacts, basal-to-basal, basal-to-luminal and luminal-to luminal.</p><p>We have added a sentence in the Discussion (at the end of the subsection headed “ICAM-1 is a new marker for the enrichment of clonogenic luminal progenitors”) mentioning that ICAM-1 can be used to localize and further characterize luminal progenitors in situ.</p><p><italic>2) Previous work published by</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19"><italic>Gastaldi et al., 2013</italic></xref> <italic>has demonstrated the role of MET and HGF in the luminal progenitor cell function in vivo, albeit not specifically for the ICAM-1 positive subpopulation. Since the novelty of this manuscript relies on the identification of ICAM-1 as a marker of luminal progenitor cells and as the generation of basal-like cells is dependent on c-Met, it is important to consolidate the functional contribution of ICAM-1 to this process. Is ICAM-1 necessary for EMT/the transition of progenitor cells to basal like cells in response to HGF? Furthermore, based on the knowledge that ICAM-1 is a co-receptor of c-Met (reported in an independent publication by one of the co-authors), the novelty of the report could be substantially expanded by the assessment whether ICAM-1 also functionally contributes to the basal cell differentiation process. In vivo experiments addressing directly the requirement for ICAM-1 are therefore necessary to address this point</italic>.</p><p>Using <italic>Icam1</italic>-KO mice, we analyzed the functional contribution of ICAM-1 in mammary development and in the luminal progenitor response to HGF. The results of these experiments are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9–figure supplement 1</xref> and described in an additional paragraph at the end of the Results section (in the subsection “Loss of ICAM-1 does not impede the response of luminal progenitors to HGF”).</p><p>Whole mount and flow cytometry analysis performed in adult virgin and pregnant females showed that loss of ICAM-1 neither visibly affected mammary morphogenesis, nor perturbed the balance between basal myoepithelial and luminal cell populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9–figure supplement 1 A-B</xref>).</p><p>To more specifically investigate the functional contribution of ICAM-1 to the luminal progenitor response to HGF, we isolated Sca1-negative luminal progenitors from <italic>Icam1</italic>-deficient mammary glands and treated them with HGF. As reported for ICAM1-expressing luminal progenitors, HGF was able to stimulate the clonogenic activity of <italic>Icam1</italic>-deficient luminal progenitors and modulate the expression of lineage- and EMT- specific genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9–figure supplement 1C-G</xref>).</p><p>Altogether, these experiments show that ICAM-1 is not mandatory for mammary development, HGF/Met signaling in luminal progenitors and basal cell differentiation process, and suggest that CD44v6 is the main co-receptor for Met in the mammary epithelium. The Discussion part has been modified according to these conclusions (please see the subsection “ICAM-1 is not mandatory for HGF/Met signaling in luminal progenitors”).</p><p><italic>3) There are also some specific ambiguities with regard to</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><italic>Figure 4C</italic></xref> <italic>and</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><italic>Figure 4D</italic></xref><italic>, specifically in the E-cadherin staining.

To underscore this, we have replaced the panel showing double immunolabeling for K5 and E-cadherin (ex <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>) by microphotographs documenting Snail2 and E-Cadherin expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), and modified the text in the Results section (in the third paragraph of the subsection headed “Luminal progenitors activate EMT program and repress luminal-specific regulatory genes upon stimulation by HGF”).</p><p>Using double immunofluorescence labeling for E-Cadherin and claudin-1, we found that in untreated spheres, most cells expressed claudin-1 at their junctions, whereas HGF-treated spheres clearly displayed large cell areas lacking claudin-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>).
