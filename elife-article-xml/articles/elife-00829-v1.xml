CME is shut down during early mitosis, but the mechanism of this inhibition is unclear. In this study, we show that the mitotic shutdown is due to an unmet requirement for actin in CME. In mitotic cells, membrane tension is increased and this invokes a requirement for the actin cytoskeleton to assist the CME machinery to overcome the increased load. However, the actin cytoskeleton is engaged in the formation of a rigid cortex in mitotic cells and is therefore unavailable for deployment. We demonstrate that CME can be ‘restarted’ in mitotic cells despite high membrane tension, by allowing actin to engage in endocytosis. Mitotic phosphorylation of endocytic proteins is maintained in mitotic cells with restored CME, indicating that direct phosphorylation of the CME machinery does not account for shutdown.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00829.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00829.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00829.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The plasma membrane that surrounds a cell acts as a protective barrier that regulates what can enter or exit the cell. However, large molecules and other ‘cargo’ can get into a cell in a variety of ways. One of these routes—known as clathrin-mediated endocytosis—involves a receptor on the outside of the membrane grabbing hold of the cargo while a protein called clathrin forms a ‘pit’ beneath the receptor. This pit becomes deeper and deeper until the cargo is completely surrounded by clathrin-lined membrane and is brought inside the cell.</p><p>This process has been studied over the past 50 years, and it is known that clathrin-mediated endocytosis is turned off when a cell begins to divide to produce new cells, and then turned back on when cell division has come to an end. However, there are competing theories as to exactly why this process stops when cell division starts.</p><p>Now, Kaur et al. have investigated these theories by looking at the role that another protein, called actin, plays in turning off clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Actin is a molecule that forms a sort of scaffolding within the cell (called the cytoskeleton), and it also guides the movement of molecules and larger structures within the cell. Further, when the cell membrane is being stretched, the actin cytoskeleton can assist the clathrin-mediated endocytosis machinery to pull cargo into the cell.</p><p>So why doesn’t actin help with endocytosis during cell division? The answer, Kaur et al. suggest, is that all the actin in the cell is needed by the cytoskeleton during cell division, so there is no actin available to perform other tasks such as clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Further experiments demonstrated that this form of endocytosis can be ‘restarted’ in dividing cells by treating the cells in a way that frees up some additional actin. The work of Kaur et al. also ruled out the theory that chemical changes to the endocytosis machinery disabled it during cell division. These findings have implications for the delivery of drugs, via endocytosis, to the rapidly dividing cells that are involved in diseases such as cancer.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00829.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00829.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>clathrin</kwd><kwd>endocytosis</kwd><kwd>mitosis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/H015582/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Royle</surname><given-names>Stephen J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Cancer Research UK</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>C25425/A15182</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Royle</surname><given-names>Stephen J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funder had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Endocytosis is switched off in dividing cells because actin is not available to assist the clathrin machinery at a time when membrane tension is increased.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME), the major route of internalisation for transmembrane proteins into mammalian cells, controls many cellular processes from signalling and growth, to cell motility and organelle identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">McMahon and Boucrot, 2011</xref>). It has been known for decades that CME, like many other cellular processes, is inhibited during the early stages of mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fawcett, 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Berlin and Oliver, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Warren, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fielding et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fielding and Royle, 2013</xref>). However, the mechanism that underlies this mitotic inhibition is unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fielding and Royle, 2013</xref>).</p><p>During CME, the cargo that is destined for internalisation is clustered into pits via interaction with adaptor proteins, which in turn, recruit clathrin triskelia. The forming clathrin-coated pit is then invaginated further and eventually pinched off in a process dependent on the GTPase dynamin. The actin cytoskeleton may assist in these latter stages of vesicle formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Robertson et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>CME is shut down shortly after prophase entry and resumes in late anaphase where it is required for membrane dynamics in cytokinesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Berlin and Oliver, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Schweitzer et al., 2005</xref>). In early mitotic cells, shallow clathrin-coated pits are seen at the plasma membrane suggesting that invagination and subsequent steps of CME are inhibited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pypaert et al., 1987</xref>). Two main mechanisms have been proposed. First, direct mitotic phosphorylation of the CME machinery decreases its activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pypaert et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">He et al., 2003</xref>). In support of this, numerous endocytic proteins are phosphorylated during mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dephoure et al., 2008</xref>), but it is not clear what effect, if any, these modifications have on CME. Second, that the increased membrane tension of mitotic cells prevents invagination during CME (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Raucher and Sheetz, 1999</xref>). There is good evidence that the membrane tension is increased in early mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Stewart et al., 2011a</xref>) in a process driven by osmotic changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Habela and Sontheimer, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Stewart et al., 2011b</xref>). The precise mechanism for shutdown is yet to be determined.</p><p>Despite a clear role in yeast, the actin cytoskeleton does not have an obligatory role in CME in human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Engqvist-Goldstein and Drubin, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Robertson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Traub, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anitei and Hoflack, 2012</xref>). Light and electron microscopy studies clearly show that it is recruited to a subset of CME events in human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Merrifield et al., 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Collins et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Taylor et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">2012</xref>) and that it is important for internalisation of pathogens such as Listeria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bonazzi et al., 2011</xref>). Interestingly, the requirement for actin in CME may be linked to membrane tension. Recent work has shown that in cells where membrane tension is increased, there is an increased requirement for actin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aghamohammadzadeh and Ayscough, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boulant et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Stachowiak et al., 2013</xref>). During mitosis the plasma membrane tension is increased as a result of osmotic changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Raucher and Sheetz, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Stewart et al., 2011a</xref>), so why is the actin cytoskeleton not deployed to assist CME as occurs in interphase cells?</p><p>We set out to discover the mechanism for mitotic shutdown of CME. We found two methods to ‘restart’ CME in mitotic cells, which effectively rule out direct mitotic phosphorylation of endocytic proteins as a mechanism for the mitotic shutdown of CME. Instead we propose that the actin machinery, which is engaged in assembling a stiff cortex in mitotic cells, is unavailable to rescue the inhibition caused by the increased membrane tension. This unmet requirement for actin in CME explains why endocytosis is inhibited in early mitosis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Membrane tension is elevated in mitotic cells</title><p>Previous reports indicated that due to osmotic changes in mitosis, the plasma membrane tension is increased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Raucher and Sheetz, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Stewart et al., 2011b</xref>). We began by verifying this observation in HeLa cells. To measure apparent membrane tension, a polystyrene bead coated with concanavalin A was held in an optical trap, attached to the plasma membrane, and then pulled away from the cell surface to form a membrane tether (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dai and Sheetz, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). The displacement of the bead from the trap centre is the tether force and this is proportional to the plasma membrane tension (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We found that the tether force was increased from 19.2 ± 1.5 pN in interphase cells to 27 ± 2.8 pN in mitotic cells at metaphase (mean ± SEM, p=0.027, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). These measurements are in good agreement with previous measurements in other cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Raucher and Sheetz, 1999</xref>). Tether force is related to the force required to invaginate a clathrin-coated vesicle. This means that, in mitotic cells, comparatively more energy is required from the CME machinery as it tries to overcome an increased load. The shortfall in this energy may explain mitotic shutdown of CME and the question is: what is the molecular basis of this shortfall?<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00829.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Membrane tension in mitotic cells is elevated.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic diagram to show the principle of using tether force to measure membrane tension.

Fluorescent transferrin binding to abundant transferrin receptors on the plasma membrane can be seen in these pits but the uptake of transferrin is prevented (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fielding et al., 2012</xref>). Our hypothesis was that differences in the proteomes of CCSs purified from interphase or mitotic cells would explain why clathrin-coated pits are arrested at the surface. For example, components of the CME machinery that are regulated might be present in interphase CCSs but could be less abundant in mitotic CCSs. To identify such differences, we prepared fractions enriched in CCSs from interphase or mitotic HeLa cells, according to established methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Borner et al., 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">2012</xref>). These fractions were analysed by mass spectrometry and label-free quantitation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Over four independent experiments, we compared the relative abundance of 1253 proteins, only a subset of which are confirmed CCS proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Borner et al., 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">2012</xref>). The list of all abundances was used to characterise the variance of the dataset and identify outliers (‘Materials and methods’). We found that cortactin was the protein most consistently reduced in mitotic CCSs compared to interphase (LFQ intensity ratio = 46.2). Cortactin is an activator of Arp2/3-dependent actin polymerisation. A list of bona fide CCS proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Borner et al., 2012</xref>) was therefore supplemented with components of the actin cytoskeleton that are recruited to CCSs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Taylor et al., 2011</xref>). The relative abundance of these proteins is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>. These data show that most of the core CME machinery is not altered significantly between CCS-containing fractions from interphase and mitotic samples. Consistent with previous results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chetrit et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kozik et al., 2013</xref>), Dab2 was less abundant and PICALM more abundant in mitotic fractions. HIP1 and HIP1R appeared to be differentially regulated. These two proteins link the clathrin machinery with the actin cytoskeleton and are regulated by binding clathrin light chain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Le Clainche et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wilbur et al., 2008</xref>). The accumulation of HIP1R and the absence of cortactin in mitotic fractions were interesting, given that these two proteins have been shown previously to be coupled functionally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Le Clainche et al., 2007</xref>). Other interesting differences, to be explored in the future, included the accumulation of NSF (N-Ethylmaleimide-Sensitive Factor) in mitotic CCSs (LFQ intensity ratio = 0.077).<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00829.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Comparative proteomics of fractions containing clathrin-coated membranes purified from interphase and mitotic HeLa cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Confocal micrographs of a HeLa cell expressing GFP-tagged clathrin light chain a (clathrin, green).

Quantification of transferrin uptake demonstrated that with either of two independent siRNAs against Ect2, the mitotic shutdown of CME was reversed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–C</xref>). Furthermore, this reversal could itself be blocked by the expression of siRNA-resistant GFP-Ect2 constructs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).

We therefore assessed actin availability to see if this was altered by Ect2 depletion. In mitotic cells depleted of Ect2, the ratio of F-actin fluorescence at the cell cortex vs the cytoplasm was reduced compared with control RNAi cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D,E</xref>). Analysis of cytosolic G-actin, visualised by DNase I staining (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cramer et al., 2002</xref>) revealed small but significant increases in the level of G-actin in mitotic cells depleted of Ect2 compared with control RNAi cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). These observations suggest that Ect2 depletion increases the availability of actin because the cortical F-actin is not efficiently remodelled into a cortex.</p><p>We next measured the membrane tension of mitotic cells following depletion of Ect2. The relative tether force in mitotic cells depleted of Ect2 was not significantly different from control RNAi mitotic cells (1.02 ± 0.15, mean ± SEM, p=0.921, Student’s <italic>t</italic> test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). This ruled out the possibility that actin cytoskeleton changes in Ect2-depletion indirectly decrease membrane tension and therefore restore CME in mitotic cells. The measurement shows that membrane tension remains high in mitotic Ect2-depleted cells.</p><p>Is the restored CME in Ect2-depleted mitotic cells actin-dependent? To test this possibility, we treated cells with latrunculin B (1 µM), a toxin that promotes actin disassembly. We found that restored CME in Ect2-depleted mitotic cells was sensitive to latrunculin B, whereas CME in interphase was not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>). Note that there was no evidence of restarting CME in control mitotic cells treated with latrunculin B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>). This argues against the possibility that the remodelled actin cortex in mitotic cells directly inhibits CME, as its destruction by the drug did not result in endocytosis. These experiments show that restored CME in mitotic cells is different to CME in interphase cells: it is strictly actin-dependent. Together our data demonstrate that the actin cytoskeleton is required for CME in the face of increased membrane tension during mitosis.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>‘Restarting’ CME in mitotic cells: Rap1 activity</title><p>Our second strategy to ‘restart’ CME in mitotic cells was to use a constitutively-active form of the small GTPase Rap1, Rap1(Q63E) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dao et al., 2009</xref>). Rap1 is an activator of β1-, β2- or β3-containing integrins that connect to the actin cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kim et al., 2011</xref>). At mitosis onset, Rap1 is normally inactivated, allowing the disassembly of focal adhesions and actin stress fibres, resulting in cell rounding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dao et al., 2009</xref>). Expression of Rap1(Q63E), but not the inactive mutant Rap1(S17A), causes mitotic cells to remain flat and unable to form a rounded actin cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dao et al., 2009</xref>). Measurement of the ratio of F-actin fluorescence at the cell cortex vs the cytoplasm showed a decrease in Rap1(Q63E)-expressing cells relative to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). The inhibition of cortex formation resulted in ∼20% more G-actin to be available in mitotic cells expressing Rap1(Q63E) compared with control mitotic cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Moreover, membrane tension remained high in mitotic cells expressing Rap1(Q63E) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). The relative tether force was 1.15 ± 0.08 (mean ± SEM, p=0.21, Student’s <italic>t</italic> test). These results indicate that, as with Ect2 depletion, the membrane tension remains high but the prevention of F-actin remodelling in mitosis has resulted in more actin becoming available to assist CME.<fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00829.007</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Restoring CME in mitotic cells by expression of Rap1(Q63E).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative confocal micrographs to show the distribution of F-actin (Phalloidin, red), G-actin (DNase I, green), and DNA (blue) in mitotic HeLa cells.

We found that mitotic cells expressing Rap1(Q63E) exhibited good transferrin uptake and this was comparable to the amount seen in interphase cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E,F</xref>).</p><p>We next investigated the involvement of the actin cytoskeleton in restored CME in Rap1(Q63E)-expressing cells. To do this, we depleted cortactin using RNAi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E,F</xref>). Depletion of cortactin blocked the restored CME in Rap1(Q63E)-expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E,F</xref>). This is in contrast to interphase cells where depletion of cortactin had no effect on CME as measured by transferrin uptake (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E,F</xref>). The cortactin-dependence of restored CME in Rap1(Q63E)-expressing cells was not due to an off-target effect of RNAi. First, it could be demonstrated with two different siRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E,F</xref>). Second, the effect could be rescued by expression of an siRNA resistant form of cortactin in Rap1(Q63E)-expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). This demonstrates that ‘restarted’ CME in mitotic cells is different from CME in interphase: it is dependent on cortactin, a protein that was lost from mitotic CCSs in our proteomic analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). This indicated that using Rap1(Q63E) expression to restart CME in mitotic cells and then inhibiting the restored CME using cortactin depletion, is analogous to the approach above using Ect2 RNAi and latrunculin B. Inhibition of actin function by latrunculin B or cortactin RNAi demonstrate that CME in mitotic cells requires actin and that Ect2 RNAi or Rap1(Q63E)-expression permit the utilisation of actin to restore CME. Both strategies to restart mitotic CME support a model where an unmet requirement for actin in CME due to increased membrane tension, causes shutdown.</p><p>Does ‘restarted’ CME in mitotic cells represent global restoration of CME, or is it specific to CME of the transferrin receptor? To explore this question, we tested for restoration of internalisation of the three main endocytic motifs YXXΦ, [DE]XXXL[LI], and FXNPXY using the CD8 reporter system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kozik et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fielding et al., 2012</xref>). Confocal imaging of the steady-state distribution of CD8 chimeras in control mitotic cells showed no intracellular puncta and all CD8 reporters localised at the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). In mitotic cells expressing Rap1(Q63E), there were numerous intracellular puncta consistent with CME of CD8 chimeras possessing any of the three main endocytic motifs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Note that this assay of endocytosis does not involve temperature shifts, chemical synchronisation or serum starvation, which have been proposed to affect CME (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tacheva-Grigorova et al., 2013</xref>). Moreover, endocytosis of CD8 chimeras as measured by antibody labelling on live cells using a fluorophore-conjugated anti-CD8 antibody confirmed that uptake of CD8 chimeras with endocytic motifs occurred in Rap1(Q63E) expressing mitotic cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>).<fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00829.009</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Internalisation of diverse cargo is restarted in mitotic Rap1(Q63E)-expressing cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative confocal images of control and Rap1(Q63E)-expressing HeLa cells in mitosis that express the indicated CD8 chimera.

Our observations, that mitotic cells are competent for CME if the actin cytoskeleton is made available, runs counter to this hypothesis. We first tested if mitotic phosphorylation of endocytic proteins was maintained in cells with restored CME. We analysed the phosphorylation status of Dab2 by western blotting. Dab2 is a clathrin adaptor for cargo proteins with an NPXY endocytic motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mishra et al., 2002</xref>) and it is known to be phosphorylated in mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">He et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chetrit et al., 2011</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> shows that Dab2 is phosphorylated in mitosis and that this phosphorylation can be reversed by brief treatment of mitotic cells with the Cdk1 inhibitor flavopiridol (5 µM, 10 min) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Losiewicz et al., 1994</xref>). An identical situation was seen in lysates from cells expressing GFP-Rap1(Q63E) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). This suggests that CME of proteins with NPXY motifs can occur (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) despite maintained mitotic phosphorylation of Dab2 by Cdk1. Secondly, we tested whether inhibition of Cdk1 was sufficient to restart CME. Such restarting would be expected if mitotic phosphorylation inhibited the CME machinery directly. To do this, CME was measured using transferrin uptake and flow cytometry. The brief incubation of mitotic cells with flavopiridol (5 or 10 µM) did not restart CME. Together, these results indicate that the direct mitotic phosphorylation of endocytic proteins cannot account for mitotic shut down of CME. It remains possible that phosphorylation of endocytic proteins may have a more minor, modulatory role in mitotic shutdown of CME, but we found no evidence that phosphorylation of the CME machinery renders it inactive. Moreover, it should be noted that cyclin B1-Cdk1 activity orchestrates mitosis and therefore drives the changes that result in the inhibition of CME at a higher level.<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00829.010</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Mitotic phosphorylation does not explain mitotic shutdown of CME.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Western blot to show Dab2 phosphorylation and inhibition by the Cdk1 inhibitor flavopiridol (5 µM, 10 min).

Membrane tension is elevated in mitotic cells and presents a challenge to the CME machinery: it now requires the assistance of actin to overcome this tension and internalise receptors. A proteomic survey revealed a comparative loss of cortactin from mitotic CCSs, implicating the actin cytoskeleton as being key to the inhibition. We showed that mitotic shutdown of CME can be cancelled either by the loss of Ect2 or by constitutive activation of Rap1, two manipulations that increase actin availability by affecting the formation of a rounded actin cortex in mitotic cells. Restored CME under these conditions was uniquely sensitive to latrunculin B-treatment or cortactin-depletion, respectively. This agrees with the idea that the actin cytoskeleton is required for CME in mitotic cells, but it is normally unavailable due to the formation of the cortex. The unmet actin requirement for CME in mitosis is shown schematically in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>.<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00829.011</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Model to show ‘two layer’ inhibition of CME during early mitosis.</title><p>In interphase, CME is continually active and can deploy actin to assist endocytosis if the membrane tension is increased. The forces of CME, actin and membrane tension are represented as green, red and blue arrows, respectively. In mitosis, the membrane tension is increased and actin is required to assist CME, but it is also unavailable due to the formation of the actin cortex. Increasing actin availability, either by Ect2-depletion or expression of Rap1(Q63E), can restore CME in mitotic cells. The membrane tension remains high, but actin is available to assist CME by providing additional force. If the actin cytoskeleton is considered to be a component of the endocytic machinery then its unavailability can be regarded as being due to a ‘moonlighting’ function in the formation of a rounded cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Royle, 2013</xref>).</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00829.011">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00829.011</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-00829-fig7-v1.tif"/></fig></p><p>The mechanism for mitotic shut down of CME can therefore be thought of as a ‘two layer’ inhibition. The first layer of inhibition comes from an increase in membrane tension, mainly due to osmotic changes in mitotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Raucher and Sheetz, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Stewart et al., 2011a</xref>). In interphase cells, CME can overcome such increases in membrane tension by recruiting the actin cytoskeleton to assist in force production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aghamohammadzadeh and Ayscough, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boulant et al., 2011</xref>). However, in mitotic cells, the cytoskeleton is engaged in the formation of a rounded actin cortex and is thus unavailable to assist the CME machinery. This lack of actin availability represents a second layer of inhibition. Local nucleation of actin could therefore provide an override mechanism for receptor internalisation in mitotic cells. Recently, F-actin-dependent internalisation of the EGF receptor has been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Vehlow et al., 2013</xref>) and this may explain how the EGF receptor can be internalised in mitotic cells albeit with delayed kinetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Liu et al., 2011</xref>). An interesting question for the future is how the CME machinery senses increased membrane tension in order to engage the actin cytoskeleton.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Molecular biology</title><p>Plasmids for expression of mCherry-tagged mouse CTTN (ID27676) and mouse HIP1R tagged with tDimer-RFP (ID27700) were from Addgene.

Each lane was cut into 32 slices and then digested with trypsin. The resulting tryptic peptide mixtures in 0.05% trifluoracetic acid were analyzed by nanoACQUITY UPLC system (Waters, UK), coupled to an LTQ Orbitrap XL mass spectrometer with a Proxeon nano-electrospray source. A 5 μl sample of the digest was injected into a BEH-C18 symmetry trapping column (Waters) in 0.1% formic acid at 15 μl/min before being resolved on a 25 cm × 75 μm BEH-C18 column (Waters), in a 1–62.5% acetonitrile gradient in 0.1% formic acid, with a flow rate of 400 nl/min. Full scan MS spectra (<italic>m/z</italic> 300–2000) were generated at 30,000 resolution, and the top five most intense ions were fragmented and subjected to MS/MS in the linear quadrapole ion trap. Ions were fragmented using collision-induced dissociation (collision energy 35%, 30 ms). All spectra were acquired using Xcalibur software (version 2.0.7). RAW files were analysed using MaxQuant version 1.2.7.4 and searched against the Human IPI database, v.3.77. The proteingroups.txt file from a combined MaxQuant analysis of all four experimental runs was used to calculate the interphase/mitotic ratio of LFQ values for each protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Waanders et al., 2009</xref>). A Log2 transformation of each ratio was taken and used to construct a frequency histogram to which a Gaussian function was fitted to find the mean and variance of the entire dataset, and identify outliers (µ ± 2σ). MaxQuant detected the same outliers when each experiment was analysed individually. Excluded from the graph are proteins whose LFQ value for either interphase or mitosis was 0. This could be due to total loss of the protein or poor detection. The following proteins had large LFQ scores (&gt;1 × 10<sup>6</sup>) in one sample but 0 in the other and may therefore represent genuine CCS proteins that are only present in interphase (EPN1, HEXB, CTSC, NUMB) or in mitosis (CFL2, CLTCL1).</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Western blotting</title><p>HeLa cells transfected to express GFP or GFP-Rap1Q63E were synchronised with 100 ng/ml nocodazole for 16 hr at 37°C. Flavopiridol (5 µM) was added for 10 min immediately prior to lysis in RIPA buffer supplemented with PMSF (0.2 mM), NaF (30 mM), and okadaic acid (100 nM). Lysates were analysed by SDS-PAGE and western blotting. Commercially available antibodies were used to Dab2 (sc-13982; Santa Cruz/Insight Biotech, UK), cyclinB1 (554179; BD Biosciences, UK), cdk1 (ab18; Abcam), β-tubulin (ab6046; Abcam), Ect2 (SC-1005; Santa Cruz).</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Microscopy</title><p>Confocal imaging was done using a Leica confocal microscope SP2 with a 63X (1.4 NA) oil-immersion objective, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fielding et al., 2012</xref>); or using a Perkin–Elmer UltraView spinning disk confocal microscope system using 405, 488 and 561 nm lasers and two Orca-R2 cameras (Hamamatsu) under the control of Volocity software (Perkin–Elmer). Epifluorescence images were taken using a Nikon-Ti Eclipse microscope with a 60X (1.4 NA) oil-immersion objective, DS-Qi1Mc camera and standard filter sets for visualisation of DAPI, GFP and Alexa568.</p></sec><sec id="s3-7"><title>Optical trapping</title><p>HeLa cells (400 µl at 5 × 10<sup>5</sup> cells/ml) were plated onto 22 × 50 mm glass cover slips (thickness 1.5). Each cover slip was suspended on blu tac pedestals inside a 10-cm petri dish alongside a 35-mm petri dish with no lid that contained 3 ml DMEM to humidify the larger dish. After 6 hr, 800 µl full DMEM was added to the cells and incubated overnight. This ensured good attachment of cells and a clean, dry surface on the underside of the glass.</p><p>Polybead carboxylate 1 µm microspheres (Polysciences/Park Scientific, UK) were coated with concanavalin A using a Polylink protein coupling kit. This gave 20 µg of protein per 1 mg of microparticle. For trapping experiments, the bead solution was diluted (1:20) in full DMEM. A microchamber was created by sealing a small cover glass over the slide on which the cells were grown using high vacuum grease (Apiezon). Bead suspension (10 µl) was introduced by capillary action and the microchamber was mounted onto a custom-made optical trap microscope, described elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carter and Cross, 2005</xref>). The stiffness of the optical trap was calibrated for each experiment, typically ∼0.3 pN/nm. A single bead was captured and held on the cell surface at a distance of 4–8 µm from the substrate, for several seconds. The bead was then pulled away, forming a membrane tether (&gt;10 µm length), by moving the microscope stage under computer control at a constant velocity. The displacement of the bead in the optical trap (and thus tether force) was measured using a quadrant detector at 5–20 kHz. Once the displacement was established, the cell was moved back towards the bead faster than the tether recovery rate to provide a zero force reference (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The cell was then moved back away and tether force was re-established. Tension values were taken from a 1 s averaged before stage manipulation. All measurements were taken less than 30 s after tether formation, because actin polymerisation into the tether introduced inconsistent measurements in older tethers. Measurements from multiple tethers pulled from the same cell indicated high reproducibility and showed that a single force measurement was representative of the membrane tension of that cell. Occasionally, double tethers visible in DIC were pulled by a single bead and these gave a twofold increase in tether force from the same cell. Data from double tethers were not included here.</p></sec><sec id="s3-8"><title>Flow cytometry</title><p>As previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fielding et al., 2012</xref>), mitotic cells were synchronised with 100 ng/ml nocodazole for 18 hr and harvested by shake-off. Interphase cells were growing asynchronously and harvested by trypsinisation. The cells were spun down at 1000 rpm for 5 min and resuspended in serum free DMEM, and this step was repeated. For the mitotic samples, 100 ng/ml nocodazole was added to prevent progression through mitosis. After 20 min of incubation at 37°C, flavopiridol was added for a further 10 min at 37°C. The cells were moved to ice for 2 min then Alexa488-conjugated transferrin (50 µg/ml dilution) added on ice for 5 min. Uptake was allowed for 7 min at 37°C. Then, the cells were pelleted, resuspended in acid wash buffer and incubated on ice for 5 min. After a second acid wash, the cells were pelleted and resuspended in 1% (wt/vol) BSA/PBS. Finally, the samples were analysed by flow cytometry (FACSCalibur; Becton Dickinson). The forward scatter channel (FSC) was gated at 200 in order to exclude all particles smaller than cells from analysis. The side scatter channel (SSC) was adjusted to 320 V and the fluorescent channel (FL1) to 385 V. The geometric mean of FL1 was used for the graphs.</p></sec><sec id="s3-9"><title>Data analysis</title><p>Transferrin uptake quantification was performed in ImageJ using confocal images, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fielding et al., 2012</xref>). For quantification of G-actin and F-actin fluorescence, a 24 pixel wide ROI was created at the cell border using a confocal z-section taken at the cell equator. A second ROI was created by placing a 50 × 50 ROI in the cytoplasm. The background-subtracted values were used to calculate the mean G-actin signal in the cytoplasm and a ratio of cortex/cytoplasm ratio for F-actin. All analysis, plots and statistical testing (see legends for details) were done in IgorPro 6.32A (WaveMetrics). Figures were assembled in Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator CS5.1.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Rachel Jones for technical help and Georg Borner and Scottie Robinson for help and advice on clathrin-coated vesicle proteomics.

Your full submission has been evaluated by a Senior editor and 3 peer reviewers, one of whom, Pascale Cossart, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the decision was reached after discussions between the reviewers.</p><p>The manuscript addresses an important question and provides robust data suggesting that actin participates in cortical stiffness and is unavailable for CME during mitosis. However, this stiffness is not measured and direct measurement of actin availability is also not made. These experiments may take time. In the spirit of our policy to ask for revisions only when these are straightforward, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication at this point.</p><p><italic>Reviewer</italic> <italic>#1:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript the authors address the long standing issue that endocytosis is less efficient during mitosis compared to interphase. They identify cortactin as the protein whose levels are the more dramatically changed, in mitotic versus interphase cellular fractions considered as enriched in clathrin coated structures (CCSs).</p><p>This leads the authors to the hypothesis that the cytoskeleton dynamics might be a key issue. Using two approaches they show that restoring actin dynamics leads to an increase in transferrin uptake in mitotic cells. In addition, they show that dab2 phosphorylation in mitosis does not regulate the endocytosis pathway. This is a convincing manuscript but controls are lacking such as rescue experiments of RNAi treated cells. The literature on the role of actin in endocytosis is not correctly cited.</p><p><italic>Reviewer</italic> <italic>#2:</italic></p><p>The paper by Fielding, Gassner and Royle presents evidence that clathrin mediated endocytosis (CME) in mitotic cells is inhibited due to sequestration of actin at the actin cortex. The authors propose that this, combined with increased membrane tension, effectively blocks CME of transferrin receptor (TfnR).</p><p>This is a short and clearly presented paper with a straightforward story. I have only a few minor questions.</p><p>1) Can the authors discount indirect effects and / or alternative mechanisms by which Rap1/Ect2 expression manipulations affect CME?</p><p>2) Hip1 and Hip1R are respectively enriched and depleted in clathrin coated structures (CCS) from mitotic cells. Can the authors comment on the difference in distribution between these two similar proteins?</p><p>3) Can the authors test whether hypo-osmotic conditions (relieving the presumed increase in mitotic cell surface tension) ‘re-starts’ CME?</p><p>4) Strikingly, the most enriched protein in mitotic CCS is NSF. Can the authors comment?</p><p>5) Flavopiridol (the Cdk1 inhibitor) did seem to reduce the phosphorylation of Dab2 a little but since this adaptor is not implicated in TfR endocytosis I’m not sure how this is relevant. There are a lot of different kinases implicated either directly or indirectly in controlling CME, so pinning everything on Cdk1 seems a bit weak. Then again, perhaps control could be exerted by other kinases downstream of Cdk1? Perhaps this would just be better in supplementary information?</p><p><italic>Reviewer</italic> <italic>#3:</italic></p><p>Here the authors seek to understand the mechanism by which clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) is downregulated during mitosis. In particular, they seek to distinguish between two alternative mechanisms of downregulation -phosphorylation and inhibition of CME proteins, or increased membrane tension involving the actin cytoskeleton. Their evidence suggests that regulation by phosphorylation does not play a primary role. Instead they find that indirectly perturbing cortical actin enables CME during mitosis, suggesting that modulating cortical tension or stiffness is important for downregulating mitotic CME. Based on this, they propose a model in which mitotic CME is inhibited because actin participates in cortical stiffness and is unavailable for CME.</p><p>On the positive side, this manuscript addresses a very interesting topic, and the findings are suggestive. Nevertheless, the major conclusions are not well supported by the data provided, as outlined below:</p><p>1) How accurate is the mass-spec quantification of protein abundance in interphase versus mitosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>)? The authors are careful to carry out four independent experiments, and identify proteins that are either enriched or depleted in mitotic cells relative to interphase cells. However, they should offer a better explanation of the methods for quantifying relative protein abundance.</p><p>2) The authors propose the general idea that cortical actin negatively regulates mitotic CME. The data to support this are provided in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2 fig3">Figures 2 and 3</xref>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> shows that expression of a constitutively activated Rap1 (which supposedly disrupts cortical actin and prevents mitotic rounding) activates CME in mitosis, and this activation is prevented by depleting cortactin. The conclusion is that “actin is required, but unavailable for, CME in mitotic cells”. However, there is no direct test of actin “availability” to support this conclusion, and it is unclear what the authors mean by the word “availability”. Are they suggesting that the ratio of G-actin to F-actin is altered in mitotic versus interphase cells? Or, are they suggesting that actin filaments are somehow unavailable based on their localization to the cortex? They should more carefully define their hypothesis, and provide more direct tests of their ideas.</p><p>Along these same lines, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> shows that depletion of Ect2 (a Rho GEF that affects cortical actin) also activates CME in mitosis, and that this effect is suppressed by adding the actin sequestering drug latrunculin B. Again, the conclusion is that “an unmet requirement for actin in CME causes shutdown.” Although the activated CME is clearly actin dependent, it is unclear from these results whether enabling actin function in mitosis, or making it more “available”, would be sufficient to restart CME. One possible test would be to express constitutively active ADF/cofilin, which might render actin more “available”, and test whether this enables mitotic CME. In any case, additional evidence is needed to support the conclusion.</p><p>3) To test for phosphoregulation of CME during mitosis, the authors briefly treat cells with the Cdk1 inhibitor flavopiridol, which inhibits the mitotic phosphorylation of the CME protein Dab2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Flavopiridol does not affect mitotic CME, leading the authors to conclude that “the direct mitotic phosphorylation of endocytic proteins cannot account for mitotic shut down of CME”. However, this one experiment is not sufficient to support this conclusion. The time period of inhibition (10 min) may not be enough to reduce mitotic phosphorylation of all CME proteins. Also, additional inhibitors or RNAi should be employed to bolster the conclusions. It would be surprising if mitotic phosphorylation plays no role in inhibition of CME, as it is the major mechanism for regulating the mitotic transition.</p><p>Minor comments:</p><p>1) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>: The authors should test the effect of cortactin RNAi on CME in cells not expressing Rap1(Q63E).</p><p>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>: A Western blot showing cortactin depletion should also be shown, and multiple cortactin siRNAs should be employed as controls, as is done for Ect2.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00829.013</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p><italic>In this manuscript the authors address the long standing issue that endocytosis is less efficient during mitosis compared to interphase.

Using two approaches they show that restoring actin dynamics leads to an increase in transferrin uptake in mitotic cells. In addition, they show that dab2 phosphorylation in mitosis does not regulate the endocytosis pathway</italic>.</p><p>We thank the reviewer for their time and constructive comments on our manuscript. We were very pleased that they recognised the importance of the question that we are addressing and that they found our manuscript convincing.</p><p><italic>This is a convincing manuscript but controls are lacking such as rescue experiments of RNAi treated cells</italic>.</p><p>There are two RNAi experiments in the paper, depletion of Ect2 and depletion of CTTN, and we have now performed rescue experiments for both. For the Ect2 knockdown experiment, we have tested for transferrin uptake in cells expressing GFP or GFP-Ect2 (siRNA resistant), cells were treated with control or Ect2 siRNA. We see restarting of mitosis only when endogenous Ect2 is depleted and no exogenous Ect2 is expressed. This is now presented as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3–figure supplement 1</xref> and shows that restarting of CME in Ect2-depleted cells is due to loss of Ect2 protein.</p><p>For the CTTN knockdown in Rap1(Q63E)-expressing cells, which prevents restoration of CME in mitotic cells, we have now included a second CTTN siRNA that shows the same effect. We have also performed a rescue experiment that demonstrates that the loss of CTTN is responsible for preventing restoration of CME in mitotic cells expressing Rap1(Q63E). The only conditions in which we see mitotic CME is when CTTN is present when Rap1(Q63E) is expressed. The controls for this experiment, where mCherry-cortactin is expressed in control mitotic cells also allow us to make the point that it is not simply loss of CTTN during mitosis that causes mitotic shutdown of CME. This was one possible interpretation of our proteomics experiments.</p><p><italic>The literature on the role of actin in endocytosis is not correctly cited</italic>.</p><p>We are not sure to which literature the reviewer is referring. One omission was for us not to acknowledge that in mammalian cells, actin is essential for pathogen entry. We have now added a sentence to rectify this. In light of the comment from Reviewer #2, we have reworded the sentence on whether actin has an obligatory role in mammalian CME.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p><italic>The paper by Fielding, Gassner and Royle presents evidence that clathrin mediated endocytosis (CME) in mitotic cells is inhibited due to sequestration of actin at the actin cortex. The authors propose that this, combined with increased membrane tension, effectively blocks CME of transferrin receptor (TfnR)</italic>.</p><p><italic>This is a short and clearly presented paper with a straightforward story. I have only a few minor questions</italic>.</p><p>We thank the reviewer for their time and constructive comments on our manuscript. We were very pleased that they had only minor comments.</p><p><italic>1) Can the authors discount indirect effects and / or alternative mechanisms by which Rap1/Ect2 expression manipulations affect CME</italic>?</p><p>We have added several experiments that demonstrate that restoration of CME in mitotic cells by either Rap1(Q63E) expression or Ect2 depletion is due to making actin available to assist the CME machinery to overcome increased membrane tension. In brief, the manuscript now shows:</p><p>1. Membrane tension is elevated in mitotic cells and stays elevated after Rap1(Q63E) expression or Ect2 depletion</p><p>2. Rap1(Q63E) expression or Ect2 depletion make more actin available (G-actin increase) by preventing F-actin to be remodelled at the cortex (F-actin ratio decrease)</p><p>3. The restored CME is actin-dependent. It can be blocked by latrunculin B treatment (for Ect2 depletion) or by cortactin RNAi (for Q63E expression).</p><p>4. Restarting of CME in Ect2-depleted mitotic cells can be blocked by expression of siRNA-resistant forms of GFP-Ect2. Two Ect2 siRNAs are used and rescued, showing that the phenomenon is due to loss of Ect2.</p><p>5. Cancelling restarted CME in Rap1(Q63E)-expressing mitotic cells by depletion of cortactin can itself be blocked by expression of siRNA-resistant mCherry-cortactin. This shows that the specificity of cortactin depletion is due to loss of cortactin protein and is not a result of an off-target effect.</p><p><italic>2) Hip1 and Hip1R are respectively enriched and depleted in clathrin coated structures (CCS) from mitotic cells. Can the authors comment on the difference in distribution between these two similar proteins</italic>?</p><p>We have now localised the distribution of HIP1R, HIP1, and CTTN together with clathrin in interphase and mitotic cells to verify these results from the proteomic survey. This is now shown in the main proteomics figure (now <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). We find that all three co-localise with some clathrin spots in interphase. For HIP1 and CTTN, the proteins become diffusely localised in mitosis, i.e. the association with clathrin is reduced. We also found a similar pattern with antibodies to the endogenous proteins (not shown) and so these findings agree with the comparative proteomics.</p><p>We do not know why HIP1R and HIP1 are differentially regulated in this way. This is an important question for the future. We have made a series of cortactin mutants that block and mimic mitotic phosphorylation, none of which did anything noticeable to the distribution of cortactin in mitosis. We feel that understanding the mislocalisation of HIP1 and cortactin is key to this difference. We will investigate this in the future but feel that this is beyond the scope of this study.</p><p><italic>3) Can the authors test whether hypo-osmotic conditions (relieving the presumed increase in mitotic cell surface tension) ‘re-starts’ CME</italic>?</p><p>We have attempted this manipulation along with many others, summarised briefly below. The short answer is “no, it doesn’t”, probably due to homeostasis.</p><p>We have carried out a serial dilution toward hypo-osmotic conditions (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Author response image 1</xref> below). This manipulation eventually inhibits CME in interphase cells, but CME in mitotic cells in unaffected. To decrease membrane tension hyper-osmotic conditions are required, to shrink the cell. This condition (e.g., 0.45M sucrose) is known to inhibit CME by making clathrin form microcages. We tried to dial this back using different salt concentrations and got good inhibition in the interphase cells and no increase in mitotic cells.<fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Osmolarity change and CME.</title><p>Transferrin uptake in HeLa cells treated as indicated by diluting the media by the indicated amount of water.

In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> of Stewart et al. 2011 (PMID 21196934) you can see that cells rebound in 2 min after a change in osmolarity.

These are coarse reagents like DMSO, ethanol, and deoxycholate (!). We found that they permeabilise the plasma membrane allowing non-specific entry of fluorescent transferrin.</p><p><italic>4) Strikingly, the most enriched protein in mitotic CCS is NSF. Can the authors comment</italic>?</p><p>We have used the proteomics data to point us in the right direction of actin. There are quite a few interesting things in the dataset and we are currently following some of these up. We have added a sentence to draw attention to NSF as the protein that accumulates most on mitotic CCSs. We have also added details of several proteins that were off-the-dial and not plotted (see response to Reviewer #3 comment 1). Uncoating is known to be inhibited in mitotic cells and our best guess is that this is why we see some proteins accumulating in the mitotic sample.</p><p><italic>5) Flavopiridol (the Cdk1 inhibitor) did seem to reduce the phosphorylation of Dab2 a little but since this adaptor is not implicated in TfR endocytosis I’m not sure how this is relevant. There are a lot of different kinases implicated either directly or indirectly in controlling CME, so pinning everything on Cdk1 seems a bit weak. Then again, perhaps control could be exerted by other kinases downstream of Cdk1? Perhaps this would just be better in supplementary information</italic>?</p><p>We thank the reviewer for feedback on this point. We have now tested whether endocytosis of the three main endocytic motifs is restored by expression of Rap1(Q63E). To do this, we used CD8 chimeric reporters with YXXΦ, [DE]XXXL[LI], and FXNPXY. We found that all of the reporters are restarted. Importantly this includes an FXNPXY reporter that is the type of motif recognised by Dab2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mishra et al., 2002</xref>). This makes a link to the experiments showing that Dab2 remains phosphorylated in mitotic cells expressing Rap1(Q63E). As FXNPXY motifs can be internalised in these cells then it argues that the phosphorylation (of Dab2 at least) cannot be inhibitory. We think these experiments are important and they remain in the main paper (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).</p><p>We accept the criticism that pinning everything on Cdk1 (albeit the master kinase in mitosis) and only looking at one adaptor is not comprehensive. We have now tempered this section by noting that mitotic phosphorylation could modulate the shut down process but that it cannot be solely responsible. We feel this is the most parsimonious explanation.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p><italic>Here the authors seek to understand the mechanism by which clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) is downregulated during mitosis. In particular, they seek to distinguish between two alternative mechanisms of downregulation -phosphorylation and inhibition of CME proteins, or increased membrane tension involving the actin cytoskeleton. Their evidence suggests that regulation by phosphorylation does not play a primary role. Instead they find that indirectly perturbing cortical actin enables CME during mitosis, suggesting that modulating cortical tension or stiffness is important for downregulating mitotic CME. Based on this, they propose a model in which mitotic CME is inhibited because actin participates in cortical stiffness and is unavailable for CME</italic>.</p><p><italic>On the positive side, this manuscript addresses a very interesting topic, and the findings are suggestive. Nevertheless, the major conclusions are not well supported by the data provided, as outlined below</italic>:</p><p>We thank the reviewer for their time and constructive comments on our manuscript. We were very pleased that they recognised the question that we are addressing is very interesting. We have undertaken substantial revisions that better support our major conclusions.</p><p><italic>1) How accurate is the mass-spec quantification of protein abundance in interphase versus mitosis (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1</italic></xref><italic>)? The authors are careful to carry out four independent experiments, and identify proteins that are either enriched or depleted in mitotic cells relative to interphase cells. However, they should offer a better explanation of the methods for quantifying relative protein abundance</italic>.</p><p>We think that the mass-spec quantitation is certainly accurate enough to show us which proteins are altered and in which direction. Even with the variability of the CCS proteome in this preparation (we were especially stringent in using 2 standard deviations as the limit for variability). For absolute quantification, to confirm how many copies of a given protein are present per clathrin triskelion, then a more detailed analysis would be required (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Borner et al., 2012</xref> PMID 22472443). The absolute quantitation is interesting, but it is not the focus here.</p><p>To verify our proteomic analysis, we have now added localisation experiments to show that the relative loss of HIP1 and CTTN in CCSs in mitosis is a real phenomenon that can be visualised in cells. Our proteomic analysis also found Dab2 and PICALM as depleted or enriched on mitotic CCSs, respectively, which had been reported previously. We were pleased that the reviewer recognised our efforts to show the reproducibility of these changes using four independent (completely independent) proteomic experiments.</p><p>For a better explanation of the methods, we have now expanded the methods section to better describe how this part of the work was done. One limitation to our approach is that any proteins that are present in one sample, but not detected in the other sample, are not included on the bar chart in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, because log2 of x/0 or 0/x is ∞ or −∞, respectively. We excluded those from the plot as this could be a detection issue rather than an absolute loss of the protein from one sample. A note about this has now been added.</p><p><italic>2) The authors propose the general idea that cortical actin negatively regulates mitotic CME. The data to support this are provided in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2 fig3"><italic>Figures 2 and 3</italic></xref><italic>.</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2</italic></xref> <italic>shows that expression of a constitutively activated Rap1 (which supposedly disrupts cortical actin and prevents mitotic rounding) activates CME in mitosis, and this activation is prevented by depleting cortactin. The conclusion is that “actin is required, but unavailable for, CME in mitotic cells”. However, there is no direct test of actin “availability” to support this conclusion, and it is unclear what the authors mean by the word “availability”. Are they suggesting that the ratio of G-actin to F-actin is altered in mitotic versus interphase cells?

Because actin is remodelled into the actomyosin cortex in mitotic cells we propose that it is unavailable to assist CME.</p><p>In the previous version of the manuscript we had shown that we could restart CME in mitotic cells and that this endocytosis was uniquely actin-dependent. We proposed that this was due to “freeing-up” actin by inhibiting cortex formation; we also assumed that the membrane tension remained high following these manipulations. We have now undertaken significant experimental work that directly tests our ideas.</p><p>1. We have measured F-actin and G-actin by light microscopy in cells with Ect2 depletion or with Rap1(Q63E) expression. This shows that the F-actin at the cortex is reduced relative the cytoplasmic level. Also, the G-actin levels in the cytoplasm are increased (a small but significant increase of 10-20%).</p><p>2. We have measured membrane tension using laser tweezers and confirmed that tension remains high in mitotic cells that are either depleted of Ect2 or are expressing Rap1(Q63E).</p><p>3. Just to be clear, we are not proposing “the general idea that cortical actin negatively regulates mitotic CME” if the reviewer thought that we meant that cortical actin physically gets in the way of CME. We have now added a sentence to the discussion of the latrunculin B experiments to make this point more clearly. Latrunculin B treatment of mitotic cells does not cause restarting of CME that would be expected if the cortical actin directly inhibits CME.</p><p><italic>3) To test for phosphoregulation of CME during mitosis, the authors briefly treat cells with the Cdk1 inhibitor flavopiridol, which inhibits the mitotic phosphorylation of the CME protein Dab2 (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><italic>Figure 4</italic></xref><italic>). Flavopiridol does not affect mitotic CME, leading the authors to conclude that “the direct mitotic phosphorylation of endocytic proteins cannot account for mitotic shut down of CME”.

We were obviously not clear enough about our interpretation of these experiments and we have addressed this in the revised version.</p><p>The time point of inhibition with Flavopiridol was selected so that cells do not reverse out of mitosis back into G2 (Potapova et al., 2006 PMID 16612388). It is possible that phosphorylation of all CME proteins may not be reduced in this time, but this is not the sole set of experiments on which we pin our conclusion.</p><p>We have now tested whether endocytosis of the three main endocytic motifs is restored by expression of Rap1(Q63E).
