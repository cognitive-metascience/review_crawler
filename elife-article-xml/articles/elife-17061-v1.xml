effects. As part of such adaptation they maintain an active memory of heat stress for several days that promotes a more efficient response to recurring stress. We show that this heat stress memory requires the activity of the <italic>FORGETTER1 (FGT1</italic>) locus, with <italic>fgt1</italic> mutants displaying reduced maintenance of heat-induced gene expression. <italic>FGT1</italic> encodes the <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> orthologue of Strawberry notch (Sno), and the protein globally associates with the promoter regions of actively expressed genes in a heat-dependent fashion. FGT1 interacts with chromatin remodelers of the SWI/SNF and ISWI families, which also display reduced heat stress memory. Genomic targets of the BRM remodeler overlap significantly with FGT1 targets. Accordingly, nucleosome dynamics at loci with altered maintenance of heat-induced expression are affected in <italic>fgt1</italic>. Together, our results suggest that by modulating nucleosome occupancy, FGT1 mediates stress-induced chromatin memory.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.17061.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.17061.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17061.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>In nature, plant growth is often limited by unfavourable conditions or disease. Plants have thus evolved sophisticated mechanisms to adapt to such stresses. In fact, brief exposure to stress can prime plants to be better prepared for a future stress following a period without stress. However, the molecular basis of this memory-like phenomenon is poorly understood.</p><p>Now, Brzezinka, Altmann et al. have used priming by heat stress as a model to dissect the memory of environmental stresses in thale cress, <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>. First, a library of mutant plants were tested to identify a gene that is specifically required for heat stress memory but not for the initial responses to heat. Brzezinka, Altmann et al. identified one such gene and termed it <italic>FORGETTER1</italic> (or <italic>FGT1</italic> for short). Further experiments then revealed that the FGT1 protein binds directly to a specific class of heat-inducible genes that are relevant for heat stress memory.</p><p>Brzezinka, Altmann et al. propose that the FGT1 protein makes sure that the heat-inducible genes are always accessible and active by modifying the way the DNA containing these genes is packaged. DNA is wrapped around protein complexes called nucleosomes and depending on how tightly the DNA of a gene is wrapped makes it more or less easy to activate the gene. In agreement with this model, FGT1 does interact with proteins that can reposition nucleosomes and leave the DNA more loosely packaged. Also, the fact that plants that lack a working <italic>FGT1</italic> gene repackage the DNA of memory-related genes too early after experiencing heat stress provides further support for the model.</p><p>Together these findings could lead to new approaches for breeding programmes to improve stress tolerance in crop plants. One future challenge will be to find out whether memories involving nucleosomes are also made in response to other stressful conditions, such as attack by pests and disease.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.17061.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.17061.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>priming</kwd><kwd>chromatin memory</kwd><kwd>DExD/H helicase</kwd><kwd>heat stress</kwd><kwd>nucleosome remodeling</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>A. thaliana</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005156</institution-id><institution>Alexander von Humboldt-Stiftung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Sofja-Kovalevskaja-Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bäurle</surname><given-names>Isabel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFB973, Project A2</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bäurle</surname><given-names>Isabel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000288</institution-id><institution>Royal Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>University Resarch Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bäurle</surname><given-names>Isabel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Environmentally-mediated gene induction is extended beyond the duration of an external cue by sustaining a nucleosome-depleted chromatin structure.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Abiotic stress is a major threat to global crop yields and this problem is likely to be exacerbated in the future. A large body of research has focused on the immediate stress responses. However, in nature, stress is frequently chronic or recurring, suggesting that temporal dynamics are an important, but under-researched, component of plant stress responses. Indeed, plants can be primed by a stress exposure such that they respond more efficiently to another stress incident that occurs after a stressless period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hilker et al., 2015</xref>). Priming has been described in response to pathogen attack, heat stress (HS), drought, and salt stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Charng et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Conrath, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jaskiewicz et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ding et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sani et al., 2013</xref>). Such stress priming and memory may be particularly beneficial to plants due to their sessile life style.</p><p>Chromatin structure can be modulated by nucleosome positioning, histone variants and posttranslational histone modifications that together control the access of sequence-specific transcription factors and the general transcription machinery to gene loci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Struhl and Segal, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zentner and Henikoff, 2013</xref>). Chromatin mediates long-term stability of environmentally and developmentally-induced gene expression states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gendrel and Heard, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Steffen and Ringrose, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Berry and Dean, 2015</xref>). Hence, the modification of chromatin structure has been suggested to mediate the priming and memory of stress-induced gene expression. Indeed, the above mentioned cases of plant stress priming are associated with lasting histone H3 methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Conrath, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jaskiewicz et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ding et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sani et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lämke et al., 2016</xref>). However, the underlying mechanism and the contribution of other determinants of chromatin structure such as nucleosome positioning and occupancy remain unknown.</p><p>Moderate HS allows a plant to acquire thermotolerance and subsequently withstand high temperatures that are lethal to a plant in the naïve state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mittler et al., 2012</xref>). After returning to non-stress temperatures, acquired thermotolerance is maintained over several days, and this maintenance phase is genetically separable from the acquisition phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Charng et al., 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Meiri and Breiman, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Stief et al., 2014</xref>). We refer to this maintenance phase as HS memory. The immediate HS response (acquisition phase) involves the activation of heat shock transcription factors (HSFs) that induce heat shock proteins (HSPs). Their chaperone activity ensures protein homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Scharf et al., 2012</xref>). The HS response is conserved in animals, plants and fungi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Richter et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Among the 21 HSFs in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Scharf et al., 2012</xref>), only <italic>HSFA2</italic> is specifically required for HS memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Charng et al., 2007</xref>). It activates <italic>HEAT-STRESS-ASSOCIATED32 (HSA32</italic>), a gene with chaperone-like activity, although no homology to known chaperone families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wu et al., 2013</xref>). Like <italic>HSFA2, HSA32</italic> is critically required for HS memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Charng et al., 2006</xref>). <italic>HSA32</italic> is induced by HS and this induction is sustained for at least three days. A set of HS memory-related genes was identified based on their similar expression pattern, which is in contrast to that of canonical HS-inducible genes (<italic>HSP70, HSP101</italic>) that show upregulation after HS, but not sustained induction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Stief et al., 2014</xref>). Among the HS memory-related genes are small HSPs (such as <italic>HSP21, HSP22.0, HSP18.2</italic>). A subset of these loci show transcriptional memory in the sense that recurring stress causes a more efficient re-activation compared to the first stress incident, even though active transcription has subsided before the second stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lämke et al., 2016</xref>). Sustained induction and transcriptional memory of these genes is associated with hyper-methylation of H3K4 (H3K4me2 and H3K4me3) and requires HSFA2, which binds directly to these genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lämke et al., 2016</xref>). Interestingly, HSFA2 dissociates from these loci before its requirement becomes apparent at the physiological and gene expression levels, thus implicating the existence of additional factors.</p><p>Here, we report the identification of <italic>FGT1</italic> from an unbiased screen for factors that are required for the sustained induction of <italic>HSA32. FGT1</italic> is required for HS memory at the physiological and gene expression levels. FGT1 is the single <italic>A. thaliana</italic> orthologue of metazoan Strawberry notch, a highly conserved co-activator of the developmental regulator Notch. We show that FGT1 associates with memory genes in a HS-dependent way. Moreover, FGT1 is widely associated with the transcriptional start site of expressed genes. We further show that FGT1 interacts with highly conserved chromatin remodeling complexes and is required for proper nucleosome dynamics at HS-memory genes. Thus, FGT1 maintains its target loci in an open and transcription-competent state by interacting with remodeler complexes around the transcriptional start site.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>FGT1</italic> is required for HS memory and sustained induction of <italic>HSA32</italic> and other memory genes</title><p>In order to identify regulators of HS memory we generated a transgenic <italic>HSA32::HSA32-LUCIFERASE (HSA32::HSA32-LUC</italic>) reporter line. <italic>LUC</italic> expression in this line was induced by HS and expression remained high for at least 3 d (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), thus mimicking expression of the endogenous <italic>HSA32</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Charng et al., 2006</xref>).

Notably, unspliced transcript levels in the parent were still elevated 20-fold relative to the non-HS control (NHS) at 69 h after ACC, indicating continued transcription throughout the memory phase. Similar results were obtained for <italic>HSP21</italic>, but not for the non-memory genes. This is in accordance with what was observed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lämke et al., 2016</xref>).

Thus, we investigated the global correlation of FGT1 binding and expression under NHS conditions by plotting global coverage profiles grouped according to the relative expression in non-stressed seedlings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gan et al., 2011</xref>). This revealed that FGT1 is preferentially associated with expressed genes at a global scale (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). FGT1 is most strongly associated with genes that have high or intermediate expression in a pattern similar to that observed for the peak genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). We next asked whether FGT1 shows differential association with genes that are HS-responsive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Stief et al., 2014</xref>). FGT1 associated most strongly with those expressed genes that are upregulated at 4 h after ACC, irrespective of their expression level before HS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). This is especially true for genes that are lowly expressed without HS; this category contains typical HS-responsive genes. Accordingly, FGT1 associated most strongly with genes that are upregulated at 4 h and/ or 52 h after ACC and this is more pronounced in the ACC samples (Figure 7C). Thus, HS increases binding of FGT1 to HS-responsive genes globally, and these genes are associated with low levels of FGT1 already before HS.</p><p>The <italic>A. thaliana</italic> genome was categorized into nine chromatin states based on the differential presence of histone modifications, variants and DNA methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sequeira-Mendes et al., 2014</xref>). Analyzing the overlap between FGT1-bound sequences with different chromatin states, we found that FGT1 was highly enriched in sequences annotated as chromatin state 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). This state is found in poised chromatin, mostly in promoters and intergenic regions (hence transcript levels are low). It is enriched in H3.3, H3K4me2, H3K4me3, H2A.Z, H2Bub, H3K27me3, AT-rich and relatively low in overall nucleosome abundance. Strikingly, state 2 peaks immediately before the TSS, and has a smaller peak just after the TTS, mimicking closely the global coverage profile of FGT1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sequeira-Mendes et al., 2014</xref>). In contrast, FGT1 was depleted from the heterochromatic states 8 and 9. Thus, FGT1 binding globally associates with the nucleosome-poor regions flanking the transcription units of expressed genes.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>FGT1 interacts with SWI/SNF and ISWI chromatin remodelers</title><p>To elucidate the mechanism of how FGT1 promotes gene expression, we isolated FGT1-interacting proteins.

FGT1-YFP and associated proteins were then subjected to LC-MS/MS analysis. As controls, we performed purifications on <italic>35S::YFP</italic> and Col-0 plants, respectively. Among the peptides identified specifically in the FGT1-YFP samples were both <italic>A. thaliana</italic> orthologues of the ISWI chromatin remodeler, CHR11 and CHR17, and the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeler BRAHMA (BRM), suggesting that FGT1 interacts with chromatin remodeling proteins (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>).

We did not observe differences between the ACC and NHS samples, suggesting that the mode of action of FGT1 is independent of HS. To confirm the interactions between FGT1 and the remodelers we used bimolecular fluorescent complementation in transiently transformed tobacco leaves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Walter et al., 2004</xref>). We thus confirmed the interaction of FGT1 with CHR11, CHR17 and BRM in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). In summary, FGT1 interacts with chromatin remodeling proteins of the ISWI and SWI/SNF classes.<table-wrap id="tbl1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17061.015</object-id><label>Table 1.</label><caption><p>FGT1 interacts with chromatin remodeling proteins <italic>in vivo</italic>.

We observed a highly significant overlap between genes associated with BRM under non-stress conditions and FGT1-associated genes (NHS and ACC; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Globally, BRM was more strongly associated with FGT1 ACC target genes than with the rest of the genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Strikingly, BRM showed a very similar coverage profile as FGT1; a pronounced peak at the TSS and a second, weaker peak just downstream the TTS. When comparing the association with genes that are induced at 4 and/or 52 h after ACC, we found BRM to be strongly enriched at memory genes (up at 4 and 52 h) and late-inducible genes (up at 52 h only), compared to downregulated or non-responsive genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). Again, this was very similar to the results observed for FGT1. Notably, the association of BRM and (to a lesser extent) FGT1 with memory genes was established before HS. The overlapping binding pattern of FGT1 and BRM was also apparent from browser screenshots of individual loci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>).

We identified FGT1 from an unbiased mutagenesis screen for factors that are required for the maintenance of high <italic>HSA32::LUC</italic> expression after HS, but not for its initial induction. Genome-wide determination of FGT1-binding sites and its high phylogenetic conservation suggest that FGT1 has a general function in promoting gene expression. FGT1 interacts with conserved chromatin remodeling complexes, and the catalytic subunits of these complexes are also required for physiological HS memory. Together, our data suggest the following model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>); HS induces memory gene expression through HSF proteins. FGT1 binds to these loci at the nucleosome-depleted region (NDR) adjacent to the TSS, where it interacts with nucleosome remodeling complexes. By tuning nucleosome occupancy around the TSS, FGT1 maintains these loci in a memory-competent state. This allows active transcription to be maintained for several days after HS, thus contributing to HS memory.<fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17061.026</object-id><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>FGT1 interacts with chromatin remodelers and affects nucleosome dynamics during transcription and HS memory.</title><p>Top: Schematic representation of HS memory gene expression in wild type and <italic>fgt1</italic> after acclimatizing HS (ACC).

Whether FGT1 interacts with HSFA2 and H3K4 methylation remains a question for future studies. FGT1 and BRM are associated with HS memory loci already before HS, when their expression levels are low. FGT1 binding increases after HS and is maintained at high levels over the course of HS memory. It is unclear whether HS memory is conserved outside the plant kingdom. However, our results strongly indicate that FGT1 has a more generic role in transcription, despite the lack of morphological aberrations under standard growth conditions. This general function of FGT1 is partially redundant with that of the SWI/SNF remodeler BRM (as apparent in the double mutant). It is conceivable that FGT1 is required for regulated gene expression, which is prevalent especially during development and under stress conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>FGT1 is the <italic>A. thaliana</italic> orthologue of the highly conserved Sno helicase</title><p>FGT1 shows a high conservation over the whole protein length with its metazoan orthologues. Sno is a component of the inductive Notch signaling pathway and important for patterning of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> wing margin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Majumdar et al., 1997</xref>).

Interestingly, other DExD/H helicase proteins have been implicated in coordinating transcription and co-transcriptional RNA processing by interacting with co-activator/-repressor proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fuller-Pace, 2006</xref>). While FGT1 binds to active genes, it was not associated with transcribed regions, but rather with the flanking promoter and terminator sequences, supporting the notion of a role in transcriptional regulation rather than RNA processing. However, we currently cannot rule out a role for (non-)coding RNAs in FGT1-dependent regulation. FGT1 also contains a Helicase C domain, which is frequently found in chromatin remodeler proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Clapier and Cairns, 2009</xref>). In fact, the combination of two helicase domains as present in FGT1 is reminiscent of remodeler proteins. In addition, FGT1 contains a PHD domain. Several PHD domains display very high binding affinities to specific posttranslational modifications of histone H3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Musselman and Kutateladze, 2011</xref>). Using recombinant FGT1<sub>PHD</sub> or transgenic FGT1-YFP, we confirmed H3 binding, however, we did not observe preferential binding to any of the tested modifications (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>), suggesting that other determinants contribute to targeting FGT1. In agreement with this, the PHD domain of FGT1 could not be assigned to any of the characterized subgroups with high specificity for methylated H3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lee et al., 2009</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>FGT1 interacts with chromatin remodeling proteins</title><p>Chromatin remodeling complexes use the energy of ATP to move nucleosomes along DNA, and to eject or exchange nucleosomes on DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Clapier and Cairns, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Narlikar et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Struhl and Segal, 2013</xref>), thus changing the accessibility of DNA for other proteins. Chromatin remodeling complexes have widespread functions during development and have been linked with several pathologies, including tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Narlikar et al., 2013</xref>). Four families of chromatin remodelers are conserved in metazoans, plants and yeast; the SWI/SNF, the ISWI, the CHD and the INO80 families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Clapier and Cairns, 2009</xref>). The catalytic subunits of all families contain a Snf2-related helicase domain and form large multi-subunit complexes. Although they have differing functions, there is evidence that remodelers of different families interact on the chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Clapier and Cairns, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Narlikar et al., 2013</xref>). FGT1 interacts with remodelers of the ISWI and SWI/SNF families. Both ISWI orthologues, BRM and several accessory subunits (SWI3, BAF73b) were identified by co-immunoprecipitation. ISWI is required for the regular spacing of nucleosomes downstream of the +1 border nucleosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Clapier and Cairns, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Li et al., 2014</xref>). FGT1 was found previously in a co-immunoprecipitation experiment with CHR17, thus independently confirming our results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Smaczniak et al., 2012</xref>). Drosophila BRM was originally identified due to its activating function that antagonizes Polycomb group silencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tamkun et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Clapier and Cairns, 2009</xref>). During HS memory, both BRM and ISWI act as positive regulators of the memory, suggesting that both contribute to maintaining the chromatin open and accessible. FGT1, localized just upstream of the TSS, may bridge both remodelers. This notion is consistent with the localization of BRM and ISWI in other systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gkikopoulos et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Narlikar et al., 2013</xref>) and with the high overlap in BRM and FGT1 localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Li et al., 2016</xref>). Moreover, remodelers of different families cooperate to regulate dynamic sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Morris et al., 2014</xref>). The evidence for interaction with BRM is further strengthened by the double mutant analysis, which demonstrated that <italic>FGT1</italic> activity becomes critical in the absence of <italic>BRM</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>FGT1 modulates nucleosome occupancy near the TSS</title><p>FGT1 binds to expressed genes just upstream of the TSS and just downstream of the TTS. Whether this reflects one function or two separable functions, remains to be investigated. The FGT1 peaks that we detected were wide and relatively flat. Consistent with FGT1 interacting with BRM and CHR11/CHR17, such a binding pattern is characteristic for chromatin remodeling proteins but not sequence-specific transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gkikopoulos et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zentner and Henikoff, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Li et al., 2016</xref>). FGT1 was preferentially associated with medium and highly expressed genes. Among the lowly expressed genes, those that are HS-inducible were more strongly bound than other genes - not only after HS, but also under control conditions. This indicates that despite an overall correlation with expression, FGT1 binding does not simply reflect the transcriptional activity of a locus. It is tempting to speculate that at some loci FGT1 binding indicates a readiness for transcription rather than actual transcription, similar to what was described as a poised state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Levine et al., 2014</xref>). FGT1 binding overlaps the NDRs present next to the TSS and TTS. Hence, FGT1 may be required to maintain the NDR by interacting with remodeler proteins. Accordingly, we observed changes in the nucleosome occupancy of this region and particularly the adjacent +1 nucleosome in <italic>fgt1-1</italic> mutants. The changes in nucleosome occupancy at FGT1 target loci preceded HS, in agreement with the FGT1 binding pattern. In non-stressed adult leaves, similar changes were observed for <italic>brm</italic> and <italic>iswi</italic> mutants. Locus-specific and developmental effects indicate the involvement of additional components. Thus, it is likely that BRM and ISWI cooperate with FGT1 to mediate nucleosome occupancy before and after HS. We propose that the molecular function of Sno/FGT1 orthologues is conserved and that they promote transcriptional regulation through interaction with chromatin remodeling complexes. The reported function of <italic>Sno</italic> as a co-activator is consistent with this mechanism; moreover, the interacting chromatin remodelers are highly conserved in metazoans.</p><p>In summary, we have uncovered a role for nucleosome occupancy in stress memory that is modulated by the conserved chromatin regulator FGT1. Sno/FGT1 also functions in a broader context to sustain gene expression during development, stress adaptation and pathologies. Our results identify a mechanism of how environmentally-induced gene expression is sustained after cessation of an external cue and provides a molecular framework for a chromatin memory. This mechanism may be exploited to improve stress tolerance in crop plants.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plant materials, growth conditions and HS assays</title><p><italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> Col-0 seedlings were grown on GM medium (1% (w/v) glucose) under a 16 h/ 8 h light/dark cycle at 23°C/21°C. <italic>brm-1, hsa32-1</italic> and <italic>hsp101</italic> were previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Charng et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hurtado et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Stief et al., 2014</xref>). <italic>chr11-1</italic><sup>-/-</sup><italic>chr17-1</italic><sup>+/-</sup> was obtained from K.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Detlef Weigel as the Senior and Reviewing Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Yijun Qi (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Through a mutant screen, you have identified a new gene, FORGETTER1 (FGT1), that is required for maintenance of heat-induced gene expression. You propose that the FGT1 protein globally associates with the promoter regions of actively expressed genes in a heat-dependent fashion, interacting in this process with chromatin remodelers of the SWI/SNF and ISWI families. You conclude that FGT1 mediates stress-dependent chromatin memory by modulating nucleosome occupancy.</p><p>The reviewers agreed that such findings should in principle be published at the highest levels. While the reviewers furthermore agreed that the data presented are clear, they also agreed that the conclusions went considerably beyond what the data showed directly. To bring the interpretation more in line with the data, they ask you to tone down your claims, and also to add a series of new data to support their claims:</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Perform a carefully controlled RNA-seq time course experiment (wt, fgt1-1, brm1 etc) over a heat shock to compare fgt1 and swi/snf effects more precisely. Alternatively, test whether SWI/SNF and ISWI is required for FGT1 binding to HS memory genes or vice versa, with FGT1 ChIP in the swi/snf or iswi mutants and SWI/SNF and ISWI ChIP in the fgt1 mutant, and add RNAPII ChIP.</p><p>2) Examine whether nucleosome redistribution dynamics during the HS memory phase are affected by swi/snf or iswi mutations.</p><p>3) Include as a control analysis of nucleosome occupancy of a gene that is not a target of FGT1 nor persistently expressed (i.e. HSP101).</p><p>4) Provide a better control for FGT1-H3 interaction.</p><p>We have included the full reviews, which mention separate points for essential revisions, but after discussion, we condensed them to the four points above</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>In this manuscript, the authors identified FORGETTER1 (FGT1) as a new factor that is required for heat stress (HS) memory. They found that FGT1 primarily binds to the proximal promoter upstream of the TSS as well as the region downstream of the TTS and functions as a co-activator of memory genes. Moreover, they showed that FGT1 interacts with SWI/SNF and ISWI chromatin remodelers that are also required for HS memory. Finally, they showed that FGT1 is required for maintaining low nucleosome occupancy during the memory phase. The authors propose that FGT1 modulates HS memory through modulating nucleosome occupancy dynamics and transcription-competent chromatin. These findings advance our understanding about the molecular mechanism of stress memory and should be of general interest. The data are of high quality and well presented. Meanwhile, I feel the authors should make efforts to provide the missing link between FGT1 and nucleosome dynamics. My requests for additional experiments are listed below.</p><p>1) The interaction between FGT1 and SWI/SNF and ISWI was shown by IP Mass-spec and BiFC experiments. As this is one of the key points of this paper, additional approaches should be employed to demonstrate the interaction.</p><p>2) The authors should test whether SWI/SNF and ISWI is required for FGT1 binding to HS memory genes or vice versa. This can be done by performing FGT1 ChIP analyses in the swi/snf or iswi mutants and SWI/SNF and ISWI ChIP in the fgt1 mutant.</p><p>3) The authors should examine whether nucleosome redistribution dynamics during the HS memory phase are affected by swi/snf or iswi mutations.</p><p>4) It would be also interesting to examine which histone marks are affected by fgt1 during HS memory.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>Organisms respond to changes in environmental conditions through changes in transcription. Most of these changes are transient and are lost if the environmental stimulus is removed. For example, heat shock leads to transient upregulation of protein folding chaperones. However, in Arabidopsis, heat stress also leads to persistent expression of several genes (HSA32, HSP21, HSP22.0, HPS18.2) for ~3 days and this protects plants from lethal heat stress during this period. This phenomenon is called heat stress memory and requires an HSF-related transcription factor HSFA2 and is correlated with changes in histone H3 lysine 4 methylation.</p><p>Here, the authors perform a genetic screen for mutants that fail to express HSA32 three days after heat stress. This screen identified a mutant in a gene called FORGETTER (FGT1), which is homologous to Strawberry Notch in animals. This mutant resulted in 1) normal expression of HSA32 immediately after a mild heat shock, 2) normal survival of a lethal heat stress administered 90 minutes after a mild heat stress, 3) low expression of an HSA32 reporter (compared with wild type) after 2 or 3 days of recovery and 4) poor survival of a lethal heat stress after 3 days of recovery. These results suggest that FGT1 is specifically required for the long-term effects of mild heat stress. The manuscript seeks to understand the phenotype of the fgt1 mutant and to define the molecular role of FGT1 in stress memory. This is a very interesting phenomenon and the system is excellent. The experiments are well designed and the data are clear. However, I do not agree with the authors' interpretation of several experiments and I am not convinced that they support the major conclusions of the paper. As a result, I do not feel that this work is mature enough to recommend publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>To validate these observations, the authors measured the mRNA levels of both genes that exhibit persistent expression after heat stress (HSA32, HSP21, HSP22.0 and HSP18.2) and a gene that is induced by heat stress but does not show persistent expression (HSP101) in the fgt1-1 mutant. Surprisingly, despite having used an HSA32 reporter for the screen, the fgt1-1 mutant plants showed normal persistent expression of HSA32 and HSP18.2 and slightly defective persistence of HSP21 and HSP22.0. However, the authors claim that the very slight decrease in HSA32 after 45 and 69h are the source of the phenotype. Because there was no statistical analysis of this difference, it is unclear if it is significant. These differences do not appear to be as strong as the differences observed with the Luciferase reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Quantitation of the luciferase for comparison would have clarified the phenotype. To convince the reader that the mutation is impacting transcription, ChIP against RNAPII would have helped. Furthermore, inclusion of the HSFA2 mutant for comparison would have made the strength of the phenotype easier to assess. It is possible that the mutation has a larger effect on the reporter and that the survival phenotype is the result of an effect on a different subset of genes (i.e., HSP21 and HSP22). If so, then the persistent expression of genes in response to heat stress involves both an FGT1-dependent and an FGT1-independent mechanism.</p><p>The authors hypothesize that FGT1 promotes persistent expression of HSP21 and HSP22.0 by remodeling nucleosomes because the protein possesses a PHD finger domain and a Helicase C domain. Consistent with this hypothesis, FGT1 localizes to the nucleus, interacts with both active genes and heat stress-induced genes and physically interacts with the BRM (SWI/SNF) and CHR11/CHR17 (ISWI). Unfortunately, a number of experiments create uncertainty about this conclusion. First, the changes in nucleosome occupancy in the fgt1 mutant do not correlate with binding of FGT1: FGT1 binds strongly to the HSA32 promoter/TSS upon heat stress and this correlates with decreased nucleosome occupancy. The fgt1 mutant shows lower nucleosome occupancy prior to heat stress and this decreases to a comparable level to the wild type in the days following heat stress. Therefore, FGT1 is not required for the decrease in nucleosome occupancy at HSA32. In the cases of HSP18.2 and HSP22, although the fgt1 mutant shows increased nucleosome occupancy, the changes in the wild type strain upon heat stress are difficult to appreciate and, as mentioned above, there is no obvious effect of this mutation on the expression of HSP18.2. It would have been helpful to include a gene that is neither a target of FGT1 nor persistently expressed (i.e. HSP101) as a more relevant control. Likewise, as mentioned above, examining the effect of the HSFA2 mutant in this assay would have been informative. Also, peptide binding experiments show that the PHD finger interacts non-specifically with (non-overlapping) histone peptides. The authors did not include a biologically irrelevant peptide control, but the low affinity and the lack of specificity cast doubt on the claim that &quot;FGT1 binds to the N-terminal region of H3[…]&quot;. It seems equally plausible that FGT1 binds to the FLAG peptide. Finally, ChIP seq shows that FGT1 associates with both the transcription start sites and the transcription termination sites of active genes. Given the DExD-like helicase domain, this raises the alternative hypothesis that the protein is involved in post-transcriptional events and might impact the ability of plants to survive through influencing protein levels.</p><p>The authors also explored the role of BRM and CHR11/CHR17 in heat stress memory. Mutations in BRM1 and FGT1 produced synthetic flowering and development phenotypes, suggesting non-overlapping roles in these processes. Both mutant plants were somewhat defective in heat stress protection after 3d of recovery. However, these mutant plants also showed significantly lower peak levels of the HS-induction of HSA32, HSP18.1, HSP21 and HSP22. Therefore, the decrease in expression afterward appears proportional to the wildtype, but starting at a significantly lower peak level. If so, then poor survival after 3d of recovery is likely due to lower levels of induced transcription, not less sustained transcription.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>How plants adapt to heat stress and remember previous heat shocks is a very interesting area of biology. This paper breaks new ground by discovering a new component, FORGETTER1, which the authors show is necessary for plants to &quot;remember&quot; heat stress correctly at the level of transcriptional regulation. Interestingly, the fgt1-1 mutants have a specific defect in acquired thermotolerance, consistent with the proposed role for this gene in controlling the transcriptional response to temperature. The authors present a rather complete story, since they go from a genetic screen, to mapping and examining the underlying molecular mechanism. It is a bit of an open question as to the actual role of FGT1 in transcriptional memory itself, but that is probably beyond the scope of this study.</p><p>Here are a few suggestions that came to my mind on reading the paper, and resolving these might make the study even stronger:</p><p>1) For the ChIP-seq of FGT1 it would be nice to see screen shots of actual loci from a browser. Averaged data is rather hard to interpret. Relating to this, different gene lists were used for &quot;active&quot; genes and HS responsive genes for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and 4C</xref>. Isn't there a more relevant list of genes whose transcription appears to show &quot;memory&quot; of heatshock? Another way of looking at this, what about the transcriptome of fgt1 itself?</p><p>2) The model for FGT1 action is interesting. It seems to invoke a specific role for +1 nucleosomes in responding to temperature. It's striking that there is such a strong enrichment for FGT1 at the +1 position as well as the TTS. Of course these are sites where there is global enrichment for H2A.Z-Nucleosomes (Coleman-Derr and Zilberman 2012) and H2A.Z-nucleosomes are evicted in response to temperature (Kumar and Wigge 2010). It is therefore curious that no attempt is made to synthesise what is already known about temperature-dependent gene expression and its regulation by chromatin. At a minimum, one could simply overlay the distribution of FGT1 with that of H2A.Z.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17061.037</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) Perform a carefully controlled RNA-seq time course experiment (wt, fgt1-1, brm1 etc) over a heat shock to compare fgt1 and swi/snf effects more precisely.

We have addressed this issue via two complementary approaches. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>) We have analyzed the overlap in genome-wide binding sites of the SWI/SNF protein BRM with those of FGT1. The BRM ChIP-seq dataset employed for this purspose has recently been published (Li et al., Nat Genet 2016), using a BRM-GFP line and anti-GFP antibody in non-stressed conditions. At the genome-wide level, we detected a highly significant overlap between regions bound by BRM and FGT1 as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>. In particular, BRM associates significantly more strongly with FGT1-bound regions than with the rest of the genome and both factors show a very similar binding profile across genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). The same enrichment of BRM binding is also seen for genes that show sustained expression after HS in our time-course microarray experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>, Stief et al. 2014). These results are supported by a series of browser screenshots of individual genes, as suggested by Reviewer #3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). Thus, we conclude that a high fraction of FGT1-bound regions is also bound by BRM and the significant overlap in these orthogonal genome-wide datasets strongly supports our interpretation of a functional interaction between the two proteins.</p><p>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>) To strengthen the conclusion that FGT1 acts at the transcriptional level, we have added the analysis of unspliced transcripts of one additional memory gene (HSP21) and two additional HS-inducible non-memory genes (HSP70, 101), which clearly show that the effect is specific for memory genes and occurs before splicing, i. e. (co-) transcriptionally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). The other memory genes do not contain introns, thus precluding this type of analysis. Moreover, the transcript analysis of the LUC transgene shows that the magnitude of the effect is similar to that observed for the endogenous HSA32 gene, suggesting that the transgene mimicks closely the behavior of the endogeneous HSA32. This is in accordance with the analysis of unspliced HSA32 transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), for which the primers detected both the endogene and the transgene. To clarify the significance of the differences, we have also added statistical analysis for the qRT-PCR experiments presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>. Regarding the RNA pol II ChIP, we have not been able to obtain reproducible chromatin immunoprecipitation with the available antibody (abcam ab817) despite several attempts by different researchers in the group with different antibody lots. Together, these two approaches support the functional interaction of BRM and FGT1 at the transcriptional start sites of a subset of genes genome-wide.</p><p>Besides providing this additional experimental evidence, we have toned down the relevant conclusions, bringing them closely in line with what we have directly shown experimentally and we have adjusted the model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>. For example, we have rephrased where previous wording suggested that FGT1 is recruiting the remodelers (see Discussion).</p><p>Regarding the additional suggestions, we feel that the additional qRT-PCR expression analysis (see above) and the strong overlap of BRM and FGT1 binding alleviate the immediate need for the extensive RNA-seq experiment to a large degree. Together with the phenotypic similarity in the memory assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) and the synergistic double mutant phenotypes, the above overlap analysis of genomic binding provides clear support for our interpretation of a functional interaction between FGT1 and SWI/SNF chromatin remodelers at the genome-wide level; this is particularly convincing to us, as it is based on completely independent datasets.</p><p>As for the additional ChIP experiments, these are unfortunately not feasible at the moment. We have not been able to obtain sufficient quantities of anti-BRM antibody (Archacki et al., Planta 2009) to perform a solid analysis of BRM binding in wild type and fgt1 mutants. The preliminary results suggest that FGT1 is not required for binding of BRM to memory genes.</p><p>Both the brm-1 and the chr11/17 double mutants are sterile (Hurtado et al. 2006; Li et al. 2012), so after crossing in the FGT1-YFP transgene it would not be possible to obtain sufficient homogeneous starting material for these ChIP experiments at the relevant seedling stage, as our protocol requires two grams of starting material. The brm-1 homozygous mutants cannot be distinguished with certainty from wild-type seedlings up until about 12 days after germination, i.e. much later than when we perform all our analyses; the chr11/17 double mutant, by contrast, is severely dwarfed and occurs at a very reduced frequency, hence obtaining sufficient material is not feasible.</p><p><italic>2) Examine whether nucleosome redistribution dynamics during the HS memory phase are affected by swi/snf or iswi mutations.</italic> </p><p>This revision concerns the nucleosome redistribution dynamics after heat shock in the swi/snf and iswi mutants. As argued in detail above, we are unfortunately not able to perform these experiments at the moment due to inherent limitations of the biological material. (Our MNase-qPCR protocol requires at least one gram of starting material.) However, to determine whether loss of FGT1 and of SWI/SNF or ISWI remodelers have similar effects on nucleosome distributions at HS memory genes, we have assayed nucleosome occupancy in fgt1-1, brm-1 and chr11/chr11 chr17/+ plants at the rosette stage under normal growth conditions, where sufficient material could be obtained. The results are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2</xref>. Consistent with the expectation from the ChIP-seq analyses, which show binding of FGT1 and BRM to memory-gene promoters even in the absence of heat stress, our results demonstrate very similar changes in nucleosome occupancy in all three mutants relative to their respective wild-type. Namely, nucleosome occupancy was increased at <italic>HSA32, HSP22</italic> and <italic>HSP18.2</italic> in the mutants. Also, the <italic>HSA32</italic> profile in the Col wildtype with or without the <italic>HSA32::LUC</italic> transgene (parent and wild type, respectively) looked very similar, lending further support to the notion that the transgene behaves similarly to the endogenous <italic>HSA32</italic>. These results strengthen our interpretation that FGT1, BRM and ISWI interact functionally at the promoters of HS memory genes.</p><p>To better illustrate the role of FGT1 in nucleosome recovery after HS, we have calculated the relative nucleosome recovery rates based on the data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> (see new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>). Over the three analysed memory genes, the results clearly indicate that the +1 nucleosome recovers faster to pre-HS levels in <italic>fgt1-1</italic>. In contrast, nucleosome recovery dynamics were not affected at the non-memory gene <italic>HSP101</italic>.Taken together, these findings show that <italic>fgt1</italic> and the remodeler mutants show both a modified nucleosome profile <underline>before</underline> HS, and a specific defect <underline>during</underline> the memory phase in <italic>fgt1</italic>.</p><p><italic>3) Include as a control analysis of nucleosome occupancy of a gene that is not a target of FGT1 nor persistently expressed (i.e. HSP101).</italic> </p><p>We have included nucleosome occupancy at the HS-inducible non-memory gene <italic>HSP101</italic> in all analyses of nucleosome occupancy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">2</xref>).

The results of this experiment shown in the (new) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref> demonstrate that FGT1-YFP can precipitate histone H3 from plant extracts, whereas overexpressed YFP alone cannot. While we cannot formally exclude that the interaction in the in vitropull-downs (now displayed as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>) is mediated by the FLAG-tag and the in vivoprecipitation is due to FGT1 binding to other proteins, the most parsimonious and to us most plausible interpretation of these results is that FGT1 directly binds histone H3, consistent with the well-established activity of PHD domains as histone H3-methyl binding domains.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p><italic>In this manuscript, the authors identified FORGETTER1 (FGT1) as a new factor that is required for heat stress (HS) memory.

Surprisingly, despite having used an HSA32 reporter for the screen, the fgt1-1 mutant plants showed normal persistent expression of HSA32 and HSP18.2 and slightly defective persistence of HSP21 and HSP22.0. However, the authors claim that the very slight decrease in HSA32 after 45 and 69h are the source of the phenotype. Because there was no statistical analysis of this difference, it is unclear if it is significant.</italic> </p><p>We have added statistics for the transcript level analysis shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, which demonstrates that the premature decline of both spliced and unspliced (where analysed) transcript levels of <italic>HSA32, HSP18.2, HSP21</italic> and HSP22.0 during the later timepoints is significant and is specific for memory genes (see also new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p><italic>These differences do not appear to be as strong as the differences observed with the Luciferase reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

It is possible that the mutation has a larger effect on the reporter and that the survival phenotype is the result of an effect on a different subset of genes (i.e., HSP21 and HSP22). If so, then the persistent expression of genes in response to heat stress involves both an FGT1-dependent and an FGT1-independent mechanism.</italic> </p><p>To estimate the strength of the <italic>fgt1-1</italic> phenotype at the physiological level, we have included the <italic>hsa32</italic> mutant in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B-D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2 C</xref>-D. Previous publications report a similar strength in phenotype of <italic>hsa32</italic> and <italic>hsfa2</italic> (e. g. Charng et al., Plant Physiol 2007). In comparison, the phenotype of <italic>fgt1-1</italic> is weaker, suggesting additional factors contribute to the memory. We have clarified the conclusion that the phenotype of <italic>fgt1-1</italic> is caused by the cumulative misregulation of several memory genes and not just <italic>HSA32</italic>.</p><p><italic>The authors hypothesize that FGT1 promotes persistent expression of HSP21 and HSP22.0 by remodeling nucleosomes because the protein possesses a PHD finger domain and a Helicase C domain. Consistent with this hypothesis, FGT1 localizes to the nucleus, interacts with both active genes and heat stress-induced genes and physically interacts with the BRM (SWI/SNF) and CHR11/CHR17 (ISWI). Unfortunately, a number of experiments create uncertainty about this conclusion. First, the changes in nucleosome occupancy in the fgt1 mutant do not correlate with binding of FGT1: FGT1 binds strongly to the HSA32 promoter/TSS upon heat stress and this correlates with decreased nucleosome occupancy. The fgt1 mutant shows lower nucleosome occupancy prior to heat stress and this decreases to a comparable level to the wild type in the days following heat stress. Therefore, FGT1 is not required for the decrease in nucleosome occupancy at HSA32. In the cases of HSP18.2 and HSP22, although the fgt1 mutant shows increased nucleosome occupancy, the changes in the wild type strain upon heat stress are difficult to appreciate and, as mentioned above, there is no obvious effect of this mutation on the expression of HSP18.2. It would have been helpful to include a gene that is neither a target of FGT1 nor persistently expressed (i.e. HSP101) as a more relevant control. Likewise, as mentioned above, examining the effect of the HSFA2 mutant in this assay would have been informative.</italic> </p><p>We show that both FGT1 and BRM are associated with memory genes already before HS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). Consistently, there are changes in the nucleosome profiles already before HS. This is confirmed in the newly included analysis of <italic>fgt1-1, brm-1</italic> and <italic>chr11/chr11 chr17</italic>/+ rosette leaves presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2</xref>. Upon HS, there is a decrease in nucleosome occupancy in both wild type and mutant. As the first timepoint analyzed was 4 h after the end of the HS, we are unable to say whether there are subtle differences in the immediate response. However, the recovery to pre-stress levels occurred faster in the <italic>fgt1</italic> mutant. To clarify this observation, we have calculated the rate of recovery at the peak nucleosome after HS relative to the respective NHS control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>). Again, this effect was not found in <italic>HSP101</italic>.</p><p>We agree with the reviewer that the analysis of nucleosome dynamics in <italic>hsfa2</italic> would be interesting. However, we feel it is outside of the scope of the present work to address this question.</p><p><italic>Also, peptide binding experiments show that the PHD finger interacts non-specifically with (non-overlapping) histone peptides. The authors did not include a biologically irrelevant peptide control, but the low affinity and the lack of specificity cast doubt on the claim that &quot;FGT1 binds to the N-terminal region of H3[…]&quot;. It seems equally plausible that FGT1 binds to the FLAG peptide.</italic> </p><p>Please refer to response to essential revision #4 above.</p><p><italic>Finally, ChIP seq shows that FGT1 associates with both the transcription start sites and the transcription termination sites of active genes. Given the DExD-like helicase domain, this raises the alternative hypothesis that the protein is involved in post-transcriptional events and might impact the ability of plants to survive through influencing protein levels.</italic> </p><p>As seen from the representative screenshots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref> and the overall occupancy analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>), the peak of the association with FGT1 is upstream of the TSS and downstream of the TTS, and thus outside the transcribed region, which is not consistent with a role in RNA processing. Transcript levels of unspliced and spliced RNA were in good accordance, suggesting that processing was not affected. While we cannot formally exclude a role in regulating protein levels, we find that the most parsimonious interpretation of the results is that FGT1 functions in nucleosome positioning alongside remodeling complexes.</p><p><italic>The authors also explored the role of BRM and CHR11/CHR17 in heat stress memory. Mutations in BRM1 and FGT1 produced synthetic flowering and development phenotypes, suggesting non-overlapping roles in these processes. Both mutant plants were somewhat defective in heat stress protection after 3d of recovery. However, these mutant plants also showed significantly lower peak levels of the HS-induction of HSA32, HSP18.1, HSP21 and HSP22. Therefore, the decrease in expression afterward appears proportional to the wildtype, but starting at a significantly lower peak level. If so, then poor survival after 3d of recovery is likely due to lower levels of induced transcription, not less sustained transcription.</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewer (as we mentioned in the original version) that the induction of memory genes is slightly altered in the remodeler mutants. Given the wide genome-wide distribution of the remodelers, clearly they have functions beyond HS memory. However, we did not find a defect in the acquisition of thermotolerance or basal thermotolerance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">2</xref>). The interaction with FGT1, the defect in the physiological memory assay and the very similar nucleosome profiles in rosette leaves, together indicate a function in HS memory together with FGT1.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p><italic>How plants adapt to heat stress and remember previous heat shocks is a very interesting area of biology. This paper breaks new ground by discovering a new component, FORGETTER1, which the authors show is necessary for plants to &quot;remember&quot; heat stress correctly at the level of transcriptional regulation. Interestingly, the fgt1-1 mutants have a specific defect in acquired thermotolerance, consistent with the proposed role for this gene in controlling the transcriptional response to temperature. The authors present a rather complete story, since they go from a genetic screen, to mapping and examining the underlying molecular mechanism. It is a bit of an open question as to the actual role of FGT1 in transcriptional memory itself, but that is probably beyond the scope of this study.</italic> </p><p><italic>Here are a few suggestions that came to my mind on reading the paper, and resolving these might make the study even stronger:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) For the ChIP-seq of FGT1 it would be nice to see screen shots of actual loci from a browser. Averaged data is rather hard to interpret. Relating to this, different gene lists were used for &quot;active&quot; genes and HS responsive genes for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and 4C</xref>. Isn't there a more relevant list of genes whose transcription appears to show &quot;memory&quot; of heatshock? Another way of looking at this, what about the transcriptome of fgt1 itself?</italic> </p><p>In the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>, we show the association of FGT1 and BRM with early and late HS-inducible and memory genes. The HS gene classes are based on the microarrays that we published in Stief et al. 2014. They show a remarkable overlap of BRM and FGT1 for HS memory genes under control conditions and after ACC, respectively.</p><p>To improve the clarity of the presentation, we have included screen shots from the FGT1 and the BRM ChIP-seq experiments for several loci (<italic>HSA32, HSP18.2, HSP21, HSP22, ACT7, HSP101</italic>) that further illustrate the very similar binding patterns of the two proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p><italic>2) The model for FGT1 action is interesting. It seems to invoke a specific role for +1 nucleosomes in responding to temperature. It's striking that there is such a strong enrichment for FGT1 at the +1 position as well as the TTS. Of course these are sites where there is global enrichment for H2A.Z-Nucleosomes (Coleman-Derr and Zilberman 2012) and H2A.Z-nucleosomes are evicted in response to temperature (Kumar and Wigge 2010). It is therefore curious that no attempt is made to synthesise what is already known about temperature-dependent gene expression and its regulation by chromatin. At a minimum, one could simply overlay the distribution of FGT1 with that of H2A.Z.</italic> </p><p>We agree that a role for H2A.Z eviction in heat-shock memory related to FGT1 function represents an attractive possibility. Based on individual-locus genome browser analysis, there indeed seems to be some overlap between FGT1 and H2A.Z bound sequences. However, we have repeatedly assayed the <italic>arp6</italic> mutant, which is defective in H2A.Z incorporation into nucleosomes, in our HS memory assays, and did not observe any difference in HS memory. Thus, we conclude that FGT1 likely functions independently of H2A.Z.</p></body></sub-article></article>
