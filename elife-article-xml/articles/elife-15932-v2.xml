the role of endocannabinoids in vision is not fully understood. Here, we identified a novel mechanism underlying a CB1R-mediated increase in retinal ganglion cell (RGC) intrinsic excitability acting through AMPK-dependent inhibition of NKCC1 activity. Clomeleon imaging and patch clamp recordings revealed that inhibition of NKCC1 downstream of CB1R activation reduces intracellular Cl<sup>−</sup> levels in RGCs, hyperpolarizing the resting membrane potential. We confirmed that such hyperpolarization enhances RGC action potential firing in response to subsequent depolarization, consistent with the increased intrinsic excitability of RGCs observed with CB1R activation. Using a dot avoidance assay in freely swimming <italic>Xenopus</italic> tadpoles, we demonstrate that CB1R activation markedly improves visual contrast sensitivity under low-light conditions. These results highlight a role for endocannabinoids in vision and present a novel mechanism for cannabinoid modulation of neuronal activity through Cl<sup>−</sup> regulation.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.15932.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.15932.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>visual system</kwd><kwd>chloride</kwd><kwd>endocannabinoid</kwd><kwd>CB1 Receptor</kwd><kwd>NKCC1</kwd><kwd>retina</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>Xenopus</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Épilepsie Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Postdoctoral award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Miraucourt</surname><given-names>Loïs S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038</institution-id><institution>Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CREATE Neuroengineering Training Program</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Miraucourt</surname><given-names>Loïs S</given-names></name><name><surname>Gobert</surname><given-names>Delphine</given-names></name><name><surname>Desjardins</surname><given-names>Jean-François</given-names></name><name><surname>Sild</surname><given-names>Mari</given-names></name><name><surname>Spratt</surname><given-names>Perry</given-names></name><name><surname>Wiseman</surname><given-names>Paul W</given-names></name><name><surname>Ruthazer</surname><given-names>Edward S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000156</institution-id><institution>Fonds de Recherche du Québec - Santé</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Research chair, postdoctoral fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tsui</surname><given-names>Jennifer</given-names></name><name><surname>Gobert</surname><given-names>Delphine</given-names></name><name><surname>Ruthazer</surname><given-names>Edward S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Operating grants</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ruthazer</surname><given-names>Edward S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Endocannabinoid activation of the CB1 receptor on retinal ganglion cells in the eye results in enhanced excitability and responsiveness to visual stimulation through a novel mechanism involving intracellular chloride regulation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Endocannabinoids (eCBs) are lipid-derived regulators of synaptic transmission that serve as important mediators of functional plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bellocchio et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bender et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Clapper et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">El Manira and Kyriakatos, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Han et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kato et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sjöström et al., 2003</xref>) and nervous system development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Argaw et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Berghuis et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Harkany et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Li et al., 2009</xref>). In the retina, high levels of type 1 cannabinoid receptors (CB1R), as well as the eCB production and degradation machinery, have been found in all vertebrate models tested, and within nearly all retinal cell types throughout development and adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Straiker et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yazulla, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zabouri et al., 2011</xref>). Although eCB modulation of voltage-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> conductances, typically resulting in the downregulation of neurotransmitter release, has been demonstrated at multiple stages of retinal processing from photoreceptors to retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fan and Yazulla, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lalonde et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Middleton and Protti, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Yazulla et al., 2000</xref>), these observations have not been directly linked to specific perceptual outcomes. On the other hand, cannabis consumption in humans has been reported to positively modulate contrast discrimination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Russo et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">West, 1991</xref>). Given the overall importance of eCB signaling in modulating neuronal activity, we set out to test whether retinal eCB signaling impacts visual function, and if so, by what modes of action.</p><p>The transparency and amenability to whole-cell recording of the <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> tadpole permits the application of both functional imaging and electrophysiological recording in the visual system of the intact animal. Exploiting the strengths of this model, we demonstrate a novel mechanism by which eCB signaling increases the intrinsic excitability of RGCs through AMPK-dependent inhibition of the Na<sup>+</sup>-K<sup>+</sup>-2Cl<sup>−</sup> co-transporter 1 (NKCC1). NKCC1 inhibition causes a reduction in intracellular Cl<sup>−</sup> levels, which enhances tonic glycinergic currents and hyperpolarizes the resting membrane potential in RGCs. We show that membrane hyperpolarization actually makes RGCs fire more spikes in response to subsequent stimulation. Accordingly, we found that activation of CB1Rs produces a marked reduction of the contrast threshold needed to trigger a visually evoked escape behavior by tadpoles under dim light conditions, consistent with enhanced visual perception.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>CB1R is present in the retina of <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> tadpoles</title><p>The presence of CB1Rs has been reported in the brain of the adult <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> frog (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cesa et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cottone et al., 2003</xref>) and in the tadpole olfactory bulb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Breunig et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Czesnik et al., 2007</xref>). We examined the retinae of <italic>Xenopus</italic> tadpoles, and found intense CB1R immunoreactivity (CB1R-IR) in the outer and inner plexiform layers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a,b</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), consistent with reports in other species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Middleton and Protti, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Yazulla et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zabouri et al., 2011</xref>).

We first performed electroretinogram (ERG) recordings in the isolated eye preparation to test if WIN 55,212-2 application modulated responses in the outer layers of the retina (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f</xref>). ERGs revealed visual responses of various non-spiking cell types in the outer retina, including photoreceptors (a-wave), ON-center bipolar cells (b-wave) and OFF-center bipolar cells (d-wave). Visual stimulation produced stable ERG responses that were generally more robust for light-OFF stimuli, consistent with previous reports in the <italic>Xenopus</italic> visual system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Engert et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zhang et al., 2000</xref>). However, perfusion of WIN 55,212-2 did not produce any significant changes in the amplitudes of the a-, b- or d-waves in response to step increments or decrements of light (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2g</xref>, n = 6, 6, 6, 6; p=0.78, 0.79, 0.89, 0.68, two-way RM ANOVA), suggesting that CB1R activation does not impact light-evoked activity in the outer part of the retina, consistent with a recent report in the mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cécyre et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Local activation of CB1Rs at bipolar axon terminals could potentially modify Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx to modulate the release of glutamate onto RGC dendrites. Similarly, CB1Rs at inhibitory amacrine presynaptic contacts could alter Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx to modulate the release of GABA or glycine. Such effects would go undetected in ERG recordings but would alter the spiking output of RGCs. To test these possibilities, we used retinal electroporation to express the genetically-encoded Ca<sup>2+</sup> reporter GCaMP6s in bipolar and amacrine cells to measure Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels in vivo at their presynaptic terminals in response to light flashes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a–i</xref>). Light stimulation reliably evoked strong Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in individual bipolar axon terminals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). Comparing average peak Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients evoked by full-field light-ON and light-OFF stimulation before and after WIN 55,212-2 perfusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>), we found that CB1R activation did not increase bipolar axon Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient amplitude in response to visual stimulation, but instead decreased it in the case of light-OFF stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d,e</xref>, ON: n = 10, p=0.17, OFF: n = 10, p=0.002), consistent with reports from salamander of a CB1R-mediated reduction of the L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> current<sup>12</sup>. Thus, its effects on Ca<sup>2+</sup> at bipolar cell terminals appear more likely to reduce than to increase RGC spiking.

Taken together these data indicate that, cannabinoid modulation of excitatory synaptic inputs onto RGCs is, if anything, acting in the wrong direction to enhance firing in response to visual stimuli. On the other hand it is possible that disinhibition may in part contribute to this phenomenon.</p><p>An alternative mechanism by which cannabinoids might enhance visually evoked firing rates would be to directly elevate the intrinsic excitability of RGCs, making it easier for them to fire action potentials. The simplest way this might occur would be through depolarization of the resting membrane potential closer to the threshold for firing. However, studies in salamander retina have suggested that membrane depolarization can cause sodium channel inactivation that paradoxically hinders action potential generation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Weick and Demb, 2011</xref>). Thus, the cannabinoid-mediated enhancement of RGC responsiveness could potentially be due one or a combination of synaptic disinhibiton, mechnanisms that depolarize or that hyperpolarize resting membrane potential.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>CB1R-mediated enhancement of RGC firing requires glycinergic transmission and NKCC1 activity</title><p>To elucidate these mechanisms, we examined the effects of various pharmacological manipulations on the cannabinoid-mediated modulation of responses to full-field light-OFF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) or light-ON stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).

These results show that both CB1Rs and GlyRs are required for the cannabinoid-mediated increase in RGC response to visual stimulation.

Subsequent addition of WIN 55,212-2 in the presence of bumetanide produced no additional increase in RGC firing rate (n = 10, p=0.224).

These results argue that CB1R activation may work by regulating NKCC1 function to modulate the driving force of chloride currents in RGCs.</p><p>NKCC1 activity can be regulated through serine/threonine phosphorylation of its intracellular domains. In mammals, the WNK-activated Sterile-20 (Ste20)-related Proline/Alanine-rich Kinase (SPAK) and Oxidative Stress-Response Kinase 1 (OSR1) have been shown to stimulate human NKCC1 through phosphorylation at T203, T207, T212 and T217 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Darman et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Richardson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Vitari et al., 2006</xref>), whereas AMP-dependent kinase (AMPK) inhibits NKCC1 by phosphorylation at S77 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Fraser et al., 2014</xref>). We examined the involvement of these regulatory molecules by performing western blotting on retina homogenates from animals treated with WIN 55,212-2. WIN 55,212-2 application produced a striking increase in the levels of phosphorylated SPAK/OSR1, indicating its activation downstream of the CB1R (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4j,k</xref>); however, this was not accompanied by an increase in phospho-NKCC1<sup>T212/T217</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1i</xref>). Thus, SPAK/OSR1, although activated, appears not to phosphorylate and activate NKCC1 under these conditions. Moreover, our physiology data would have predicted <italic>decreased</italic> NKCC1 activity. We therefore wondered whether AMPK activation might be suppressing NKCC1 function. Because no phospho-specific antibody against the AMPK site S77 on NKCC1 is available, we instead tested this hypothesis functionally by using the selective AMPK inhibitor dorsomorphin. We found that dorsomorphin (10 µM) reversed the effects of WIN 55,212-2, reducing RGCs spiking rate in response to light-OFF flashes (before: 37.5 ± 6.3 Hz, after: 22.9 ± 2.6 Hz, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4l</xref>, n = 10, p=0.0095, paired t-test).

We tested this prediction by performing gramicidin-perforated patch recordings on dissociated cultured RGCs. To identify RGCs in dissociated retinal cultures, we used Isl2b:EGFP transgenic tadpoles that express GFP in RGCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6g</xref>). Application of WIN 55,212-2 significantly hyperpolarized RGCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6h</xref>, uncorrected for liquid junction potential; n = 6, p=0.004, paired t-test).

RGCs are known to decrease their excitability following a period of depolarization and firing through the inactivation of voltage-gated sodium channels as a way of extending their dynamic range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kim and Rieke, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Weick and Demb, 2011</xref>). Hyperpolarization, by facilitating recovery from inactivation, may therefore increase the intrinsic excitability of RGCs. We examined whether a brief hyperpolarizing pre-pulse could indeed enhance the excitability of Xenopus RGCs in vivo. During whole-cell current-clamp recordings from RGCs, a pre-pulse of 100 ms hyperpolarizing or depolarizing current (range: −100 to +80 pA) was injected, and 25 ms later a 100 ms depolarizing test pulse (200 pA) was applied (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6j</xref>). The number of spikes evoked by the test pulse was substantially elevated following hyperpolarizing pre-pulses, whereas it decreased after depolarizing pre-pulses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6k</xref>). The 25 ms interval between pre-pulse and test pulse facilitated spike counting, but the effect was also evident in experiments where the test pulse followed immediately after the pre-pulse.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Sustained retinal stimulation induces CB1R-dependent enhancement of RGC firing</title><p>eCBs can be released from neurons in response to stimulation driving a prolonged increase in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hashimotodani et al., 2007</xref>).

We first performed amphotericin-perforated patch recordings of visually evoked synaptic potentials from neurons in the optic tectum which receives direct RGC innervation – in this case, perforated-patch recording helps maintain the quality of recordings during long recordings by preventing 'wash-out' of the cell. Direct electrical stimulation of RGCs through a glass-stimulating electrode placed in the ganglion cell layer of the eye (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8a</xref>) evoked α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor-mediated retinotectal currents with latencies of about 5 ms in postsynaptic tectal neurons clamped at −60 mV.

This indicates that the cannabinoid-mediated enhancement of retinotectal EPSC amplitude is due to increased retinal excitability and the resulting recruitment of more RGCs when stimulating in the eye, rather than to changes at the retinotectal synapses or in properties of the neurons within the optic tectum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1c–h</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, these data suggest a model in which activation of CB1Rs on RGCs should enhance their excitability enough to recruit RGCs to fire action potentials in response to visual stimulation of subfields that were previously sub-threshold. This should manifest as an enlargement of input receptive field (RF) sizes in tectal neurons, which receive convergent inputs from many RGCs. To test this prediction, we examined whether RFs of tectal neurons were expanded by WIN 55,212-2 treatment. Immediately after establishing stable in vivoamphotericin-perforated patches onto tectal neurons in intact tadpoles, the objective of the electrophysiology microscope was reoriented to project a 7 × 7 grid of rectangular subfields directly onto the photoreceptor layer of the eye contralateral to the cell being recorded.

During an initial 3 min pre-test period, a uniform field was displayed to calculate false-positive response probabilities for the tadpoles by measuring escape 'responses' to 'invisible dots' presented by the software as isoluminant to background, and during the subsequent 5 min test period, dots (4 mm diameter) with lower luminance than the background, moving in random directions were displayed on the monitor while the software tracked each tadpole for escape responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8j</xref>).

Although our observation of increased escape velocities suggests that the effects of WIN 55,212-2 were not limited to the retina, the finding that drug-treated tadpoles exhibited superior detection of mesopic, but not photopic, visual stimuli, strongly argues for a retinal site of action. It is therefore highly likely that the enhanced excitability of RGCs by CB1R activation which we first report here, also contributes to this remarkable improvement in the visual detection of dim objects.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We found that activation of CB1Rs on RGCs reduces [Cl<sup>−</sup>]<sub>i</sub>, through the AMPK-dependent inhibition of NKCC1. This results in the hyperpolarization of the RGC resting membrane potential by enhancing the driving force for Cl<sup>−</sup> currents through GlyRs, and acutely enhances the intrinsic excitability of the RGCs, most likely through the resultant de-inactivation of voltage-gated sodium channels. This enhancement in RGC intrinsic excitability leads to the recruitment of additional, initially subthreshold RGC responses by target neurons in the optic tectum, which in turn may contribute to improved visual contrast sensitivity.</p><p>CB1Rs constitute one of the most highly expressed G-protein-coupled receptors in the central nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Herkenham et al., 1990</xref>), where they generally have been reported to act to reduce neurotransmitter release by attenuating voltage-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> or K<sup>+</sup> conductances in presynaptic terminals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chevaleyre et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kano et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Piomelli, 2003</xref>). CB1R-mediated hyperpolarization has also been proposed to reduce intrinsic excitability in cerebellar and cortical interneurons by positive modulation of a K<sup>+</sup> conductance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bacci et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kreitzer et al., 2002</xref>). Our work presents a novel mechanism for interaction between glycinergic inhibition and the eCB system involving the regulation of Cl<sup>−</sup> homeostasis, to enhance intrinsic neuronal excitability.</p><p>This finding also importantly adds to our understanding of the role of chloride transporter regulation in neuronal physiology. In neurons, Cl<sup>−</sup> levels are primarily controlled by the interplay of the inward NKCC1 and outward KCC2 cation-Cl<sup>−</sup> co-transporters, which are modulated by phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Darman et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">de Los Heros et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Delpire and Austin, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Garzón-Muvdi et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rinehart et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Song et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wenz et al., 2009</xref>). Activation of human NKCC1 requires phosphorylation at T217 by SPAK family members downstream of WNK1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Darman et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Vitari et al., 2006</xref>). It had previously been reported that AMPK activation can result in the inhibition of human NKCC1 through phosphorylation at S77, as well as suppression of T217 phosphorylation by SPAK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Fraser et al., 2014</xref>). In our study, we have provided evidence that CB1R-mediated down-regulation of [Cl<sup>−</sup>]<sub>i</sub>. in RGCs is dependent upon the AMPK pathway.</p><p>We used Clomeleon imaging and a variety of electrophysiological methods to demonstrate the reduction of [Cl<sup>−</sup>]<sub>i</sub> at the cell soma, and further found that Cl<sup>−</sup> currents through GlyRs appear to participate in the regulation of resting membrane voltage and cell excitability, presumably through tonic inhibition. Although tonic glycinergic inhibition has been well studied in the spinal cord and hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Xu and Gong, 2010</xref>), our study is one of the first to suggest a role for tonic inhibition by strychnine-sensitive GlyRs in the retina. We also found evidence from calcium imaging of bipolar cell terminals for their regulation by cannabinoid signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b–e</xref>) and observed that synaptic excitation and inhibition evoked by visual stimuli are reduced in response to CB1R activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3m–p</xref>). While a reduction in synaptic inhibition could potentially contribute to the cannabinoid-dependent enhancement of RGC firing that we detected, it is unlikely to fully account for this phenomenon for three reasons. First, the primary effect that we observed was a specific decrease in RGC [Cl]<sub>i</sub> leading to membrane hyperpolarization. This should enhance inhibitory driving force rather than decrease it and therefore is more consistent with our model that tonic pre-hyperpolarization helps prime the cell to fire more robustly to subsequent depolarization, which we demonstrated can occur in RGCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6j,k</xref>). Second, the fact that direct, instantaneous electrical stimulation of RGCs with an electrode in the RGC layer, which entirely bypasses upstream retinal circuitry, still resulted in a strychnine-sensitive enhancement of retinotectal EPSCs by CB1R activation is strongly indicative of direct tonic changes in RGC excitability. Third, when measuring evoked firing rates of RGCs, we did not find that pharmacological blockade of GABA-A receptors or GlyRs increased the excitability of RGCs. To the contrary, the fact that inhibition of NKCC1 or blockade of GlyRs completely eliminated the CB1R-dependent enhancement of RGC firing rates, taken together with Clomeleon imaging data showing that [Cl<sup>−</sup>]<sub>i</sub> is selectively altered in RGCs argues that direct, cell-autonomous changes in RGC excitability rather than modulation of upstream synaptic transmission constituted the primary mechanism underlying the increased firing in response to visual stimulation. The CB1R-mediated reduction of Ca<sup>2+</sup> in bipolar cell terminals seems more likely to impact vision by attenuating the signal from the outer retina to RGCs as has been well-documented in other species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Middleton and Protti, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Straiker et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Yazulla et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>Additionally, GlyRs have been reported to be directly positively modulated by cannabinoids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lozovaya et al., 2005</xref>). The change in slope of the E<sub>Gly</sub> I-V curve upon WIN 55,212-2 perfusion, apparent in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6e</xref>, may provide further support for this idea. GlyR modulation could act synergistically with the augmentation of tonic inhibition via the changes in [Cl<sup>−</sup>]<sub>i</sub> that we demonstrated to enhance intrinsic excitability of RGCs. On the other hand, it would counter any mechanism that relied on synaptic disinhibition. A direct enhancement of GlyRs by cannabinoids might account for why strychnine, but not gabazine, was most effective at preventing the effects of WIN 55,212-2 on RGC excitability.</p><p>Cannabinoid regulation of RGC-firing properties is not entirely unprecedented. Suppression of HVA Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents has been reported in dissociated rat RGCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lalonde et al., 2006</xref>). Interestingly, RGCs are known to express both the synthetic (NAPE-PLD) and degradative (FAAH) enzymes for AEA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Maione et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yazulla et al., 1999</xref>), suggesting they also may be a source of eCBs. In support of this idea, the CB1R-dependent reduction in synaptic drive from bipolar and amacrine interneurons can be induced by direct RGC membrane depolarization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wang et al., 2016</xref>). Based on our present data, we propose that AEA release additionally acts in an auto- or paracrine manner to enhance RGC excitability. Opposing actions on bipolar cell terminals and RGCs may serve a useful role to improve the signal-to-noise ratio of visual responses by maintaining a vigorous retinal output while attenuating excessive synaptic noise from the outer retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Grimes et al., 2014</xref>). This may explain our finding that CB1R activation dramatically improved behavioral responses to dark moving cues near absolute threshold for visual detection.</p><p>Finally, our work describes a mechanism of sensitization to spatial subfield stimulation when a conditioning stimulus is presented in the periphery. This is reminiscent of the so-called ‘Westheimer effect’ where detection sensitivity for a small test flash at the center of a background disk improves as the background disk increases in size, an effect shown in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Westheimer, 1965</xref>) and lower vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Burkhardt, 1974</xref>). The sensitization component of this effect generally has been explained based on the antagonistic center and surround regions of the RGC RF, such that progressive stimulation in the surround decreases net excitation. However, important limitations to this model exist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Essock et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sinai et al., 1999</xref>) and recent research has revealed that sensitization to temporal contrast changes can last for seconds in individual regions of the RGC surround field and may therefore mediate a predictive function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kastner and Baccus, 2013</xref>). The CB1R-dependent sensitization of mesopic RGC responses that we report here can persist for minutes, but appears to require prolonged stimulation in the periphery to produce the eCBs that induce it. This mechanism may be beneficial as a means of optimizing RGC signal-to-noise ratios during the initial period of dark adaptation before photoreceptors obtain maximum sensitivity.</p><p>The CB1R-dependent mechanism for low luminance sensitization that we describe here in the developing amphibian retina will require additional investigation to determine whether it also occurs in the mammalian eye, although the psychophysical evidence is encouraging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Russo et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">West, 1991</xref>). Our findings offer a new framework for future studies of contrast gain control in the retina and generally expand our understanding of the diverse mechanisms of neuromodulation by eCBs.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>Albino <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> tadpoles (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/NXR_0.0082">NXR_0.0082</ext-link>) were bred by human chorionic gonadotropin-induced mating.

The same size patch pipette was used for extracellular RGC stimulation except that it was filled with external solution. For optic chiasm stimulation experiments, the brain was dissected out into external solution, filleted flat by transecting the dorsal midline and pinned to a Sylgard base in a recording perfusion chamber. A custom-bent 25 mm cluster electrode (FHC, Maine) was positioned onto the optic chiasm through which constant current electrical stimulation was delivered using a stimulus isolation unit (AMPI, Israel). Test pulses to evoke retinotectal EPSCs were applied every 30 s in voltage clamp. Recordings were acquired with a patch-clamp amplifier (Axopatch 200B; Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) and Clampex software (Molecular Devices). Signals were filtered at 2 kHz and sampled at 5 kHz. Input resistance (0.5–1 GOhm) and series resistance (30–70 MOhm) were monitored continuously during recordings. Data were accepted for analysis only if the series resistance and input resistance remained relatively constant (&lt;20% change) throughout the experiment. Cells were held at a holding potential of −60 mV. To measure visual receptive fields of tectal neurons, visual stimuli were presented on an 800 × 600 pixel, 9 × 12 mm SVGA 3D OLED-XL color microdisplay (eMagin, Hopewell Junction, NY) mounted in place of one microscope eyepiece using a custom built frame. The image was then focused onto the photoreceptor layer of the retina through the microscope objective. The screen displayed a 7 × 7 pixel array, each pixel (30 µm square) of which independently turned off for 200 ms in random order at 0.067 Hz to drive receptive field OFF stimulation. Total charge transferred in the 200 ms window following each stimulus presentation was used to calculate input strength for the corresponding part of the visual field.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Behavior</title><p>Stage 44–45 tadpoles were placed in MBSH solution in a polystyrene Petri dish (100 × 15 mm) positioned directly over a 22 in computer monitor (ViewSonic 1080 Full HD, 10 M:1 contrast ratio), which lay horizontally within a darkened box. For each experiment, eight animals at a time were filmed using a digital camcorder (SONY HDR-CX250B), while the screen displayed dark moving dot stimuli (10 mm dia., 2 cm s<sup>−1</sup>) following a ballistic random walker trajectory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Molinàs-Mata et al., 1996</xref>). A pre-test period of 3 min, with dots having the same luminance as the background (invisible dots) was used to establish the frequency of random chance false positive dot avoidance behaviors. During the test period, lasting 5 min, the screen displayed either a white background of high intensity (photopic, 190 ± 4.2 cd m<sup>−2</sup>) or of low intensity (mesopic, 0.65 ± 0.05 cd m<sup>−2</sup>), with dark dots of different luminances for each trial. Custom MATLAB 'Tadtracker' code (available for download at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ruthazerlab.mcgill.ca/local.htm">http://ruthazerlab.mcgill.ca/local.htm</ext-link>) was created to track each tadpole independently in the recorded videos and measure their reactions by correlating their locations, relative to the dots, with changes in their swimming speed to the dot coordinates. Tadpole positions were calculated based on image contrast to background with the software always identifying the eight objects fitting the criteria for a tadpole based on size and interpolation of previous and subsequent positions, and excluding the positions of known moving dot stimuli. Velocities were measured between each frame at 30 Hz video rate and then Gaussian smoothed to reduce the effects of noise on the tracking. A potential dot avoidance event was counted whenever a dot came within 5 mm of a tadpole. A successful avoidance event was logged if swimming velocity changed by at least 24 mm s<sup>−1</sup> within 0.25 s of initial encounter. This threshold was determined empirically based on the acquisition frame-rate and baseline rates of tadpole movement as one which unambiguously constituted a reaction to the visual environment. We noted that histograms of tadpole swimming speeds showed a dual power law distribution ranging from 0 to 200 mm s<sup>−1</sup> with a critical point at 24 mm s<sup>−1</sup>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Western blot for pNKCC1 and pSPAK</title><p>To analyze the changes in NKCC1 and SPAK phosphorylation, samples were prepared of stage 42–45 <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> tadpole eyes. Eyes were homogenized in the extraction buffer (10 mM HEPES/NaOH pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA pH 8.0, 1% NP40) with protease inhibitors (Calbiochem Protease inhibitor Set V, EDTA-free). Western blot analysis for NKCC1 phosphorylation was performed with Biorad wet transfer system and PVDF membrane, using the primary sheep polyclonal anti-human antibody against Thr phosphorylation sites 212, 217 of NKCC1 (MRC-PPU Reagents, antibody S063D). S063D was used at 0.5 µg/ml in 2% milk-TBS with 0.05% Tween, and before applying it to the blot, 30 min pre-incubation with 5 µg/ml of non-phosphorylated epitope peptide was performed, as per the recommendations of the manufacturer to minimize the prevalence of the antibodies in the polyclonal mix that react with the non-phosphorylated epitope. For total NKCC1 measurement, sheep anti-Dog fish polyclonal antibody (S841B, MRC PPU Reagents) was used, 0.2 µg/ml in 2.5% milk-PBS with 0.1% Triton. As a secondary antibody for S063D and S841B, Abcam rabbit anti-sheep IgG-HRP (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_955453">AB_955453</ext-link>) was used, 1:30 000 in 2% milk TBS-T. For detection of SPAK phosphorylation, primary Millipore antibody 07–2273 p-SPAK Ser373/pOSR Ser325 (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_11205577">AB_11205577</ext-link>) was used, 1:7000 in 5% BSA, and as a secondary antibody, goat anti-rabbit HRP (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2307391">AB_2307391</ext-link>), 1:30 000 in 5% milk TBS-tween. In all cases, blots were incubated in primary antibody overnight at 4C. Secondary antibodies were incubated at room temperature for 1 hr. The blots were developed with Immobilon Western Chemiluminescent HRP Substrate (WBKLS0500).</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Analysis</title><p>All statistical analyses were performed using Prism 6.0 (GraphPad, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_002798">SCR_002798</ext-link>) and all data are reported and graphed as mean ± SEM. Data were tested for normality using a Shapiro-Wilk test and outliers, as identified by Grubb’s test, were excluded from analysis. Correction for multiple comparisons following ANOVA were made using the Holm-Sidak post-hoc test with multiplicity corrected p-values reported. For one-sample t-tests, we tested whether fold-change was significantly different from one-fold (i.e. no change). Sample size in whole-cell recording experiments was based on values previously found sufficient to detect significant changes in retinotectal synaptic strength in past studies from the lab. For extracellular recordings, an N of 10 independent recordings from 10 animals was set in advance to provide sufficient statistical power while trying to minimize the number of animals sacrificed. Behavioral studies and RGC recording experiments were not performed blind, but analysis used automated software algorithms to present randomized stimuli and applied uniform criteria to all samples, limiting potential bias.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="conflict" id="conf1"><p>The authors declare that no competing interests exist.</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>LSM, Conceived and designed the project, Performed the experiments, Wrote the manuscript, Analysis and interpretation of data</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>JT, Conceived and designed the project, Performed the experiments, Analysis and interpretation of data, Drafting or revising the article</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>DG, Performed the experiments, Conception and design, Analysis and interpretation of data, Drafting or revising the article</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>J-FD, Performed the experiments, Designed and created the tadpole tracking software and analyzed behavioural data, Contributed unpublished essential data or reagents</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>AS, Performed the experiments, Conception and design, Drafting or revising the article</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>MS, Performed the experiments, Conception and design, Analysis and interpretation of data, Drafting or revising the article</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>PS, Performed the experiments, Analysis and interpretation of data, Drafting or revising the article</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>AC, Modified and tested the Clomeleon constructs and directed their use and the interpretation of data, Conception and design, Drafting or revising the article, Contributed unpublished essential data or reagents</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>YDK, Modified and tested the Clomeleon constructs and directed their use and the interpretation of data, Conception and design, Drafting or revising the article, Contributed unpublished essential data or reagents</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>NM-A, Provided transgenic animals, Helped design experiments in which they were used, Drafting or revising the article, Contributed unpublished essential data or reagents</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>PWW, Supervised the experiments, Conception and design, Analysis and interpretation of data, Drafting or revising the article, Contributed unpublished essential data or reagents</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con12"><p>ESR, Conceived and designed the project, Supervised the experiments, Wrote the manuscript, Analysis and interpretation of data</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Animal experimentation: This study was performed in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Canadian Council on Animal Care.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Gary Westbrook as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Jeff Diamond (Reviewer #1); Rowland Taylor (Reviewer #2). The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Senior Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission..</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This is an interesting, thorough paper showing how cannabinoids enhance the sensitivity of visual signaling in the <italic>Xenopus</italic> visual system. The authors show that CB1 receptors are expressed in the <italic>Xenopus</italic> tadpole retina, including ganglion cells, and that CB1 receptor activation by exogenous or endogenous ligands enhances light-evoked spike responses in ganglion cells. Enhanced responses are not observed in bipolar or amacrine cells, indicating an effect on ganglion cells. The enhancement requires glycine receptor-mediated inhibition and is mimicked and occluded by blockade of the chloride transporter NKCC1. They go on to show that CB1 inhibits NKCC1 via AMP-dependent kinase. This reduction in NKCC1 activity lowers intracellular chloride, hyperpolarizing the ganglion cell membrane potential. The authors argue that this hyperpolarization actually enhances spiking response to light stimulation by reducing sodium channel inactivation. They show that CB1 activation regulates light-evoked firing in ganglion cells, enhances responses and broadens receptive fields in the tectum and enhances visually evoked behavioral responses under low light conditions. The experiments are cleanly performed and clearly presented. This is an excellent paper.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1)There were concerns regarding the evidence for reduced sodium channel inactivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). CB1 receptor activation causes a ~25% increase in light-evoked spike responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) and hyperpolarizes the resting membrane potential from -42 mV to -53 mV (perforated patch recordings, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). According to the authors' theory, these data would predict that a similar 11 mV hyperpolarization of the membrane potential would decrease sodium channel inactivation and increase (perhaps by 25%) spiking elicited by a depolarizing current step. The authors show that pre-hyperpolarizing the membrane leads to increased spikes in response to a test current step (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>), but this experiment does not really test the idea as well as it could. First, the hyperpolarizing pre-steps cause a much greater change in membrane potential than that caused by CB1 activation (admittedly, these larger hyperpolarizations also cause larger changes in spiking). Also, there is a 25-ms interval between the end of the hyperpolarizing pre-pulse and the test step, and it's not clear how much change in inactivation occurs during this interval. It would seem more direct to hyperpolarize the membrane potential by 11 mV from rest with a long step, then immediately apply the test pulse to see if the spike response is enhanced 25% relative to the response with no pre-step. In addition, a voltage clamp experiment could be employed to show that, in these cells, sodium channel inactivation is substantially greater at -42 mV compared to -53 mV substantially reduces sodium channel inactivation.

CB1 receptor activation causes a ~25% increase in light-evoked spike responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) and hyperpolarizes the resting membrane potential from -42 mV to -53 mV (perforated patch recordings, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). According to the authors' theory, these data would predict that a similar 11 mV hyperpolarization of the membrane potential would decrease sodium channel inactivation and increase (perhaps by 25%) spiking elicited by a depolarizing current step. The authors show that pre-hyperpolarizing the membrane leads to increased spikes in response to a test current step (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>), but this experiment does not really test the idea as well as it could. First, the hyperpolarizing pre-steps cause a much greater change in membrane potential than that caused by CB1 activation (admittedly, these larger hyperpolarizations also cause larger changes in spiking). Also, there is a 25-ms interval between the end of the hyperpolarizing pre-pulse and the test step, and it's not clear how much change in inactivation occurs during this interval. It would seem more direct to hyperpolarize the membrane potential by 11 mV from rest with a long step, then immediately apply the test pulse to see if the spike response is enhanced 25% relative to the response with no pre-step. In addition, a voltage clamp experiment could be employed to show that, in these cells, sodium channel inactivation is substantially greater at -42 mV compared to -53 mV substantially reduces sodium channel inactivation. This second result is certainly expected, would not show causation, and may not be required; the first experiment (a modification of the protocol shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>) is not necessarily critical but would strengthen the argument considerably.</italic> </p><p>We had performed gramicidin perforated patch recordings of dissociated RGCs to provide electrophysiological validation of our in vivo Clomeleon imaging data. These recordings also had the added benefit of demonstrating that isolated RGCs without the intact retinal circuit to provide synaptic input show a cell-autonomous shift in V<sub>m</sub> (old <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6g–i</xref>) as predicted. Our attempts to perform gramicidin perforated patch recordings in vivo were unsuccessful due to the well-known challenges associated with this technique.</p><p>Dissociated cultured neurons are unlikely to exhibit identical properties to intact neurons in situ. For example, we found these cultured cells to be considerably less prone to spiking than intact RGCs in the retina. In addition, we reported V<sub>m</sub> without correcting for the liquid junction potential. Overall we believe the precise membrane voltages measured in these in vitro recordings can be used to interpret relative changes but not absolute voltages that likely occur in the intact retina in vivo in response to CB1R activation.</p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6j,k</xref> (old <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>) we showed that a hyperpolarizing prepulse increases the firing rates of RGCs in response to depolarizing current injected 25 ms later. This protocol was adapted from a <italic>Neuron</italic> article by Weick &amp; Demb (2011). The reviewers indicated that, while not necessarily critical, our case might have been made more directly by simply reducing membrane voltage by the “predicted” 11mV during the prepulse and omitting the 25 ms interval. We have therefore implemented a version of this experiment in the accompanying figure, which demonstrates that the outcome is not substantially different when the 25 ms interval is removed (n =6). Indeed the example shown on the right illustrates that a 10 mV hyperpolarizing prepulse can increase spike rates by about 20%. We do not know precisely where on this curve the cells actually would sit prior to patching, but the data are entirely consistent with spike rate changes of the magnitude we report throughout the paper.<fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15932.017</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.15932.017">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.15932.017</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-15932-resp-fig1-v2"/></fig></p><p> <italic>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>: The conclusion that the effects of CB1R agonists do not occur upstream of the RGCs seems a little strong, given the data.

Our argument is not that there are absolutely no upstream changes that could contribute to RGC firing –as the reviewers point out the complexity of the retina makes it virtually impossible to exclude such a contribution. Indeed we discuss such upstream mechanisms (e.g., cannabinoid modulation of glyRs) at length in the Discussion section. From the beginning our objective has simply been to provide multiple lines of evidence for a novel form of cannabinoid-mediated regulation of excitability and to make a compelling case that the eCB system in the retina indeed exploits this mechanism to drive network and behavioral changes.</p><p>Our data show that this novel mechanism based on CB1R-dependent chloride regulation in RGCs is both necessary and sufficient to drive the changes in RGC responsiveness, but they cannot exclude all possible contributions by other factors.

However we have added two new sets of experiments involving in situ whole-cell recordings from RGCs:</p><p>1) To provide further evidence for a CB1R-mediated inhibition of NKCC1, leading to reduced intracellular Cl<sup>-</sup>, we performed in vivo whole cell recordings from RGCs while puffing glycine in order to test for a shift in the glyR I-V curve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a–f</xref>). Because any changes in intracellular Cl<sup>-</sup> must overcome the Cl<sup>-</sup> loading by the whole-cell recording pipette, this method does not directly demonstrate the changes in intracellular Cl<sup>-</sup> levels that would occur in intact cells, but rather reveals the activation of Cl<sup>-</sup> transporters that underlie these changes. We demonstrate that CB1R activation produces a leftward shift in the I-V curve that mimics that produced by directly inhibiting NKCC1 with bumetanide. This provides additional evidence that CB1R activation inhibits NKCC1 in RGCs.</p><p>2) We have also more directly examined the effects of cannabinoid application on synaptic inputs onto RGCs by performing in vivo whole-cell recordings during visual stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3j–p</xref>). These experiments reveal that retinal CB1R activation decreases visually evoked excitatory synaptic drive onto RGCs, consistent with the GCaMP6 imaging data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a–e</xref> (old <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2h–l</xref>). An IPSC reduction is also seen. Thus in this case, CB1R agonists appear to carry out their classic role of decreasing synaptic release probability of bipolar and amacrine cells. This is unlikely to account for the increased firing rates of RGCs that we observe, especially in light of the fact that we know that the driving force for Cl<sup>-</sup> in intact neurons is enhanced, which would counteract the decrease in evoked synaptic IPSCs.</p></body></sub-article></article>
