proposed to mediate fear responses to imminent danger. Previously we reported that vlPAG neurons showing short-latency increases in firing to a danger cue – the presumed neural substrate for fear output – signal threat probability in male rats (Wright et al., 2019). Here, we scrutinize the activity vlPAG neurons that <italic>decrease</italic> firing to danger. One cue-inhibited population flipped danger activity from early inhibition to late excitation: a poor neural substrate for fear output, but a better substrate for threat timing. A second population showed differential firing with greatest inhibition to danger, less to uncertainty and no inhibition to safety. The pattern of differential firing reflected the pattern of fear output, and was observed throughout cue presentation. The results reveal an expected vlPAG signal for fear output in an unexpected, cue-inhibited population.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>threat</kwd><kwd>fear</kwd><kwd>midbrain</kwd><kwd>electrophsyiology</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01MH117791</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>McDannald</surname><given-names>Michael A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R00DA034010</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>McDannald</surname><given-names>Michael A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5106201</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wright</surname><given-names>Kristina M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Ventrolateral periaqueductal gray neurons signal fear output through patterned inhibition of neural activity.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The ventrolateral periaqueductal gray (vlPAG) is an essential node in a neural circuit for defensive behavior. In the prevailing view of the defensive circuit, threat estimates originate in the amygdala and are relayed to the vlPAG to organize the behavioral components of fear output, such as freezing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fanselow, 1994</xref>). A multitude of studies have observed a population of vlPAG single-units showing short-latency excitation to cues predicting foot shock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Tovote et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Watson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ozawa et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Groessl et al., 2018</xref>). While short-latency, cue-excitation would provide a suitable neural substrate for freezing output, cue-excited neural activity did not consistently track freezing in each of these studies. Recently, we recorded vlPAG single-unit activity while rats underwent fear discrimination in which three auditory cues predicted unique foot shock probabilities: danger (p = 1.00), uncertainty (p = 0.375) and safety (p = 0.00) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Wright and McDannald, 2019</xref>). As in previous studies, we identified single-units with short-latency excitation to cue onset. Somewhat surprisingly, onset single-unit activity reflected the foot shock probability associated with each cue, rather than the level of fear demonstrated to that cue. Thus, short-latency excitatory responses reflect information about threat probability.</p><p>Although cue-excited single-units have been the focus of a neural substrate for fear output, cue-inhibited vlPAG single-units have also been found (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Tovote et al., 2016</xref>). Further, optogenetic inhibition of this functional type promotes freezing. Among the vlPAG single-units recorded in our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Wright and McDannald, 2019</xref>), a considerable number inhibited activity on cue presentation (91/245,~37% of single-units recorded), particularly to danger. The goal of the current study was to scrutinize these cue-inhibited, vlPAG single-units and determine whether they may provide a suitable neural substrate for fear output.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Rats were trained to nose poke in a central port in order to receive a food pellet from a cup below. During fear discrimination, three distinct auditory cues predicted unique foot shock probabilities: danger (p = 1.00), uncertainty (p = 0.375) and safety (p = 0.00) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Trial order was randomized each session.

After eight discrimination sessions, rats were implanted with 16-wire, drivable microelectrode bundles dorsal to the vlPAG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Following recovery, rats were returned to fear discrimination and activity was recorded. Single-units were isolated and held for the duration of each recording session.

The interaction was driven by negative beta coefficients for fear output and threat probability in two, early cue intervals (95% bootstrap confidence interval did not contain zero, pound signs), that gave way to positive beta coefficients specific to threat probability in all late cue intervals (95% bootstrap confidence interval did not contain zero, pound signs; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Further supporting the interaction, beta coefficients for Flip single-units were not biased away from zero for fear output and threat probability during the first 5 s cue period [Probability Early: p(s) = 0.37, Fear Output Early: p(s) = 0.14] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). However, there was positive bias toward threat probability, but not fear output, during the last 5 s cue period [Probability Late: p(s) = 2.47×10<sup>−4</sup>, Fear Output Late: p(s) = 0.77] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Fear responses are sustained for the cue duration, yet Flip neurons do not consistently signal threat probability or fear output in early cue presentation. The inconsistency in signaling reveals that Flip neurons are not a suitable neural substrate for governing fear output throughout cue presentation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Sustain neurons signal fear output and threat probability throughout cue presentation</title><p>Linear regression revealed consistent signals for fear output and threat probability in Sustain neurons. Beta coefficients were negative at cue onset for each regressor, and maintained this negativity throughout cue presentation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). ANOVA for beta coefficients with factors of regressor and interval was performed as before for baseline, cue and delay. The baseline ANOVA returned no main effects or interaction (all F &lt; 1, all p &gt; 0.3). The cue ANOVA found only a main effect of bin (F<sub>9,405</sub> = 4.23, p = 2.90×10<sup>−5</sup>, η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> = 0.086, op = 0.997), indicating similar signaling of fear output and threat probability. The delay ANOVA found only a main effect of regressor (F<sub>1,45</sub> = 7.27, p = 0.01, η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> = 0.14, op = 0.751), indicating a difference in signaling of fear output and threat probability during the delay period. For each regressor over the 10, 1 s cue intervals, the 95% bootstrap confidence interval did not contain zero, indicating that fear output and threat probability signaling were observed throughout cue presentation. Consistent with equivalent signaling of fear output and probability throughout cue presentation, single-unit beta coefficients for each regressor were biased away from zero for fear output and threat probability during early and late cue presentation [Probability (Early: p(s) = 1.83×10<sup>−6</sup> and Late: p(s) = 4.06×10<sup>−5</sup>), Fear Output (Early: p(s) = 0.002 and Late: p(s) = 1.56×10<sup>−4</sup>)] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E &amp; F</xref>). Further, single-unit beta coefficients for threat probability and fear output were correlated early and late (Early: R<sup>2</sup> = 0.41, p = 2.38×10<sup>−6</sup> and Late: R<sup>2</sup> = 0.37, p = 9.55×10<sup>−6</sup>).

Of course, the subjects, and by extension their neurons, had no a priori knowledge of the actual shock probability. Thus, it is possible that Flip and Sustain single-units are ‘tuned’ to alternative shock probabilities. To test this, we performed single-unit linear regression for normalized firing in each 1 s interval as before, maintaining the probabilities for danger (1.00) and safety (0.00), but incrementing the probability assigned to uncertainty from 0 to 1 in 0.125 steps (0.000, 0.125, 0.250, 0.375, 0.500, 0.625, 0.750, 0.875, and 1.000). Threat probability beta coefficients were averaged over early and late cue presentation. The mean beta coefficient for each uncertainty assignment is plotted as a threat-tuning curve, early and late, for each population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.50054.006</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Sustain and Flip populations probability tuning.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Mean beta coefficient for probability is shown for early (light pink) or late (hot pink) cue presentation for each of nine uncertainty assignments for the Flip population (n = 45). The peak or trough of each curve is indicated by a single point with the corresponding uncertainty assignment highlighted in the same color on the x axis below.

Early threat overestimation (equating uncertainty to danger) gave way to late underestimation (equating uncertainty to safety). The tuning curve trough for early cue presentation occurred at 0.750 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, light pink); overshooting the actual probability of 0.375 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, dashed black line) and exceeding mean fear output (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, dashed green line). The tuning curve peak for late cue presentation occurred at 0.250 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, dark pink); undershooting the actual probability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, dashed black line). ANOVA for beta coefficient with factors of time (early vs. late) and uncertainty assignment (9) found both main effects and the interaction to be significant (all F &gt; 13, all p &lt; 0.001). The relative firing patterns of Flip neurons do not approximate the actual probability of foot shock or the pattern of fear output, and further indicate that these neurons are unlikely to govern fear output.</p><p>In contrast, Sustain neuron tuning consistently fell between the bounds of the actual foot shock probability and the mean fear output, changing only subtly over cue presentation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). The trough of the tuning curve occurred at an assignment of 0.500 early and at an assignment of 0.625 late. ANOVA found a main effect of assignment (F<sub>8,360</sub> = 5.66, p = 8.85×10<sup>−7</sup>, η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> = 0.112, op = 1.00) and a time x assignment interaction (F<sub>8,360</sub> = 3.25, p = 0.001, η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> = 0.067, op = 0.971). The stability of Sustain tuning and the bias toward mean fear output further suggests this population as a candidate for fear output.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We set out to scrutinize cue-inhibited vlPAG neurons to determine if their activity reflected fear output. Unexpectedly, we found one population inhibited to danger early, but excited to danger late. Although Flip neurons are not suitable candidates for signaling fear output, they may provide information about the anticipated time of foot shock. Consistent with this speculation, peak activity of Flip neurons occurred just prior to shock presentation and declined toward baseline shortly after. This finding is in general accord with studies showing that the shift from distal to proximate threats corresponds with a shift from prefrontal to periaqueductal activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Mobbs et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Mobbs et al., 2010</xref>). Further, the patterned activity of Flip neurons is similar to our previously reported ‘Ramping’ population, which showed little change in activity at cue presentation but increased firing toward shock delivery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Wright and McDannald, 2019</xref>). Flip and Ramping neurons may comprise a single, functional population, and suggest a central role for the vlPAG in threat timing.</p><p>The patterned activity of Sustain neurons complies with basic assumptions of a neural correlate for fear output. Sustain neurons decreased firing to threat-related cues, but did not decrease firing to safety. Neural activity fully discriminated between danger, uncertainty and safety from cue onset through shock presentation and returned to baseline shortly thereafter. These population biases were observed in single-units. Interestingly, while threat probability signaling was observed in Sustain single-units, the probability to which neurons were tuned exceeded the actual probability of 0.375 and better approximated fear output. Although we do not have causal evidence that Sustain neurons drive a discriminative fear response, we have identified a complete neural correlate for fear output in a population of vlPAG neurons.</p><p>An influential theory posits that vlPAG output is achieved through a disinhibition mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Tovote et al., 2016</xref>). GABA interneurons (with high baseline firing rates) receive inputs from GABAergic neurons in the central amygdala. Central amygdala GABA neurons increase firing to danger cues, inhibiting and reducing firing of vlPAG interneurons. This stops the local inhibition of glutamate neurons that now increase firing to promote freezing through downstream projections. Consistent with a disinhibition mechanism, we observed Sustain neurons that have high baseline firing rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, right). However, we observed many Sustain neurons that had low baseline firing rates, including those with baseline rates just above zero. While we cannot conclusively determine neuron type from baseline firing, it is likely that cue-inhibited neurons are not uniformly GABAergic interneurons. While inconsistent with a pure disinhibition mechanism, our results are consistent with an alternative view in which the vlPAG contains unique output populations that separately convey information via excitation and inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Lau and Vaughan, 2014</xref>). Most likely, the vlPAG utilizes disinhibition, as well as independent signaling via cue-excited and cue-inhibited projection populations.</p><p>Altogether, our previous and present findings reveal diverse temporal responding and threat signaling in the vlPAG. Our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Wright and McDannald, 2019</xref>) found a cue-excited population that phasically fired at cue onset and exclusively signaled threat probability. That study also identified cue-excited population of ‘Ramping’ neurons that increased firing over cue presentation, and prioritized threat probability signaling over fear output (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Wright and McDannald, 2019</xref>). The present findings expand the functional diversity of vlPAG neurons. Patterned activity and signaling of Flip neurons resembles that of our previously identified ‘Ramping’ neurons, perhaps marking a single functional class critical for timing impending noxious events. Patterned activity and signaling of Sustain neurons was more consistent with fear output, but also contained information about threat probability. Observing robust vlPAG threat-related activity is expected, given its essential role in defensive behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bandler and Depaulis, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Fanselow, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Carrive et al., 1997</xref>). However, the diversity of information contained in these signals is surprising. Concurrent with our findings, there is increasing evidence that vlPAG dysfunction may contribute to a variety of psychiatric disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">George et al., 2019</xref>). Understanding the factors that determine vlPAG neuron function: cell-type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Li et al., 2016</xref>), transcriptome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Okaty et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Okaty et al., 2019</xref>), connectome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Rozeske et al., 2018</xref>) and more (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">McPherson et al., 2018</xref>), will be essential to understanding the neural mechanisms underlying adaptive and maladaptive threat behavior.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th>Source or <break/>Reference</th><th>Identifier</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Antibody</td><td valign="top">Anti-Tryptophan Hydroxylase (sheep polyclonal)</td><td>Sigma</td><td>Cat #

Rats were implanted with drivable, sixteen-wire microelectrode bundles. Each animal received between eleven and sixteen days to recover from surgery with ad libitum access to water and standard chow. Throughout the experiment, rats had ad libitum access to water; however, to generate motivation for a food-reward, standard chow was restricted to maintain rats at 85% of their free-feeding body weight. Three rats were eliminated from the study because electrodes failed to register single-unit activity and one rat was eliminated due to incorrect electrode placement. Reported data are from remaining six individuals.

The cannula bundle was attached to a manually operated microdrive calibrated to permit ~0.042 mm advancement increments. Two free-hanging 127 µm diameter PFA-coated stainless-steel ground wires were also part of the assembly (791400, A-M Systems, Carlsborg, WA). All wires were electrically connected to a Nano Strip omnetics connector (A79042-001, Omnetics Connector Corp., Minneapolis, MN) on a custom 24-contact, individually-routed and gold-immersed circuit board (San Francisco Circuits, San Mateo, CA).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Surgery</title><p>Aseptic stereotaxic surgery was performed under isoflurane anesthesia (1% to 5% in oxygen).

Post-incision, the skull was scoured in a crosshatch pattern with a scalpel blade to strengthen implant adhesion. Five screws (two anterior to Bregma, two between Bregma and lambda: 3 mm medial to the lateral ridges of the skull, and one on the midline: 5 mm posterior of lambda) were installed in the skull to further stabilize the bond between the skull, electrode assembly and protective head cap. A 1.4 mm diameter burr hole was drilled through the skull, centered on the implant site and the underlying dura was removed to expose the cortex. Nichrome recording wires were freshly cut with surgical scissors to extend approximately 2.0 mm beyond the cannula at a 15° angle. Just before implant, current was delivered to each recording wire in a saline bath, stripping each tip of its formvar insulation. Each omnetics connector contact was stimulated for 2 s using a resistor-equipped lead; current was supplied by a 12 V lantern battery. Machine grease was placed by the cannula and on the microdrive to prevent orthodontic resin from seizing moveable components.</p><p>The electrode assembly was slowly advanced at a 20° angle for implantation dorsal to the vlPAG. Coordinates from cortex: anterior-posterior (AP) −8.00 mm, medial-lateral (ML) −2.45 mm, and dorsal-ventral (DV) −5.52 mm. Once in place, stripped ends of both ground wires were wrapped around the posterior midline screw inserted previously. The microdrive base and a protective head cap surrounding the electrode assembly were cemented in place on the skull with orthodontic resin (C 22-05-98, Pearson Dental Supply, Sylmar, CA).

A nose poke opening equipped with infrared photocells was mounted on a central, acrylic wall panel and an acrylic external food cup was mounted on the same wall panel three inches below.

Cue identity was counterbalanced across rats. Foot shock was administered 2 s following the termination of the auditory cue on danger and uncertainty shock trials. This was done in order to observe possible neural activity during the delay period not driven by an explicit cue. A single session consisted of six danger trials, ten uncertainty no-shock trials, six uncertainty shock trials, and ten safety trials. The order of trial type presentation was randomly determined by the behavioral program, and differed for each rat during each session. After the eighth discrimination session, rats were given ad libitum access to standard rat chow for at least 24 hr, followed by stereotaxic surgery. Following recovery, discrimination (identical to that described above) resumed with single-unit recording. Animals received discrimination with recording every other day.

This acquisition process resulted in a single file (.pl2) containing all time stamps for all spikes and events. Single-units were sorted offline with a template-based spike-sorting algorithm (Offline Sorter V3, Plexon Inc, Dallas TX). Timestamped spikes and events (cues, shocks, nose pokes) were extracted and analyzed with statistical routines in MATLAB (Natick, MA). Neural activity was recorded throughout the 500 ms shock delivery period. Data are not presented from this period because we cannot be certain that shock artifacts did not disrupt spike collection.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Statistical analysis</title><sec id="s4-10-1"><title>Calculating suppression ratios</title><p>Fear was measured by suppression of rewarded nose poking, calculated as a ratio: (baseline poke rate – cue poke rate) / (baseline poke rate + cue poke rate). A ratio of ‘1.00’ indicated high fear, ‘0.00’ low fear, and gradations between reflect intermediate levels of fear.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10-2"><title>Behavior analyses</title><p>Behavior was analyzed using analysis of variance (ANOVA) with trial type as a factor. ANOVA for behavior contained three trial types (danger, uncertainty and safety). Uncertainty trial types (shock and no-shock) were collapsed because they did not differ for suppression ratio; during cue presentation, rats did not know the current uncertainty trial type. 95% bootstrap confidence intervals were constructed to evaluate the relationship between suppression ratios for each cue pair. </p></sec><sec id="s4-10-3"><title>95% bootstrap confidence intervals</title><p>95% bootstrap confidence intervals were constructed using the bootci function in Matlab. For each bootstrap, a distribution was created by sampling the data 1000 times with replacement. Studentized confidence intervals were constructed with the final outputs being the mean, lower bound and upper bound of the 95% bootstrap confidence interval.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10-4"><title>Identifying cue-inhibited vlPAG neurons</title><p>All 245 neurons were screened for inhibitory firing during the first or last 5 s of danger and uncertainty cue presentation. This was achieved using a paired, two-tailed t-test comparing raw firing rate (spikes/s) during the 10 s baseline period just prior to cue onset with firing during the first or last, 5 s of cue presentation (p&lt;0.0125; Bonferroni corrected for six comparisons). Safety-responsive neurons were excluded because few neurons showed significant decreases in firing to safety.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10-5"><title>Z-Score normalization</title><p>For each neuron, and for each trial, firing rate (spikes/s) was calculated in 250 ms bins from 20 s prior to cue onset to 20 s following cue offset, for a total of 200 bins. Differential firing was calculated for each bin (n = 200) by subtracting mean baseline firing rate (2 s prior to cue onset) on that trial. Differential firing for each single-unit was Z-score normalized across all trials such that mean firing = 0, and standard deviation in firing = 1. Z-score normalization was applied to firing across all 200 bins, as opposed to only the bins prior to cue onset, in case neurons showed little/no baseline activity. Z-score normalized firing was analyzed with ANOVA using bin and trial-type as factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A&amp;C</xref>). F and p values are reported, as well as partial eta squared and observed power.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10-6"><title>Identifying flip and sustain neurons</title><p>Normalized firing (Z-score) of each cue-inhibited neuron was averaged over the first (early) and last (late) 5 s of danger cue presentation. K-mean’s clustering (k = 2) applied to early and late firing of all danger-inhibited neurons (n = 95) revealed two clusters of approximately equal size. Neuron identity screening at this stage revealed four neurons previously analyzed in a separate manuscript. These neurons were removed and did not undergo further analyses. This manuscript considers 91 cue-inhibited neurons for analysis: Flip neurons (n = 45), which were inhibited early but excited late, and Sustain neurons (n = 46), which maintained inhibition throughout danger cue presentation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10-7"><title>Waveform analyses</title><p>Baseline firing rate, half duration and amplitude ratio of the mean waveform were determined for each Flip and Sustain neuron. Baseline firing rate (spikes/s) was calculated using the 10 s baseline period just prior to cue presentation. Half duration was determined by measuring the time (ms) from peak depolarization to the trough of after-hyperpolarization and dividing by 2. Amplitude ratio was calculated using (n – p) / (n + p), where p = initial hyperpolarization (in mV) and n = maximal depolarization (in mV).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10-8"><title>Population firing analyses</title><p>Flip and Sustain population firing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) were analyzed using analysis of variance (ANOVA) with trial type and bin (250 ms) as factors. ANOVA for normalized firing contained three trial types: danger, uncertainty and safety. Uncertainty trial types were collapsed because they did not differ for either suppression ratio or firing analysis. This was expected; during cue presentation rats did not know the current uncertainty trial type. F statistic, p value, observed power and partial eta squared are reported for effects and interactions. Bootstrap confidence intervals were performed for mean normalized firing to danger vs. uncertainty and uncertainty vs. safety during the first (early) and last (late) five seconds of cue presentation. Biases in single-unit firing to the three cues during the first and last 5 s (early or late) of cue presentation were determined using a sign test [p(s)] comparing normalized firing to danger vs. uncertainty and uncertainty vs. safety. The linear relationship between each cue firing comparison was determined using Pearson’s correlation coefficient (R<sup>2</sup>); associated p values for each comparison are also reported.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10-9"><title>Single-unit linear regression</title><p>Single-unit linear regression was used to determine the degree to which fear output and threat probability explained trial-by-trial variation in single-unit firing during specific 1 s cue intervals. The 32 trials composing a single session were ordered by trial type and Z-score normalized firing was specified for each trial and interval. The fear output regressor was the mean suppression ratio for the entire 10 s cue for the specific trial. The probability regressor was the foot shock probability associated with each cue (danger = 1.00, uncertainty = 0.375, safety = 0.00). The regression output of greatest interest is the beta coefficient (β) for each regressor (fear output and threat probability), which quantifies the strength (greater distance from zero = stronger) and direction (&gt;0 = positive,&lt;0 = negative) of the predictive relationship between each regressor and single-unit firing. ANOVA, bootstrap confidence intervals, sign test and Pearson’s correlation coefficient were all used to analyze beta coefficients for Z-score normalized firing.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10-10"><title>Threat probability tuning curve</title><p>Nine separate regression analyses were performed as above. Only now, the value assigned to the uncertainty component of the threat probability regressor was systematically increased from 0 to 1 in 0.125 steps (0.000, 0.125, 0.250, 0.375, 0.500, 0.625, 0.750, 0.875 and 1.000). The first regression used the value of 0.000, second regression 0.125 and so on. Regression was performed for each 1 s interval of the 10 s cue. Beta coefficients for the first 5 s of cue and the last 5 s of cue were averaged to produce early and late threat tuning curves.</p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Dr. Hiram Brownell for statistical advice on linear regression, Dr. Donald B Katz for guidance on electrode construction, Dr. Thomas Stalnaker for guidance on waveform analysis, and Blake Zimmerman for guidance on Matlab scripts. Perceptually uniform colour-maps are used in this study to prevent visual distortion of the data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Crameri, 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Crameri, 2018b</xref>).</p></ack><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Visualization, Writing—original draft, Writing—review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Resources, Writing—review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Data curation, Constructed elctrodes used for recording, Made auditory devices used for cue presentation, Performed all post-operative care for rats, Assisted in training rats, Assisted with histology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing—original draft, Project administration, Writing—review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Animal experimentation: This study was performed in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Laura Colgin as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Laura Bradfield (Reviewer #1); Satoshi Ikemoto (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript follows on from prior work showing that vlPAG neurons do not simply signal fear output, as is the dominant current theory of vlPAG function, but that they better reflect threat probability. The current manuscript builds on these findings in a detailed and elegant manner, demonstrating that the firing patterns of neuronal populations within vlPAG are in fact, heterogeneous, and that a subpopulation of neurons show early inhibition to a danger cue, but that this response becomes excitation throughout the 10 s of cue presentation. This pattern of firing was concluded to reflect threat timing. By contrast, an second population of about the same size, sustained their inhibitory firing throughout the cue signal, and this firing was greatest for the danger signal, then for the uncertainty signal, and was not present for the safety signal. The pattern of firing for this population was revealed to better reflect fear output than threat probability, and the implications of this for current theories of fear conditioning are discussed.</p><p>Overall the reviewers found this article to be excellent. The findings are novel and exciting, the methodologies employed were solid, and the discussion of the results was thoughtful and insightful. There was only one more major comment regarding statistical analysis that we would like the authors to address in a revised version of the manuscript.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers had a concern regarding the statistical analyses. Specifically, the authors sometimes violate statistical conventions in analyzing the data. If the authors choose to violate conventions, they must justify them.</p><p>Results, second paragraph and subsection “Flip and Sustain populations show differential cue firing”: Conduct posthoc tests, instead of t-tests, after a significant main effect of the ANOVAs on trial type. t-Tests do not account for family-wise errors.</p><p>Figure 4F legend: Bonferroni correction was performed for 14 t-tests. However, for Figure 4A, it should be done in 28 t-tests, which include both regressors. For Figure 4D, t-tests should not be performed separately between the regressors for each 1-s bin, because the ANOVA indicates just a main significant effect on interval without interaction between interval and regressor. Having that said, there appear to be difference between the regressors during the post cue period, suggesting that insufficient power to detect such interaction with the ANOVA. The authors may want to consider performing three ANOVAs: one for baseline, one during the cue, and one after cue.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.50054.013</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers had a concern regarding the statistical analyses.

As data were analyzed using SPSS, posthoc options were not available due to the lack of between subject comparisons. In place of all t-tests, we now use bootstrapping to construct 95% confidence intervals for each of the instances mentioned above. Confidence intervals allow us to make between-cue comparisons without assuming a normal distribution and also help circumvent the problem of multiple comparisons.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 4F legend: Bonferroni correction was performed for 14 t-tests.

We feel this provides a clearer demonstration of the overall pattern, which is supported by the scatter plots in Figure 4. As suggested, we have adjusted our ANOVA approach and performed three ANOVAs for baseline, cue and post-cue periods. Due to this new approach, we are able to detect the post-cue main effect of regressor for Sustain neurons.</p></body></sub-article></article>
