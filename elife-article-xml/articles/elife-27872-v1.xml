Yet, how learning triggers this process to form memory is unclear. Translin/trax is a candidate to drive this learning-induced memory mechanism by suppressing microRNA-mediated translational silencing at activated synapses. We find that mice lacking translin/trax display defects in synaptic tagging, which requires protein synthesis at activated synapses, and long-term memory. Hippocampal samples harvested from these mice following learning show increases in several disease-related microRNAs targeting the activin A receptor type 1C (ACVR1C), a component of the transforming growth factor-β receptor superfamily. Furthermore, the absence of translin/trax abolishes synaptic upregulation of ACVR1C protein after learning. Finally, synaptic tagging and long-term memory deficits in mice lacking translin/trax are mimicked by ACVR1C inhibition. Thus, we define a new memory mechanism by which learning reverses microRNA-mediated silencing of the novel plasticity protein ACVR1C via translin/trax.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>RNA-binding protein</kwd><kwd>translin/trax</kwd><kwd>synaptic tagging</kwd><kwd>activin receptor</kwd><kwd>miRNA</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>The Kwanjeong Educational Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Graduate Student Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Park</surname><given-names>Alan Jung</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003246</institution-id><institution>Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Postdoctoral Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Havekes</surname><given-names>Robbert</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MH087463</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Abel</surname><given-names>Ted</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DA-000266</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Baraban</surname><given-names>Jay</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Brush Family Chair of Biology at the University of Pennsylvania</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Faculty Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Abel</surname><given-names>Ted</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Roy J.

Deficits in this process are thought to play a prominent role in neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Liu-Yesucevitz et al., 2011</xref>). Therefore, identification of the molecular pathways linking synaptic activation to local translation of key plasticity proteins is a top priority as it promises to yield valuable insights into the etiology of and treatment for these debilitating disorders.</p><p>Neuronal stimulation can trigger rapid translation of plasticity transcripts by reversing microRNA-mediated translational silencing. For example, pharmacological activation of cultured neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Huang et al., 2012</xref>) and electrical stimulation of the perforant pathway of rodents in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Joilin et al., 2014</xref>) elicit rapid suppression of microRNA-mediated translational silencing. In the amygdala, fear conditioning induces microRNA level changes to form fear memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Griggs et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, synaptic stimuli and learning may drive the translation of plasticity transcripts by reversing microRNA-mediated silencing. However, the mechanism linking synaptic stimulation or learning to microRNA-mediated expression of key plasticity proteins remains elusive.</p><p>One candidate for mediating this mechanism is a protein complex composed of translin and its partner protein translin-associated factor X (trax), a catalytic subunit with endoRNase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Finkenstadt et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Liu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Tian et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ye et al., 2011</xref>). In this complex, two homomeric translin dimers and two heteromeric translin/trax dimers form a hetero-octomer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Tian et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ye et al., 2011</xref>). Translin/trax is brain enriched (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Han et al., 1995a</xref>) and translocates to dendrites in response to neuronal stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Han et al., 1995b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wu et al., 2011</xref>). Initially, the RNase activity of translin/trax was not appreciated and, hence, it was thought to function as an RNA-binding protein complex involved in RNA trafficking. However, following recognition of its catalytic activity, recent studies have revealed that transln/trax suppresses microRNA-mediated translational silencing by degrading microRNAs in non-neuronal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Asada et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, translin/trax is ideally positioned to link synaptic activity to the synthesis of plasticity proteins at activated synapses.</p><p>To evaluate the role of translin/trax in synaptic plasticity and memory formation, we utilized translin knockout (KO) mice in this study. As trax protein is unstable in the absence of translin, translin KO mice are completely devoid of both proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chennathukuzhi et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yang et al., 2004</xref>). Previous behavioral characterization of these mice has revealed that they have intact long-term spatial and contextual memory assessed by the water maze and fear conditioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Stein et al., 2006</xref>). However, behaviors from such aversive tasks need careful interpretation as translin KO mice display reduced anxiety-related behavior in addition to developmental adaptations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chennathukuzhi et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Stein et al., 2006</xref>). Therefore, designing experiments to assess memory formation in translin KO mice should account for their developmental as well as baseline alterations.</p><p>Prior studies have not examined the synaptic function of translin/trax. To investigate the role of translin/trax in synaptic control of plasticity-related protein synthesis, we employed a synaptic tagging paradigm in which transient potentiation in one pathway becomes persistent in response to strong stimulation in a separate pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Frey and Morris, 1997</xref>). This form of heterosynaptic plasticity is ideal to evaluate the synaptic function of translin/trax as it requires the synthesis of plasticity proteins at synapses that are tagged by synaptic stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Redondo and Morris, 2011</xref>). Moreover, in addition to examining heterosynaptic interactions between the two pathways, this synaptic tagging paradigm also allows us to assess conventional homosynaptic plasticity in each pathway. Because the identity of key plasticity proteins critical for synaptic tagging remains elusive, establishing the mechanism by which translin/trax mediates the synthesis of key plasticity proteins required for persistent synaptic plasticity will significantly advance our knowledge of this important process.</p><p>Here, given that translin KO mice display normal behavior in the open field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Stein et al., 2006</xref>), we investigated the role of the translin/trax in long-term memory using an open field-based object-location task. Also, viral reinstatement of translin/trax in the hippocampus of adult translin KO mice confirmed that the observed phenotypes were not due to non-specific effects of constitutive deletion of translin/trax. This ‘rescue’ experiment further allows us to conclude that translin/trax acts within the hippocampus to mediate synaptic tagging and long-term object memory. Finally, the search for targets of the microRNAs regulated by translin/trax after learning identified the novel plasticity protein ACVR1C, which is critical for persistent synaptic plasticity and long-term memory formation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Translin/trax is required for synaptic tagging and long-term object location memory</title><p>We first investigated whether the lack of translin/trax impacts synaptic plasticity using a synaptic tagging paradigm.

Associative memory can be investigated using a hippocampus-dependent long-term object-location memory task, in which mice learn and remember the location of each object relative to external cues or other objects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Oliveira et al., 2010</xref>). If the spatial location of each object is properly encoded during training, mice identify the displaced object during testing 24 hr after training, showing increased preference of what is perceived as a spatially novel stimulus. This task involves initial exposure to an open field (context) and then subsequent exposure to objects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>), experiences that potentially mirror the independent synaptic inputs that are integrated in synaptic tagging. Mice were trained and the preference for the displaced object 24 hr after training was compared between WT and translin KO mice. Compared to WT littermates, preference for the displaced object was significantly reduced in translin KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>; WT: 52.3 ± 1.8%, n = 9; KO: 42.6 ± 2.4%). However, 1 hr short-term memory was unaffected in translin KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>; WT: 44.4 ± 1.5%; KO: 41.5 ± 4%), suggesting that translin KO mice are able to acquire relevant information, but have deficits in memory consolidation. In line with previous findings that translin KO mice exhibit unaltered exploratory behavior in an open field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Stein et al., 2006</xref>), the total object exploration time during training and testing did not differ across groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).

This suggests that translin/trax may elicit degradation of microRNAs in response to specific stimuli. To define learning-induced targets of translin/trax, we determined whether translin KO mice display altered hippocampal microRNA levels after object location memory training. A microRNA PCR array (MIMM-107ZE-1, Qiagen), which includes 84 microRNAs implicated in nervous system development or disease, was used to probe for dysregulated microRNAs, and the candidate microRNAs were verified with real-time RT-PCR (see Methods). Compared to WT littermates, translin KO mice show significant increases in the levels of let-7c-5p, miR-125b-5p, miR-128–3p, and miR-9–3p in the hippocampus 30 min following training. Surprisingly, however, there was no difference across candidate microRNAs between translin KO mice and WT littermates kept under homecage conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). These microRNAs are brain enriched and implicated in neuropsychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia, Alzheimer's Disease and anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Edbauer et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lukiw, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Muiños-Gimeno et al., 2009</xref>). In contrast, miR-409–3p was not a learning specific target of translin/trax as its levels in the hippocampus were increased in translin KO mice both after training and in home cage conditions (p=0.00009 and p=0.03, respectively; data not shown).

Because the lack of translin/trax specifically impairs heterosynaptic strengthening of pathway S2, SB431542 treatment was started after pathway S1 was potentiated. We found that SB431542 did not alter long-lasting potentiation in pathway S1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A1</xref>), but blocked heterosynaptic strengthening of pathway S2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A2</xref>) in hippocampal slices from WT mice. Consistent with previous findings that activin signaling is not required for basal synaptic transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ageta et al., 2010</xref>), SB431542 treatment did not alter baseline synaptic responses in pathway S2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A2</xref>).

Compared to WT littermates, preference for the displaced object was significantly reduced in translin KO mice injected with eGFP virus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F2</xref>). The viral restoration of translin/trax levels in adult excitatory neurons in the hippocampus rescued the memory deficits in KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F2</xref>). The lack of an effect of eGFP expression on the behavior of WT mice indicates that viral infection was not responsible for the observed rescue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F2</xref>). The total object exploration time during training and testing did not differ across groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B</xref>; WT: 2.9 ± 0.3 s, KO<sub>translin</sub>: 3.1 ± 0.6 s, KO<sub>eGFP</sub>: 2.7 ± 0.2 s, WT<sub>eGFP</sub>: 3.1 ± 0.4 s). In contrast to previous findings that male KO mice show increased escape latency during trainings for the water maze task while female KO mice display enhanced freezing during fear memory testing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Stein et al., 2006</xref>), no difference was observed between male and female during object location memory task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>). Therefore, the function of translin/trax in adult excitatory neurons is critical for heterosynaptic strengthening of short-lived potentiation and long-term memory formation. Moreover, this viral reinstatement approach confirms that the observed deficits were not due to compensatory developmental changes caused by constitutive deletion of the translin gene.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Here, we investigated how translin/trax mediates learning-induced de novo synthesis of plasticity proteins that are critical for persistent synaptic plasticity and memory. Unlike conventional studies focusing on basal genetic alterations leading to defective phenotypes, we found that mice lacking translin/trax display increased levels of several microRNAs following learning, not at baseline. These microRNAs suppress the expression of the activin receptor ACVR1C, and the lack of translin/trax abolishes learning-induced synaptic upregulation of ACVR1C. Finally, inhibition of ACVR1C after synaptic stimulation or learning phenocopies the defects in synaptic plasticity or memory displayed by translin KO mice. Taken together, these findings provide compelling evidence for a novel pathway underlying long-term plasticity and memory, in which learning or synaptic stimulation engages translin/trax to reverse silencing of ACVR1C.</p><p>We found that translin KO mice display selective defects in synaptic plasticity and memory. Absence of translin/trax does not impact high frequency stimulation-induced long-lasting potentiation, but does cause selective impairment in heterosynaptic tagging. Behaviorally, although developmental and sex-specific alterations need to be considered, translin KO mice do not exhibit deficits in long-term spatial and contextual memory assessed by the water maze and fear conditioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Stein et al., 2006</xref>). In contrast, we found in this study that both male and female translin KO mice exhibit long-term memory deficits in an object-location task. Furthermore, inhibition of ACVR1C, a target of translin/trax identified in the present study, selectively blocks the maintenance of synaptic tagging and object-location memory. Thus, object-location memory, in which mice integrate information about object identity and spatial location, may depend on the plasticity processes that mediate heterosynaptic plasticity.</p><p>This study is the first to show that ACVR1C is a key plasticity protein that is critical for heterosynaptic strengthening of short-lived plasticity and long-term memory, a finding that fits well with previous studies demonstrating that activin, a ligand for this receptor, plays a critical role in synaptic plasticity and memory. Activin mRNA is upregulated by stimuli that induce long-term potentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Inokuchi et al., 1996</xref>), and activin treatment facilitates short-lived potentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ageta et al., 2010</xref>). Furthermore, activin signaling is required for long-term memory formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ageta et al., 2010</xref>). Interestingly, we find that ACVR1C blockade selectively affects the maintenance of strengthened short-lived plasticity, a finding that distinguishes ACVR1C from other plasticity proteins postulated to be involved in synaptic tagging such as PKMζ and BDNF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barco et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sajikumar et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Yao et al., 2008</xref>). Although recent studies challenge the specificity of ZIP peptide in blocking PKMζ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Volk et al., 2013</xref>), treatment with ZIP impairs maintenance of both long-lasting plasticity and strengthened short-lived plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sajikumar et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tsokas et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Yao et al., 2008</xref>). Additionally, deletion of BDNF blocks both induction and maintenance of strengthened short-lived plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barco et al., 2005</xref>). Overall, our results reveal the translin/trax/ACVR1C pathway as a new critical component of the molecular machinery mediating the maintenance of heterosynaptic plasticity and memory.</p><p>In current models of synaptic tagging, tags mark activated synapses and recruit locally translated proteins induced by strong synaptic input, which produces persistent potentiation of short-lived plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barco et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Park and Abel, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Redondo and Morris, 2011</xref>). Because phosphorylation of translin changes its RNA-binding affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kwon and Hecht, 1993</xref>) and translin binds actin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wu et al., 1999</xref>), it is plausible that synaptic tags could regulate the activity or localization of translin/trax, leading to reversal of translational silencing of ACVR1C at synapses receiving strong input. Indeed, we find that learning increases translin levels in synaptosomes supporting the view that it is recruited to the synapse after learning. Newly expressed ACVR1C could then be captured by tags generated at weakly activated synapses. At present, it is unclear how ACVR1C activation elicits persistent potentiation of weakly activated inputs. However, previous in vitro studies have demonstrated that activin is able to enhance synaptic contacts and spine growth via a process that requires CaMKII, PKA, ERK, and actin dynamics, all of which have been implicated as synaptic tags (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barco et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hasegawa et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Park and Abel, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Redondo and Morris, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Shoji-Kasai et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>We found that translin/trax suppresses certain microRNAs to elicit expression of ACVR1C only after training in a memory task, not at baseline. In other words, baseline levels of these miRNAs or ACVR1C and basal synaptic properties or behavior were unaffected in translin KO mice. Therefore, to avoid affecting baseline molecular pathways and behavior, we employed SB431542, a pharmacological inhibitor of ACVR1C shortly after training or synaptic stimulation. This temporal precision enabled us to demonstrate that ACVR1C inhibition can block maintenance even when applied 30 min following induction. In contrast, the slower time course of miRNA inhibitors or viral-based techniques capable of manipulating expression of ACVR1C would not be able to distinguish between effects on induction or maintenance. Moreover, constitutive inhibition of miR128, one of our target microRNAs, causes hyperactivity and premature death, and genetic mouse models targeting activin signaling showed altered glutamatergic transmission, locomotor activity and anxiety levels at baseline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ageta et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Müller et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tan et al., 2013</xref>). However, it is worth noting that SB431542 also inhibits ALK4 and ALK5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Inman et al., 2002</xref>), receptors closely related to ACVR1C (also known as ALK7), and we cannot rule out the possibility that ALK4 and ALK5 play roles in memory formation. Future investigations including testing of inhibitors that specifically target ACVR1C when they become available would be important to confirm the role of ACVR1C in synaptic tagging and memory.</p><p>In summary, we have demonstrated that synaptic suppression of microRNA-mediated translational silencing is a novel mechanism mediating synaptic plasticity and memory. In doing so, we have identified translin/trax as a key enzyme activating this mechanism after synaptic stimulation and ACVR1C as a key plasticity product induced by reversal of silencing. BDNF also stimulates rapid translation of plasticity transcripts in cultured hippocampal neurons in vitro by suppressing silencing via activation of Lin28a, which targets microRNAs for degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Huang et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, activation of microRNA degrading enzymes may provide a general mechanism for driving translation in response to synaptic stimulation. As defects in the ability of synaptic stimulation to drive protein translation are thought to play a prominent role in neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders, we anticipate that elucidating this mode of translation regulation will yield valuable insights into the pathophysiology of these disorders.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Translin knockout (KO) mice</title><p>Translin KO mice (MGI:2677496) were backcrossed to C57BL/6J (The Jackson Laboratory) for more than 15 generations.

ACVR1C-3’UTR-F2 sense 5’gtatgcatccttccacgtct3’; antisense 5’gatgactgtcttcactaagac3’. These fragments were ligated into pGEM-T easy (Promega) according to the manufacturer's guidelines, and then inserted into a single <italic>NotI</italic> site in frame with the 3' end of luciferase in the psiCHECK-2 reporter plasmid (Promega). Fragment orientation was verified by sequencing. The mouse TRIM71 3’UTR luciferase reporter was purchased from Genecopeia (Rockville, MD).</p><p>An aliquot of HEK 293 cells (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_0045">CVCL_0045</ext-link>) were gifted from the Snyder lab at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, which obtained the cells from ATCC. Although this specific batch was not tested for mycoplasma contamination, there was no evidence of contamination, such as reduced proliferation rate or morphological changes. HEK293 cells were used because they are well-known and widely used for their favorable transfection properties. HEK293 cells grown in 24-well-plates to 70–90% confluence were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Life Sciences) with 150 ng of one of the psiCHECK-2 reporter plasmids along with 2 nM of one of the microRNA mimics (Dharmacon). Control wells received only reporter plasmid. Twenty-four hours later, cells were lysed and luciferase activities were monitored with the Dual-Luciferase assay according to the manufacturer's guidelines (Promega). For miRNA inhibitor experiments LNA-anti-miR128-3p (4101052–002) and LNA-anti-let7c-5p (4100669–002) were purchased from Exiqon.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Data analysis</title><p>Data analyses were performed using Statistica 10 or SPSS V10. The LTP data were analyzed using a repeated-measures ANOVA test on the last 20 min of the initial fEPSP slope values normalized to the average baseline value. To analyze input–output data, a t-test was used to compare the average linear regression slopes between each group. PPF data were analyzed using a two-way repeated-measures ANOVA. For evaluation of biochemical, behavioral, and gene expression data, a t-test or a two-way ANOVA was performed. Dunnett’s post hoc test was performed if applicable. Differences were considered statistically significant when p&lt;0.05. Data were plotted as mean ±S.E.M.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by the Kwanjeong Educational Foundation (to A.P.), Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research NWO-Rubicon Grant 825.07.029 (to R.H.), DA-000266 (to J.B.) and NIH Grant R01 MH087463 (to T.A.).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom, Lisa M Monteggia (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Eve Marder as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The reviewers are all agreed on the merits and significance of the work. However, they also concur that the manuscript requires major re-editing and clarification to avoid the confusion generated by the current organization of the study. Despite the extensive nature of the revision, the reviewers all agreed that the revised manuscript does not necessarily require incorporation of new experiments. Since there are no new experimental requirements please refer to the individual reviews to address the editorial revisions needed.</p><p>Reviewer #1</p><p>In the manuscript titled &quot;Learning induces translin/trax RNAse complex to express activin receptors for persistent memory,&quot; the authors propose that following stimulation which induces heterosynaptic plasticity the translin/trax RNAse complex is trafficked to the post-synapse where it degrades certain miRNAs causing the disinhibition of translation of certain mRNAs. They suggest this disinhibition is necessary for the long term maintenance of heterosynaptic plasticity. Specifically the authors posit that the degradation of miR-128-3p and let-7c-5p to disinhibit the activin receptor ACVR1C is crucial for maintaining heterosynaptic plasticity and behavioral memory in the displaced object test. The data provided by the authors makes a strong case for their hypothesis but there are a few concerns that should be addressed.</p><p>Comments:</p><p>1) The authors should present data if they have it on whether the miRNAs which have altered profiles after training (let-7c-5p, miR-125b-5p, miR-128-3p, and miR-9-3p) can be degraded by translin/trax in vitro. This would significantly strengthen the study.</p><p>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> home cage and after training data should be plotted together and normalized to home cage WT (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) to highlight that the alteration in miRNA level is caused by a decrease in miRNAs in WT after training that is not seen in KO rather than an increase in KO miRNAs above WT levels after training.</p><p>3) Figure 6B2 behavioral data does not seem to replicate <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> data.

The same comment on whether Figure 6B2 (genotype x drug) and 7F2 (genotype x virus) should also be analyzed by two-way ANOVAs.</p><p>5) As a minor note, there appears to be a textual error in paragraph two of subsection “Translin/Trax RNAse complex reverses microRNA silencing of ACVR1C transcript after learning”. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> is a positive control not the ACVR1C fragment with the miR-125b-5p target site.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>This manuscript describes a logical series of experiments demonstrating a role for translin/trax in activity-dependent down-regulation of miRNA (particularly let-7c-5p and miR-128-3p) in a way that upregulates activin receptor 1C. Both translin and ACVR1C were shown to be required for normal synaptic tag and capture (STC)-based LTP and long-term memory for object location. Importantly, deficits in each caused by translin-KO could be rescued by AAV-mediated restoration of translin levels. The demonstration of an activity-dependent reversal of miRNA silencing that is important for plasticity and behaviour is an important step forward for this field.</p><p>The authors have done an excellent job of pulling out a phenotype of the translin-KO mice, as they have previously reported limited effects on water maze learning and no impairment in fear conditioning. The effect here is thus subtle. The mice appear to explore the objects only minimally on the test day (&lt;4 s out of 6 min), and out of that time the displaced object is explored dropped from 52% to 42% in the KO mice. This subtlety was reflected in the electrophysiology where S1 LTP was not affected by the KO or the drug, but priming of S2 LTP was. It would be good to have more discussion as to why translin appears to play no role under stronger learning or LTP protocols. I wasn't particularly convinced, for example, that the object location task was any more analogous to an STC protocol than any of the other behavioural tasks, in that all involve some kind of associative interaction.</p><p>It is curious that translin KO had no effect on home-cage miRNA levels. Please comment on this. More importantly, the authors suggest that after learning, translin mediates a rapid degradation of miRNA. It would be helpful to provide evidence that this actually occurs. Are the levels of any of the tested miRNA reduced compared to home-cage controls in WT mice? Is translin phosphorylated after training in WT mice? Such data would help solidify the concept that translin is activated after training, adding to its increase in synaptosomes which is perhaps less diagnostic.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>In this very interesting study the authors provide outstanding new information on a complex consisting of two RNA binding proteins, translin/trax. Until recently, this protein complex has been implicated in various processes including synaptic plasticity, learning and memory, however, it was not considered as one of the major players in the field. Since a recent publication by one of the authors, Dr. Baraban, in Cell Reports in 2014, there was a change in perception as the protein complex had been implicated as suppressor of miRNA-mediated translational silencing. Consequently, the authors investigate a previously published translin ko mice (also lacking trax due to its own instability) for deficits in synaptic plasticity and long-term memory. Importantly, these ko mice display specific defects in long-term memory and synaptic tagging, a form of heterosynaptic plasticity implicated in memory storage. In a pilot experiment, the authors then identified a few miRNAs that are significantly increased in translin ko mice after training and searched for conserved targets that might be regulated by these three key miRNAs, i.e. let-7c, miR-125b-5p and miR-128-3p. From the short listed targets, the authors identified one promising candidate, coding for activin receptor 1C (ACVR1C, or activin-like kinase 7, ALK7). Luciferase reporter assays then showed that ACVR1C mRNA is indeed regulated by two of these miRNAs. A general ALK inhibitor selectively blocked heterosynaptic strengthening of one pathway (S2) in hippocampal slices from wt mice, but not in translin ko mice. In line with these findings is the finding that the ALK inhibitor impaired long-term novel object location memory (a form of memory that is hippocampus dependent) 24 hours after training in wt but not translin ko mice. Finally, and most impressively, the authors were able to rescue the observed deficits by intrahippocampal re-expression of translin via AAV.</p><p>In my opinion, the authors not only substantiate the new molecular function of translin/trax as a miRNase, but provide stunning new data for the in vivo role of the complex in specific forms of synaptic plasticity and learning and memory. Before this important, original and timely study can be published, there is serious effort needed to bring this quite unusual manuscript in a form that suits the standard for a major journal. Given the fact that most authors have left their laboratories at the time of the study and the often-incoherent red line, I have the impression that this manuscript has been in the peer review process since a long time having suffered major (inconsistent) revisions. I would strongly encourage the authors to give proper background information on the existing data: the published translin ko mice, their correct molecular, behavioral and electrophysiological phenotype, cite key papers from the authors' labs (Stein 2006), explain the observed female versus male differences and how this is consistent with the new study, changes in the interpretation of the function of the translin/trax complex over the last 18 years or so, define better what the authors mean by the &quot;translin/trax RNase complex&quot; and what does this precisely mean molecularly. Accordingly, I would suggest to redo and extend the Introduction. Moreover, the Results section is inadequate in terms of guiding the reader through the experiments and key experiments have to be properly explained in the text (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, what is actually shown here? Include size markers. Label the visible bands and symbols; indicate <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> as qPCR experiment in the text, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>: how was the miRNA screening performed?), and figure legends are insufficient, sometimes misleading, and not properly written as they interpret the data instead of explain the techniques/methods.</p><p>There are key experimental issues that must be fixed before publication. First, two miRNAs (let-7, miRNA 128) are essential for this story (see above), but why have the authors chosen miR-409 for the miRNA cleavage assays in vitro, although it is not relevant at all in this context? Second, another crucial experiment is shown in synaptoneurosomes in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>. Throughout the manuscript, the authors carefully distinguish between short-term and long-term plastic effects, but why did they decide to investigate translin protein levels after 30 min of learning (= short-term). Shouldn't be there only an effect after 24h, but NOT after only 30 min, as demonstrated in all the other experiments (no effect after 1 hour)? These fractionations should be performed after at least 1h post-training. Third, the authors must investigate and comment on whether the other members of the activin receptor (ALK4, ALK5) are possibly regulated by the same set of miRNAs than ALK7, as the inhibitor is less potent for ALK7 than for the other ALK members. Have the authors checked the expression levels of ALK4 and 5 in the hippocampus? Forth, in their rescue experiment presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> F2, are the levels for the three key miRNAs back to normal levels in trained animals? Finally, the Abstract is not doing justice to the outstanding data presented but contain more speculation than own data.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27872.018</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1</p><p>In the manuscript titled &quot;Learning induces translin/trax RNAse complex to express activin receptors for persistent memory,&quot; the authors propose that following stimulation which induces heterosynaptic plasticity the translin/trax RNAse complex is trafficked to the post-synapse where it degrades certain miRNAs causing the disinhibition of translation of certain mRNAs.

Furthermore, this study showed that this activity depended on the presence of mismatches in the stem, as removing those abolished cleavages by translin/trax in vitro. Because all four of the microRNAs shown to be elevated following training in translin KO mice contain similar or more extensive mismatches in the stem, we feel it is reasonable to assume that pre-microRNAs of let-7c-5p, miR-125b-5p, miR-128-3p, and miR-9-3p can be cleaved by translin/trax in vitro. Accordingly, we have not conducted these studies and do not have in vitro data showing that translin/trax degrades let-7c-5p, miR-125b-5p, miR-128-3p, and miR-9-3p.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> home cage and after training data should be plotted together and normalized to home cage WT (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) to highlight that the alteration in miRNA level is caused by a decrease in miRNAs in WT after training that is not seen in KO rather than an increase in KO miRNAs above WT levels after training.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the advantage of presenting <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> according to the reviewer’s suggestion.

Hence, it would be inappropriate to normalize training data with home cage WT data.

Absence of translin/trax does not impact high frequency stimulation-induced long-lasting potentiation, but does cause selective impairment in heterosynaptic tagging. Behaviorally, although developmental and sex-specific alterations need to be considered, translin KO mice do not exhibit deficits in long-term spatial and contextual memory assessed by the water maze and fear conditioning (Stein et al., 2006). In contrast, we found in this study that both male and female translin KO mice exhibit long-term memory deficits in an object-location task. Furthermore, inhibition of ACVR1C, a target of translin/trax identified in the present study, selectively blocks the maintenance of synaptic tagging and object-location memory. Thus, object-location memory, in which mice integrate information about object identity and spatial location, may depend on the plasticity processes that mediate heterosynaptic plasticity”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is curious that translin KO had no effect on home-cage miRNA levels. Please comment on this.</p></disp-quote><p>This is one of the most interesting findings of the present study. Our working model posits that training activates translin/trax to degrade selected miRNAs, so translin KO mice display elevations in these miRNAs relative to WT mice following training. However, under baseline conditions, translin/trax is inactive, so levels of these miRNAs are unchanged between WT and KO mice. We have emphasized this point at appropriate places in the manuscript. We also added a statement in the first paragraph of the Discussion: “Unlike conventional studies focusing on basal genetic alterations leading to defective phenotypes, we found that mice lacking translin/trax display increased levels of several microRNAs following learning, not at baseline”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>More importantly, the authors suggest that after learning, translin mediates a rapid degradation of miRNA. It would be helpful to provide evidence that this actually occurs. Are the levels of any of the tested miRNA reduced compared to home-cage controls in WT mice?</p></disp-quote><p>Please refer to our response to the reviewer 1 comment 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Is translin phosphorylated after training in WT mice? Such data would help solidify the concept that translin is activated after training, adding to its increase in synaptosomes which is perhaps less diagnostic.</p></disp-quote><p>At present, the mechanism mediating the activation of translin/trax RNase activity is not known. Certainly, phosphorylation is a leading possibility and will be the subject of future investigations once phospho-translin antibodies become available.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>In this very interesting study the authors provide outstanding new information on a complex consisting of two RNA binding proteins, translin/trax. Until recently, this protein complex has been implicated in various processes including synaptic plasticity, learning and memory, however, it was not considered as one of the major players in the field. Since a recent publication by one of the authors, Dr. Baraban, in Cell Reports in 2014, there was a change in perception as the protein complex had been implicated as suppressor of miRNA-mediated translational silencing. Consequently, the authors investigate a previously published translin ko mice (also lacking trax due to its own instability) for deficits in synaptic plasticity and long-term memory. Importantly, these ko mice display specific defects in long-term memory and synaptic tagging, a form of heterosynaptic plasticity implicated in memory storage. In a pilot experiment, the authors then identified a few miRNAs that are significantly increased in translin ko mice after training and searched for conserved targets that might be regulated by these three key miRNAs, i.e. let-7c, miR-125b-5p and miR-128-3p. From the short listed targets, the authors identified one promising candidate, coding for activin receptor 1C (ACVR1C, or activin-like kinase 7, ALK7). Luciferase reporter assays then showed that ACVR1C mRNA is indeed regulated by two of these miRNAs. A general ALK inhibitor selectively blocked heterosynaptic strengthening of one pathway (S2) in hippocampal slices from wt mice, but not in translin ko mice. In line with these findings is the finding that the ALK inhibitor impaired long-term novel object location memory (a form of memory that is hippocampus dependent) 24 hours after training in wt but not translin ko mice. Finally, and most impressively, the authors were able to rescue the observed deficits by intrahippocampal re-expression of translin via AAV.</p><p>In my opinion, the authors not only substantiate the new molecular function of translin/trax as a miRNase, but provide stunning new data for the in vivo role of the complex in specific forms of synaptic plasticity and learning and memory. Before this important, original and timely study can be published, there is serious effort needed to bring this quite unusual manuscript in a form that suits the standard for a major journal. Given the fact that most authors have left their laboratories at the time of the study and the often-incoherent red line, I have the impression that this manuscript has been in the peer review process since a long time having suffered major (inconsistent) revisions. I would strongly encourage the authors to give proper background information on the existing data: the published translin ko mice, their correct molecular, behavioral and electrophysiological phenotype, cite key papers from the authors' labs (Stein 2006), explain the observed female versus male differences and how this is consistent with the new study, changes in the interpretation of the function of the translin/trax complex over the last 18 years or so, define better what the authors mean by the &quot;translin/trax RNase complex&quot; and what does this precisely mean molecularly. Accordingly, I would suggest to redo and extend the Introduction. Moreover, the Results section is inadequate in terms of guiding the reader through the experiments and key experiments have to be properly explained in the text (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, what is actually shown here? Include size markers. Label the visible bands and symbols; indicate <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> as qPCR experiment in the text, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>: how was the miRNA screening performed?), and figure legends are insufficient, sometimes misleading, and not properly written as they interpret the data instead of explain the techniques/methods.</p></disp-quote><p>We have revised the manuscript as suggested. In particular, we have expanded the Introduction to include additional background on the phenotypes observed previously in these mice, the advances our study made in our understanding the function of the translin/trax, and a detailed description of the molecular composition of the translin/trax RNase complex. Additional details about these changes are detailed below. The male vs. female differences were described in paragraph two of subsection “Restoration of translin/trax to physiological levels in hippocampal excitatory neurons rescues deficits in synaptic tagging and long-term memory”.</p><p>Regarding <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, we indicated qPCR in the text (paragraph two subsection “Loss of translin/trax alters microRNA levels after learning”) and the legend. For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, more detailed description about the miRNA screening was provided in the Results and in the Materials and methods under “cDNA synthesis and quantitative real-time reverse transcription (RT)-PCR”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There are key experimental issues that must be fixed before publication. First, two miRNAs (let-7, miRNA 128) are essential for this story (see above), but why have the authors chosen miR-409 for the miRNA cleavage assays in vitro, although it is not relevant at all in this context?</p></disp-quote><p>We chose miR-409 to illustrate the RNase activity of translin/trax because both our group and another group (Asada et al., 2014) independently found that the level of miR-409 is elevated in the brain of translin KO mice. As we agree that miR-409 cleavage data are irrelevant to our study, we omitted these data (and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>) from the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Second, another crucial experiment is shown in synaptoneurosomes in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>. Throughout the manuscript, the authors carefully distinguish between short-term and long-term plastic effects, but why did they decide to investigate translin protein levels after 30 min of learning (= short-term). Shouldn't be there only an effect after 24h, but NOT after only 30 min, as demonstrated in all the other experiments (no effect after 1 hour)? These fractionations should be performed after at least 1h post-training.</p></disp-quote><p>Our study indicates that learning induces translin-mediated synaptic expression of activin receptors to produce long-lasting synaptic plasticity and long-term memory. In other words, we focused on a mechanism activated immediately after learning to produce long-term memory, a mechanism independent of that for short-term memory. Indeed, treatment with the activin inhibitor SB431542 immediately after learning impaired long-term memory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>), and translin KO mice display impairments for long-term, not short-term memory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Moreover, delivering SB431542 during or 1-hour after the tagging stimulation impaired synaptic tagging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). These findings suggest that the activin signaling activated within 1-hour after learning is critical for long-term memory formation. Hence, we collected hippocampal tissue samples 30 minutes after learning. We have added “For protein and microRNA assays, hippocampal tissue was collected 30 minutes after the last training session to probe for molecular mechanisms induced by learning to form long-term memory.” in the Materials and methods.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Third, the authors must investigate and comment on whether the other members of the activin receptor (ALK4, ALK5) are possibly regulated by the same set of miRNAs than ALK7, as the inhibitor is less potent for ALK7 than for the other ALK members. Have the authors checked the expression levels of ALK4 and 5 in the hippocampus? Forth, in their rescue experiment presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> F2, are the levels for the three key miRNAs back to normal levels in trained animals?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that these are important points. However, in our experiments we have not yet examined the levels of ALK4 and 5 nor the levels of miRNAs after translin reinstatement. We have discussed the reviewers points as future directions in the fifth paragraph of the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally, the Abstract is not doing justice to the outstanding data presented but contain more speculation than own data.</p></disp-quote><p>We have rewritten the Abstract as suggested.</p></body></sub-article></article>
