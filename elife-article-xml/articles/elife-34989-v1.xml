Viral expression of wild type (exWT) and mutant MORs, where all phosphorylation sites on the C-terminus (Total Phosphorylation Deficient (TPD)) were mutated to alanine, were examined in locus coeruleus neurons in a MOR knockout rat. Both receptors activated potassium conductance similar to endogenous receptors in wild type animals. The exWT receptors, like endogenous receptors, acutely desensitized, internalized and, after chronic morphine treatment, displayed signs of tolerance. However, TPD receptors did not desensitize or internalize with agonist treatment. In addition the TPD receptors did not develop cellular tolerance following chronic morphine treatment. Thus C-terminal phosphorylation is necessary for the expression of acute desensitization, trafficking and one sign of long-term tolerance to morphine at the cellular level.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Desensitization</kwd><kwd>opioid</kwd><kwd>tolerance</kwd><kwd>phosphorylation</kwd><kwd>Locus Coeruleus</kwd><kwd>internalization</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000026</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Drug Abuse</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RO1-DA08163</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Williams</surname><given-names>John T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>It is true that NIDA had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The role of C-terminal phosphorylation is critical for the expression of acute desensitization, trafficking and long-term tolerance to morphine.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Considerable effort has been aimed at characterizing the mechanisms that underlie acute µ-opioid receptor (MOR) dependent desensitization and cellular tolerance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Williams et al., 2013</xref>). One key step thought to be important in these processes is the phosphorylation of sites on the cytoplasmic loops and C-terminal tail following receptor activation. There are 11 possible phosphorylation sites on the C-terminal tail of the MOR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Two specific cassettes, amino acid residues 354 to 357 (TSST) and 375 to 379 (STANT), are phosphorylated following application of agonists that induce desensitization and internalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Lau et al., 2011</xref>). Point mutations of serine (S) and threonine (T) residues in the STANT sequence resulted in a decrease in agonist induced arrestin recruitment and internalization, but did not eliminate the induction of acute desensitization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Lau et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Birdsong et al., 2015</xref>). Complete alanine mutation of both the TSST and STANT sequences significantly reduced, but did not completely eliminate acute desensitization. Although the TSST and STANT sequences are known to be agonist-dependent phosphorylation sites, there are four other serine and threonine sites on the C-terminus that are either phosphorylated constitutively or by agonist dependent kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Williams et al., 2013</xref>). It is not known if phosphorylation of these sites alters the regulation of MORs.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34989.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Schematic illustrates the phosphorylation sites (in yellow) that were mutated to alanine for the TPD receptor.</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-34989-fig1-v1"/></fig><p>The present study investigated the role of C-terminus MOR phosphorylation on acute signaling, desensitization, internalization and cellular tolerance in rats. The desensitization of MOR in rat locus coeruleus neurons measured using the activation of potassium (GIRK) conductance has been studied extensively in wild type animals. In order to study wild type and mutant MORs, a MOR-knockout rat model was used and MORs were virally expressed. Two versions of MOR were expressed, wild-type (exWT) and total phosphorylation deficient receptors (TPD) where all 11 possible phosphorylation sites on the C-terminus were mutated to alanine. By linking green fluorescence protein (GFP) to the N-terminus of the MOR the trafficking of expressed receptors was examined. Plasma membrane associated receptors were selectively labeled with the use of a fluorescently tagged antiGFP nanobody. The results show that both receptors activate a potassium current that hyperpolarizes the cells. There was no significant difference in the kinetics of activation between WT, exWT, and TPDs. Thus acute activation of virally expressed MORs was not significantly different from endogenous receptors. There was however a near complete loss of desensitization, internalization, and long-term tolerance in neurons expressing TPD receptors. This study demonstrates a key role of phosphorylation in the both acute- and long-term actions of opioids on the activation of potassium conductance on single neurons.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>MOR knockout</title><p>Recordings from LC neurons in brain slices from the MOR knockout animal confirmed that there was no opioid–induced current or hyperpolarization.

Often times the expression was not the same on both sides of the preparation. The application of [Met<sup>5</sup>]enkephalin (ME, 300 nM, an EC50 concentration in slices from wild type animals) was used as an estimate of the level of receptor expression. In preparations from wild type rats ME (300 nM) results in an outward current between 100 and 250 pA or 10–20 mV hyperpolarization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Quillinan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Levitt and Williams, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dang and Williams, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fiorillo and Williams, 1996</xref>).

The rate of activation (10–90%, exWT 255 ± 35 ms, n = 10, TPD 220 ± 32 ms, n = 14, p=0.5, unpaired T-test) and the time to the peak of the outward current (exWT 1.78 ± 0.12 s, n = 12, TPD 1.95 ± 0.18, n = 17, p=0.4, unpaired T-test) were the same between exWT and TPD and similar to those from experiments made from cells expressing wild type receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Williams, 2014</xref>). Likewise the return to baseline following photolysis of the caged antagonist naloxone (CNV-Nal) in the presence of ME (1 µM) was not different in recordings made from the two receptors (exWT 1.57 ± 0.08 s, n = 7, TPD 1.53 ± 0.15, n = 6, p=0.78, unpaired T-test). The decay of the ME current induced by CNV-Nal was thought to result from processes downstream of the receptor, most likely dependent on the sequestration of G protein beta/gamma subunits away from the GIRK channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Banghart et al., 2013</xref>). The time course of current decay induced by high affinity agonists was found to be a better indication of agonist/receptor interaction. Therefore experiments were also done with the high affinity agonist endomorphin-1 (100 nM). The time constant of CNV-Nal-induced inactivation in exWT receptors (4.06 ± 0.41 s, n = 8) was not significantly different from that measured with TPD receptors (5.37 ± 0.59 s, n = 10, p=0.09. unpaired T-test).

The results with the exWT receptors in the knockout animal were similar to those found in wild type animals. The activation kinetics of TPD receptors was also the same as both virally expressed and endogenous WT receptors. This study, measuring the increase in potassium conductance, demonstrates that the elimination of phosphorylation sites along the C-terminal of the MOR largely eliminates acute desensitization and one measure of long-term cellular tolerance to morphine. The results also indicate that with the expression of receptors specifically in the locus coeruleus the development of tolerance is cell autonomous, independent of receptor activation in other areas of the CNS.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Desensitization and internalization</title><p>MOR desensitization and internalization are not closely linked. The strongest evidence is based on experiments using mutation of the STANT sequence. Although mutations in the STANT sequence resulted in a significant decrease in internalization, acute desensitization was little changed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Lau et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Just et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Birdsong et al., 2015</xref>). The conclusion was that acute desensitization precedes internalization and the two processes are mechanistically distinct. The same conclusion was reached in experiments in cultured locus coeruleus neurons from a transgenic mouse that expressed soluble GFP under the control of the tyrosine hydroxylase promotor (TH-GFP). Internalization of the endogenous MORs measured with the use of a fluorescent peptide, dermorphin-Alexa594, was blocked by concanavalin A and yet desensitization and the recovery from desensitization measured electrophysiologically was not changed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arttamangkul et al., 2006</xref>). The sequence beginning at T354 and ending at T357 (TSST) was also efficiently phosphorylated following the application of potent opioid agonists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Lau et al., 2011</xref>). An alanine-mutant of C-terminal phosphorylation sites excluding TSST and T394 (6S/T-A sites) prevented receptor endocytosis while desensitization remained unchanged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Yousuf et al., 2015</xref>). It was not until the TSST sequence along with the STANT sequence or all phosphosites on the C terminus were mutated to alanine that there was a large decrease in the degree of acute desensitization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Birdsong et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Yousuf et al., 2015</xref>). Similar results were shown in this study with viral expressed TPD in MOR knockout rats. Thus it is clear that although acute desensitization and internalization of MOR are dependent on phosphorylation, the two processes involve mechanisms that can be distinguished by the degree of phosphorylation of the C-terminal tail.</p><p>The heterologous desensitization induced by muscarinic receptor activation was not blocked after mutations of C-terminal phosphorylation sites. Activation of muscarinic receptors can increase PKC activity that is thought to underlie heterologous desensitization of MORs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bailey et al., 2004</xref>). The decrease in opioid current induced by muscarine in slices expressing the TPD was similar to results obtained in slices from wild type animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Shen and North, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fiorillo and Williams, 1996</xref>). The results may be interpreted in two ways. One is that the facilitation of MOR desensitization by PKC results from phosphorylation of intracellular loops of MOR and not in the C-terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2013</xref>). It is also possible that phosphorylation of other signaling proteins results in the inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chu et al., 2010</xref>). Activation of muscarinic receptors has been shown to alter the trafficking of MORs heterologously expressed in HEK293 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Lopez-Gimenez et al., 2017</xref>), however there was no change in internalization of FLAG-MORs in the mouse locus coeruleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arttamangkul et al., 2015</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Is the TPD a G protein biased receptor?</title><p>Depending on the agonist, MORs can activate differential downstream processes. A number of biased agonists have been described recently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Siuda et al., 2017</xref>). G protein biased agonists have reduced ability to recruit arrestin while maintaining signaling through G proteins. Mutations in the C-terminus of MORs have a significant impact on arrestin signaling. Mutations of even one phosphorylation site at S375 and/or the STANT sequence in the C-terminus resulted in a significant reduction in the association with arrestin and the induction of internalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Lau et al., 2011</xref>). The STANT mutant MOR was functional as measured by adenylyl cyclase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Lau et al., 2011</xref>) and activation of potassium conductance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Birdsong et al., 2015</xref>) assays. Mutations of all phosphorylation sites on the C-terminus (TPD) eliminated endocytosis induced by highly efficacious agonists such as DAMGO, etonitazene and fentanyl in HEK293 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Just et al., 2013</xref>) as well as ME in LC neurons (present study). Given these observations, the TPD receptor could be considered to function almost exclusively through a G protein-dependent process.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Cellular tolerance and homeostatic mechanisms</title><p>One robust measure of tolerance in the LC is a decrease in the recovery from acute desensitization in slices from morphine treated animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dang and Williams, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Quillinan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Levitt and Williams, 2012</xref>). In experiments from slices expressing TPD receptors, chronic morphine treatment had no effect. There are two possible conclusions that follow this observation. First, the near complete block of desensitization alone reduced tolerance. This however requires further investigation using a longer duration of morphine treatment. It is possible that tolerance may develop slower. It is also possible that compensatory homeostatic mechanisms due to continuous signaling may develop from the longer-term chronic treatment. The second conclusion centers on the elimination of internalization. It may be that internalization mediated by the arrestin pathway is a key step in the development of long-term tolerance. Studies using arrestin3-null mice show that cellular tolerance is attenuated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Quillinan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Connor et al., 2015</xref>). This could be the result of MOR trafficking because while the internalization of MORs in these animals was normal, receptor recycling was faster after chronic morphine treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Quillinan et al., 2011</xref>). Interpretation of these studies is difficult given that only one isoform of arrestin was knocked out. Experiments expressing phosphorylation mutants in the C-terminus in the MOR knockout rat could begin to address the role of internalization in the development of cellular tolerance.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Summary</title><p>The present work addresses one mechanism that underlies the development of long-term tolerance to morphine. Phosphorylation of the C-terminal of the MOR has been shown to be a key step in the mechanism of acute desensitization measured with multiple downstream effectors. Elimination of phosphorylation sites on the C-terminal rendered MORs resistant to one cellular measure of long-term tolerance induced by morphine. One conclusion is that desensitization and/or internalization of MORs is necessary for the development of this form of cellular tolerance to opioids. Although there were no obvious change in cellular excitability, it could be that continued signaling through the phosphorylation deficient receptors result in downstream homeostatic mechanisms that counteract the lack of cellular tolerance and may well increase signs of withdrawal.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Drugs</title><p>Morphine sulfate and morphine alkaloid were obtained from the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), Neuroscience Center (Bethesda, MD).

The His-tag was removed by adding thrombin protease (Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO) in to the protein solution at 1:100 (by mass) and incubated at 4°C overnight. The protein was further purified by size-exclusive chromatography (Superdex 200) in Dulbecco’s Phosphate Buffered Saline (Thermo Fisher Scientific, (Waltham, MA). Peak fractions having a single band by SDS-Page (10–20% gradient) electrophoresis were pooled and concentrated to ≈0.6 mg/ml.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Anti-GFP nanobody Alexa594 conjugation</title><p>The site-specific fluorescent labeling of the cysteine-mutated nanobody was modified from previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Pleiner et al., 2015</xref>). A solution containing the nanobody (100 µg) was used for the conjugation reaction. The solution was mixed with tris-(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine 15 mM on ice for 10 min. The buffer was exchanged to labeling buffer using P6 spin-column (BioRad, Hercules, CA). A labeling reaction was started by adding 1.5-fold of Alexa 594 maleimide (2 µl of 5 µg/µl in dimethylsulfoxide). The reaction proceeded on ice for 1 hr. The conjugated nanobody was further purified by Superdex 200 in phosphate buffer. The degree of labeling was determined by measuring OD at 280 and 594 and was close to 1.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>MOR-GFP trafficking</title><p>Brain slices (240 µm) from the virally injected rats were prepared as previously described. Slices were visualized with an Olympus Macroview fluorescent microscope for GFP expression in the LC area and then incubated in a solution of anti-GFP nanobody Alexa594 (Nb-A594, 10 µg/mL, 30–45 min). Images were captured with an upright microscope (Olympus, Center Valley, PA.) equipped with a custom-built two-photon apparatus and a 60x water immersion lens (Olympus LUMFI, NA1.1, Center Valley, PA). The dye was excited at 810 nm. Data were acquired and collected using Scan Image Software ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Pologruto et al., 2003</xref>]. Images were taken at a magnification where a single neuron filled the field of view. A z-series of 15–20 sections was collected at 1 µm intervals. With this protocol, the whole neuron was qualitatively compared. Drugs were applied by perfusion at the rate of 1.5 ml/min. All experiments were done at 35 ˚C. The area of interest was obtained by manually drawing a line along the plasma membrane. A subset of 5 sections from the z-series was selected before and after ME application. The stacks were summed using Image J z-projection and the fluorescence within the area of the plasma membrane was measured. Internalization was calculated as the difference in cytoplasmic fluorescence before (C) and after ME application (D) and normalized to fluorescence before ME (% internalization = (D-C/C)x100).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Data Analysis</title><p>Analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism four software (La Jolla, CA). Values are presented as mean ± SEM. Statistical comparisons were made using T-test or two-way ANOVA, as appropriate. Comparisons with p&lt;0.05 were considered significant.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by NIH funding DA08163 (JTW).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Eve Marder as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Ken Mackie (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission..</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This study presents new data on the role of phosphorylation of the C-terminal tail of the mu opioid receptor (MOR) to receptor activation/inhibition kinetics, desensitization, internalization, and tolerance. The model system is the MOR knockout rat with viral reconstitution of wild-type MOR or a mutant in which all 11 C-terminal phosphorylation sites are mutated. Particularly attractive features of the study include expressing in the MOR null background, careful kinetic analysis of the expressed receptor signaling, examination of both hyperpolarization and outward currents, the nano-body imaging of MOR internalization in live slices and complementing bath application of agonist by flash photolysis release of met-enkephalin. The data indicate that the residues mutated in TPD MOR are responsible for the acute desensitization of GIRK currents to met-enkephalin via MOR and the development of cellular tolerance to MOR. Overall this is a well-done study that advances our understanding of the regulation of MOR signaling and the development of tolerance.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The conclusion that chronic morphine didn't affect MOR TPD signaling was based on the lack of enhancement of desensitization of met-enkephalin signaling in this mutant after chronic morphine treatment. It is important to determine if chronic morphine produced tolerance to met-enkephalin activation of GIRKs. For example, in Quillinan et al., 2011, chronic morphine produced a ~2-fold right shift in the met-enkephalin dose response curve. As 300 nM met-enkephalin is close to the EC50 for this response, the authors should be able to extract from their existing data if chronic morphine suppressed the GIRK response in TPD MOR.</p><p>2) Desensitization was only examined for GIRK current activation for met-enkephalin. Thus, conclusions need to be tempered that desensitization of other pathways and ligands may involve other/additional mechanisms. For example, extensive work from the Chavkin group suggests involvement of both arrestin and JNK in tolerance to various MOR agonists.</p><p>3) The imaging data require quantifying. Information about how often the results were obtained or how robust the internalization/loss of internalization actually is should be provided. Can the authors provide some kind of nominal statement of how representative the images are – in terms of number of fields and experiments?</p><p>4) Group sizes are small in many instances; statistical analyses are either not applied, not reported, inconsistently reported, or inappropriately conducted. The basis for excluding some recordings on the basis of size of the ME-induced response (and how many cells were excluded on this basis) should be provided. Without evaluating the EC50 for ME with reconstituted receptors, it does not seem justified to suggest that any concentration used in this study is saturating or an EC50 dose; the variable application of drugs across experiments (as displayed in figures) seems quite problematic, and there seems to convey that consistency from experiment to experiment was not ensured or the assumption that it is not particularly important.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34989.018</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The conclusion that chronic morphine didn't affect MOR TPD signaling was based on the lack of enhancement of desensitization of met-enkephalin signaling in this mutant after chronic morphine treatment.

The key point is that with the viral expression of receptors there was enough variability between animals that constructing reliable concentration response curves was problematic. Given the small shift in the concentration response curves that have been published in the LC in the past (2-fold) there is little chance that a similar shift would be detectable. The plot shows the current induced by ME (0.3 µM) normalized to the current induced by ME (30 µM). The variability in the current induced by the low concentration of ME (0.3 µM) relative to the high concentration limits the ability to claim tolerance in this way.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref> points out at least one drawback associated with the viral expression of receptors.</p><p>The change in acute desensitization induced by chronic morphine treatment was a robust measure of tolerance induced by chronic morphine treatment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Desensitization was only examined for GIRK current activation for met-enkephalin.

Measures of recovery from desensitization require the use of agonists that wash out of the slice. These experiments are limited to the use of enkephalin.

The problems surrounding the measures of concentration response is a weakness that was unavoidable with the viral expression. It is true that the exact determination of EC50 was not rigorously determined. To carry out multiple concentrations in each recording prior to starting an experiment with each cell is simply not feasible. The plot above shows the variability in the current induced by ME 300 nM relative to the high concentration. The text has been changed to state that the ME 300 nM concentration was chosen because it is the EC50 in wild type animals.</p><p>As with all viral injections there were hits, misses or near misses that resulted in no or very low levels of expression in the LC, particularly since the area of LC is very small. The preparations where expression was predicted to be low based on examination of the fluorescence prior to recording were examined but often not included because the response to the low concentration of ME (300 nM) was small (30 pA or 5 mV). It was pointless to think that a reliable decrease in those responses could be accurately measured following desensitization. In addition, the expression could be great on one side and completely absent on the other side of the LC. No tally of misses versus hits was recorded. The text has been changed to be clear.</p></body></sub-article></article>
