diversity central to understanding the origins of parasitism and non-photosynthetic plastids. We generated single-cell transcriptomes for all major apicomplexan groups lacking large-scale sequence data. Phylogenetic analysis reveals that apicomplexan-like parasites are polyphyletic and their similar morphologies emerged convergently at least three times. Gregarines and eugregarines are monophyletic, against most expectations, and rhytidocystids and <italic>Eleutheroschizon</italic> are sister lineages to medically important taxa. Although previously unrecognized, plastids in deep-branching apicomplexans are common, and they contain some of the most divergent and AT-rich genomes ever found. In eugregarines, however, plastids are either abnormally reduced or absent, thus increasing known plastid losses in eukaryotes from two to four. Environmental sequences of ten novel plastid lineages and structural innovations in plastid proteins confirm that plastids in apicomplexans and their relatives are widespread and share a common, photosynthetic origin.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.49662.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Microscopic parasites known collectively as apicomplexans are responsible for several infectious diseases in humans including malaria and toxoplasmosis. The cells of the malaria parasite and many other apicomplexans contain compartments known as cryptic chloroplasts that produce molecules the parasites need to survive. Cryptic chloroplasts are similar to the chloroplasts found in plant cells, but unlike plants the compartments in apicomplexans are unable to harvest energy from sunlight.</p><p>Since the cells of humans and other animals do not contain chloroplasts, cryptic chloroplasts are a potential target for new drugs to treat diseases caused by apicomplexans. However, it remains unclear how widespread cryptic chloroplasts are in these parasites, largely because few apicomplexans have been successfully grown in the laboratory.</p><p>To address this question, Janouškovec et al. used an approach called single-cell transcriptomics to study ten different apicomplexans. This provided new data about the genetic make-up of each parasite that the team analysed to find out how they are related to one another. The analysis revealed that, unexpectedly, apicomplexan parasites do not share a close common ancestor and are therefore not a natural grouping from an evolutionary perspective. Instead, their similar physical appearances and lifestyles evolved independently on at least three separate occasions.</p><p>Further analysis demonstrated that cryptic chloroplasts are common in apicomplexan parasites, including in lineages where they were not previously known to exist. However, at least three lineages of apicomplexans have independently lost their cryptic chloroplasts.</p><p>The findings of Janouškovec et al. shed new light on the importance of chloroplasts in the evolution of life and may help develop new treatments for diseases caused by apicomplexan parasites. Several drugs targeting the cryptic chloroplasts in malaria parasites are currently in clinical trials, and this work suggests that these drugs may also have the potential to be used against other apicomplexan parasites in the future.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>origin of parasitism</kwd><kwd>non-photosynthetic plastids</kwd><kwd>apicomplexans</kwd><kwd>chrompodellids</kwd><kwd>plastid genomes</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000765</institution-id><institution>University College London</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Excellence Research Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Janouškovec</surname><given-names>Jan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002261</institution-id><institution>Russian Foundation for Basic Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>18-04-00324</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Paskerova</surname><given-names>Gita G</given-names></name><name><surname>Simdyanov</surname><given-names>Timur G</given-names></name><name><surname>Miroliubova</surname><given-names>Tatiana S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100006769</institution-id><institution>Russian Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>18-14-00123</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Aleoshin</surname><given-names>Vladimir V</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004285</institution-id><institution>Saint Petersburg State University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1.42.1099.2016</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Paskerova</surname><given-names>Gita G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004285</institution-id><institution>Saint Petersburg State University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1.42.723.2017</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Paskerova</surname><given-names>Gita G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Apicomplexan-like parasites originated several times independently and many of them contain cryptic plastid organelles, which demonstrate that the parasites evolved from photosynthetic algae.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The phylum Apicomplexa is a major group of protistan parasites important in animal disease globally (we will use the name Apicomplexa hereinafter for the clade of parasites sensu stricto; a synonym of the taxon Sporozoa Leuckart, 1879; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adl et al., 2019</xref>). The group includes the human pathogens <italic>Plasmodium</italic> (haemosporidians), <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> (eucoccidians), <italic>Babesia</italic> (piroplasms), and <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> (cryptosporidians), whose cell biology and genomes have been extensively studied. Conversely, most apicomplexans from invertebrates such as eugregarines, archigregarines, blastogregarines, protococcidians, and agamococcidians lack detailed genomic information, in part because they cannot be cultured in laboratory conditions. Because these uncultured groups are also deep-branching lineages with unresolved relationships to the medically important taxa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Leander and Ramey, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Rueckert et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Simdyanov et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Simdyanov et al., 2017</xref>), the lack of their genomes and cell biology data hinders our understanding of apicomplexan evolution and the origin of parasitism itself. This, in turn, limits insights into infection mechanisms across the group: the structural and molecular make-up of machineries for host cell invasion such as the apical complex, pellicle, and glideosome, and how these relate to parasite life cycles, host preferences, and habitats.</p><p>Apicomplexans are evolutionarily derived from mixotrophic algae, a realization that first came with sequencing a plastid genome in <italic>Plasmodium</italic> and localizing it into a cryptic, non-photosynthetic organelle called ‘the apicoplast’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gardner et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">McFadden et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Wilson et al., 1996</xref>). The apicoplast is a four-membrane plastid (a broader term we will use hereinafter to describe the organelle in both parasitic and free-living organisms), which is derived from a secondary endosymbiont. Where exactly this plastid endosymbiont came from was settled by data from two newly discovered photosynthetic relatives of Apicomplexa, <italic>Chromera velia</italic> and <italic>Vitrella brassicaformis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Janouskovec et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Moore et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Oborník et al., 2012</xref>). The photosynthetic plastids in <italic>Chromera</italic> and <italic>Vitrella</italic> are also surrounded by four membranes and they share conspicuous similarities with both the apicomplexan plastid and the plastid in peridinin-pigmented dinoflagellates, pointing to their common origin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Janouskovec et al., 2010</xref>). <italic>Chromera</italic> and <italic>Vitrella</italic> belong to a monophyletic group, called the chrompodellids, with heterotrophic colpodellids <italic>Alphamonas edax</italic>, <italic>Voromonas pontica</italic>, and '<italic>Colpodella' angusta</italic>, which also retain non-photosynthetic plastids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gile and Slamovits, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Janouškovec et al., 2015</xref>). Plastids are nevertheless absent in <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abrahamsen et al., 2004</xref>), and they have never been recorded in other deep-branching apicomplexans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Toso and Omoto, 2007</xref>). Lack of plastids in these groups once fueled alternative ideas about independent gains of plastids in apicomplexans, dinoflagellates, and even <italic>Chromera</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bodył, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bodył et al., 2009</xref>). However, it also brings into question the metabolic importance of the plastid for the apicomplexan cell and its implications for plastid maintenance and loss in eukaryotes more broadly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cavalier-Smith, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Janouškovec et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Here, we sought to understand the phylogeny and plastid evolution of Apicomplexa by filling in major gaps in their sequence data. We used individual cells of parasites to generate transcriptomes from all major apicomplexan groups that currently lack laboratory cultures and large-scale transcriptomic or genomic data. By resolving their phylogeny, we observe that parasites with apicomplexan-like morphologies are polyphyletic and originated at least three times independently. We also show that gregarines and eugregarines are monophyletic, and blastogregarines are related to archigregarines, highlighting the importance of several traits uniquely shared among them. Many deep-branching apicomplexans contain plastidial metabolism and divergent, AT-rich plastid genomes, but eugregarines lost plastids at least twice independently. Phylogeny of 16S ribosomal RNA genes and structural novelties in plastid proteins demonstrate that plastids are widespread and ancestral in the group.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>First multiprotein dataset including all major apicomplexan lineages</title><p>We generated 13 transcriptomes for 10 parasites, representing six deep apicomplexan lineages with poor presence of sequence data: protococcidians, agamococcidians, blastogregarines, archigregarines, eugregarines (three different superfamilies), and <italic>incertae sedis</italic> species (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Between 1 and 80 cells per species were isolated from the intestines of marine annelids, molluscs, and barnacles. The parasite cells were washed and preserved for RNA extraction (Materials and methods). Transcriptomes were sequenced from amplified cDNA by pair-end Illumina HiSeq and assembled in Trinity. To resolve deep apicomplexans relationships, we modified a published dataset of slow-evolving nucleus-encoded markers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Derelle et al., 2016</xref>) by including broad, representative sampling of genomes and transcriptomes of apicomplexans and related taxa (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). This produced a phylogenetic matrix of 296 protein sequences, which were individually verified for orthology by maximum likelihood phylogenies – this allowed us to unambiguously identify paralogous and contaminant sequences (Materials and methods). Our apicomplexan transcriptomes typically contained a single ortholog per gene; two exceptions to this were suggestive of cryptic species among the collected cells. In <italic>Rhytidocystis</italic> sp. 1, the most complete of multiple isoforms was selected, whereas two distinct sequence variants were present in <italic>Siedleckia nematoides</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>) and eventually merged into a single taxonomic unit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

All three are members of the superfamily Actinocephaloidea based on a consensus of protein and ribosomal RNA gene (rDNA) phylogenies (Materials and methods).

The protococcidian <italic>Eleutheroschizon duboscqi</italic> was a sister of eucoccidians, and rhytidocystids branched as basal coccidiomorphs, the group containing most medically important apicomplexans. The blastogregarine <italic>Siedleckia</italic> was strongly related to the archigregarine <italic>Selenidium pygospionis</italic>. Gregarine apicomplexans (sensu lato including blastogregarines but excluding <italic>Digyalum</italic>; see below) and eugregarines were both monophyletic, in contrast to most interpretations based on ribosomal RNA genes (rDNA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cavalier-Smith, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Leander, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Rueckert et al., 2011</xref>).

The resulting trees had congruent topologies with all internal branches fully supported except for two eugregarine subclades and the position of cryptosporidians (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Similarly, seven statistical tests on 105 tree topologies representing all possible relationships between coccidiomorphs, cryptosporidians, eugregarines, archigregarines, and blastogregarines rejected all alternative topologies at p=0.01 except those differing in the placement of cryptosporidians (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). The relationship of cryptosporidians therefore requires additional support, although their sister position to gregarines, which was unambiguously recovered in all trees including the ten PhyloBayes runs, is a preferred hypothesis. Two apicomplexan-like parasites branched outside the main apicomplexan clade (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). <italic>Digyalum oweni</italic>, a formally described archigregarine was fully resolved as a sister lineage to all apicomplexans and chrompodellids. A previously undescribed parasitic symbiont of the annelid <italic>Scoloplos</italic> with apicomplexan-like traits, named ‘Symbiont X’, was specifically related to <italic>Chromera velia.</italic> Thus, apicomplexan parasites in the traditional sense are polyphyletic (see Discussion).

The eugregarine <italic>Lankesteria</italic> unusually contains fatty acid biosynthesis as the only plastidial pathway, whereas Symbiont X contains only the isoprenoid pathway, similar to piroplasms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lizundia et al., 2009</xref>). Both <italic>Lankesteria</italic> and Symbiont X appear to lack plastid genomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The distribution of control, signature plastid genes involved in polypeptide import, folding, and DNA replication in the plastid (<italic>cpn60</italic>, <italic>sDer-1</italic>, <italic>PREX</italic>), matches the presence of plastid metabolism and genomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Maximum likelihood phylogenies of all individual proteins allowed us to readily distinguish the apicomplexan sequences from bacteria and other contaminants in the datasets (Materials and methods). In most phylogenies, the apicomplexan sequences cluster with algal plastid forms, confirming that they came from the plastid endosymbiont rather than the eukaryotic host. The phylogeny is different in several genes that are either derived by horizontal gene transfer from bacteria or in fact localize outside of the plastid in <italic>Plasmodium</italic> (in heme biosynthesis; see below). N-terminal regions of plastid sequences from our new transcriptomes often carry signal peptides typical for targeting to the plastid (the other have incomplete N-termini or lack targeting signatures by default, such as most triose phosphate translocators). The signal peptides are often followed by transit peptide-like regions, although these are more difficult to predict computationally (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>). In <italic>Digyalum</italic>, transit peptides have a net positive charge similar to other plastid leaders (they are low in acidic and high in basic residues; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). <italic>Digyalum</italic> transit peptides are compositionally similar to transit peptides in <italic>Plasmodium</italic>, and likewise lack the phenylalanine motif at the first position after the signal peptide cleavage site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Patron and Waller, 2007</xref>). Predicted localizations for plastidial proteins and mitochondrial ALAS correspond closely to experimental evidence in <italic>Plasmodium</italic> and <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The only exceptions to this pattern are the last three enzymes in heme biosynthesis, which are predicted to be plastidial in some parasites (see Discussion). The reconstructed plastid pathways also reflect known dependencies between their modules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Iron-sulphur cluster assembly and ferredoxin system are widely required as co-factors for isoprenoid and fatty acid synthesis, whereas heme biosynthesis can be lost independently of other modules – likely the case in <italic>Lankesteria</italic> and Symbiont X. The synthesis of 3-phosphoglycerate (GAPDH-II and PGK-II) is present selectively. SufA was not identified in the <italic>Chromera</italic> genome. Pyruvate dehydrogenase and fatty and lipoic acid synthesis protein sequences in <italic>Digyalum</italic> are notably divergent, including three that are more closely related to bacterial than plastid sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The cytosolic mevalonate pathway for isoprenoid precursor synthesis is absent in all species, but the mitochondrial cysteine desulphurase (IscS) and cytosolic fatty acid synthase (FASI) and elongase (ELO) pathways are present, as expected (Materials and methods) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dellibovi-Ragheb et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Ramakrishnan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Zhu et al., 2004</xref>).

Symbiont X is known only from light microscopy data but would be also readily classified as an apicomplexan based on crude characteristics: it parasitizes the gut of <italic>Scoloplos armiger</italic> polychaetes being attached to the host epithelium by its apical end (unpublished data). Tracing the evolution of such parasite characteristics, however, indicates that the basis for convergence lies in evolution acting on similar preconditions. Apical complexes with rhoptries, micronemes and pseudoconoids are present in free-living relatives of apicomplexans, such as in the predatory <italic>Colpodella</italic> and <italic>Psammosa</italic> and photosynthetic <italic>Chromera</italic>, and in more distantly related parasites such as <italic>Perkinsus</italic> and <italic>Parvilucifera</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Foissner and Foissner, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Norén et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Oborník et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Okamoto and Keeling, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Perkins, 1996</xref>). Such broad distribution points to a single origin of the apical complex in the ancestor of apicomplexans and dinoflagellates in a non-parasitic context (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Because the apical complex mediates secretion often associated with cell-to-cell interactions, it is likely an important precondition in multiple origins of parasitism in both apicomplexans and dinoflagellates. In similar host environments the structure may have also promoted convergent parasite morphologies. The use of the apical complex in extracellular attachment and secretion in the gut epithelium of animal hosts, for example, may have triggered convergent expansion in the cell size of gregarine, <italic>Digyalum</italic> and Symbiont X trophonts. Unsurprisingly, convergent similarities in the three lineages are accompanied by considerable differences in detailed morphology: <italic>Digyalum</italic> and Symbiont X do not glide or twist but they pulsate, and detailed ultrastructure of their apical complex and pellicle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dyson et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dyson et al., 1993</xref>) (unpublished data) is distinct from that in gregarines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kováčiková et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Paskerova et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Valigurová et al., 2017</xref>). Similar divergence characterizes their molecular make-ups: apicomplexans are well-known auxotrophs for purines, but <italic>Digyalum</italic> contains a pathway for their synthesis (data not shown) and, despite that both lineages lost photosynthesis, their plastid genomes have been reduced in different ways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). The convergent morphologies of <italic>Digyalum</italic>, Symbiont X and apicomplexans are therefore rather superficial similarities, but the possibility that they were driven by the presence of shared ancestral traits (such as the apical complex) in similar host habitats highlights the importance of preconditions in the origin of parasites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Janouskovec and Keeling, 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Relationships and morphological transitions in early apicomplexan evolution</title><p>Key findings of multiprotein phylogenies are that eugregarines and gregarines are unequivocally monophyletic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). This broadly supports traditional morphological classifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Grassé, 1953</xref>) in contrast to many recent proposals based on rDNA phylogenies, which regard both groups as polyphyletic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cavalier-Smith, 2013</xref>). Indeed, protein sequences allow for building larger phylogenetic matrices and have more even substitution rates than rDNAs, some of which are notoriously divergent and phylogenetically unstable. Although the sampling of eugregarine diversity is incomplete, our phylogeny contains six of their seven main lineages at the superfamily level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Simdyanov et al., 2017</xref>) – one of them being <italic>Polyrhabdina</italic>, which is apparently not a lecudinoid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and unpublished data). The eugregarine monophyly provides the first unambiguous phylogenetic support for their two candidate synapomorphies: the ultrastructure of the epimerite, and the ultrastructure of epicytic crests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Simdyanov et al., 2017</xref>). It also partially resolves the little understood relationships between eugregarine superfamilies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cavalier-Smith, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Simdyanov et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Simdyanov et al., 2015</xref>). The blastogregarine <italic>Siedleckia</italic> groups strongly with the archigregarine <italic>Selenidium</italic>. The sampling of both groups is incomplete, especially in the archigregarines, but they do share a combination of characteristics that are rare or absent in other apicomplexans, namely active bending and twisting movement in trophozoites, pellicular folds running along the body length in many species, and one or more layers of longitudinal microtubules underlying the pellicle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Schrével et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Simdyanov et al., 2018</xref>). Both lineages also feed by myzocytosis, which is known in some relatives of apicomplexans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Foissner and Foissner, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mylnikov and Mylnikova, 2008</xref>) but not in eugregarines, cryptosporidians or coccidiomorphs. Because the blastogregarine ultrastructure and life cycle share additional similarities with coccidians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Simdyanov et al., 2018</xref>), confirming their phylogenetic position is important for reconstructing character evolution in Apicomplexa as a whole. The monophyly of gregarines sensu lato in our trees (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) provides phylogenetic support for a tentative synapomorphy of this group, the forming of a gametocyst during the life cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Simdyanov et al., 2017</xref>), although this characteristic is absent in blastogregarines. The position of cryptosporidians is still not fully resolved, but the group is consistently recovered next to gregarines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). <italic>Eleutheroschizon</italic> is clearly important to understanding the origin of eucoccidians (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Valigurová et al., 2015</xref>), although its classification as a protococcidian is apparently incorrect (unpublished data). Two <italic>Rhytidocystis</italic> species are positioned as a basal group in the class Coccidiomorpha (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), which supports traditional views on their classification closer to coccidians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Levine, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Porchet Hennere, 1972</xref>) rather than to gregarines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cavalier-Smith, 2014</xref>). The bigger group that includes rhytidocystids and related parasites of annelids and molluscs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kristmundsson et al., 2011</xref>) therefore provides a stepping stone for understanding the evolution of coccidiomorphs, including the majority of medically important apicomplexans.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Widespread maintenance but multiple losses of plastids in apicomplexa</title><p>Evidence for endosymbiotic genes with plastid targeting signals and plastid genomes shows that plastids are common in deep-branching apicomplexans, despite not having been previously recognized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>). Their plastid metabolic networks are similar to those in <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> and <italic>Plasmodium</italic> and generally serve to produce three essential metabolites: isoprenoid precursors for the synthesis of carotenoids, ubiquinone and prenyls; heme as a protein co-factor; and fatty acids as constituents of cellular lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Imlay and Odom, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Ramakrishnan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">van Dooren et al., 2012</xref>). Heme biosynthesis is partially localized in the cytosol and mitochondria, and fatty acids can be extended by non-plastidial elongases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Ramakrishnan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Zhu et al., 2004</xref>), but de novo biosynthesis of all three metabolites outside of the plastid appears to be absent. This creates dependence on the plastid for the production of isoprenoid precursors, heme, and fatty acids, which can be overcome only by metabolite uptake from the environment. Salvage of host isoprenoids, heme, and fatty acids is common in parasites, but obtaining them in sufficient amounts across the life cycle is apparently challenging. Most parasites retain all three plastidial pathways, and only two lineages have lost plastid organelles altogether (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>): cryptosporidians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abrahamsen et al., 2004</xref>), and the dinoflagellates <italic>Hematodinium</italic> and <italic>Amoebophrya</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gornik et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">John et al., 2019</xref>). In free-living organisms, plastids are always retained, perhaps because replacing their metabolism by salvage is even more difficult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Janouškovec et al., 2017</xref>). Most consistently required is the biosynthesis of isoprenoid precursors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), which is the only indispensable plastidial pathway in piroplasms, the <italic>Plasmodium</italic> blood stage, and possibly in Symbiont X (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lizundia et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Yeh and DeRisi, 2011</xref>). A fully unprecedented situation exists in the eugregarine <italic>Lankesteria</italic>, where fatty acid biosynthesis appears to be the only retained plastidial anabolic pathway (the transcriptome is fragmentary but enzymes for the biosynthesis of isoprenoid precursors and heme are absent). Interestingly, the existence of plastids in <italic>Selenidium</italic> and <italic>Rhytidocystis</italic> is also consistent with ultrastructural reports of multimembrane organelles in some of their species, which correspond to non-photosynthetic plastids in other apicomplexans by size, appearance, and their position near the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Leander and Ramey, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Porchet Hennere, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Schrével, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Schrével et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wakeman et al., 2014</xref>). Five eugregarines lack any evidence for plastid presence; these include <italic>Gregarina</italic> where a draft genome is available (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Since <italic>Lankesteria</italic> is phylogenetically nested among them, eugregarines must have lost plastids at least twice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). <italic>Ascogregarina</italic> contains a fragment of <italic>PREX</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), but because the species lacks evidence for other endosymbiont-derived genes we conservatively consider it encodes for an ex-plastidial protein or is a contaminant. Our results indicate that the two plastid losses in eugregarines are independent of the one in cryptosporidians (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), unlike previous assumptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cavalier-Smith, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Toso and Omoto, 2007</xref>).

Testing whether plastids in apicomplexans, chrompodellids and <italic>Digyalum</italic> derive from the same endosymbiont is therefore relevant to understanding plastid evolution and frequency of plastid losses in general. We find three lines of evidence that support a common origin. Firstly, phylogenies of individual plastid genes repeatedly group <italic>Digyalum</italic> with apicomplexans and chrompodellids, and their topologies either reiterate nuclear phylogenies directly or are unresolved without consistently supporting alternatives (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). Secondly, unidentified lineages that carry plastid-encoded 16S rDNAs related to apicomplexans and chrompodellids (ARLs) are growing in number and diversity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Some are apicomplexans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Janouškovec et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kwong et al., 2019</xref>) and others may be free-living, but they altogether support the idea that plastids in the lineage are widespread (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Janouškovec et al., 2012</xref>). Finally, unique evolutionary innovations in the plastidial <italic>PREX</italic>, <italic>ispH</italic>, and <italic>hemH</italic> link together the plastids in apicomplexans, chrompodellids, and <italic>Digyalum</italic> (bacterial <italic>fabG</italic> and split <italic>rpoC2</italic> further link plastids in some of them). It is difficult to see how endosymbiosis would move plastids in or out of the lineage without changing the distribution of these genes. Altogether, the evidence suggests that plastids in apicomplexans, chrompodellids, and <italic>Digyalum</italic> were inherited vertically from a common ancestor, are widely distributed in the group, and are most likely retained by default, particularly in free-living representatives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Janouškovec et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Janouskovec et al., 2010</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Metabolic evolution in the plastid</title><p>Core plastid metabolism in <italic>Digyalum</italic>, Symbiont X, and apicomplexans has been remarkably conserved across long time scales and reveals only a few outstanding variations.

PfiTPT orthologs are less common (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gile and Slamovits, 2014</xref>), but they possess N-terminal signal peptides in <italic>Chromera</italic>, <italic>Vitrella</italic>, and <italic>Rhytidocystis</italic> sp. two compatible with their targeting to the inner plastid membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). The split between the two forms therefore likely predated Apicomplexa and the loss of the PfiTPT form in the lineage leading to <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> is apparently a derived evolutionary state. One enzyme that processes the TPT substrate dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) is triose phosphate isomerase (TPI-II), and the failure to identify TPI-II in piroplasms once led to the proposition that their plastids import glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, the TPI-II product (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fleige et al., 2010</xref>). We find that TPI-II, although highly divergent in piroplasms, is present in all apicomplexans with plastids, and it frequently possesses N-terminal signal peptides for plastid targeting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

Parasites with characteristics similar to apicomplexans could provide a study system for morphological and molecular convergence and insights into the transition from free-living species to obligate symbionts.

Secondly, plastids appear to be consistently absent in most eugregarine superfamilies except for the Lecudinoidea (<italic>Lankesteria</italic> in our study and <italic>Lecudina</italic> and <italic>Pterospora</italic> in the other study), where fatty acid biosynthesis is the only core plastidial pathway. The presence of two additional eugregarine superfamilies in our trees (Ancoroidea and <italic>Polyrhabdina</italic>) points to an extra case of plastid loss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), but the relationships of eugregarine superfamilies which are present in both studies are fully congruent. Integrating sequence datasets from both studies will be a first step in creating a phylogenetic framework for apicomplexan evolution. This framework will likely be useful in illuminating steps in the emergence of parasitism and in predicting cell biology of less known parasites by the methods of comparative genomics.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or <break/>reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Commercial assay or kit</td><td>RNAqueous-Micro Total RNA Isolation Kit</td><td valign="bottom">ThermoFisher</td><td>cat no.

RNA was reverse-transcribed by using SMART-Seq v4 Ultra Low Input RNA Kit (Takara; cat no. 634888), however20-30 amplification cycles; optimization was done as in SMARTer Pico PCR cDNA Synthesis Kit). Indexed TruSeq libraries were built at Edinburgh Genomics and sequenced as paired-end 150 bp reads in two multiplexed lanes on the Illumina HiSeq 4000 machine. For the <italic>Digyalum oweni</italic> WS3-2017 sample, paired-end 150 bp HiSeq 4000 reads were produced independently of other samples. Demultiplexed reads were processed by cutadapt v1.8.3 to remove low quality nucleotides (-q 20 setting), polyA tails, SMARTer adapters and leftover Illumina barcodes (on 3' ends of shorter sequence fragments). Reads of minimum length of 100 nucleotides were assembled in Trinity v2.4.0 by using the default settings. Predicted proteomes were generated as six-frame translations of transcriptomic contigs. Analysis of assembled reads revealed minor cross-contamination between samples due to adapter swapping, but contaminants were well distinguishable by read coverage. Raw sequence reads and our assemblies were deposited in NCBI Bioprojects PRJNA557242 and PRJNA556465. Photographs of studied parasites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) were made using Leica DM 2500 microscopes equipped with DIC optics and a digital camera (Leica, Germany) at the White Sea Biological Station of Moscow State University and the Marine Biological Station of St. Petersburg State University.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Single protein sequence alignments for nuclear phylogeny</title><p>We built our dataset from 339 protein sequence alignments previously used in stramenopile phylogenies and tested for orthology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Derelle et al., 2016</xref>). Firstly, slow-evolving stramenopile sequence query for each alignment (mostly the <italic>Phytophthora</italic> sequence) was used to retrieve five best BLASTP hits (e-value cutoff of 1e-5) and select the closest ortholog in translated alveolate, stramenopile, and rhizarian genomes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Secondly, a new alveolate protein sequence query (primarily from <italic>Vitrella</italic>) was used in the same way to expand the dataset with our newly generated and existing transcriptomes. Closest hits from animal, fungal, microsporidian and bodonid genomes were also included to distinguish sequences derived from animal host and other contaminants in the samples. Orthologous sequences were identified by multiple rounds of alignment clean-up as guided by Maximum Likelihood phylogenies. Initial rounds of phylogenies were focused on removing out-paralogs and contaminants by using default alignment in MAFFT v7.402 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Katoh and Standley, 2013</xref>), alignment trimming in BMGE v1.12 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Criscuolo and Gribaldo, 2010</xref>) with the -b 3 g 0.4 setting and phylogeny in Fasttree v2.1.10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Price et al., 2010</xref>) with the -lg -gamma setting. Later rounds were focused on resolving difficult cases of paralogy, horizontal gene transfer, and the orthology of fast-evolving sequences: localpair, --linsi, alignment in MAFFT; -b 4 g 0.4 settings in BMGE; and IQ-TREE v1.6.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nguyen et al., 2015</xref>) phylogeny with the LG+I+G4+F model and 1000 UFBoot2 supports. Of the original 339 single protein sequence alignments (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Derelle et al., 2016</xref>), 43 were excluded in the process: 10 were absent in apicomplexans and dinoflagellates (alignments #72, #290, #291, #292, #294, #295, #300, #301, #304 and #315) and 33 were sparsely sampled or strongly incongruent with known organismal relationships (alignments #29, #57, #70, #73, #82, #149, #151, #155, #157, #159, #163, #164, #167, #171, #183, #184, #191, #193, #194, #198, #241, #246, #260, #265, #270, #283, #285, #289, #302, #303, #305, #330, #331). In the remaining 296 alignments, paralogs were reduced to the most slowly evolving sequence with non-conflicting phylogenetic placement (else both were removed) and multiple gene isoforms were reduced to the most complete sequence. Cross-contaminant sequences were identified based on read coverage and excluded. Divergent regions of sequences resulting from frame shift errors or imperfect gene models were removed from alignments manually. Adjacent protein sequence fragments that were apparently derived from the same gene fragmented by wrong genome annotation were merged.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Multiprotein phylogeny and topology tests</title><p>The final 296 protein sequence datasets were realigned by the localpair algorithm in MAFFT, trimmed by using the -b 4 g 0.4 settings in BMGE and concatenated in Scafos v1.25 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Roure et al., 2007</xref>). During the latter step, sequences derived from different strains of the same species (in <italic>Colpodella angusta</italic>, <italic>Sarcocystis neurona, Voromonas pontica</italic>, and unidentified actinocephaloid parasites of <italic>Helicoverpa armigera</italic> and <italic>Helicoverpa assulta</italic>) were merged into single operational taxonomic units (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). The initial phylogenetic matrix contained 54 species, 99948 sites and 14.4% missing data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). To further reduce missing data we merged sequences of two <italic>Oxyrrhis marina</italic> strains and of two distinct variants found in <italic>Siedleckia nematoides</italic> transcriptomes; the latter are possibly derived from different cryptic species (variant one was preferentially identified and/or found to be more complete in the transcriptome of the WS1 strain; variant two in the transcriptome of the WS2 strain). We also merged sequences of three representatives of the superfamily Actinocephaloidea with low sequence presence: <italic>Ascogregarina</italic> and two unidentified parasites of the insects <italic>Teleopsis</italic> and <italic>Helicoverpa</italic>, which contaminate the host transcriptomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Borner and Burmester, 2017</xref>). The 18S rDNA of the <italic>Teleopsis</italic> parasite branches among other actinocephaloids (data not shown) and both unidentified group with <italic>Ascogregarina</italic> in the multiprotein phylogeny (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Merging all these taxa produced the main phylogenetic matrix with 50 species, 99908 positions and 10.6% missing data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). Three additional matrices were created by excluding all sequences of <italic>Gregarina</italic>, <italic>Cephaloidophora</italic>, or both species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Final matrices were first analyzed in IQ-TREE by using the LG+I+G4+F model and the best tree was used as a guide tree in a more thorough analysis with the LG+G4+F+C60+PMSF model: 1000 UFBoot2 replicates were computed for all datasets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) and 100 non-parametric bootstrap were computed for the main matrix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Seven statistical tests of 105 tree topologies corresponding to all possible relationships between coccidiomorphs, cryptosporidians, eugregarines, archigregarines, and blastogregarines in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> were calculated in IQ-TREE v1.6.5 with the LG+I+G4+F model and 10000 replicates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). The main phylogenetic matrix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) was also analyzed by 10 independent PhyloBayes runs (either standard version 4.1 c or MPI version 1.7b) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lartillot et al., 2009</xref>) with the GTR+CAT model and constant sites removed (-dc setting). Each chain was run for 1000 cycles, of which the initial 250 were discarded and the remaining (10 × 750) were combined to compute a consensus tree (maxdiff = 0.23, meandiff = 0.00057).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Analysis of plastidial metabolism and horizontally acquired genes</title><p>We next searched the orthologs of apicomplexan plastid proteins with focus on core pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) in transcriptomes and genomes of apicomplexans and their relatives (including <italic>Perkinsus</italic> and dinoflagellates) by using similar approach as for the nuclear genes above. Five best BLASTP hits at the e-value threshold of 1e-5 were retrieved for each species by using a comparatively slow evolving sequence query (typically <italic>Vitrella</italic> or <italic>Chromera</italic>). These hits were included in plastid protein alignments created previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Janouškovec et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Janouškovec et al., 2015</xref>), or in new alignments created here by retrieving representative outgroup sequences from GenBank and the local database by BLASTP searches with the same query sequences (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). This process included non-plastidial genes of the heme biosynthesis pathway, and three genes representing controls for non-plastidial pathways: <italic>iscS</italic> (mitochondrial iron-sulfur biosynthesis),enoyl reductase domain (FASI, cytosolic fatty acid synthesis), and <italic>ELO</italic> (endoplasmic reticulum-localized fatty acid elongation). Alignments were reduced by an iteration process analogous to that used for nuclear genes. Final phylogenetic matrices were prepared by localpair alignment in MAFFT and -b 4 g 0.4 trimming in BMGE, and analyzed in IQ-TREE by using the built-in ModelFinder to select the best model with the preset LG substitution matrix (for example, LG+F+R7 model for TPT in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). This approach allowed to distinguish true apicomplexan sequences from contaminants in our transcriptomes and confirmed their origins to be in the plastid endosymbiont (grouping with other plastidial sequences) or eukaryotic host (grouping with eukaryotic cytosolic or mitochondrial sequences; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Protein phylogenies of six horizontally acquired genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>) were built by expanding previous datasets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Janouškovec et al., 2015</xref>) and computed by using the same method as plastid phylogenies above.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Analysis of leader sequences in plastid proteins</title><p>Proteins of core plastidial pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) derived from our transcriptomes and those of <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic>, <italic>Babesia microti</italic> and <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> were scanned for the presence of identifiable N-terminal signal peptides in SignalP v4.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Petersen et al., 2011</xref>). All methionines downstream of the predicted protein start were also tested for targeting signals. Positive sequences were checked for the presence of N-terminal extensions – truncated proteins were filtered out as false positives. The remaining signal peptide-positive proteins were recorded in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and further checked for identifiable transit peptides in ChloroP 1.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Emanuelsson et al., 1999</xref>). The SignalP and ChloroP statistics were listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>. Apicomplexan proteins that have known experimental localization (as described in primary literature and Apiloc3) or that were classified as high-confidence plastid-localized proteins in <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> by BioID (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boucher et al., 2018</xref>), were recorded in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>. To characterize transit peptides in <italic>Digyalum oweni</italic>, we expanded its identified plastid protein set. Additional plastidial proteins in the WS1+two isolates were searched by BLASTP with apicomplexan queries, comprising known <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> and <italic>Plasmodium</italic> plastid proteins primarily involved in transcript and protein processing (e.g., stromal processing peptidase, clpP chaperone, histone-like protein HU, tRNA-Met ligase, etc.). Matched sequences were verified by reverse BLASTP searches on KEGG and NCBI BLAST websites (aided by distance tree phylogenies at the latter site). Pooling positive hits with those identified previously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) and filtering for sequences with N-terminal extension carrying a signal peptide (as identified by SignalP v4.1) produced 41 plastid proteins. The first 14 transit peptide residues downstream of the signal peptide cleavage site (an approach to allow comparison with results in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Patron and Waller, 2007</xref> were merged and analyzed altogether for their amino acid composition by ‘Protein Stats’ script at the Sequence Manipulation Suite website. Composition of the 41 mature proteins (without transit peptides) was also analyzed – because transit peptide cleavage sites are difficult to predict in silico the initial 50 residues were removed arbitrarily (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The amino acid frequency at the first 20 positions across the 41 <italic>Digyalum</italic> transit peptides was analyzed at the WebLogo3 website (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Plastid genome analysis and 16S rDNA phylogeny</title><p>Plastids transcripts were identified by three search strategies: BLASTN searches with plastidial 16S rDNA; BLASTP searches with sequences of plastid-encoded protein sequences of apicomplexans or chrompodellids;and searches for high AT contigs (typically contigs &gt; 70% AT and 1–3 kb in length). Hits from the former search were examined in a 16S rDNA tree. Hits those from the latter two search strategies were combined and reversely compared by BLASTX against the NCBI nr database to search if they match genes in apicomplexan, chrompodellids and algal plastid genomes. Positive hits were limited to representative, non-redundant contigs of 1 kb or longer (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp7">Supplementary file 7</xref>). Identification of individual genes was based on NCBI BLAST searches and tRNAscan-SE, and it was further aided by Artemis 17.0.1 and MFannot website. AT content was examined in 16S rDNAs and in whole plastid genomes or combined plastid transcripts by the ‘DNA Stats’ script on the Sequence Manipulation Suite website (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp7">Supplementary file 7</xref>). The phylogeny of 16S rDNA was based on an earlier dataset with representatives of ARL-I to ARL-VIII clades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Janouškovec et al., 2012</xref>). We also requested sequences of ARL-X and ARL-XI as reported in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mathur et al. (2018)</xref> from the authors of the study. Of the 34 sequences of clustered centroids we received, only one centroid was named ‘ARL-XI’ and this was a <italic>Pelagibacter</italic>-like bacterial contaminant; we therefore consider ARL-XI to be invalid. The remaining 33 centroids were named ‘ARL-X’: nine of them were bacterial contaminants and the remaining formed two non-overlapping groups of 3 and 21 sequences. We included in our phylogeny all three sequences from the first group and four slowly evolving sequences from the second group, but they all branched within ARL-I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), which leads us to synonymize ARL-X with ARL-I. Finally, we included in the phylogeny 10 new ARLs identified by phylogenetic sorting of the VAMPS database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Huse et al., 2014</xref>). Briefly, we obtained all VAMPS reads annotated as ‘Organelle’ or ‘Unknown’, selected those being 350 bp or longer, and clustered each group in Usearch at 97% identity. Centroids were individually classified by maximum likelihood phylogenies in a dataset containing plastids, bacteria and mitochondria by an approach used previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Janouškovec et al., 2012</xref>). The initial round of phylogenies was computed by using Fasttree2 (-lg -gamma setting) and later rounds by using IQ-TREE (LG+I+G4+F model; additional rounds with modified taxon sampling were used for sequences that were difficult to classify). Candidate ARL sequences were used to retrieve additional ARLs from centroid databases by BLASTN searches (i.e., those that had been misplaced by Fasttree2). The apicomplexan affiliation of all ARL sequences was verified in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> dataset. Representative sequences for all known and novel ARLs were listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>. The final 16S rDNA phylogeny was based on a localpair MAFFT alignment trimmed in BMGE (-h 0.4 g 0.65 settings) and computed by using IQ-TREE with ModelFinder selection of the best fit model and 10000 UFBoot2 supports (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Ross F Waller and reviewers and editors in <italic>Elife</italic> for providing helpful comments and suggestions about the draft manuscript.

transparency, eLife includes the editorial decision letter and accompanying author responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Convergent origins of parasitism, new phylogenetic relationships and complex distribution of plastids in Apicomplexa.&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by John McCutcheon as the Reviewing Editor and Detlef Weigel as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Christopher Howe (Reviewer #1); Geoff McFadden (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The phylum Apicomplexa includes many medically important and biologically fascinating organisms. However, only a few species of medical importance have been studied with genomics, leaving many important questions related to the evolution of their unusual non-photosynthetic plastids and their sometimes parasitic lifestyles unanswered. Using transcriptome sequencing from apicomplexan cells isolated from various marine invertebrates, the authors resolved some of the long-standing mysteries of Apicomplexa. They show that parasitism likely evolved not once but many times in Apicomplexa, and they show that plastid loss is likely more common that originally appreciated. The evolution of this important group of organisms is now much clearer.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>There are five essential revisions that need to be made.</p><p>1) The difficulty of reconstructing the deeper regions of the phylogenies (because of biased sequence compositions, rates of evolution) is mentioned and dealt with thoroughly but needs to be made more clear in the text for readers that are not experts in phylogenetic reconstructions.</p><p>2) The potential problems associated with bacterial contamination in transcriptomes should be discussed more clearly in the main text. The reviewers thought that some reporting on gene-level support for each key gene <italic>not</italic> being the result of contamination would be useful. If most genes follow a certain pattern (for example, if all are found on the plastids of close relatives), then the results could be summarized in a sentence or two in the Results. If the results are more variable, then perhaps a table would be more appropriate. We appreciate that some detail on this is provided in the Materials and methods, and the main line of evidence seems to be that the transcripts group with plastid-genome-encoded sequences from other species where genomes are available, but this needs to be clearly articulated in the appropriate Results section. For example, were analyses performed in which all of the sequences corresponding to the previously-reported ARLs were included, or just centroids? More detail on these analyses might help the reader to understand the issue more clearly.</p><p>3) The existence of a related bioRxiv preprint (http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/636183) which reports many of the same findings needs to be acknowledged and discussed. The reviewers and editors feel that this would strengthen the paper and is the fair thing to do. The authors needn't worry about <italic>eLife</italic> rejecting their manuscript because of this bioRxiv preprint (see this article on <italic>eLife</italic>'s policy on scooping: https://elifesciences.org/articles/30076).</p><p>4) The terminology related to Apicomplexa, apicomplexans, plastids, apicoplasts, etc. needs to be clarified and made consistent throughout the manuscript. It is clear that parasitism has arisen multiple times in this lineage. That's interesting. What is murky is whether the apical complex has arisen independently, which is what some of the language in this paper hints at (e.g Abstract, Introduction, last paragraph and subsection “Monophyly of gregarines and eugregarines, and polyphyly of apicomplexan parasites”. Where does this paper stand on parallel origins of the apical complex? Given that we have some structures in dinoflagellates that we think are homologues, when does a case of parallel evolution from a common ancestral structure become identifiable? Bat and bird wings is a nice example. Both arose independently from a common ancestral structure, namely the vertebrate forelimb. They are still homologous, but modification to aid flight arose convergently. Are the authors of this submission arguing that the apical complex arose independently multiple times, or are they simply saying that parasitism arose multiple times amongst the lineage that has Phylum Apicomplexa at its tip? There is a really big difference of course. The problem is that select lineages could also have lost or degraded apical complexes. We certainly see many parasites with stages that don't develop an apical complex. It seems that the authors are saying (at least in the title) that the apical complex arose once, and that parasitism has arisen multiple times amongst a lineage possessed of an apical complex, but the conclusion from the text is less clear.</p><p>The authors have chosen not to use the term apicoplast. Given its wide usage in the literature, a mention of the term early on, and justification for using the more general term plastid to embrace the homologous organelles in those relatives without an apicoplast complex such as the dinozoa, would be appropriate in the Introduction.</p><p>Another language issue is whether or not the authors are using formal or informal names for taxa. Happily, they adopt the systematics of Adl et al., 2018, which is widely accepted in the protistology field. The problems encountered in this submission were mainly when the informal name was capitalised (e.g. the tree in Figure 1). This is confusing and should be avoided as it hints at the name being a formal taxon. It is therefore preferable to avoid using informal taxon names at the start of sentences. Clear usage would also include the taxon rank (e.g. Phylum Apicomplexa) for formal taxon names, but lower case for informal categories (e.g. apicomplexans). It is also important to be consistent. For instance, in Figure 1 the authors use the term Cryptosporidians (the capital C should go) but in the text the frequently use the term cryptosporidia. Choose one informal name, and stick to it throughout.</p><p>5) The title needs to be made more precise and exciting.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.49662.029</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>There are five essential revisions that need to be made.</p><p>1) The difficulty of reconstructing the deeper regions of the phylogenies (because of biased sequence compositions, rates of evolution) is mentioned and dealt with thoroughly but needs to be made more clear in the text for readers that are not experts in phylogenetic reconstructions.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a good suggestion. To address it, we extended the description of the plastid 16S rDNA phylogeny (the bias affects exclusively the analysis in Figure 3A). We clarified that the deep-level topology needs to be interpreted with caution and explained that unrelated but compositionally similar sequences can cluster artificially together. Although none of this bias relates to our interpretations it is indeed better that readers are made aware of it (we ask them to compare trees in Figures 3A and 1A). The relevant sentence in the Figure 3 legend was also reworded to clarify that “sequences in the tree vary greatly in their AT content and substitution rates, which can induce a misleading topology – deep relationships in the tree should therefore be interpreted with caution”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The potential problems associated with bacterial contamination in transcriptomes should be discussed more clearly in the main text.

In nuclear phylogenies in the Results, we highlighted that single gene orthologs were identified by “maximum likelihood phylogenies – this allowed us to unambiguously identify paralogous and contaminant sequences (Materials and methods”. In the plastid phylogeny section, we clarified how contaminants were identified and how the origin of individual genes was assigned, as requested: “Maximum likelihood phylogenies of all individual proteins allowed us to readily distinguish the apicomplexan sequences from bacteria and other contaminants in datasets (Materials and methods). In most phylogenies, the apicomplexan sequences form a cluster that is related to algal plastidial forms confirming an origin in the plastid endosymbiont rather than eukaryotic host). The phylogenetic pattern is only different in genes that are derived by horizontal gene transfer from bacteria or that in fact localize outside of the plastid in <italic>Plasmodium</italic> (heme biosynthesis; see below).” Finally, a description of the global ARL phylogeny with regard to selection of environmental sequences was added, as requested. We included it in Results where we briefly describe the tree and explain that it includes “newly identified VAMPS centroids and representative sequences of known ARLs”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The existence of a related bioRxiv preprint (http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/636183) which reports many of the same findings needs to be acknowledged and discussed.

The authors needn't worry about eLife rejecting their manuscript because of this bioRxiv preprint (see this article on eLife's policy on scooping: https://elifesciences.org/articles/30076).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree. This is an exciting report that reaches some similar conclusions based on a fully complementary sets of apicomplexan transcriptomes. We referenced the preprint in the last paragraph of Discussion entitled “Summary and future directions”. We briefly compared the principal findings of the two studies, and the agreement of their conclusions in two main areas: the polyphyly of Apicomplexa and multiple plastid losses in eugregarines. Importantly, while the two studies do not fully overlap, they do not fundamentally disagree on any particulars. We note that integrating the two datasets will provide a strong framework for understanding apicomplexan evolution.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The terminology related to Apicomplexa, apicomplexans, plastids, apicoplasts, etc. needs to be clarified and made consistent throughout the manuscript.

The evidence is clear that apicomplexan parasites are polyphyletic, but this makes no assumption about single vs. multiple origins of their apical complex organelles. The reviewer understood us correctly that the apical complex originated only once but this had not been stated explicitly. We have now expanded the text and references in corresponding section of the Discussion, among others clearly saying that the “distribution points to a single, early origin of the apical complex in the ancestor of apicomplexans and dinoflagellates, in a non-parasitic context”. We then link the early presence of the apical complex to the emergence of convergent parasite morphologies, as outlined previously, so this new information fits in very well.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors have chosen not to use the term apicoplast. Given its wide usage in the literature, a mention of the term early on, and justification for using the more general term plastid to embrace the homologous organelles in those relatives without an apicoplast complex such as the dinozoa, would be appropriate in the Introduction.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, we now introduced the term in the Introduction. We explain that “The apicoplast is a four-membrane plastid (a broader term we will use hereinafter to describe the organelle in both parasitic and free-living organisms)”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Another language issue is whether or not the authors are using formal or informal names for taxa.

Given the complex taxonomic history of the group, different formal names or ranks are still being used for Apicomplexa or its subgroups (e.g., phylum vs. subphylum for Apicomplexa; note that Adl et al., 2019, move away from taxonomic ranks altogether). Since the taxonomy is not in the focus here either, we have adopted informal names more widely in the text and in Figure 1A. We kept formal taxonomic group names in Figure 1—figure supplement 1 for comparison, and we point to this in the Figure 1 legend. The one formal name that we keep using more widely is “Apicomplexa”, which we now introduce as a phylum in the Introduction. We avoided instances of informal names at sentence beginnings and used single forms (“cryptosporidians”) throughout the manuscript, as suggested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The title needs to be made more precise and exciting.</p></disp-quote><p>We rephrased the title in an active voice, which makes it more interesting and explicit at the same time: it highlights two key discoveries, which the reviewers also pointed out in their summary.</p></body></sub-article></article>
