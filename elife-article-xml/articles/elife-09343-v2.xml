However, little is known about the involvement of mC in response to environmental cues. Using whole genome bisulfite sequencing to assess the spatio-temporal dynamics of mC in rice grown under phosphate starvation and recovery conditions, we identified widespread phosphate starvation-induced changes in mC, preferentially localized in transposable elements (TEs) close to highly induced genes. These changes in mC occurred after changes in nearby gene transcription, were mostly <italic>DCL3a</italic>-independent, and could partially be propagated through mitosis, however no evidence of meiotic transmission was observed. Similar analyses performed in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> revealed a very limited effect of phosphate starvation on mC, suggesting a species-specific mechanism. Overall, this suggests that TEs in proximity to environmentally induced genes are silenced via hypermethylation, and establishes the temporal hierarchy of transcriptional and epigenomic changes in response to stress.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.09343.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.09343.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09343.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Phosphate is an important nutrient for all living organisms. This chemical group forms part of the backbone of DNA molecules, and has a crucial role in many chemical reactions that occur inside cells. Plants in particular need a source of phosphate to grow. This is why agricultural fertilizers are rich in phosphate, but unfortunately, the use of fertilizers is not sustainable. Many researchers are now looking for new ways to maintain high crop yields without chemical fertilizers, and understanding how crops are affected in times of shortage will be pivotal to achieving this goal.</p><p>DNA contains coded information in the form of genes, which can either be switched on or off. Chemical marks added to the DNA can earmark genes for activation or inactivation, a bit like handwritten annotations in an instruction manual. One example is the addition of a chemical tag called a methyl group to one of the letters of the DNA code—so-called ‘cytosine methylation’. However, little is known about how the pattern of these chemical marks on DNA changes in response to changes in the environment.</p><p>Secco et al. investigated changes in cytosine methylation in both rice and <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> plants that had been deprived of phosphate. <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, or thale cress, is a model plant that is often studied by plant biologists because it is small and grows quickly. The experiments showed that when rice plants were not given enough phosphate, the pattern of DNA methylation changed. This was particularly true around certain genes that help the plants survive in these difficult conditions. Notably, in the absence of phosphate, methylation also occurs more often in DNA sequences called transposable elements that sit close to these useful genes, and less often around other genes.</p><p>Transposable elements, also known as ‘jumping genes’ can move within the genome and thus potentially have damaging effects through altering the DNA sequence. However, DNA methylation normally prevents this from happening. Therefore, the extra methylation observed by Secco et al. may be a cautionary measure to inactivate these transposable elements and limit their potential deleterious effects. Further experiments went on to show that these useful genes seem to be switched on before the DNA of these transposable elements is methylated, implying that the extra methylation observed in these transposable elements is a consequence of the activation of these nearby useful genes.</p><p>By contrast, similar experiments performed in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> reveal a very limited change in DNA methylation when the plants are grown under stressful conditions. This might be because <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> has considerably fewer transposable elements than rice. The next challenge will be to explore how significant the environmentally induced silencing of transposable elements is to the stress responses and genome integrity of crop plants.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.09343.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.09343.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>epigenome</kwd><kwd>DNA methylation</kwd><kwd>nutrient stress</kwd><kwd>transcriptome</kwd><kwd>phosphate starvation</kwd><kwd>rice</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>A. thaliana</italic></kwd><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000936</institution-id><institution>Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GBMF3034</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ecker</surname><given-names>Joseph R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000923</institution-id><institution>Australian Research Council (ARC)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FT120100862</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lister</surname><given-names>Ryan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000923</institution-id><institution>Australian Research Council (ARC)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FS100100022</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Secco</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000923</institution-id><institution>Australian Research Council (ARC)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DE150100460</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Secco</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000923</institution-id><institution>Australian Research Council (ARC)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CE140100008</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Whelan</surname><given-names>James</given-names></name><name><surname>Lister</surname><given-names>Ryan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Phosphate starvation in rice induces widespread, but transient, modulation of DNA methylation near stress responsive genes that is independent from the RNA-directed DNA methylation pathway.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Phosphorus (P) is one of the most important macronutrients for all living organisms, being a key component of nucleic acids and membrane phospholipids, as well as being an essential element for energy-mediated metabolic processes. Plants preferentially absorb this nutrient as inorganic phosphate (Pi), a form of P with low availability and mobility in the soil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Poirier and Bucher, 2002</xref>). As a consequence, Pi is one of the most limiting nutrients for plant growth and development in most agricultural soils. To overcome these issues, application of large quantities of Pi fertilizers has been the primary strategy to maintain crop yields. Yet, this approach is increasingly economically and environmentally unsustainable, with the reserves of Pi rocks greatly diminishing. It is therefore critical to better understand the molecular mechanisms involved in Pi homeostasis in order to generate plants with increased P acquisition and use efficiency, associated with sustained yields that will contribute to improve global food security. Plants have developed a wide set of sophisticated responses aimed at acquiring and utilizing Pi efficiently in order to maintain cellular Pi homeostasis even under Pi limiting conditions (−Pi) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rouached et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chiou and Lin, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Peret et al., 2011</xref>). In −Pi, the expression level of genes encoding high affinity Pi transporters (<italic>PTs</italic>) in the roots increases in order to increase Pi uptake, as well as inducing and secreting acid phosphatases and ribonucleases to mobilize organically bound P. In contrast, the levels of P-containing intermediates such as nucleotides, RNA and phospholipids are dramatically reduced under −Pi, with phospholipids being replaced with sulpho- and galactolipids. As a consequence, genes involved in sulpho- and galactolipids synthesis, such as sulpholipid synthases (<italic>SQDs</italic>) and monogalactosyl diacylglycerol synthases (<italic>MGDs</italic>) are highly up-regulated in −Pi conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Misson et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59a">Secco et al., 2013a</xref>). Members of the SPX-domain containing protein family (e.g., <italic>SPX</italic>, <italic>PHO1</italic> and <italic>NLA</italic>) have also been shown to be key regulators of Pi homeostasis, being involved in Pi transport and signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rouached et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kant et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Secco et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59a">Secco et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Puga et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wang et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>In addition to the complex regulation observed at the transcriptome level, studies have shown that Pi homeostasis is also regulated by several post-transcriptional mechanisms involving non-coding RNAs, such as miR827, miR399 and <italic>IPS1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Franco-Zorrilla et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chiou and Lin, 2011</xref>) as well as post-translational changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bayle et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Park et al., 2014</xref>). However, only a limited number of studies have assessed the potential involvement of altered DNA or histone modifications in response to Pi starvation, and stresses in general (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sahu et al., 2013</xref>). Smith and colleagues previously reported that in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>) the histone variant H2A.Z was deposited at a number of Pi starvation-induced (PSI) genes and that a loss H2A.Z resulted with their de-repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Smith et al., 2010</xref>). In addition, using low resolution, non-quantitative and locus-specific methods, several studies have shown the potential involvement of altered DNA methylation in response to stresses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Labra et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chinnusamy and Zhu, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wang et al., 2011a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">2011b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Karan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen and Zhou, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sahu et al., 2013</xref>). Deep sequencing technologies now enable whole genome single base resolution analysis of DNA methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cokus et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lister et al., 2008</xref>), thus enabling global assessment of changes in DNA methylation in response to environmental and developmental cues. Indeed, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dowen et al. (2012)</xref> previously reported that biotic stress could induce dynamic changes in DNA methylation of repetitive sequences or transposons, often coupled to transcriptional changes of neighbouring genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dowen et al., 2012</xref>). In addition, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Zhong et al. (2013)</xref> recently reported that changes in DNA methylation patterns play a role in the process of tomato fruit ripening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Zhong et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Cytosine DNA methylation (mC) is involved in a range of important biological processes, including silencing of repetitive sequences and transposable elements (TEs), genomic imprinting, and stable gene silencing. In plants, DNA methylation exists in all sequence contexts (CG, CHG, CHH, where H = A, C or T) through the activity of multiple genetically distinct pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Law and Jacobsen, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Matzke and Mosher, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mirouze and Vitte, 2014</xref>). De novo DNA methylation is mediated by the RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) pathways. In the canonical RdDM pathway, transcripts produced from the RNA polymerase IV (Pol IV) are then copied into dsRNAs by the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RDR2) before being processed into 24-nucleotides (nt) small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) by DICER-LIKE 3 (DCL3). These newly generated siRNAs are then loaded onto ARGONAUTE 4 (AGO4) before being guided towards the nascent scaffold of RNAs transcribed by the RNA polymerase V (Pol V) through sequence complementarity. Finally, this complex recruits the DNA methyltransferase DOMAINS REARRANGED METHYLTRANSFERASE 2 (DRM2) to perform de novo methylation in all sequence contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Matzke and Mosher, 2014</xref>). Recently, another RdDM pathway, which is independent of Pol IV and DCL3, has been identified and is referred to as RDR6-RdDM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nuthikattu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Panda and Slotkin, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Creasey et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Matzke and Mosher, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bond and Baulcombe, 2015</xref>). In this pathway, Pol II derived transcripts are copied by RDR6 into dsRNAs before being processed into 21-22-nt siRNAs by DCL2 and DCL4. These siRNAs can then either induce post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS) when loaded onto AGO1 or initiate de novo DNA methylation when associated with AGO2, thus ultimately triggering the canonical RdDM pathway. Maintenance of DNA methylation through replication is mediated by METHYLTRANSFERASE 1 (MET1) and CHROMOMETHYLASE 3 (CMT3) methyltransferases in the CG and CHG contexts, respectively, and are thus referred to as symmetrical methylation, while methylation in the non-symmetrical CHH context has to be established de novo after DNA replication and involves the activities of the DOMAINS REARRANGED METHYLTRANSFERASE 1 and 2 (DRM1/DRM2) and CMT2 methyltransferases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Finnegan et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Du et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Zemach et al., 2013</xref>). Within the plant species studied to date, the general methylation state of particular genomic features are relatively conserved, with TEs often highly methylated in all contexts, and CG methylation commonly located in gene bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Feng et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Zemach et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mirouze and Vitte, 2014</xref>). However, large differences in global DNA methylation levels can be observed amongst plant species potentially associated with different TE content in the various plant genomes. Indeed, the TE-rich genome (∼40%) of rice has a much higher aggregate level of DNA methylation than the TE-poor (∼15%) <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Li et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ragupathy et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mirouze and Vitte, 2014</xref>).</p><p>Given the paucity of past studies assessing the impact of abiotic stresses upon the plant DNA methylome and the temporal relationship between DNA methylation and transcriptional changes, we performed a comprehensive spatio-temporal assessment of the impact of limiting a central plant macronutrient, Pi, upon DNA methylation patterns and transcription, in rice (<italic>Oryza sativa</italic>) and <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. Using whole genome bisulfite sequencing, we identified species-specific, widespread and mitotically heritable changes in DNA methylation in response to Pi starvation that are particularly enriched at stress responsive genes. These changes in DNA methylation occur after changes in nearby gene expression, and are thus likely a consequence of induced transcription of nearby Pi responsive genes, as well as being largely independent of <italic>DCL3a</italic>. Altogether, we demonstrate a species-specific process in which Pi starvation causes highly localized changes in the genomic DNA methylation patterns in rice, which may act to repress the potentially deleterious activity of TEs located near genes that are highly induced upon stress.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Transcriptional responses of rice to Pi starvation and resupply</title><p>A comprehensive time-course experiment of Pi-starved plants was undertaken, spanning medium (3 and 7 days), and long-term (21 days up to 52 days) Pi deprivation (−Pi), as well as both short term (1 and 3 days) and long-term (31 days) recovery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The 52 days time point consisting of 21 days starvation +31 days recovery enabled investigation of the effects of long term resupply on Pi starved plants, and coincided with the emergence of the first panicles and grains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). Pre-germinated rice seedlings were grown for 14 days in Pi sufficient conditions (0.32 mM Pi) before being transferred to either Pi sufficient (0.32 mM Pi) or Pi deficient (0 mM Pi) media for 21 days. After 21 days of Pi deficient treatment, half of the plants were either maintained under Pi deficient conditions or re-supplied with Pi (0.32 mM) for 1, 3 or 31 days. To confirm the effectiveness of the Pi starvation and resupply treatments, physiological and molecular analyses were performed. Growth analyses revealed that 21 days of Pi deprivation resulted in a 2.3 fold decrease in shoot biomass (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>), however no significant differences could be observed for the root biomass after 21 days of treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Consequently, the root-to-shoot biomass ratio, a parameter often used to assess the efficiency of various nutrient stresses, was significantly altered (t-test, p &lt; 0.05), with plants grown under Pi deficient conditions for 21 days showing a 2.2 fold increase compared to plants grown under Pi sufficient conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>), which is consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Reymond et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jiang et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59a">Secco et al., 2013a</xref>).

Hierarchical clustering of the steady state transcript abundance of the 5570 genes identified as significantly differentially expressed (Cuffdiff, FDR &lt; 0.05) in at least one of the time points revealed a gradual increase in the number and fold change of differentially expressed genes upon −Pi, associated with the length of the Pi deprivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,E</xref>; Figure 1—source data 1, available at Dryad, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Secco et al., 2015</xref>).

Surprisingly, 52 days of Pi deprivation was associated with a decrease in the number and extent of significantly differentially abundant transcripts, including most of the PSI marker genes, potentially due to the concurrent occurrence of panicle development and grain filling. Indeed, a previous study aimed at profiling the shoots of rice grown in the field throughout their life cycle identified two major transcriptome changes, occurring just before panicle differentiation and straight after flowering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sato et al., 2011</xref>). In addition, the transcription of some of the PSI genes, including <italic>MGD2</italic> and <italic>PHO2</italic>, was reduced before the panicle differentiation, suggesting that the rice plants undergo a major change in Pi homeostasis at the vegetative-reproductive phase transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sato et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Resupplying Pi for 1 day after 21 days of starvation was sufficient for the transcript abundance of 40% of PSI differentially regulated genes to return to a level that was not significantly different from the +Pi condition at the matched time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,E</xref>). Within 3 days of Pi resupply, the internal root Pi content was similar to that of Pi sufficient plants and the transcript abundance of 80% of the 5570 PSI differentially expressed genes had already returned to levels equivalent to Pi sufficient conditions. After 31 days of Pi resupply, the transcript abundance of only 80 PSI genes remained significantly different compared to Pi sufficient conditions. Overall, the physiological and transcriptional changes associated with Pi starvation and resupply confirmed the effectiveness of the Pi treatments, as well as the capacity of the rice plants to rapidly sense and respond to these changing nutrient conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Pi starvation induces widespread changes in DNA methylation, enriched at key regulators of Pi homeostasis</title><p>To test whether Pi starvation affects genomic DNA methylation in rice, whole genome base resolution profiling of DNA methylation by MethylC-seq was performed on rice roots in triplicate at each time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Altogether, 45 root single-base resolution high coverage DNA methylomes were generated (77–87% of cytosines covered by at least one read, 82–88% of the genome) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). In order to identify a set of conserved PSI differentially methylated regions (DMRs) in the roots, the 21, 22 and 24 time points were utilized, resulting in the selection of 9 +Pi samples and 9 −Pi samples. The methylation levels in all sequence contexts (CNN) were then assessed for these samples, and only regions that showed significant differences in methylation levels (FDR &lt; 0.01) in at least 7 of the 9 samples in each of the conditions were considered for further analysis, resulting in the identification of 175 high confidence root PSI DMRs (Figure 2—source data 1, available at Dryad, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Secco et al., 2015</xref>). Among these 175 PSI DMRs, 84% were hypermethylated in response to Pi starvation (147 hypermethylated, 28 hypomethylated regions, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). As observed for transcript abundance, 3 and 7 days of Pi deprivation resulted in fewer changes in DNA methylation levels, which increased with the duration of the Pi starvation. Indeed, hierarchical clustering of the 45 root samples based on their CNN methylation levels in the 175 PSI DMRs revealed two main clusters, with cluster 1 containing all +Pi samples as well as the 3 and 7 days −Pi samples, and cluster 2 comprising all long-term −Pi time points (≥21 days) in addition to the Pi re-supplied samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Furthermore, unlike transcript abundance, where 3 days of Pi resupply was sufficient for the majority of PSI genes to return towards non-stressed level, DNA methylation levels were unaffected by 3 days of Pi recovery. While long-term (31 days) Pi resupply resulted in the PSI DMR methylation level moving towards the Pi sufficient methylation levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), hierarchical clustering analysis revealed that the long-term resupply samples were still more closely related to the long-term Pi starvation samples rather than those of +Pi, as assessed by methylation level at the PSI DMRs in roots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Given the role of DNA methylation in repressing TE activity, and the high frequency of TEs in the rice genome, accounting for 40% of the total genome length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ragupathy et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mirouze and Vitte, 2014</xref>), the position of the DMRs with respect to annotated TEs was assessed. Among the 175 root PSI DMRs, 90% overlapped with TEs, with Miniature Inverted-repeat Transposable Elements (MITEs), the most common class of TEs in the rice genome (69% of all TEs), accounting for 58% of the DMRs overlapping with TEs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). To investigate the specificity of the changes in DNA methylation in TEs, DNA methylation levels were assessed in TEs overlapping PSI DMRs as well as in all annotated TEs after 21 days of Pi treatment. Altogether, while TEs overlapping PSI DMRs show significant changes in DNA methylation in response to Pi starvation, the majority of all annotated TEs are unaffected by Pi starvation, suggesting that Pi starvation triggers specific and localized changes in DNA methylation in a subset of all annotated TEs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). In addition, RNA-seq analysis failed to reveal any significantly differentially expressed TEs (Cuffdiff, FDR &lt; 0.05) that overlapped with PSI DMRs, between Pi sufficient and deficient conditions (7 and 21 days), with more than 80% of them not being expressed (Figure 2—source data 2, available at Dryad, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Secco et al., 2015</xref>). Next, each of the 175 PSI DMRs were assigned to the nearest gene, resulting in the association of 126 unique genes with PSI DMRs (Figure 2—source data 1, available at Dryad, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Secco et al., 2015</xref>). Gene transcript abundance analyses revealed that 66 of these DMR-associated genes (52%) were differentially expressed by &gt;2 fold (FDR &lt; 0.05) in response to 21 days −Pi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). The steady state transcript abundance of 35% of the 126 genes was &gt;4 fold higher following 21 days Pi starvation. Furthermore, gene ontology analyses revealed a strong enrichment for genes encoding proteins involved in phosphate homeostasis, such as acid phosphatases, phosphate transporters, and factors involved in glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>).

Firstly, changes in shoot methylation levels were assessed at the 175 PSI DMRs identified in the roots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, Figure 2—source data 1, available at Dryad, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Secco et al., 2015</xref>), revealing similar changes in DNA methylation levels in response to Pi starvation in both roots and shoots, though to a lesser extent in the shoots. Secondly, shoot methylomes under Pi-sufficient and deficient conditions were analysed in order to identify shoot PSI DMRs. Due to the lower number of replicates used to identify shoot PSI DMRs (n = 3) compared to the root PSI DMRs (n = 9), a less stringent FDR cut-off of &lt; 0.05 was selected for further analysis, resulting in the identification of 341 shoot PSI DMRs (FDR &lt; 0.05) (Figure 2—source data 3, available at Dryad, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Secco et al., 2015</xref>). Assigning the 341 shoot PSI DMRs to the nearest genes identified 43 distinct genes that were significantly differentially regulated by Pi starvation in the shoots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref>). In addition, analysis of the methylation levels in all contexts (CNN) revealed that the 341 shoot PSI DMRs had similar patterns of methylation in both roots and shoots, suggesting that Pi starvation affects DNA methylation in roots and shoots in a similar manner.

After 3 and 7 days of Pi starvation, 18% and 55% of the PSI DMR associated genes, respectively, showed significant changes in transcript abundance (Cuffdiff, FDR &lt; 0.05), while only 5% and 9% of the 100 PSI DMRs showed significant changes in DNA methylation compared to +Pi samples (t-test, FDR &lt; 0.05) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>, Figure 3—source data 1, available at Dryad, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Secco et al., 2015</xref>). Long term Pi deprivation (≥21 days −Pi) was sufficient to induce significant changes in both gene transcript abundance and DNA methylation levels, with all PSI DMRs being significantly differentially methylated after 24 days of −Pi compared to +Pi (t-test, FDR &lt; 0.05). Furthermore, while resupplying Pi starved plants with Pi for 3 days resulted in 87% of the DMR associated genes differentially expressed upon Pi starvation to return to Pi sufficient-like levels, 94% of PSI DMRs still showed significant differences in DNA methylation levels compared to +Pi conditions (t-test, FDR &lt; 0.05). Finally, while 52 days of Pi starvation resulted in only 22% of PSI DMR associated genes showing significant changes in transcript abundance (Cuffdiff, FDR &lt; 0.05) compared to +Pi, likely a consequence of the floral transition and nutrient reallocation to the grains, the majority of PSI DMRs remained unaffected, with 83% of PSI DMRs still showing significant changes in DNA methylation after 52 days −Pi compared to 52 days +Pi (t-test, FDR &lt; 0.05). Resupplying Pi for 31 days resulted in 11 of the 100 PSI DMRs showing significant persisting changes in DNA methylation (t-test, FDR &lt; 0.05) while no significant changes in gene transcription could be observed compared to +Pi. Taken together, Pi deprivation and Pi resupply appear to first rapidly modulate the transcript levels of genes induced by the stress before subsequently inducing changes in DNA methylation, indicating that the Pi starvation-induced changes in transcription precede, and are potentially causal, for the changes in DNA methylation. This induction of methylation may be involved in repressing the activity of specific TEs close to highly induced genes, via hypermethylation of the TEs in the CHH context.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Phosphate starvation induced DMRs are mainly transient</title><p>Due to the observation that differences in DNA methylation in some PSI DMRs may persist despite 31 days of Pi resupply, during which root fresh weight is increased by more than 2.2 fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), we wanted to assess the extent of potential transmission of changes in DNA methylation through mitosis. Hierarchical clustering of 45 root samples based on their methylation levels in all sequence contexts (CNN) in the 175 PSI DMRs revealed that the 31 days Pi recovered roots were more closely related to the −Pi samples than the +Pi samples, further indicating that some stress induced differences in DNA methylation can persist despite extended Pi recovery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). However, resupplying Pi for 31 days resulted in 96 of the 175 PSI DMRs showing more than a 2 fold reduction in the differential DNA methylation levels induced by 52 days −Pi, when compared to +Pi, suggesting that the majority of PSI DMRs are returning towards Pi sufficient levels after 31 days of Pi resupply (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Of note, despite identifying significant persisting differences in DNA methylation, Pi resupplied samples often showed DNA methylation levels that were intermediate between +Pi and −Pi samples. These persistent differences in methylation levels preferentially occurred in the CHH context (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) and were associated with 13 unique genes located nearby, including key regulators of Pi homeostasis such as <italic>SPX2</italic> and <italic>MGD2</italic>.

Indeed, by the time the panicles appeared (∼40 days after initiation of treatment), the recovering plants had been re-supplied with Pi for ∼20 days, and should thus have a physiological status similar to that of Pi sufficient plants. After 52 days of Pi treatment, panicles were collected from plants continuously grown in +Pi or −Pi, as well as 21 days Pi starved plants resupplied for 31 days, using independent triplicates. Generation of high coverage methylomes enabled the identification of 36 PSI DMRs in the panicles of plants grown for 52 days in +Pi and −Pi (FDR &lt; 0.05). However, no significant differences (t-test, FDR &lt; 0.05) could be observed in the DNA methylation levels of these 36 regions between panicles of plants grown for 52 days in −Pi compared to those resupplied with Pi for 31 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, Figure 4—source data 2, available at Dryad, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Secco et al., 2015</xref>). Yet, using a less stringent FDR cutoff of &lt; 0.1, two of the 36 PSI DMRs identified in the panicles, including SPX2_DMR2, showed persisting differences in DNA methylation despite 31 days of Pi resupply, suggesting that a limited number of PSI DMRs could potentially be transmitted to newly generated tissue that has never experienced the stress.</p><p>We next tested whether PSI DMRs could be transmitted from Pi stressed plants to their progeny, and thus potentially act as a transgenerational stress memory mechanism. To do so, individual seeds from five individual plants continuously grown under Pi sufficient or deficient conditions were harvested, and subsequently germinated and grown for 10 days under Pi sufficient conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), before performing whole genome bisulfite sequencing on the corresponding root genomic DNA (n = 5 for each condition, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>).

Overall, despite Pi starvation having a limited effect upon DNA methylation in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> compared to rice, with only 2 PSI DMRs identified, the location of these PSI DMRs appears to be conserved, with hypermethylated regions overlapping with specific TEs that are close to highly induced PSI genes.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Plants have developed a wide array of mechanisms to tolerate changing environmental conditions. However, despite our understanding of Pi homeostasis greatly increasing during the past decade, very little is known about the potential role of changes in the epigenome in response to Pi starvation, and to stresses in general. Comprehensive methylome profiling coupled with an extensive time course experiment enabled investigation of the presence and potential role of dynamic epigenomic changes upon stress, revealing the temporal relationship between changes in DNA methylation and transcription, and the stability of altered DNA methylation states through mitosis and meiosis. Indeed, this study provides insights into the dynamic changes in DNA methylation in response to Pi starvation, with the identification of widespread changes in DNA methylation near PSI genes, in a species-dependent manner, likely correlated with the TE content of the genome. It is well known that plant genomes exhibit a very large diversity of size and repeat content as well as methylation levels, which were recently shown to be positively correlated, thus highlighting the central role of DNA methylation in repressing the potentially deleterious activity of TEs through hypermethylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mirouze and Vitte, 2014</xref>). However, the majority of DNA methylation analyses performed in plants to date have focused on <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, despite being relatively depleted of TEs (15–20% of the genome) and being poorly methylated compared to other plant genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mirouze and Vitte, 2014</xref>). Potentially, the differences in DNA methylation changes observed in rice and <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> in response to Pi starvation could primarily be due to the differential frequency of TEs in the genome of each species.</p><p>To date, only a limited number of studies have comprehensively investigated the involvement of DNA methylation in response to adverse environmental conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dowen et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Liang et al., 2014</xref>). Several studies have reported that changes in the environment can affect the methylation status of some regions of the genome, using low resolution and non-quantitative techniques such as methylation-sensitive amplification polymorphism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Choi and Sano, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hauser et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wang et al., 2011a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">2011b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Karan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Shaik and Ramakrishna, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sahu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Yu et al., 2013</xref>). However, these studies have lacked the resolution to provide the specific context and genomic location of the changes in DNA methylation, thus offering limited insights into the potential role of stress-induced changes in DNA methylation. While this study primarily focused in the main organ involved in nutrient sensing and uptake, namely the root, both roots and shoots appeared to exhibit similar changes in DNA methylation in response to Pi starvation. In addition, all but one of these DMRs overlapped with TEs. While, several studies have suggested that there is a negative relationship between methylation of TEs and nearby gene transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hollister and Gaut, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahmed et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Eichten et al., 2012</xref>), we observed the opposite trend, with hypermethylated DMRs being located in close proximity to PSI genes. Consequently, we sought to shed light upon the temporal hierarchy, and thus potential causal relationships, between the observed environmentally-induced differential DNA methylation and the changes in gene transcript abundance. Using our time-course experiment, we demonstrated that upon Pi stress, changes in transcription occurred prior to changes in DNA methylation levels, thus suggesting that induction of gene transcription may be causal for the differential DNA methylation. In addition, since almost all the regions gaining DNA methylation in response to Pi deprivation overlap with TEs, such a process could potentially constitute a mechanism to repress the activity of specific TEs that are near highly induced PSI genes when plants are confronted with −Pi conditions. Indeed, vonHoldt and colleagues recently showed that the methylation pattern of TEs is a complex function of TE size, age and distance to a gene, with young TEs being preferentially poorly methylated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">vonHoldt et al., 2012</xref>). During Pi stress, PSI genes are highly expressed, presumably requiring increased chromatin accessibility to facilitate access of Pol II and other transcription machinery, which may facilitate the transcription of poorly methylated nearby TEs, with potentially deleterious effects upon the genome such as insertional inactivation of genes and ectopic recombination. This hypothesis is strengthened by the fact that the majority of the hypermethylated PSI DMRs are independent of <italic>DCL3a</italic>, a key component of the canonical RdDM pathway. Thus, we hypothesize that the RDR6-RdDM pathway, another entry point into RdDM that recognizes Pol II-derived TE transcripts, may act to methylate these TEs. Overall, the observed increase in DNA methylation in specific TEs located close to PSI genes provides insights into a cellular activity that may act to maintain localized suppression of transposable elements in genomic regions that must be transcriptionally activated to respond to environmental perturbation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09343.032</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Model of the role of DNA methylation in response to Pi starvation.</title><p>Schematic of a PSI gene associated with two TEs. TE A represents TEs that are located distant from genes and are highly methylated, while TE B represents TEs that are close to genes and lowly methylated. Upon short term Pi deprivation, RNA polymerase II is recruited to Pi starvation-induced (PSI) genes, resulting in increased PSI gene expression. These high levels of RNA polymerase II could induce transcription of nearby and poorly methylated TEs, such as TE B, which could have deleterious effects upon the plant. As a consequence, upon prolonged Pi deprivation, TEs that are close to highly expressed stress-induced genes are hypermethylated, via a <italic>DCL3a</italic>-independent mechanism, thus preventing their transcription via RNA polymerase II.

Among the 11 <italic>DCL3a-</italic>dependent PSI DMRs, those associated with <italic>SPX1</italic> and <italic>SPX2</italic> were the most affected by reduced transcription of <italic>DCL3a</italic>. It has recently been shown that both SPX1 and SPX2 can inhibit phosphate starvation responses through Pi-dependant direct interaction with PHR2, a key transcription factor controlling the majority of Pi-responsive genes. Under Pi sufficient conditions, SPX1 and SXP2 are tightly bound to PHR2, preventing PHR2 from interacting with its cognate binding sites, and suppressing induction of Pi responsive genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Puga et al., 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). Surprisingly, <italic>SPX2</italic> transcript abundance was &gt;65 fold lower in the <italic>DCL3a</italic> RNAi line compared to WT, potentially enabling PHR2 to interact with its target binding sites and induce transcription of PSI genes. Such a mechanism would thus explain the high number of differentially expressed genes observed between WT and the <italic>DCL3a</italic> RNAi line under +Pi conditions (3531), compared to −Pi (1791), where <italic>SPX2</italic> is expressed at similar levels between WT and the <italic>DCL3a</italic> RNAi line. However, it remains unclear how the knockdown of <italic>DCL3a</italic> can repress <italic>SPX2</italic> to such an extent in +Pi conditions. It is unlikely that the repression of <italic>SPX2</italic> is a direct consequence of <italic>DCL3a</italic>-dependent changes in DNA methylation at this locus, since similar DNA methylation patterns are observed in <italic>DCL3a</italic> RNAi plants under +Pi and −Pi, while <italic>SPX2</italic> is highly induced in −Pi and not expressed in +Pi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). In addition, several studies have shown that changes in DNA methylation within or near DNA binding elements could interfere with the binding of cognate transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Deng et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bird, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Zhong et al., 2013</xref>). Zhong and colleagues (2013) recently showed in tomato that binding sites for RIN (Ripening Inhibitor), one the main transcription factors involved in fruit ripening, were frequently demethylated during ripening, thus enabling the induction of ripening genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Zhong et al., 2013</xref>). Such a mechanism could potentially occur in rice, fine-tuning the expression of specific genes involved in Pi homeostasis by regulating the binding capacity of specific transcription factors to PSI genes. However, the involvement of such a mechanism in the Pi starvation response remains to be determined.</p><p>The Pi resupply experiment allowed us to determine whether PSI DMRs could be maintained despite an extensive period of Pi recovery and tissue growth. While the majority of PSI DMRs returned towards +Pi DNA methylation levels, 14 root PSI DMRs showed significant sustained changes in DNA methylation despite 31 days of Pi resupply, suggesting that these epialleles are likely to be transmitted to newly generated cells, and can thus be mitotically inherited. In addition, unlike animals where DNA methylation is reset in primordial germ cells and during embryogenesis, DNA methylation states in plants can be stably transmitted from parents to offspring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kinoshita et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Becker et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Schmitz et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Weigel and Colot, 2012</xref>), and thus could potentially establish a transgenerational ‘memory’ of the stress. However, to date few reports have studied the potential heritability of stress-induced DNA methylation changes, and no evidence of transgenerational transmission of stress-induced differential DNA methylation exists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hauser et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pecinka and Scheid, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sahu et al., 2013</xref>). Boyko and colleagues reported that the progeny of stress-treated plants had increased homologous recombination frequency and global DNA methylation levels, as well as higher tolerance to stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Boyko et al., 2010</xref>). However, no evidence of transgenerational transmission of differences in DNA methylation was observed, and the increase in global genome methylation levels did not persist in successive generations during the absence of stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Boyko et al., 2010</xref>). Additionally, several recent studies suggest that specific mechanisms exist to prevent transgenerational inheritance of stress-induced epigenetic states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baubec et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Crevillen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Iwasaki and Paszkowski, 2014</xref>). Furthermore, Hagmann and colleagues, using a near-clonal North American <italic>A. thaliana</italic> population that has diverged under natural conditions for at least a century, recently showed that environment-induced changes are only minor contributors to durable genome-wide heritable epigenetic variation, with more than 97% of the total methylated genome space not being altered by the environment across dozens of generations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hagmann et al., 2015</xref>). In this study, we found no evidence of transgenerational inheritance of PSI DMRs, suggesting that PSI DMRs, and potentially most stress-induced differential methylation in general, are not transmitted to their progeny and are thus not likely to contribute to transgenerational stress memory.</p><p>Altogether, this study reveals a species-specific process in which an abiotic stress induces dynamic and widespread changes in DNA methylation in rice. In addition, we establish the temporal relationship between differential transcription and DNA methylation, the limited stability of such induced DNA methylation events through mitosis, and the absence of their transmission through meiosis. These findings have important implications for interpreting the capacity of environmentally induced epialleles to influence genic transcription, and their stability through plant growth and reproduction.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plant materials and growth conditions</title><p>Rice (<italic>Oryza sativa L. cv.

To do so, a contingency table where rows indicated the position of each cytosine in the CNN context on the genome and the columns indicated the number of reads that supported a methylated cytosine or an unmethylated cytosine was generated. Next, p-values were simulated using 10,000 permutations and for each permutation, a new contingency table was generated by randomly assigning reads to cells with a probability equal to the product of the row marginal and column marginal divided by the total number of reads squared.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Detlef Weigel (Senior editor and Reviewing editor), and three reviewers. The manuscript has been improved since the previous version but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before final acceptance.</p><p>The reviewers very much appreciated your diligent follow up, and agreed that the observation of TE methylation following transcription of adjacent genes is an important one. Not only does it go against the commonly accepted wisdom of transcription being an outcome in changes of methylation, but your demonstration that this mostly does not involve the canonical RdDM pathway may also reveal a formerly unappreciated route to (somatic) methylation changes.</p><p>We would ask you for some minor tweaks. First, it would be good if the title better reflected the new data, and that you refer to the temporal order of transcription and methylation changes. Second, the reviewers were wondering whether there are phosphate-starvation-induced DMRs between DCL3a control and DCL3a stressed plants. The question that could be addressed with this is whether DCL3a is required for the stability of other regions in the genome that might not be the same as the stress-induced ones in the wild type. Finally, there are some minor changes, as listed below.</p><p>Abstract</p><p>Abstract. I find the word “proximal” a bit confusing.

The previous decision letter after peer review is shown below.]</p><p>Thank you for choosing to send your work entitled “Phosphate starvation in rice induces mitotically heritable modulation of DNA methylation at starvation responsive genes” for consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your full submission has been evaluated by Detlef Weigel (Senior editor and Reviewing editor) and three peer reviewers, and the decision was reached after discussions between all involved. Based on our discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic> at this time.</p><p>Detlef Weigel and the reviewers had a long discussion about the merits of the work. On the plus side, there was broad agreement that this is likely the most rigorous study of stress-induced DNA methylation changes in plants. On the negative side, it is difficult to come to any strong conclusions. First, the question of whether methylation changes are mostly a consequence of altered transcription or vice versa is not really solved. Much of the evidence points to transcriptional changes being more important, but there is some tantalizing evidence for the opposite scenario, such as methylation of transcription factor binding sites affecting RNA expression. However, this latter observation is not entirely new, as you point out yourself, and the statistical significance is difficult to judge without a genome-wide comparison. There is potential methylation of one PHR1 binding site, but what about all the other PHR1 binding sites in the genome, and what could be a plausible biological mechanism for such a specific effect? Finally, we appreciated the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> data. We agreed that the differences in repeat content might explain the different effects seen in this species, but overall the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> data do not help to better understand the phenomenon – with the added caveat that the experiments and analyses were not done exactly in the same way.</p><p>The agreement was that for <italic>eLife</italic>, causality of methylation and RNA expression changes would have to be established, using either chemical treatment or appropriate mutants. This would entail an entirely new set of experiments, and since it is <italic>eLife's</italic> policy to invite revision only when it is likely that the required experiments can be done in a short time frame, we are declining the study at this time. However, we think that this could in principle be appropriate for <italic>eLife</italic> with such added analyses, and we would reconsider such a substantially revised version of the work as a new submission.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1</italic>:</p><p>Secco and colleagues present one of the first single-nucleotide resolution studies on abiotic-stress-related methylation changes in plants. The experiment is well designed: rice plants are deprived of inorganic phosphate for up to 3 weeks, then are either kept under Pi deprivation or are re-supplied with Pi for another 1-31 days. The authors analyze gene expression by RNA-seq and DNA methylation by whole-genome bisulfite sequencing. The re-supply experiment is most noteworthy, as it shows very nicely a resetting of the transcriptional activity to control levels once Pi is available to the plant. The methylome, in contrast has a lag phase and only slowly returns back to the initial configuration, with some regions persistently maintaining their altered methylation pattern.</p><p>This study addresses the important question whether methylation can persistently change upon an abiotic stress signal and induce effects that would eventually allow the plant to adapt to a changing environment. Despite the quality of the data and the solid experimental setup, I have several major concerns:</p><p>1) I have had difficulties in assessing the general aim of the manuscript. On the one hand, the data presented are very descriptive, and most findings are not evaluated in detail. On the other hand, the data is presented in a way that suggests a regulatory or causal link between DNA methylation and transcription, although data support for this is only marginal or at least not verified. On several occasions the change in DNA methylation is described as being linked to the change in expression, as for the SPX2 locus, which is even given as an example of a putatively more general mechanism. In the Discussion, the authors then again refute links between methylation and expression. This latter take is much more consistent with their data (but is not kept up throughout the manuscript). For example, both hypo- and hyper-methylation-associated genes are up-regulated. Along the same line, re-establishment of control transcription levels does not correlate with re-established methylation after Pi resupply. SPX2 expression drops back to control levels after re-supply of Pi while the methylation is persistently altered. The conclusion from these observations should then be that gene expression and DNA methylation in response to Pi starvation are most likely not linked.</p><p>2) Another major concern is that many hypotheses built on the results from the methylome analysis are not verified, either statistically or experimentally, even though in many instances this would have been possible. There are numerous instances of claims about significant findings that lack statistical validation (explained below in more detail).</p><p>In the Abstract it reads that the detected changes in mC are “likely involved in the expression of repeat elements proximal to highly induced genes”. Why don't the authors use their transcriptome data or locus-specific analyses to address this important point?</p><p>3) The authors build their DMR detection on differentially methylated positions, which they then cluster into regions. It has been shown that for coverage and statistical reasons, DMPs are much easier to detect in the CG context than in CHG and CHH contexts. The DMR detection could therefore be biased towards 5mCG-rich regions. The authors should provide information on the DMPs and the distribution of the sequence contexts, so that it becomes clear whether DMR detection is skewed towards a specific context and thus towards certain genetic elements.</p><p>More importantly: why are the thresholds for DMR detection in the root and in the shoot different from each other (FDR&lt;0.01 vs. FDR&lt;0.05)? Could the lower threshold in the shoot explain why more DMRs are found in this tissue, which is not the primary Pi sensing organ?</p><p>What is the reasoning behind applying yet another FDR threshold for DMR detection in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (0.2 in this case)? It leaves the impression that the authors switch between different cut-off values in order to get some reportable DMRs where there are none or very few to report. Also, are the genes associated with these DMRs among the DEGs? It would be less confusing if the authors simply stated that no DMRs were detectable in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, as they allude to in the last paragraph of the Discussion.</p><p>Moreover, why was the sequencing for rice done on single plants while for <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> 10 plants were pooled in each replicate? Could it be that the higher number of DMRs is also due to high stochastic inter-individual variation? I suggest the authors compare differential methylation between replicates in both species. In any way it would be interesting to see the degree of that variation and how it scales to the variation between treatments. It should also be mentioned in the main text that the experimental setups significantly differed in this respect.</p><p>4) Changes in the CHH context imply that there is an involvement of the smallRNA machinery and the RdDM pathway. This is discussed nowhere in the manuscript.</p><p>5) The model on methylation-mediated binding of PHR1 to the P1BS binding motif is interesting, but it is completely speculative. Neither does the data show that expression of these genes is linked to methylation, nor do the authors provide evidence for the enhanced binding of PHR1 to the motif in its unmethylated state.</p><p>6) Transgenerational inheritance is only assessed in the context of persistence of several DMRs in the progeny of the stressed plants. As control I suggest that the authors identify DMRs between the two generations and check whether these DMRs are related to PSI loci. This way one might get an insight into DMRs induced in the germ line of the stressed plants, which would be the only ones possibly forwarded to the following generation.</p><p>Overall, the authors have generated a very interesting dataset, but, in terms of analysis and conclusions, in my view their study in its current state does not meet the standards of a high-profile publication.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2</italic>:</p><p>The manuscript by Secco and co-authors presents data on the identification of transcriptional and DNA methylation changes induced by phosphate (Pi) starvation and their dynamics in rice and to a smaller extent also <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. In rice, part of the Pi starvation up- or down-regulated genes is associated with local DNA methylation changes, including some key Pi metabolism genes. Interestingly, these changes persist even after Pi re-supply, and based on this the authors suggest their mitotic heritability. However, they are not carried into the next generation. In contrast, Pi starvation induced DNA methylation changes were much more modest in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, indicating species-specific regulatory responses.</p><p>To my knowledge, this is so far the most comprehensive study addressing stress-induced DNA methylation changes. It provides important data towards the frequently proposed, but rarely evidenced, role of DNA methylation and transposable elements in controlling gene transcription.</p><p>I consider this study as an obvious candidate for publication in <italic>eLife</italic> upon revision.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3</italic>:</p><p>This study addresses the role of DNA methylation in plant gene regulation - specifically its role in transcriptional changes during phosphate starvation in rice. The authors perform a deep analysis of transcripts and DNA methylation using sequencing, following controlled phosphate starvation. They identify a set of genes that show transcriptional up-regulation together with coincident DNA demethylation in regions close to the TSS. Many of these genes are known to play functional roles in the phosphate starvation response. The authors demonstrate that many of these demethylated regions correspond to MITE transposons that have inserted close to the gene.</p><p>This is a thorough and detailed analysis, but it is essentially descriptive. It is unclear the extent to which the methylation changes are cause or effect of gene transcriptional induction. A number of mechanisms are possible, for example transcription may promote DNA demethylation via DNA glycosylases and/or inhibit DNA methylation maintenance. Mutations are available in rice DNA methylation factors, e.g. MET1 PMID 25002488 and DCL3 PMID 24554078, that may facilitate mechanistic experiments to test these ideas.</p><p>Transcriptional induction via transcription factors may be the most important factor here, which directly leads to demethylation of proximal TEs. In this scenario the methylation may not play an important role in control of gene expression. Removal of the methylation via mutation would allow expression of the target genes and associated TEs to be monitored to test the models proposed by the authors. It should also be possible to correlate Pol-II ChIP localisation with demethylation, in addition to other 5'-associated chromatin marks, e.g. H2A.Z, H3K4 methylation, nucleosome free regions. Further information is required to address how this methylation is removed and the extent to which it is really exerting an influence on the regulation of the genes of interest.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09343.035</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>We would ask you for some minor tweaks.

We believe this is important given that there is a very frequent assumption that changes in DNA methylation drive changes in transcription. Accordingly, in this revised manuscript we have:</p><p>1) Added an earlier time point to our extensive phosphate starvation time course experiment, enabling us to establish the temporal hierarchy between changes in DNA methylation and transcript abundance. With this new data we clearly show that the changes in DNA methylation occur after the changes in transcript abundance. Thus, the observed DNA methylation changes are likely a consequence of increased transcription of the proximal stress responsive genes. Therefore, this study provides insights into a cellular activity that potentially repress the activity of specific transposable elements in genomic regions that must be transcriptionally activated to respond to environmental perturbation.</p><p>2) Performed a new phosphate starvation experiment, including the suggested <italic>DCL3a</italic> RNAi line, which is impaired in 24nt siRNA biogenesis. As suggested by reviewer 3, this new experiment sheds light on the mechanism involved in regulating these stress-induced changes in DNA methylation.

There are numerous instances of claims about significant findings that lack statistical validation (explained below in more detail)</italic>.</p><p><italic>In the abstract it reads that the detected changes in mC are</italic> “<italic>likely involved in the expression of repeat elements proximal to highly induced genes</italic>”<italic>. Why don't the authors use their transcriptome data or locus-specific analyses to address this important point</italic>?</p><p>In the revised version of the manuscript, all claims about significant findings now include appropriate statistical validation. Due to extensive changes in the manuscript/Abstract, the Abstract sentence cited by Reviewer 1 is no longer present in the current version of the manuscript. Nonetheless, the following sentence has been added in the manuscript: “in addition, RNA-seq analysis failed to reveal any significantly differentially expressed TEs (Cuffdiff, FDR &lt; 0.05) that overlapped with PSI DMRs, between Pi sufficient and deficient conditions (7 and 21 d), with more than 80% of them not being expressed”.</p><p><italic>3) The authors build their DMR detection on differentially methylated positions, which they then cluster into regions. It has been shown that for coverage and statistical reasons, DMPs are much easier to detect in the CG context than in CHG and CHH contexts. The DMR detection could therefore be biased towards 5mCG-rich regions. The authors should provide information on the DMPs and the distribution of the sequence contexts, so that it becomes clear whether DMR detection is skewed towards a specific context and thus towards certain genetic elements</italic>.</p><p>We do not observe a bias towards DMR detection in mCG-rich regions. As shown in the manuscript <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, most PSI DMRs occur in the CHH context, thus indicating that the DMR detection is not biased towards the CG context.</p><p>We agree that the identification of DMPs can be biased towards the CG context (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Author response image 1</xref>). However, comparison of the proportion of significantly differentially methylated cytosines located within the identified DMRs did not reveal an enrichment of DMPs in the CG context, suggesting that the identification of DMRs is unlikely to be biased towards the CG context.<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09343.036</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.09343.036">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.09343.036</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-09343-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig></p><p><italic>More importantly: why are the thresholds for DMR detection in the root and in the shoot different from each other (FDR&lt;0.01 vs. FDR&lt;0.05)? Could the lower threshold in the shoot explain why more DMRs are found in this tissue, which is not the primary Pi sensing organ</italic>?</p><p>We agree with this comment. In the revised manuscript, all statistical analyses have been performed using a FDR threshold of 0.05, when the experiment was done using 3 biological replicates (n=3). However, due to the high number of replicates (n=9) used to identify root phosphate starvation induced (PSI) DMRs, a more stringent threshold of 0.01 was used, to detect a robust core set of PSI DMRs for further in depth analysis.</p><p>We agree that the higher FDR used for the shoot (FDR 0.05) is likely the cause of the increased DMRs identified in the shoots compared to the roots. However, we believe that the message of this comparison is clear: both roots and shoots have similar patterns of DNA methylation after phosphate starvation. We have modified the manuscript with respect to the reviewers comment, and clearly explained why different FDRs are being used.</p><p><italic>What is the reasoning behind applying yet another FDR threshold for DMR detection in</italic> Arabidopsis <italic>(0.2 in this case)? It leaves the impression that the authors switch between different cut-off values in order to get some reportable DMRs where there are none or very few to report. Also, are the genes associated with these DMRs among the DEGs? It would be less confusing if the authors simply stated that no DMRs were detectable in</italic> Arabidopsis<italic>, as they allude to in the last paragraph of the Discussion</italic>.</p><p>We agree, and this has been clarified in the manuscript. In the revised version, we first used a FDR threshold of 0.05, showing that no DMRs could be identified using similar criteria as the rice DMR analysis. In addition, in order to assess whether any DMRs could be identified upon Pi starvation, a less stringent FDR threshold of 0.2 was used, resulting in the identification of only two PSI DMRs, proximal to phosphate-starvation induced genes.</p><p><italic>Moreover, why was the sequencing for rice done on single plants while for</italic> Arabidopsis <italic>10 plants were pooled in each replicate? Could it be that the higher number of DMRs is also due to high stochastic inter-individual variation? I suggest the authors compare differential methylation between replicates in both species. In any way it would be interesting to see the degree of that variation and how it scales to the variation between treatments. It should also be mentioned in the main text that the experimental setups significantly differed in this respect</italic>.</p><p>While we agree with the reviewer’s comments, <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> roots are much smaller than rice roots. Consequently, the quantity of DNA recovered from individual roots (especially after 10 d of –Pi) was insufficient to perform whole genome bisulfite sequencing on single roots of a single <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> plant. The higher number of DMRs observed in rice is unlikely due to higher stochastic inter-individual variation since the main criteria for DMR identification was requiring 7 of the 9 replicates to show similar changes in DNA methylation, as mentioned in the methods. Comparison of the variation of the replicates in rice can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2–figure supplement 1</xref>.</p><p><italic>4) Changes in the CHH context imply that there is an involvement of the smallRNA machinery and the RdDM pathway. This is discussed nowhere in the manuscript</italic>.</p><p>We agree, and this has been revised in the current version of the manuscript. Indeed, we have now added substantial new experiments, repeating the phosphate starvation and DNA methylome/transcriptome experiment in a rice <italic>DCL3a</italic> RNAi line in order to decipher the involvement of the canonical RdDM pathway in Pi starvation induced DMRs. This demonstrated that the majority of the Pi starvation induced DMRs are <italic>DCL3a</italic>-independent.</p><p><italic>5) The model on methylation-mediated binding of PHR1 to the P1BS binding motif is interesting, but it is completely speculative. Neither does the data show that expression of these genes is linked to methylation, nor do the authors provide evidence for the enhanced binding of PHR1 to the motif in its unmethylated state</italic>.</p><p>We agree, and this has been removed in the revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>6) Transgenerational inheritance is only assessed in the context of persistence of several DMRs in the progeny of the stressed plants. As control I suggest that the authors identify DMRs between the two generations and check whether these DMRs are related to PSI loci. This way one might get an insight into DMRs induced in the germ line of the stressed plants, which would be the only ones possibly forwarded to the following generation</italic>.</p><p>In the current version of the manuscript, we assess the persistence of altered DNA methylation in all the Pi starvation induced DMRs, and clearly show that none of the PSI DMRs identified in the first generation are transmitted to the second generation.</p><p>In addition, as suggested, we investigated whether DMRs could be identified between the two generations, and if so whether they were related to any PSI loci. In order to identify DMRs between the two generations and exclude any potential DMRs that might arise from comparing different developmental stages, we compared the 3d +Pi time-point of the first generation of plants (15 day old plants: germinated for 2 weeks in +Pi, followed by 3 d of +Pi) to 10 d old seedlings from the parental plants that were continuously grown in + or –Pi conditions. Overall, only 21 and 24 DMRs (FDR &lt; 0.05) could be identified between the first generation (3d +Pi) plants versus the progeny of Pi stressed parent and progeny of non-stressed plants, respectively. Assignment of these DMRs to their proximal gene showed that the majority of these DMRs were located near transposons and genes encoding ‘expressed proteins’. Importantly, none of these proximal genes showed a significant difference in transcript abundance in response to Pi stress (Cufflinks, FDR &lt;0.05).</p><p>In conclusion, the ‘resetting’ of many root PSI DMRs over time after stress cessation, the very limited number of PSI DMRs identified in the panicles, the absence of persistent PSI DMRs in the progeny of stressed plants, and the analysis described above indicate that it is very unlikely that these stress induced DMRs are transmitted to the following generation.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p><italic>[…] This study addresses the role of DNA methylation in plant gene regulation - specifically its role in transcriptional changes during phosphate starvation in rice. The authors perform a deep analysis of transcripts and DNA methylation using sequencing, following controlled phosphate starvation. They identify a set of genes that show transcriptional up-regulation together with coincident DNA demethylation in regions close to the TSS. Many of these genes are known to play functional roles in the phosphate starvation response. The authors demonstrate that many of these demethylated regions correspond to MITE transposons that have inserted close to the gene</italic>.</p><p><italic>This is a thorough and detailed analysis, but it is essentially descriptive. It is unclear the extent to which the methylation changes are cause or effect of gene transcriptional induction. A number of mechanisms are possible, for example transcription may promote DNA demethylation via DNA glycosylases and/or inhibit DNA methylation maintenance. Mutations are available in rice DNA methylation factors, e.g. MET1 PMID 25002488 and</italic> DCL3 <italic>PMID 24554078, that may facilitate mechanistic experiments to test these ideas</italic>.</p><p>We agree with this point, and as suggested by Reviewer 3 we performed extensive additional experiments to shed light on the mechanism and role of phosphate starvation induced (PSI) differential DNA methylation.</p><p>Firstly, as mentioned above (see Reviewer 1 section), we improved the already extensive time course experiment, allowing us to decipher the temporal relationship between changes in DNA methylation and transcript abundance. Indeed, we could show that changes in DNA methylation occurred after changes in nearby transcript abundance, thus suggesting that increased transcription of stress responsive genes could lead to increased methylation of nearby TEs.</p><p>Secondly, to gain further insights into the mechanism involved in the PSI differential DNA methylation, as suggested by Reviewer 3, we performed a new experiment utilizing the suggested rice <italic>DCL3a</italic> RNAi line. We grew WT and a <italic>DCL3a</italic> RNAi line (PMID 24554078), which is impaired in 24nt siRNA biogenesis, under + or –Pi for 21 days, before performing MethylC-seq and RNA-seq. While reduced expression of <italic>DCL3a</italic> had major effects on the epigenome, altering DNA methylation at &gt;9000 regions in the genome, very few effects were observed in the phosphate starvation induced DMRs, with hypermethylated DMRs being almost exclusively <italic>DCL3a</italic>-independent, indicating that this process likely does not involve the canonical RdDM pathway.</p><p>The suggested <italic>met1-2</italic> mutant was not included in this new experiment due to the extremely deleterious effects of the mutation on plant growth and morphology: “…growth of the seedlings was significantly retarded, and they could only grow to ca. 3 cm in height with sporadic, deformed tiny roots, and then growth of the seedlings was totally halted and underwent necrotic death within 2 wk” (Hu et al., 2014 PMID 25002488).</p><p><italic>Transcriptional induction via transcription factors may be the most important factor here, which directly leads to demethylation of proximal TEs. In this scenario the methylation may not play an important role in control of gene expression. Removal of the methylation via mutation would allow expression of the target genes and associated TEs to be monitored to test the models proposed by the authors. It should also be possible to correlate Pol-II ChIP localisation with demethylation, in addition to other 5'-associated chromatin marks, e.g. H2A.Z, H3K4 methylation, nucleosome free regions. Further information is required to address how this methylation is removed and the extent to which it is really exerting an influence on the regulation of the genes of interest</italic>.</p><p>While we agree with reviewer 3, we believe the model on methylation-mediated binding of PHR1 to the P1BS binding motif is too speculative at this stage and has thus been removed from the revised manuscript.</p><p>However, to shed light on the mechanism involved in the regulation Pi starvation-induced DMRs, as suggested by reviewer 3, we used a <italic>dcl3a</italic> RNAi line (PMID 24554078). Briefly, we now show that the majority of phosphate starvation induced DMRs are not dependent upon <italic>DCL3a</italic> and thus do not involve the canonical RdDM pathway. These findings have important implications for interpreting the capacity of environmentally induced epialleles to influence genic transcription, and their stability through plant growth and reproduction.</p></body></sub-article></article>
