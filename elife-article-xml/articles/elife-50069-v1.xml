Mitochondrial dysfunction has been proposed as a key event in the etiology of AD. We have previously modeled amyloid-beta (AÎ²)-induced mitochondrial dysfunction in a transgenic <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> strain by expressing human AÎ² peptide specifically in neurons (GRU102). Here, we focus on the deeper metabolic changes associated with this AÎ²-induced mitochondrial dysfunction. Integrating metabolomics, transcriptomics and computational modeling, we identify alterations in Tricarboxylic Acid (TCA) cycle metabolism following even low-level AÎ² expression. In particular, GRU102 showed reduced activity of a rate-limiting TCA cycle enzyme, alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase. These defects were associated with elevation of protein carbonyl content specifically in mitochondria. Importantly, metabolic failure occurred before any significant increase in global protein aggregate was detectable. Treatment with an anti-diabetes drug, Metformin, reversed AÎ²-induced metabolic defects, reduced protein aggregation and normalized lifespan of GRU102. Our results point to metabolic dysfunction as an early and causative event in AÎ²-induced pathology and a promising target for intervention.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>amyloid beta</kwd><kwd>mitochondria</kwd><kwd>metformin</kwd><kwd>TCA cycle</kwd><kwd>metabolism</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001459</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Education - Singapore</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NGS Scholarship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Teo</surname><given-names>Emelyne</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001459</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Education - Singapore</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R-184-000-230-112</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gruber</surname><given-names>Jan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Swiss National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>163390</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ravi</surname><given-names>Sudharshan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100012693</institution-id><institution>Yale-NUS</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IG17-LR006</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Teo</surname><given-names>Emelyne</given-names></name><name><surname>Tolwinski</surname><given-names>Nicholas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001459</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Education - Singapore</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2014-T2-2-120</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gruber</surname><given-names>Jan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Metabolic defects following expression of AÎ²1-42 in nematode neurons are partially caused by inactivation of alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase and can be rescued by Metformin.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Alzheimerâs disease (AD) is a debilitating neurodegenerative disease, that is clinically characterized by the formation of amyloid-beta (AÎ²) plaques and aggregates of hyperphosphorylated tau protein in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mirra et al., 1991</xref>). Even though AD is primarily a neuronal disorder, perturbations in mitochondrial functions including energy metabolism have consistently been observed not only in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gibson et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gibson et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">MÃ¼ller et al., 2010</xref>) but also in non-neuronal cells derived from AD subjects, including in fibroblasts and platelets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bosetti et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Blass and Gibson, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cardoso et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Curti et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Parker et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Swerdlow, 2012</xref>). These findings form part of an emerging story that there is an important metabolic component to the etiology of AD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">de la Monte and Wands, 2008</xref>), and that these metabolic defects may precede AÎ² aggregate formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Yao et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Ye et al., 2012</xref>). The metabolism-related hypothesis of AD therefore posits that AD is, in part, mediated by impairments to the brainâs insulin response, which promotes oxidative stress and inflammation, similar to that of diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">de la Monte and Wands, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">McClean et al., 2011</xref>). Moreover, intranasal insulin treatment has been shown to ameliorate AD pathology in a transgenic rat model and to improve mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Craft et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Guo et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Stanley et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Craft et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Several animal studies have confirmed that oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction and metabolic alterations are early events in the pathophysiological progression of AD. Energy deficits, reduction in mitochondrial membrane potential, abnormal mitochondrial gene expression and increased oxidative stress have been observed early in transgenic AD mice (2â3 months of age) well before the appearance of AÎ² plaques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Reddy et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hauptmann et al., 2009</xref>). The AÎ²-induced oxidative stress hypothesis further posits that AÎ², predominantly its oligomeric form, can directly induce oxidative stress by inserting itself into the lipid bilayer, subsequently leading to lipid peroxidation and protein oxidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Swomley and Butterfield, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Swomley et al., 2014</xref>). Oxidative modification to specific enzymes involved in glucose metabolism has also been confirmed in brain of AD and MCI patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Butterfield et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Reed et al., 2009</xref>), further supporting the hypothesis that AÎ²-induced oxidative stress contributes to defects in metabolism, impairs glucose metabolism, before leading to synaptic dysfunction and ultimately neuronal death in AD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Butterfield and Halliwell, 2019</xref>).</p><p><italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> (<italic>C. elegans</italic>) is an invertebrate organism with unique advantages as a model organism. <italic>C. elegans</italic> has a short lifespan, a well-characterized nervous system, and is therefore routinely used for studies in developmental biology, neurobiology, aging and mitochondrial biology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gruber et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ghosh-Roy and Chisholm, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Corsi, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dancy, 2015</xref>). The creation of transgenic AD strains expressing human AÎ²-peptides in different cellular locations (muscle, neurons, or in subsets of neurons only) and under different promoters (temperature inducible or constitutive) has confirmed AD-like pathology with varying disease severity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">McColl et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Wu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Link, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fong et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Treusch et al., 2011</xref>). In particular, temperature-inducible strains which, upon induction, express high levels of AÎ² in muscle, exhibit obvious AÎ² aggregates, rapid paralysis and die within 2â3 days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Link, 1995</xref>). Strains with a comparatively low-level of neuronal AÎ² expression do not produce obvious aggregates and typically display milder effects, such as a reduction in egg-laying, progressive chemotaxis defects, neuronal loss and a 10â20% lifespan reduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Wu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fong et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Treusch et al., 2011</xref>). Different strains therefore serve as useful tools to study different aspects of AD (late-stage, aggregate-driven pathologies in the more severely affected strains <italic>vs.</italic> early-stage AD in strains with later and milder phenotypes). In particular, it is important to study the early events occurring in AD pathogenesis, as interventions given at earlier stages of AD may be more likely to succeed in modifying disease progression.</p><p>To study the temporal sequence of events underlying AÎ²-mediated toxicity, especially the early events affecting mitochondrial metabolism, we have created a novel transgenic <italic>C. elegans</italic> strain with constitutive pan-neuronal expression of low-levels of human AÎ²<sub>1-42</sub> (GRU102). Similar to previous transgenic strains expressing AÎ² in neurons, GRU102 display comparatively mild phenotypes including failure in chemotaxis, with neuromuscular and behavioral defects that become more pronounced with age. Remarkably, even though AÎ² aggregates were detectable only in old GRU102 (day 12), we found defects in energy metabolism and significantly reduced activity in mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) complexes in GRU102 already when young (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fong et al., 2016</xref>). Our findings suggest that metabolic alterations are early events in AD pathogenesis, and this prompted us to further investigate why and how AÎ² peptides cause mitochondria to fail, and what interventions might target early defects in the pathophysiological chain leading to AD.</p><p>Based on the metabolism hypothesis of AD, several studies have explored a new class of interventions, aiming at improving metabolic health, including the use of antioxidant and insulin-regulating drugs in AD. For instance, we have previously shown that antioxidant treatment, using the mitochondrial-targeted antioxidant MitoQ, ameliorated depletion of the mitochondrial lipid cardiolipin and improved healthspan of another strain of transgenic AD nematodes with muscular expression of AÎ² (CL2006) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ng et al., 2014</xref>). Treatment using an antidiabetic drug, Metformin, has also recently been shown to delay AÎ²-related paralysis, and improve neuronal transmission, in two transgenic AD strains, one with inducible muscular (CL4176) and one with neuronal AÎ² expression (CL2355) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahmad and Ebert, 2017</xref>). However, the mechanisms underlying the beneficial AD effects of such metabolism-related drugs are still not fully understood.</p><p>Here, we examine how AÎ² causes mitochondrial failure in AD, the mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects of Metformin, the metabolic consequences underlying AÎ² expression and how they relate to protein aggregation in the GRU102 strain. We link AÎ² expression to Tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle impairment and oxidative protein damage specifically in the mitochondria starting early in life (day 4). This precedes general protein aggregation as the latter only occurs late in life (day 12), suggesting the disruption in proteostasis is a secondary event likely induced by the early metabolic dysfunction. Metformin treatment normalized lifespan to that of untreated non-transgenic controls, increased stress resistance, reversed metabolic defects and prevented the increase in levels of protein aggregation in GRU102, suggesting that improvement in metabolism can also enhance proteostasis. Our results, taken together with other recent findings, suggest that disruption in mitochondrial function and redox homeostasis can induce protein aggregation, and targeting these processes can be beneficial in AD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Ruan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Patel et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Guerrero-GÃ³mez et al., 2019</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Alterations in amino acid and tricarboxylic acid cycle metabolism in GRU102</title><p>GRU102 suffer from early and significant defects in energy metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fong et al., 2016</xref>). To determine which energy substrates were specifically affected in GRU102, we followed a targeted metabolomics approach, comparing intermediary metabolites involved in energy production between age-matched GRU102 and its transgenic controls (GRU101). We specifically determined levels of different Acylcarnitines (AC), Triacylglycerides (TAG), amino acids (AA) as well as of organic acids (OA), including TCA cycle intermediates.</p><p>AC are intermediates that are typically generated during the transport of activated long-chain fatty acids (FA) from the cytosol to mitochondria for FA oxidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Schooneman et al., 2013</xref>). Even though most AC species are derived from FA, some AC species are formed through non-FA intermediates. For example, Propionylcarnitine (C3) and Isovalerylcarnitine (C5) are derived from the degradation of branched-chain AA while Acetylcarnitine (C2) is a common energy precursor derived from glucose and FA metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Schooneman et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rinaldo et al., 2008</xref>). We found that levels of the common energy precursor C2 were significantly reduced in old GRU102 compared to age-matched GRU101 controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>), reflecting a low energy status in old GRU102. AA-derived AC species (C3-carnitine) was also significantly reduced in old GRU102 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), suggesting that AA metabolism was affected in old GRU102. By contrast, FA-derived AC species remained unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), suggesting that FA metabolism remained intact even in old GRU102. These findings agree with the observation that levels of storage lipids, Triacylglycerides (TAGs), between GRU102 and GRU101 remained similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) while lower total AA levels were observed in old GRU102 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.50069.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Metabolomics profile of GRU102 and its transgenic controls (GRU101).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>)Â Acylcarnitines (AC) profile, (<bold>B</bold>) Triacylglyceride (TAG), (<bold>C</bold>) Total Amino acids (AA) level, (<bold>D</bold>) Percentage glucogenic AA, computed as [sum of AA forming the particular glucogenic substrate/total AA levels].

To avoid confounding developmental effects, we started aKGDH knockdown <italic>via</italic> RNAi treatment only from adulthood (day 3) in both backgrounds. We found that aKGDH knockdown significantly reduced both basal and maximal respiration in GRU101, an effect similar to the defects in GRU102 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Notably, as for GRU102, the response to the addition of chemical uncoupler appeared both delayed and blunted in GRU101 with adult aKGDH knockdown. In fact, the oxygen consumption rate (OCR) profile of GRU101 with aKGDH knockdown closely mirrored that of GRU102 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). To evaluate if loss of aKGDH might be a compensatory mechanism, we also carried out lifespan studies in GRU102 subject to RNAi knockdown of aKGDH but found that further loss of this enzyme did not significantly affect lifespan, suggesting that reduced aKGDH activity is not protective in GRU102 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2</xref>). We also evaluated metabolic effects of aKGDH knockdown in GRU102 and found that loss of aKGDH similarly did not normalize but instead significantly worsened the metabolic flux in GRU102 animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), further confirming that reduction in aKGDH is detrimental in AD.</p><p>Comparing OCR profiles between GRU101 animals subject to aKGDH knockdown and GRU102, we noticed that their timeseries of OCR values following addition of the uncoupler appeared to be similar. To further assess how well the OCR profile of GRU101 fed with aKGDH RNAi correlates with GRU102, we plotted a scatter diagram of OCR of GRU102 vs GRU101 fed with aKGDH RNAi or EV just before and during uncoupling (time measurement 6â12 of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, after addition of FCCP uncoupler). The correlation coefficient, r, can be used to evaluate how well the respective conditions correlate with each other, with r value close to one being indicating a high degree of correlation. We found that the OCR during uncoupling of GRU102 correlates well with that of GRU101 fed with aKGDH RNAi (rÂ =Â 0.98, p&lt;0.001) but not for animals fed EV (rÂ =Â 0.33, p=ns, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), illustrating that aKGDH knockdown causes GRU101 to experience deficits in the response to uncoupling that resembles GRU102. One way in which the OCR time course of GRU101 with aKGDH knockdown resembles GRU102 is an increase in the time taken to reach maximal uncoupled respiration (state 3 u), following addition of uncoupler (FCCP). To directly quantify this effect, we compared the time needed for OCR values to rise to at least two standard deviation above the average coupled (basal) respiration, finding that, while GRU101 rapidly responded to addition of FCCP, both GRU102 and GRU101 subject to aKGDH knockdown suffer a significant delay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Interestingly, aKGDH knockdown did not further delay uncoupled respiration in GRU102.

We found that Metformin treatment increased the abundance of many AA in GRU102, with Alanine, Glycine, Proline and Serine consistently increased in both replicates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Interestingly, at the same time that it increased AA related metabolites, Metformin treatment significantly reduced the level of fat-derived C18:1-carnitine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>), suggesting that Metformin reduced the amount of energy derived from lipid metabolism relative to that derived from AA metabolism. Metformin treatment also reduced the level of lactate in GRU102 while at the same time increasing the levels of pyruvate, fumarate and malate. Levels of malate were in fact significantly higher than those in GRU101 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). Our metabolomics findings were consistent with a previous proteomic analysis of Metformin-treated WT <italic>C. elegans</italic>, which suggested an enrichment of proteins involved in branched-chain amino acid degradation and TCA cycle metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">De Haes et al., 2014</xref>). Collectively, these data suggest that Metformin improves energy substrate availability, and that such metabolic improvement is helpful against AÎ²-mediated mitochondrial toxicity in GRU102.</p><p>We next compared the metabolic state of GRU101 and GRU102 animals at different ages (day 4 and 12), and compared these with 12 day old Metformin-treated GRU102 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5âfigure supplement 2</xref>). The Heatmap of this analysis revealed an interesting cluster of metabolites (Cluster 1: Ornitine, aKG, Pyruvate, Histidine, Alanine and Glutamine) that showed a strong age-dependent decline that could be rescued by Metformin treatment. To examine how ages, genotypes and metformin treatment, respectively, affect the metabolites in this cluster, we performed a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and also individually compared the metabolites of cluster 1. PCA analysis showed that genotype only had a significant influence on the metabolites in young but not old animals, where levels were similarly reduced in both GRU101 and GRU102 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5âfigure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5âfigure supplement 3</xref>). Individually, levels of Ornitine, aKG, Alanine and Glutamine significantly reduced in young GRU102 compared to young GRU101 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5âfigure supplement 2C</xref>). Age completely separated the metabolites for GRU101 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5âfigure supplement 2B</xref>) while only Pyruvate, Histidine and Alanine significantly declined with age in GRU102 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5âfigure supplement 2D</xref>).

Sulfomethoxazole (SMX), a sulfonamide antibiotics that blocks folate synthesis, has similarly been shown to extend lifespan in nematodes, establishing a link between folate inhibition and lifespan extension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Virk et al., 2012</xref>). To determine if the beneficial effects of Metformin in GRU102 were mediated by microbiome folate inhibition, we investigated whether addition of SMX phenocopies the beneficial effects of Metformin in GRU102. We found that SMX did not rescue the metabolic flux impairment or the lifespan detriment of GRU102 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5âfigure supplement 4</xref>). These observations suggest that the beneficial effects of Metformin in GRU102 were unlikely to be mediated predominantly by inhibition of microbiome folate production.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>General protein aggregation as a secondary event to metabolic alterations in AD</title><p>Increased oxidative stress can disrupt protein homeostasis (proteostasis) through irreversible oxidation and subsequent modifications of proteins, and such damage also impairs protein degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Squier, 2001</xref>).

We have previously reported that energy deficits and reduced activities of mitochondrial ETC complexes are early events in GRU102, well before any detectable AÎ² aggregates are present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fong et al., 2016</xref>). Here, we have shown that key energy substrates, in particular glucogenic AA that form pyruvate and aKG, as well as the TCA cycle intermediates fumarate and malate, are selectively affected in GRU102. Metabolic flux balance analysis, incorporating transcriptomics and metabolic data (oxygen intake and bacterial consumption), suggested alterations in transport or metabolism of aKG to be involved in these defects. Indeed, enzymatic assays of key TCA cycle enzymes confirmed deficiency in a rate-limiting TCA cycle enzyme, aKGDH, involved in aKG metabolism.</p><p>Given that aKGDH is a rate-limiting enzyme in the TCA cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Huang et al., 2003</xref>), reduced aKGDH activity is a plausible explanation for reduced flux through the TCA cycle, ATP production and maximum respiratory capacity. Inhibition of aKGDH activity, as observed in GRU102, may therefore partially explain key metabolic defects observed in GRU102. Inactivation of aKGDH may contribute not only to the observed reduction in levels of TCA cycle metabolites downstream of aKG (malate and fumarate), but also explain the general reduction in spare respiratory capacity and energy deficits in the GRU102 animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Butterfield et al., 2006</xref>). To test this hypothesis, we carried out aKGDH RNAi knockdown in adult GRU101 as well as GRU102 animals and found GRU101 fed on aKGDH RNAi suffered metabolic detriments that closely resembles GRU102. Exposure to aKGDH RNAi of GRU102, which are already experiencing reduced aKGDH activity, similarly did not improve their metabolic defects and instead resulted in further detriments. These results suggest that reduction in aKGDH activity is detrimental to metabolic capacity in adults and that it alone can recapitulate the metabolic deficits of AD in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. This, of course, does not mean that inactivation of aKGDH is the single cause of the metabolic detriments in AÎ²1â42-expressing <italic>C. elegans</italic>, but it suggests that inactivation of specific enzymes involved in the TCA may be a key mechanism of AÎ² toxicity.</p><p>Our study revealed mitochondrial-specific ROS as a potential early cause of mitochondrial dysfunction in our AD model, as shown by the early (day 4) increase in mtPCC but not in global PCC. In vitro experiments have shown that the mitochondrial enzyme aKGDH is particularly sensitive to inactivation by ROS (hydrogen peroxide) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Tretter and Adam-Vizi, 2000</xref>), consistent with the involvement of this enzyme in GRU102 metabolic defects. Site-specific oxidative modification to mitochondrial but not global protein is one possible mechanism to explain the reduction of aKGDH activity observed in old GRU102. These findings are consistent with other reports showing that mitochondrial enzymes involved in energy regulation are known to be redox sensitive and often downregulated in AD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Butterfield and Halliwell, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mastrogiacomo et al., 1996</xref>).</p><p>Remarkably, we found that metabolic deficits and increased mtPCC were detectable in young GRU102, while increased global protein aggregation was only seen in aged GRU102.

Increase in mitochondrial protein carbonyl content (mtPCC) was also observed as an early phenomenon in GRU102. Elevated oxidative stress further affects ROS-sensitive Tricarboxylic Acid (TCA) cycle enzyme, including alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (aKGDH), resulting in a reduction of its activity as well as altered levels of TCA metabolites (aKGDH, fumarate and malate) in old GRU102. Together with the reduction in electron transfer chain (ETC) complex I and IV activities as well as low ATP levels in the GRU102 animals we reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fong et al., 2016</xref>), these phenomena result in metabolic stress. Proteostasis, an energy-intensive process, is impaired by metabolic and oxidative stress, resulting in an increase in general protein aggregates. Treatment with Metformin (Met) increases stress resistance and rescues metabolic defects of GRU102. Metformin-treated GRU102 also appears to reduce the increase in protein aggregates in GRU102, even though it could not fully rescue this phenotype.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-50069-fig7-v1.tif"/></fig><p>It is intriguing that GRU102 animals displayed such broad metabolic changes, given that the AÎ² transgene is only expressed in neurons. This raises the question of whether these metabolic effects are primarily confined to the neurons, or if non-cell-autonomous effects contribute to these phenotypes. While our data currently do not address this question, the AÎ²-induced oxidative stress hypothesis of AD (see Introduction paragraph 2) supports oxidative stress as a direct and cell-autonomous mechanism of AÎ²-induced toxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Butterfield and Halliwell, 2019</xref>). The confined effects of oxidative stress in AÎ²-expressing neurons is also supported by clinical findings that ROS-mediated elevation in PCC are only observed in brain regions of AD subjects rich in AÎ²-plaques, but not in other brain regions devoid of AÎ²-plaques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hensley et al., 1995</xref>).</p><p>On the other hand, existing literature has suggested the activation of stress response mechanism and proteotoxicity as non-cell-autonomous consequences in protein-misfolding diseases including AD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nussbaum-Krammer and Morimoto, 2014</xref>), as activation of stress response, such as the heat shock response or unfolded protein response, functions at a whole animal level, beyond the immediate affected cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nussbaum-Krammer and Morimoto, 2014</xref>). Studies in <italic>C. elegans</italic> have also shown that induction of mitochondrial stress in neurons can lead to non-cell-autonomous mitochondrial stress response in non-neuronal compartment such as intestine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Durieux et al., 2011</xref>). The mechanism of the impairment in mitochondrial health observed in GRU102 may therefore not be confined to neuronal cells only. The pan-neuronal unc-119 promoter that we use to drive AÎ² expression in GRU102 has been suggested to have low expression in intestine, and such expression might lead to detriments in that compartment not confined in the neurons.</p><p>Metformin has previously been shown to strengthen stress defense, and to increase branched-chain AA degradation and TCA metabolism in WT <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">De Haes et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Onken and Driscoll, 2010</xref>). We found that Metformin treatment normalizes lifespan and mitochondrial function in GRU102 up to the level of untreated GRU101 controls. Lifespan of the Metformin-treated GRU102 was even longer than the untreated GRU101. Consistent with previous studies showing that Metformin improves AA and TCA cycle metabolism in WT <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">De Haes et al., 2014</xref>), we demonstrated that Metformin treatment also restores respiratory capacity and improves the availability of glucogenic AA and TCA cycle intermediates in the GRU102 animals.</p><p>We further found that Metformin-treated GRU102 showed a trend towards lower levels of protein aggregates. However, due to the variability inherent in this method, the reduction was not statistically significant, and we could not conclusively show that Metformin reduces protein aggregation in GRU102. However, protein aggregates levels in Metformin-treated GRU102 were also no longer significantly different from GRU101, suggesting that Metformin treatment had some benefit on this parameter. While more work needs to be carried out to confirm the causal relationship between metabolic dysfunction and protein aggregation, our observation is consistent with findings that metabolic health and proteostasis are closely related to each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Ruan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Patel et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Guerrero-GÃ³mez et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Given that Metformin can penetrate through the blood brain barrier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Ying et al., 2015</xref>), our findings suggest Metformin as an alternative therapy for AD.

In pFBA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Yilmaz and Walhout, 2016</xref>), metabolic fluxes of each metabolites are computed based on the mass balance around every metabolite in the metabolic network under the following assumptions: (1) that the metabolism is operating at steady state (i.e. no change in the metabolite concentrations over time), (2) that the organism/cell optimizes its metabolism according to a biological objective, and (3) that the total absolute flux in the metabolic network is minimized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lewis et al., 2010</xref>). We performed pFBA using built in functions in the COBRA toolbox (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Schellenberger et al., 2011</xref>) in MATLAB. Given the life history of <italic>C. elegans</italic>, we chose the maximization of biomass production for growth and storage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Yilmaz and Walhout, 2016</xref>).</p><p>We curated condition-specific metabolic network models for the GRU101 and GRU102 animals by pruning the <italic>C.Â elegans</italic> genome-scale metabolic model iCEL 1273 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Yilmaz and Walhout, 2016</xref>) based on strain-specific transcriptomic data, using the Gene Inactivity Moderated by Metabolism and Expression (GIMME) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Becker and Palsson, 2008</xref>) algorithm. Briefly, starting from the genome-scale metabolic network (iCEL 1273) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Yilmaz and Walhout, 2016</xref>), the algorithm removes reactions whose mRNA transcript levels are below a pre-determined threshold. We set the threshold at the 5<sup>th</sup> percentile of the normalized transcript level for each gene. The algorithm then uses flux balance analysis (FBA) to ensure that the reduced model is able to achieve the same optimal biological objective value as the full model. In the event that the resulting model is unable to achieve the same biological objective, GIMME determines the smallest set of previously removed reactions to be added back into the reduced model to replicate the optimal biological objective value of the full model. We confirmed that changing the threshold in the range between 1 and 50 percentile does not significantly affect the results of our analysis.</p><p>Using the condition-specific metabolic models for GRU101 and GRU102 animals, we then applied pFBA to determine metabolic fluxes based on the maximization of biomass production. We started by analyzing the metabolic fluxes of the controls (GRU101), using experimentally observed bacterial consumption rate as a constraint on the bacterial intake rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Yilmaz and Walhout, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Smith, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Van Voorhies, 2002</xref>). We used the results of the pFBA of GRU101 to set constraints on bacterial intake and oxygen consumption rates in the pFBA of GRU102. More specifically, we set the constraint on the bacterial intake rate of GRU102 by scaling the constraint of GRU101 according to the ratio of pharyngeal pumping rates between the two strains. Meanwhile, the oxygen consumption rate of GRU102 is constrained to a scalar multiple of the oxygen consumption rate of GRU101 as determined by pFBA, based on the ratio of experimentally observed oxygen uptake rates between the two strains.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Flux Variability Analysis and inconsistent reactions</title><p>We performed flux variability analysis (FVA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gudmundsson and Thiele, 2010</xref>) on the GRU101 and GRU102 metabolic models to determine the range (interval) of flux values for each reaction, within which one can vary the flux of a reaction â keeping the others constant â without changing the optimal biological objective value. We implemented the FVA using in-built functions in the COBRA toolbox (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Schellenberger et al., 2011</xref>). We compared the results of FVA of GRU101 and GRU102 to identify as inconsistent reactions. Here, a reaction is inconsistent between the two animals when its flux interval according to FVA is located fully to the left (negative) or right (positive) of the origin for at least one of the strains, and the flux intervals between the two animals have values of opposite signs.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>TCA enzyme activity assay</title><p>Mitochondrial extraction was carried out as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Goo et al.

Lipids extraction from the lysed samples was carried out by Folchâs extraction. In order to minimize oxidation during and after extraction, 0.5% butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) was added to the organic solvents. Samples were spiked with known amounts of internal standards (purchased from Avanti polar lipids, Alabaster, AL, USA) corresponding to each lipid class during the extraction to control lipid-class dependent differences in extraction and ionization. Internal standard used for triacylglyceride (TAG) was d5-TAG 48:0. To achieve separation into aqueous and organic phases, the samples were vortexed and centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 5 min.

To obtain the detergent-soluble protein, the lysate was removed after the first extraction following centrifugation at 14,000 rpm. Sequential extraction was done by adding fresh RIPA buffer to the pellet, followed by re-homogenization in bead beater, and then removing the lysate and repeating this process for another four times. This was to ensure that all the detergent-soluble protein had been extracted. Soluble fraction from these wash steps were then pooled and the amount of detergent-soluble protein present in the pooled sample was determined using Bradford protein assay (DC Protein Assay Kit, Bio-rad Laboratories, California, United States).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Matt Kaeberlein as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Jessica Tyler as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: George L Sutphin (Reviewer #2); Michael Petrascheck (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Teo et al. present a study examining the role of impaired mitochondrial metabolism in amyloid-beta neuropathology in transgenic <italic>C. elegans</italic>. Specifically, they examine the link between early changes in the TCA cycle and late changes in proteostasis and related pathology in a previously published strain with relatively low-level transgenic pan-neuronal expression of human amyloid-beta that results in late-onset amyloid pathology.</p><p>To begin the analysis, they used metabolomics to examine intermediate metabolites related to the TCA cycle and several pathways that provide precursor molecules. These results suggested that some aspects of TCA metabolism were perturbed in amyloid-beta animals. The authors then performed flux analysis using a combination of transcriptomic and metabolomic data to determine which TCA-associated pathways were specifically altered in these animals, identifying the conversion of pyruvate to alpha-ketoglutarate (aKG) as a major focal point. They next identified an age-dependent decrease in aKG dehydrogenase (aKGDH), and demonstrate that RNAi knockdown of aKGDH in non-amyloid-beta transgenic controls mimics several of the metabolic defects (e.g. oxygen consumption profiles) in amyloid-beta animals, suggesting that this may be a mediating factor in pathology driven by metabolic differences. They propose oxidative damage as a potential driver of mitochondrial dysfunction, and report elevated protein carbonylation specifically in the mitochondria. Finally, they demonstrate that metformin rescues both survival deficits and metabolic dysfunction in amyloid-beta animals.</p><p>This work adds valuable insight into early metabolic events in amyloid-beta neurotoxicity in a malleable model system. We believe the paper will be of broad interest to the scientific community, particularly those working in, or in areas adjacent to, aging and Alzheimer's disease. Metabolic dysfunction as an early even in AD is of particular interest, as is the identification of aKGDH as a potential focal point and potential intervention target. We have identified a few significant concerns that the authors should address in a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>One concern is whether the reported effects are primarily confined to the neurons or if they are cell non-autonomous effects caused by neuronal dysfunction. The data do not address this question, which to some extent is central to the model that metabolic defects happen before protein aggregation. This also impinges on the ROS model, since presumably ROS would be largely confined to neurons. While perhaps not absolutely essential if addressed thoroughly in the text, if the authors could provide some data clarifying the cell-autonomous versus cell non-autonomous nature of their observations that would greatly strengthen the manuscript. Related to this, unc-119 has been suggested to have some low expression in the gut.</p><p>There are a couple of concerns related to the effects of metformin.</p><p>1) The effects seem variable and perhaps interpreted too strongly. For example, the text states that &quot;We found that Metformin treatment indeed normalized total levels of insoluble protein in GRU102 to that of GRU101 animals (Figure 6A, B).&quot; Looking at panel A, two of the four Metformin treated samples look indistinguishable from age-matched GRU102, and the other two look indistinguishable from GRU101. How was protein loading measured/normalized/verified (there is a hint in the Materials and methods that protein concentration of the soluble fraction may have been measured, but no detail)? In panel B, the comparisons indicate that the Metformin group is not statistically different from either. These patterns in the data complicate the interpretation. The text needs to reflect the data here, and the strength of the claims should be placed in context of the variability of the Metformin data. This claim is also made in the legend of Figure 7 and in the Discussion.</p><p>2) The mechanism of action for metformin is unclear. Metformin is an inhibitor of Complex I of the ETC and has also been shown to impact lifespan in <italic>C. elegans</italic> through inhibition of folate production by the microbiome. Either (or neither) could be contributing to the observed effects in GRU102. Effects of bacterial folate limitation on lifespan are supported by published data from several labs that sulfa antibiotics can increase lifespan in worms. It would enhance the impact of this manuscript if the authors explored whether the effects of metformin are microbiome mediated. Two easy ways to do this would be to (1) determine whether sulfa antibiotics phenocopy metformin in the AD worms and (2) determine whether metformin still has effects when killed bacterial food is used for the assays.</p><p>3) Please provide data and statistics for all independent replicates indicated in the text and figure legends as supplementary material.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.50069.033</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>One concern is whether the reported effects are primarily confined to the neurons or if they are cell non-autonomous effects caused by neuronal dysfunction.

We have attempted to answer the question by performing whole body mitoSOX and mitoTracker staining of the animals, to respectively examine ROS localization and mitochondrial morphology in neuronal versus non-neuronal compartments of the animals. However, we found that the mitoSOX dye predominantly localizes at the pharyngeal bulb as also previously reported<sup>1</sup>, and the resolution we were able to get was not high enough to clearly differentiate between neuronal and other cellular structure (Figure 1A) and we did not see a clear difference in gut (as might be expected by unc-119 driven leaky expression). Similarly, we also could not distinguish between neuronal vs. other cellular compartment from the mitotracker stain (Figure 1B).</p><p>We have added these data to the manuscript, briefly mentioning it as part of the overall discussion. However, we appreciate that these data are not sufficient to fully address this point. In line with the reviewersâ suggestion, we have therefore added a more complete discussion of the question and clearly stated this limitation in our current understanding as follows:</p><p>Discussion:</p><p>âIt is intriguing that GRU102 animals displayed such broad metabolic changes, given that the AÎ² transgene is only expressed in neurons. [â¦] While our data currently do not address this question, the AÎ²-induced oxidative stress hypothesis of AD (see Introduction paragraph two) supports oxidative stress as a direct and cell-autonomous mechanism of AÎ²-induced toxicity<sup>2</sup>. The confined effects of oxidative stress in AÎ²-expressing neurons is also supported by clinical findings that ROS-mediated elevation in PCC are only observed in brain regions of AD subjects rich in AÎ²-plaques, but not in other brain regions devoid of AÎ²-plaques<sup>3</sup>.</p><p>On the other hand, existing literature has suggested the activation of stress response mechanism and proteotoxicity as non-cell-autonomous consequences in protein-misfolding diseases including AD<sup>4</sup>, as activation of stress response, such as the heat shock response or unfolded protein response, functions at a whole animal level, beyond the immediate affected cell<sup>4</sup>. Studies in <italic>C. elegans</italic> have also shown that induction of mitochondrial stress in neurons can lead to non-cell-autonomous mitochondrial stress response in non-neuronal compartment such as intestine<sup>5</sup>. The mechanism of the impairment in mitochondrial health observed in GRU102 may therefore not be confined to neuronal cells only. The pan-neuronal unc-119 promoter that we use to drive AÎ² expression in GRU102 has been suggested to have low expression in intestine, and such expression might lead to detriments in that compartment not confined in the neurons.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There are a couple of concerns related to the effects of metformin.</p><p>1) The effects seem variable and perhaps interpreted too strongly.

This claim is also made in the legend of Figure 7 and in the Discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that the effect of Metformin on protein aggregation is variable and we apologize for missing out some of the details on protein loading and normalization. In response to the reviewersâ comments, we have re-analysed this dataset, generated additional normalization data and performed additional validation experiments.</p><p>Briefly, the amount of insoluble protein loaded was based on the amount of soluble protein in the soluble fraction, where the volume for each insoluble protein sample loaded was five times the volume of soluble lysate, equivalent to 2ug soluble protein as determined by Biorad Bradford protein assay (DC Protein Assay Kit). In other words, the amount loaded was normalized to the protein content of the soluble fraction as evaluated by Biorad Bradford protein assay (DC Protein Assay Kit). We have further clarified this in the Materials and methods section as follows:</p><p>âTo obtain the detergent-soluble protein, the lysate was removed after the first extraction following centrifugation at 14,000rpm. [â¦] Upon completion of gel electrophoresis, total protein amount was visualized using Silver Stain Kit (Cat. No 24612, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Massachusetts, USA). Densitometric analysis of gel intensity was performed using ImageJ.â</p><p>Following the reviewersâ comments, we also re-examined the volume normalization process to explore reasons for the observed variability in insoluble protein seen in the metformin-treated cohorts. We considered the possibility that the variability was due to inaccuracies in quantification of the soluble protein fraction, resulting in increased variability due to loading volumes based on this quantification. We typically keep these soluble fractions but do not always run them on SDS-PAGE. We have now followed up this question by running these soluble protein fractions on SDS-PAGE gels. The amount of insoluble protein loaded for comparison is based on the assumption that the amount soluble protein in each lane should be precisely 0.2Î¼g. We only had soluble protein fractions for a second replicate of the Metformin trials, as we did not retain the soluble protein samples for the first batch of samples originally shown in the manuscript. We therefore ran SDS-PAGE of the soluble protein fractions from the second experiments and replaced the graphs and gels in the manuscript with this second replicate. For statistical analysis, we now re-normalize data of insoluble protein using the densitometric intensity of the SDS-PAGE of the corresponding soluble fractions (Figure 6). We have moved the original unnormalized gel to the supplementary data (Figure 6âfigure supplement 1).</p><p>We found that the actual amount of soluble protein indeed varied slightly between samples (Figure 6B). While the somewhat reduced variability in normalized values confirms that some of the observed variability was likely due to loading volume, the normalization did not change any of the overall statistics and conclusions. After correcting for the loading differences by normalizing the densitometric intensity of insoluble gel against that of the soluble gel, the result remained qualitatively the same as the previously unnormalized data. Even though Metformin treatment showed a trend of reduced protein aggregates level in D12 GRU102, the reduction was not statistically significant (Figure 6C, One-way ANOVA multiple comparisons test P=0.08). However, the levels of protein aggregates in D12 Metformin-treated GRU102 also appear similar to the D12 GRU101 controls (Figure 6C, One-way ANOVA multiple comparisons test P=ns), and the levels of protein aggregates in the Metformin-treated animals were intermediate between the untreated GRU101 and GRU102. We therefore felt that there were some benefits in reducing protein aggregates conferred by Metformin, even though it does not fully rescue it.</p><p>We therefore agree with the reviewers that care should be taken with regards to claims made regarding this effect. We apologize for not more strongly emphasize this in the original version of the manuscript. We agree that we cannot conclude unambiguously that the effects of Metformin on protein aggregation due to the variability of the gel and hence suggest the following modification of our claim:</p><p>Results:</p><p>âTo determine whether general protein aggregation occurs in the AÎ²-expressing animals, we examined the levels of insoluble proteins <italic>via</italic> SDS-PAGE<sup>6</sup>. [â¦] Metformin treatment therefore appears to benefit GRU102 in terms of proteostasis but it did not fully rescue the increase in protein aggregates.â</p><p>Figure legend:</p><p><bold>â</bold>Figure 7. Graphical summary of the model of AÎ² pathology in GRU102. [â¦] Metformin-treated GRU102 also appears to reduce the increase in protein aggregates in GRU102, even though it could not fully rescue this phenotype.â</p><p>Discussion:</p><p>âWe further found that Metformin-treated GRU102 showed a trend towards lower levels of protein aggregates. [â¦] While more work needs to be carried out to confirm the causal relationship between metabolic dysfunction and protein aggregation, our observation is consistent with findings that metabolic health and proteostasis are closely related to each other<sup>7-10</sup>.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The mechanism of action for metformin is unclear.

In response to the reviewers comments, we have performed the first suggested experiment â to determine whether Sulfamethoxazole (SMX), a sulfonamide antibiotics that has been previously shown to reduce folate levels and increase lifespan in worms (de la Monte et al., 2008), results in a rescue in metabolic flux impairment and/or lifespan in GRU102. These data suggest that inhibition of microbiome folate production through SMX does not have any beneficial effects in GRU102, hence lessening the probability that the benefits of Metformin were predominantly microbiome-mediated. We have added these results as follow:</p><p>Results:</p><p>âMetformin has been previously shown to impact lifespan in <italic>C. elegans</italic> through inhibition of folate production by the microbiome.

As indicated, overall the data and statistics for these two independent replicates are consistent. However, there are four metabolites that show minor differences, and we have now also explicitly listed and discussed these. These differences concern the acylcarnitine and amino acids metabolites levels, where some of the originally reported changes did not reach statistical significance in the second replicate. However, the general pattern that we observe clearly holds in both datasets, and none of these differences affect the major claim that we made in the manuscript. We have nevertheless modified the text accordingly to reflect the differences in the independent replicate and report only the consensus input following <xref ref-type="table" rid="resptable1">Author response table 1</xref>:</p><table-wrap id="resptable1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.50069.031</object-id><label>Author response table 1.</label><caption/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top"/><th valign="top">Original data in manuscript</th><th valign="top">Data in independent replicate</th><th valign="top">Modifications made in the manuscript</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Figure 1A</td><td valign="top">Acylcarnitines derived from amino acids, C3 and C5, were significantly reduced in D12 GRU102</td><td valign="top">Only C3 was significantly reduced in D12 GRU102; C5 showed a trend towards reduction but the difference did not reach statistical significance in D12 GRU102</td><td valign="top">We removed the sentence stating that C5-Acylcarnitine was significantly reduced and focused only on C3-Acylcarntine: <break/>âAA-derived AC species (C3-carnitine) was also significantly reduced in old GRU102 (Figure 1A), suggesting that AA metabolism was affected in old GRU102.â</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Figure 1D</td><td valign="top">Percentage of amino acids forming pyruvate were significantly lower in both D4 and D12 GRU102 <break/>Percentage of amino acids forming aKG were significantly higher in both D4 and D12 GRU102</td><td valign="top">Reduction in percentage of amino acids forming pyruvate did not reach statistical significance in both D4 and D12 GRU102 <break/>Increase in percentage of amino acids forming aKG was only statistically significant in D12 GRU102, but not in D4 GRU102</td><td valign="top">We removed the phrase that the percentage of amino acids forming pyruvate was significantly lower and focused only on the increase in percentage of amino acids forming aKG: <break/>âThis analysis of the AA profile demonstrated that, in comparison to age-matched controls, the percentage of glucogenic AA forming alpha-Ketoglutarate (aKG) was significantly increased in old GRU102 animals (Figure 1D).â</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Figure 5D</td><td valign="top">Metformin significantly increased levels of Ala, Asp, Gly, Leu, Met, Phe, Pro, Ser, Trp and Val in D12 GRU102.</td><td valign="top">Metformin significantly increased levels of Ala, Asp, Gly, Phe, Pro, Ser while significantly decreased levels of Arg and Tyr in D12 GRU102.</td><td valign="top">The general trend that Metformin increased levels of several individual amino acids still holds, even though the two replicates showed a slight variation in the identity of amino acids that were increased.
