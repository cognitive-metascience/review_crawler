A putative neural substrate of motor preparation occurs when a delay separates instruction and execution cues. When readiness is sustained during the delay, sustained neural activity is observed in motor and premotor areas. Yet whether delay-period activity reflects an essential preparatory stage is controversial. In particular, it has remained ambiguous whether delay-period-like activity appears before non-delayed movements. To overcome that ambiguity, we leveraged a recently developed analysis method that parses population responses into putatively preparatory and movement-related components. We examined cortical responses when reaches were initiated after an imposed delay, at a self-chosen time, or reactively with low latency and no delay. Putatively preparatory events were conserved across all contexts. Our findings support the hypothesis that an appropriate preparatory state is consistently achieved before movement onset. However, our results reveal that this process can consume surprisingly little time.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>reaching</kwd><kwd>movement preparation</kwd><kwd>motor cortex</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rhesus macaque</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000879</institution-id><institution>Alfred P.

al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rosenbaum, 2010</xref>). Most fundamentally, the voluntary reaction time (RT) typically becomes shorter when a delay period separates an instruction from a go cue, presumably because the delay allows preparation time to complete (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rosenbaum, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Riehle and Requin, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Michaels et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Churchland et al., 2006</xref>). Neurons in many brain areas â including primary motor cortex (M1) and dorsal premotor cortex (PMd) â respond selectively during the delay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tanji and Evarts, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Riehle and Requin, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Weinrich et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Godschalk et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wise and Kurata, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kurata, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Crammond and Kalaska, 1989</xref>). Delay-period activity is thus hypothesized to reflect a preparatory process, albeit one that becomes artificially sustained due to the imposed delay. In support of this interpretation, delay-period activity is predictive of RT variability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Riehle and Requin, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Michaels et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bastian et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Churchland et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Afshar et al., 2011</xref>) and its disruption erases RT-savings provided by the delay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Churchland and Shenoy, 2007a</xref>).</p><p>Although appealing, aspects of this interpretation remain incomplete, uncertain, or controversial. There exist at least three alternative interpretations where delay-period activity is either not preparatory or not essential. First, delay-period activity may be primarily (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wong et al., 2015</xref>) or partially (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Perfiliev et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wise et al., 1986</xref>) suppressive, reflecting the need to inhibit movement until the go cue. Second, delay-period activity may be facilitatory but inessential and may thus be bypassed when there is no delay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ames et al., 2014</xref>). Third, delay-period activity may reflect a higher-level âplanningâ process essential only when movements are complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wong et al., 2015</xref>) or involve a non-direct motor mapping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Perfiliev et al., 2010</xref>) (e.g. between joystick and cursor motion). In support of the latter proposal, direct reaches can be executed at such short latencies that âit is not possible to regard the response as voluntarily plannedâ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Perfiliev et al., 2010</xref>) under the typical assumption that motor preparation is a time-consuming process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rosenbaum, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Riehle and Requin, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ghez et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bastian et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Churchland et al., 2006</xref>). Related behavioral results similarly argue that preparation is either unnecessary or much faster than typically assumed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wong et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Haith et al., 2016</xref>). Behind the above alternatives lies a deeper concern: perhaps delay-period activity is specific to an artificial situation where an experimenter-imposed delay interrupts the normal pacing of voluntary movement.</p><p>We test the hypothesis that delay-period activity reflects an essential preparatory stage yet can occur unexpectedly rapidly. A central prediction of that hypothesis is that activity resembling delay-period activity should still occur, briefly, when the delay duration is zero. This has been explored by multiple studies but results have remained ambiguous. An early study revealed that some aspects of delay-period activity are recapitulated without a delay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Crammond and Kalaska, 2000</xref>), as did (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Churchland et al., 2006</xref>). However, using state-space methods, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ames et al., 2014</xref>) found that the delay-period neural state was bypassed in zero-delay trials. This result has been variously interpreted as evidence that delay-period activity is beneficial but inessential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ames et al., 2014</xref>), that delay-period activity is suppressive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wong et al., 2015</xref>), or that the range of acceptable preparatory states is broad (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Michaels et al., 2015</xref>). Yet other findings of Ames et al. suggested that some early, and putatively preparatory, response aspects are present without a delay.</p><p>Here we compare neural activity with and without a delay but employ a different analysis approach and consider neural activity across a broader range of behavioral contexts. To observe neural activity during an imposed delay, we used the standard delayed-reach paradigm with an explicit go cue (the âcue-initiated contextâ). To examine preparation without a delay, we did not simply reduce the cue-initiated delay to zero (as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Crammond and Kalaska, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Churchland et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ames et al., 2014</xref>) but instead adopted the paradigm of (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Perfiliev et al., 2010</xref>) and used moving targets. Because moving targets evoke particularly low-latency reaches, this âquasi-automaticâ context provides a stringent test of the prediction that delay-period-like activity should appear in the absence of a delay. We also employed a âself-initiatedâ context: monkeys were free to reach upon target onset but received larger rewards if they chose to wait. This context was designed to distinguish between the competing hypotheses that delay-period activity is preparatory versus suppressive. If preparatory, delay-period-like activity should be present in the self-initiated context and should grow with time. If suppressive, any such activity should wane with time.</p><p>As in prior studies, a technical hurdle is determining whether the patterns of neural activity during a delay reappear without a delay. Most neurons with delay-period activity also exhibit movement-related activity, making it challenging to determine whether activity in a narrow time-window is preparation-related, movement-related, or some combination. To overcome this challenge, we leveraged the recent finding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Elsayed et al., 2016</xref>) that delay-period activity and movement-related activity occupy orthogonal population-level subspaces. Based on the cue-initiated context, we used delay-period responses to define a putatively âpreparatory subspaceâ and responses during movement to define a âmovement subspaceâ. We then quantified events in these subspaces during the other contexts.</p><p>Preparatory- and movement-subspace activity patterns were surprisingly well-conserved across contexts. For self-initiated reaches, preparatory subspace activity grew with time, becoming strongest before movement onset. This finding agrees with the hypothesis that such activity plays a preparatory rather than suppressive role. Quasi-automatic reaches exhibited the same sequence of preparatory- and movement-subspace events as cue-initiated and self-initiated reaches. However, that sequence unfolded remarkably rapidly: preparatory-subspace events led movement-subspace events by only a few tens of milliseconds. We have hypothesized that a goal of movement preparation is to initialize movement-generating dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Churchland et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Churchland et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Churchland et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Shenoy et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Churchland and Cunningham, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sussillo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Michaels et al., 2016</xref>). Consistent with a key prediction of this hypothesis, each reach direction was preceded by a preparatory-subspace state that was similar across contexts. Thus, our results support the hypothesis that delay-period activity reflects a preparatory process that consistently occurs even when there is no delay. However, in agreement with (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Perfiliev et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Haith et al., 2016</xref>), our results argue against the idea that movement preparation necessarily involves time-consuming cognitive or high-level planning processes. It is more likely that preparatory activity plays a straightforward and mechanistic role: initializing the networks that will produce descending motor commands.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>We trained two monkeys (Ba and Ax) to execute reaches from a central touch-point to radially arranged targets. We employed three contexts. The cue-initiated context (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>) emulated the standard instructed-delay paradigm: a variable delay period (0â1000 ms) separated target onset from an explicit go cue. A key hypothesis being examined is that motor preparation can occur during the delay and is reflected in delay-period neural activity. We thus analyzed trials with delaysÂ &gt;Â 400 ms, allowing observation of sustained delay-period activity. Shorter delays ensured the go cue was unpredictable, encouraging timely and consistent preparation.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31826.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Behavioral task.</title><p>Monkeys performed the same set of reaches under three initiation contexts.

Growing target size mirrored the growing reward. The self-initiated context was included to distinguish between the hypotheses that delay-period activity is primarily preparatory versus suppressive. The preparatory hypothesis predicts that delay-period-like activity should be present in the self-initiated context and should grow stronger in anticipation of execution. Conversely, the suppressive hypothesis predicts that delay-period-like activity should wane as execution becomes more probable and suppression is relieved.</p><p>The quasi-automatic context (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>) was similar to the cue-initiated context, but the go cue was the onset of target motion along a radial path toward the screenâs edge. Monkeys had to intercept the target mid-flight as it âescapedâ. Initial target position was calibrated such that interception occurred close to the target position in the other contexts. To recapitulate the traditional comparison between trials with zero delay versus a long delay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Crammond and Kalaska, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Churchland et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ames et al., 2014</xref>), we analyzed only zero-delay quasi-automatic trials and compared with cue-initiated trials possessing a delayÂ &gt;400 ms (see above). This provides a particularly stringent comparison because moving targets evoke quite low-latency responses (see below). Given this time pressure, delay-period-like events are expected to be observed during the quasi-automatic context only if they are part of the typical process of movement preparation and initiation, and not if they are suppressive or are otherwise an âartificialâ product of the experimenter-imposed delay. The quasi-automatic context also allows exploration of the possibility that preparation is beneficial but âskippedâ when movements are hurried (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ames et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Touch-point/target color specified context (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).

The target was missed if a reach was executed but did not land within the acceptance window. Delay violations occurred if above-threshold hand velocity was detected between target onset and the go cue. This could occur if the monkey made an overt reach or a small adjustment. Trials were also failed if hand velocity was above threshold during the interval from the go cue until 100 ms later. Changes in hand velocity during this time are unlikely to reflect legitimate responses to the go cue, and were thus treated the same way as movement during the delay. Movement during the target-hold period (after it was successfully hit) also resulted in a failure. This occurred if velocity exceeded threshold, or if hand position exited the acceptance window. The maximum RT (500 ms for cue-initiated, 1500 ms for self-initiated) elapsed if the hand never moved. Such failures tended to happen if the monkey became distracted during a trial, or near the end of the day as motivation waned. For example, simply holding the hand on the screen but not performing the task resulted in such failures being recorded. Violations of the maximum movement duration occurred if the hand left the touch-point but did not land on the target within 500 ms. This could occur for very sluggish movements, or if the monkey simply aborted the trial and did not attempt to hit the target. We also included in this category failures in the quasi-automatic context where the hand did not land back on the screen before the target disappeared off the screen.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top"/><th colspan="3" valign="top">Monkey ba</th><th colspan="3" valign="top">Monkey ax</th></tr><tr><th valign="top"/><th valign="top">Cue-initiated</th><th valign="top">Self-initiated</th><th valign="top">Quasi-automatic</th><th valign="top">Cue-initiated</th><th valign="top">Self-initiated</th><th valign="top">Quasi-automatic</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Missed target</td><td valign="top">1.4%</td><td valign="top">4.1%</td><td valign="top">3.3%</td><td valign="top">0.9%</td><td valign="top">1.6%</td><td valign="top">2.4%</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Delay violation <break/>(adjustment or overt reach)</td><td valign="top">2.2%</td><td valign="top">NA</td><td valign="top">NA</td><td valign="top">1.3%</td><td valign="top">NA</td><td valign="top">NA</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Velocity violation within 100 ms <break/>of go cue (adjustment <break/>or non-physiological RT)</td><td valign="top">1.6%</td><td valign="top">0.1%</td><td valign="top">0.6%</td><td valign="top">1.1%</td><td valign="top">0%</td><td valign="top">0.5%</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Moved during <break/>target-hold period</td><td valign="top">1.4%</td><td valign="top">1.3%</td><td valign="top">2.1%</td><td valign="top">1.5%</td><td valign="top">1.2%</td><td valign="top">1.1%</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Max RT elapsed</td><td valign="top">2.2%</td><td valign="top">2.6%</td><td valign="top">NA</td><td valign="top">0.8%</td><td valign="top">0.6%</td><td valign="top">NA</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Max movement <break/>duration elapsed</td><td valign="top">0.2%</td><td valign="top">0.2%</td><td valign="top">1.3% <break/>(target left screen)</td><td valign="top">0.1%</td><td valign="top">0.2%</td><td valign="top">2.7% <break/>(target left screen)</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s2-1"><title>Reaction times (RTs)</title><p>RT was defined as the time between the visual go cue (confirmed by a photodetector) and a change in hand velocity (<italic>Methods</italic>).

This question has traditionally been addressed by including zero-delay trials that are otherwise identical to long-delay trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Crammond and Kalaska, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Churchland et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ames et al., 2014</xref>). While valid, that approach raises a potential concern: might monkeys, once accustomed to a delay, start to treat zero-delay trials as if they have a delay? For example, mightÂ monkeys increase their RT to accommodate the expectation of a delay and begin to generate delay-period-like neural events that would otherwise not occur? The low-latency of quasi-automatic trials addresses such concerns. Monkeys cannot be âaddingâ their own delay, otherwise RTs would be longer rather than shorter than for the cue-initiated context. Indeed, quasi-automatic responses are sufficiently swift that it becomes reasonable to question whether preparation is possible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Perfiliev et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Haith et al., 2016</xref>). That said, we do not argue that the quasi-automatic context represents a different âclassâ of movement.

Quasi-automatic reaches tended to have a slightly greater extent and a slightly higher peak velocity (on average 7% and 9% higher relative to cue-initiated movements) but were otherwise very similar to cue-initiated and self-initiated reaches. It may seem surprising that quasi-automatic reaches did not display dramatically higher velocities. However, we find that monkeys typically reach rapidly even when not required, presumably out of a desire to obtain reward quickly once the decision to move has been made.</p><p>Might monkeys sometimes begin quasi-automatic reaches before they are fully specified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ghez et al., 1997</xref>), which might cause preparation to be trivially absent?

Yet while quasi-automatic movements were consistently target-directed, they were slightly less accurate: the circular standard deviation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berens, 2009</xref>) of initial reach direction was 17% and 11% higher (monkey Ba and Ax; p&lt;0.001 for both). Furthermore, quasi-automatic trials with RTs shorter than the median were slightly less accurate than those with RTs longer than the median: the standard deviation of reach direction was 4.9% and 3.0% higher (p&lt;0.05 for monkey Ba, NS for monkey Ax). In absolute terms these effects were small â the standard deviation of initial reach direction was never higher than 4.3 degrees. Still, reaches that missed the target were slightly more common in the quasi-automatic context: an increase from 1.4% (cue-initiated) to 3.3% (quasi-automatic) for monkey Ba and from 0.9% to 2.4% for monkey Ax.

For example, the neuron illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref> shows multiple response phases following the go cue, including a peakÂ ~75 ms before movement onset (higher for rightwards reaches; <italic>lighter red traces</italic>) and a subsequent peak during movement (higher for leftwards reaches; <italic>darker red traces</italic>). Should the first peak be interpreted as a final strengthening of a preparation-related response or the beginning of a movement-related response? Is such a distinction even meaningful? Similar ambiguity was present even when neurons had seemingly simple responses. The neuron illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref> (<italic>red traces</italic>) exhibits activity just before movement that is a magnified version of delay-period activity. Does that peak reflect the culmination of putatively preparatory activity, or is it a movement-related burst? These uncertainties highlight a known limitation of the instructed-delay paradigm: it is challenging to interpret neural events between the go cue and movement onset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Crammond and Kalaska, 2000</xref>). This challenge will become particularly relevant when examining responses during the quasi-automatic context, where that interval is the only opportunity for preparatory events.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Single-neuron responses during the self-initiated context</title><p>If delay-period activity is primarily suppressive, then in the self-initiated context, delay-period-like activity should be present but should wane as movement approaches and suppression is relieved. The opposite should occur if delay-period activity is primarily preparatory: delay-period-like activity should grow with time in the self-initiated context. Single-neuron responses followed the second prediction. Pre-movement activity in the self-initiated context grew stronger with time and came to resemble delay-period activity in the cue-initiated context. For example, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>, the ordering of tracesÂ ~Â 250 ms before movement onset is similar for the self-initiated (<italic>blue</italic>) and cue-initiated (<italic>red</italic>) contexts.</p><p>During the first 150 ms after target onset, the median correlation between self-initiated and cue-initiated activity patterns was low (across-neuron median <italic>r</italic>Â =Â 0.39 and 0.16 for the two monkeys), largely because activity was often weak in the self-initiated context. Correlations became stronger as movement onset neared (median <italic>r</italic>Â =Â 0.86 and 0.74, using a 150 ms window ending 50 ms before movement onset).

The primary difference was a tendency for some features to be slightly magnified in the quasi-automatic context (e.g.Â the central peak in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>), consistent with the slightly greater reach speed and slightly stronger muscle activity in the quasi-automatic context.</p><p>Do responses in the quasi-automatic context contain putatively preparatory aspects? Addressing this question requires interpreting events between target onset and movement onset. Consider the neurons illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a,c</xref>. For both, the first pattern of activity to emerge in the quasi-automatic context resembled that shortly before movement onset in the cue-initiated context. But does activity at that time reflect the culmination of preparation or the beginning of movement-related activity? As discussed above, this is difficult to infer from individual-neuron responses.</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>Segregating preparatory and movement responses at the population level</title><p>We employed a recently developed method to segregate the population response into putatively preparatory and movement-related aspects. This method leverages the unexpected observation that neuron-neuron correlations change dramatically between delay and movement epochs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Elsayed et al., 2016</xref>). Specifically, the âneural dimensionsâ that best capture delay-epoch activity do not capture movement-epoch activity and vice versa. Our strategy is to use the cue-initiated context to identify a set of neural dimensions capturing delay-epoch activity and an orthogonal set of dimensions capturing movement-epoch activity. If delay-epoch activity reflects a standardly occurring preparatory process, the corresponding dimensions may similarly capture preparatory processing in the other two contexts. Alternatively, if delay-epoch activity reflects some non-preparatory process specific to an experimenter-imposed delay, the corresponding dimensions will either capture little activity during the other contexts or will capture activity unrelated to delay-epoch activity.</p><p>The simplest method for identifying putatively preparatory and movement-related dimensions is to apply principal component analysis separately to delay-epoch and movement-epoch data. Empirically, this results in two sets of dimensions that are naturally close to orthogonal. We improved upon this approach by identifying all dimensions jointly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Elsayed et al., 2016</xref>); our cost function seeks one set of dimensions capturing maximal delay-epoch variance and an orthogonal set of dimensions capturing maximal movement-epoch variance. This achieves a result similar to principal component analysis but ensures all dimensions are truly orthogonal. Dimensions were found based on neural responses during the cue-initiated context only. We identified twelve dimensions, collectively the putative âpreparatory subspaceâ, that captured 80% of delay-epoch firing rate variance but only 3% of movement-epoch variance. We isolated twelve further dimensions, collectively the âmovement subspaceâ, that captured 85% of movement-epoch variance but only 3% of delay-epoch variance. The above percentages are for monkey Ba and were similar for monkey Ax (72% versus 4% and 83% versus 3%). We specifically sought dimensions capturing response aspects that vary with condition (i.e. are âtunedâ for reach direction). Untuned response aspects exist in separate, largely orthogonal, dimensions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kaufman et al., 2014</xref>) and are not analyzed here.</p><p>We projected the population response onto each preparatory and movement dimension (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, <italic>middle</italic>). Each projection is a weighted sum of single-neuron responses (weights are the elements of the vector defining the dimension). Because weights are optimized to capture response variance, projections are not only readouts but also building blocks of single-neuron responses (as for principal component analysis). Using these building blocks, it becomes possible to estimate different contributions to each neuronâs response. For example, the response of neuron 88 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, <italic>rightmost column</italic>) is accurately approximated as the sum of a preparatory-subspace pattern (a weighted sum of preparatory projections, <italic>orange</italic>) and a movement-subspace pattern (a weighted sum of movement projections, <italic>purple</italic>).

Under this hypothesis, preparatory activity develops shortly after target onset, but rises at different rates on different trials, leading to different RTs. A related hypothesis (not illustrated) is that the rise is stochastic and a higher average slope produces short RT trials. These hypotheses lead to the following prediction when trials are aligned to movement onset and averaged: when looking back in time, preparatory activity should decline slowly for trials with longer RTs (which had shallower slopes), and quickly for trials with shorter RTs (which had steeper slopes). (<bold>b</bold>) Schematic of the âprepare-on-demandâ hypothesis. Under this hypothesis, preparatory activity stays weak until close to the time of movement. Activity then rises in a stereotyped profile, and movement onset follows shortly thereafter. Note that this profile could involve a step, a ramp, or a variety of other shapes. The key aspect of this hypothesis is not the exact temporal profile, but rather the proposition that the profile is stereotyped across trials. Despite this stereotypy, average target-locked data could appear as a steady rise. In contrast, averages locked to movement onset would better capture the typical temporal profile. Thus, a central prediction of the prepare-on-demand hypothesis is that movement-locked averages will look similar for short-RT and long-RT trials. (<bold>c</bold>) Preparatory subspace occupancy computed from data locked to movement onset for monkey Ba. For each neuron, trials were divided into those shorter and longer than the median. This yielded both a short-RT and a long-RT population response. Populations responses were projected into the preparatory subspace (found using the cue-initiated context, as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>) and occupancy was computed. Only data after target onset are shown. Thus, the leftwards extent of each trace is limited by the longest interval between target onset and movement onset (which is of course longer for long-RT trials). The profile of preparatory occupancy is similar for short-RT and long-RT trials. These results are most consistent with the prepare-on-demand hypothesis. There is only a slight hint of occupancy being higher for long-RT trials prior to movement onset, as predicted by the target-locked-rise hypothesis. (<bold>d</bold>) Same as panel c but for monkey Ax. In summary, temporal profiles were somewhat different for the two monkeys (more ramp-like for monkey Ba and more step-like for monkey Ax). However, in both cases the profile was very similar regardless of RT, consistent with the prepare-on-demand hypothesis. We stress that this analysis still averages over potentially diverse single-trial events. For example, the ramp of preparatory subspace occupancy that beginsÂ ~400 ms before movement onset could be a ramp on every trial, or a step with somewhat variable timing: sometimes rising 350 ms before movement onset and sometimes rising 200 ms before movement onset. What can be concluded is that RT variability is not primarily driven by variability in the slope of ramping preparatory activity.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="postscript" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-31826-fig8-figsupp1-v2"/></fig></fig-group><p>In the cue-initiated context, occupancy rose sharply following target onset and was sustained at a lower level throughout the delay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8a</xref>).

These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that a preparatory stage, involving delay-period-like activity, is present during the quasi-automatic context despite the absence of a delay and the low latency of the reaches. However, that putatively preparatory stage appears to be very rapid: preparatory-subspace occupancy precedes movement-subspace occupancy by only a few tens of milliseconds: 33 ms for monkey Ba and 42 ms for monkey Ax (assessed using a threshold of 10% of the peak, p&lt;0.001 for both).</p></sec><sec id="s2-12"><title>The preparatory subspace is occupied for short-RT quasi-automatic trials</title><p>A small percentage of quasi-automatic trials had relatively long RTs and thus less time pressure (bottom of <italic>panel a</italic> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and associated figure supplements). Might preparatory-subspace occupancy in the quasi-automatic context be primarily due to such trials? This seems unlikely a priori: if most trials lacked preparatory-subspace activity, trial-averaged activity would show very low preparatory-subspace occupancy. We further addressed this issue by re-analyzing the data after excluding trials with long RTs.

This allows one to observe that some key events occur more swiftly for short-RT trials. For the averages made from all trials, preparatory-subspace activity is just reaching its zenith at the end of the window starting at target onset. In contrast, for short-RT trials, activity has already begun to decline, in anticipation of movement onset, by the end of that window. This decline then completes sooner for short-RT trials (compare third subpanel across rows in a). Rotational dynamics also begin and end at earlier times for short-RT trials. This earlier occurrence of key events is expected, assuming a relatively tight link between the offset of preparatory-subspace activity, the onset of rotational dynamics, and the onset of muscle activity and physical movement.

As movement onset approached, the preparatory-subspace pattern became more robust and closely resembled that in the cue-initiated context. For the quasi-automatic context, the preparatory-subspace pattern was very short-lived: it grew rapidly following target onset then immediately collapsed prior to movement onset. However, while present, the preparatory-subspace pattern during the quasi-automatic context closely resembled that in the other two contexts (compare across contexts in the third-to-last column of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10a</xref>).

To address this question we focused on the preparatory subspace at a time â 55 ms before movement onset â when both preparatory and movement subspaces are occupied. At this time, preparatory-subspace occupancy is still high and movement-subspace activity has just started to emerge. It has been hypothesized that movement-generating dynamics are seeded by preparation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Churchland et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Elsayed et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Churchland et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Churchland et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Churchland and Cunningham, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sussillo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Michaels et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hennequin et al., 2014</xref>). Under this hypothesis, movement-related activity is largely determined by the preparatory state when movement-related activity begins. The preparatory-subspace state at that moment is thus predicted to be similar across contexts, given that subsequent patterns of movement-subspace activity are similar. We refer to that potentially critical preparatory-subspace state as the âfinalâ preparatory state. After that moment, preparatory-subspace activity declines to near-baseline levels and movement-subspace activity becomes strong.</p><p>The final preparatory state was similar across contexts. For each reach direction, the triplet of neural states for the three contexts formed a cluster (grouped via covariance ellipses in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11a,b</xref>). Clusters were quite tight for monkey Ba and somewhat less so for monkey Ax. To quantify tightness of clustering â i.e. the similarity of states across contexts â we computed the correlation, between contexts, of the set of preparatory-subspace states (one state per reach direction). Considering the top two dimensions, the correlation between cue-initiated and self-initiated contexts was 0.99 for monkey Ba and 0.95 for monkey Ax (95% CIs were 0.98â0.99 and 0.86â0.98). The correlation between cue-initiated and quasi-automatic contexts was 0.99 for monkey Ba and 0.91 for monkey Ax (0.97â1.0 and 0.76â0.97). The correlation between self-initiated and quasi-automatic contexts was 0.99 for monkey Ba and 0.92 for monkey Ax (0.97â1.0 and 0.79â0.97). All correlations were statistically significant (p&lt;0.001). Results were similar if we considered all twelve preparatory dimensions. Although higher dimensions primarily captured noise, their inclusion did not have a large impact on correlations because they contributed little variance.:Â correlations ranged from 0.73 to 0.95 (across three comparisons for two monkeys), only modestly reduced from the 0.91â0.99 range for two dimensions.

For such trials, the preparatory-subspace state still varies strongly across target locations (different colored circles). This observation further underscores the results obtained when analyzing occupancy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9a</xref>). Second, preparatory-subspace states continue to cluster by target direction. That is, for a given target direction, the preparatory states for the three contexts tend to be close to one another. Clustering is slightly weaker than when considering all the data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11a,b</xref>). This may be a real effect or may simply reflect increased sampling noise after down-selection (some neurons are now contributing only 3 trials for a given target location).</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="postscript" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-31826-fig11-figsupp1-v2"/></fig></fig-group><p>The clustering of preparatory states, evident in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11a,b</xref>, was very similar when considering trials with RTs shorter than the median (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11s1">Figure 11âfigure supplement 1</xref>). This confirms the results of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>: preparatory-subspace activity remains robust even when excluding trials with longer RTs. For the analyses in both <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11a,b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11s1">Figure 11âfigure supplement 1</xref>, clustering was very tight for monkey Ba (preparatory-subspace states were nearly identical across contexts) and less so for monkey Ax (preparatory-subspace states were quite similar, but not identical, across contexts). The less-tight clustering for monkey Ax may reflect the small across-context differences in the reaches being prepared and executed or may reflect a small influence of context itself on the preparatory state.</p><p>The above results establish that preparatory-subspace activity, shortly before movement onset, is similar across contexts. To assess the time-course of similarity, at each time we computed the covariance between the neural states in one context and those in another. Covariance reflects both similarity and strength and is thus expected to peak at a time when preparatory patterns are both similar and robust. When comparing the self-initiated and cue-initiated contexts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11c,d</xref>; <italic>blue</italic>) covariance rose as movement approached, peaking slightly more than 100 ms (monkey Ba and Ax) before movement onset. This is consistent with what can be observed in earlier figures: in the preparatory subspace, the pattern of states in the self-initiated context generally resembles the pattern in the cue-initiated context but is weaker until movement onset nears.</p><p>When comparing the quasi-automatic and cue-initiated contexts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11c,d</xref>; <italic>yellow</italic>) covariance rose rapidly, peakingÂ ~65 ms andÂ ~75 ms (monkey Ba and Ax) before movement onset. These peaks occur just after activity in the movement-subspace first begins to change, atÂ ~75 ms (monkey Ba) andÂ ~80 ms (monkey Ax) prior to movement onset in the quasi-automatic context. The narrowness of the peak underscores that there was only a brief period where both contexts had strong preparatory activity with similar structure. Thus, while the pattern of preparatory subspace activity in the quasi-automatic context comes to closely match that in the cue-initiated context, this similarity occurs late, just as movement-subspace activity is developing. This is consistent with a preparatory process that is present across contexts but unfolds very rapidly in the quasi-automatic context.</p></sec><sec id="s2-15"><title>Methodology and the segregation between preparatory and movement subspaces</title><p>Our dimensionality reduction approach maximizes the degree to which the preparatory subspace captures delay-period activity in the cue-initiated context, and the degree to which the movement subspace captures movement-related activity in the cue-initiated context. Importantly, this approach can segregate activity into separate subspaces only if the data naturally have that property. This is not in general the case (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Elsayed et al., 2016</xref>). For example, while recent dynamical models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Churchland et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sussillo et al., 2015</xref>) employ a null space in which preparatory activity can develop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kaufman et al., 2014</xref>), they do not exhibit preparatory and movement-related activity that live in orthogonal dimensions. Segregation would also not have been possible if tuning were similar between preparation and movement. Thus, the almost complete disappearance of preparatory-subspace occupancy during the movement, and the almost complete absence of movement-subspace occupancy during the delay, are features of the data that were not appreciated until recently.</p><p>We used broad epochs of time to define the two subspaces and thus imposed no particular structure upon the time-course of occupancy. Because subspaces were identified blind to all data from the self-initiated and quasi-automatic contexts, the magnitude and time-course of occupancy in those contexts is a consequence not of the method but of shared aspects of the population response across contexts. The exact choice of temporal epochs used to define the subspaces generally had little impact on our results. However, we did find that such choices could subtly impact the profile of delay-period occupancy. For example, the initial peak in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8a</xref> was somewhat more prominent if we shifted the delay-epoch earlier, and the final peak was somewhat more prominent if we shifted the delay-epoch later. This indicates that the subspace being occupied changes subtly over the course of the delay.</p><p>Dimensions found using cue-initiated data allow one to address whether events during the cue-initiated context also occur during the other contexts. Those dimensions do not address a different question: might there exist additional structure in the other contexts, outside the subspaces identified using the cue-initiated context? This is essentially guaranteed to be true to some degree but cannot be a large effect: preparatory and movement subspaces captured nearly as much variance (86% on average) for the self-initiated and quasi-automatic contexts as they did for the cue-initiated context. We also addressed this question by repeating the analysis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> but with preparatory and movement subspaces based on activity during the self-initiated context. Results were very similar overall, but preparatory-subspace occupancy in the self-initiated context was accentuated slightly for monkey Ba and noticeably for monkey Ax. This finding should be interpreted with some caution â dimensions will of course tend to best capture the data upon which optimization is based. Nevertheless, the result indicates that the subspaces occupied in the cue-initiated and self-initiated contexts are not perfectly aligned. This could indicate aspects of activity unique to self-initiated movements or may reflect the small differences in the upcoming reaches themselves. These same possibilities relate to the finding that there was a good but not always perfect match between the final preparatory states for the three contexts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11a,b</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-16"><title>Relative timing of movement-related events</title><p>Given that motor cortex connects directly and indirectly to motoneurons, we wished to characterize the timing between movement-subspace occupancy and the onset of muscle activity. For both, we assessed latency by measuring the moment when activity surpassed 10% of its peak. To minimize the impact of filtering on latency, these analyses employed a 10 ms Gaussian filter for both neural and EMG data. Across monkeys and contexts, the movement subspace always became occupied just before the onset of changes in EMG, with an average latency of 21 ms. For comparison, the conduction delay from cortex to muscles, assessed via spike-triggered averages, can be as little as 6 ms from the time of a spike to the peak of the EMG response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fetz and Cheney, 1980</xref>). This delay is slightly shorter (~4 ms for the lowest-latency neurons) when considering the initial rather than peak EMG response. Thus, activity in the movement subspace rises early enough to potentially account for the onset of muscle activity. This was consistently true across contexts, although with slight variability. The latency between the onset of movement-subspace activity and muscle activity was, for monkey Ba and Ax, 27 and 20 ms (cue-initiated), 33 and 22 ms (self-initiated) and 19 and 6 ms (quasi-automatic). These exact latencies should be interpreted with some caution: latencies are notoriously difficult to assess because high thresholds overestimate latency while low thresholds are sensitiveÂ to noise. Still, our best estimates indicate that, if cortico-motoneurons draw from movement-subspace activity, the onset of such activity occurs early enough to contribute to the onset of muscle activity.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Is delay-period activity a reflection of motor preparation?</title><p>The first studies of delay-period activity employed two target directions and noted that directional selectivity could either agree with subsequent movement activity â suggesting a preparatory role â or disagree â suggesting a suppressive role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wise et al., 1986</xref>). Later experiments leveraged a greater range of movements, revealing that delay-period and movement-related selectivity typically differ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Crammond and Kalaska, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Elsayed et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Churchland et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kaufman et al., 2010</xref>). Thus, delay-period activity is not a subthreshold form of movement-related activity. It was instead suggested that delay-period activity may initialize neural dynamics that will produce movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Churchland et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Churchland et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Churchland et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Churchland and Cunningham, 2014</xref>). Yet a recent study yielded mixed evidence for this hypothesis when comparing activity with and without a delay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ames et al., 2014</xref>), highlighting the longstanding uncertainty regarding whether delay-period activity represents an essential preparatory process, a facilitatory but non-obligatory process, or a suppressive process specific to an artificial imposed delay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wong et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>The present results reveal that the neural process present during a delay-period is not specific to that situation. Delay-period-like activity is consistently observed in other contexts and displays the following properties. First, activity occupies a âpreparatoryâ subspace orthogonal to that occupied during movement. Second, activity in that preparatory subspace consistently occurs before movement-subspace activity. Third, activity in the preparatory subspace achieves a direction-specific state before movement onset, and this state is similar regardless of the presence of an imposed delay. Similarity is most robust at the critical moment when movement-subspace activity is just beginning.</p><p>These results do not prove that preparatory-subspace activity is preparatory, only that it follows the major predictions of that hypothesis. It is currently not feasible to perform a key causal test: perturbing activity in the preparatory subspace only. Still, non-specific disruption of premotor cortex activity impacts RT in a manner consistent with disruption of a preparatory process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Churchland and Shenoy, 2007a</xref>).

The view that preparation is time-consuming has enjoyed explanatory power and has motivated successful comparisons of trial-to-trial RT and neural variability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Riehle and Requin, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Michaels et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bastian et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Churchland et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Afshar et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Yet there exist compelling recent arguments against the necessity of a time-consuming preparatory process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wong et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Perfiliev et al., 2010</xref>). The present findings support those arguments. In the quasi-automatic context, EMG latencies could be as short as 90â110 ms on some trials. Thus, there cannot exist an obligatory preparatory process that necessarily takes 100â200 ms to complete. Neural data are consistent with a preparatory process that can be very rapid. In the quasi-automatic context, preparatory subspace activity leads movement-subspace activity by onlyÂ ~40 ms, and the preparatory-subspace state came to match that in the cue-initiated context inÂ ~70 ms. These findings rule out the idea of a slow, cognitive planning process that must complete before movement begins. These findings support the hypothesis that preparatory activity is necessary to seed movement-generating dynamics but indicate that such activity can develop quite rapidly.</p><p>However, when time is available (as for both the self-initiated and cue-initiated contexts) the preparatory subspace becomes occupied well before movement onset. If preparation can be rapid, there would seem little advantage to this strategy â why not simply wait to prepare until just before movement onset? We can only speculate, but the ability to rapidly and consistently achieve the correct preparatory state may be uncertain in many real-world situations. The motor system may thus have developed the strategy of preparing in advance when possible, allowing time to correct small inaccuracies before movement begins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Churchland et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Churchland and Shenoy, 2007a</xref>). More broadly, rapid preparation may be feasible only for well-practiced movements, leading to a default strategy of preparing in advance when possible.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Putatively preparatory and movement-related processes overlap</title><p>Preparatory-subspace activity declines as movement-subspace activity develops, with an overlap ofÂ ~100 ms. This overlap is consistent with (and indeed required by) the hypothesis that preparatory-subspace activity seeds movement-subspace dynamics. Aspects of the overlap explain a seeming discrepancy. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ames et al., 2014</xref>) found that the neural state for zero-delay trials does not pass through the state achieved during the delay of long-delay trials. This seems at odds with our finding that a consistent preparatory-subspace state is achieved across all contexts. In fact, our results are fully compatible. Preparatory-subspace activity in the quasi-automatic and cue-initiated contexts became maximally similar slightly after movement-subspace activity emerged. Thus, at the moment when preparatory-subspace states are similar, the full neural state contains both preparation-related and movement-related contributions (and will also contain condition-independent components linked to movement initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kaufman et al., 2016</xref>)). The full neural state at this moment will therefore not match that during a delay period, when only the preparatory-subspace contribution is present.</p><p>With this conflict resolved, the present results support and extend two key conclusions of Ames et al. First, the initial response to target onset is similar for zero-delay and long-delay trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10a</xref>, compare the âtargetâ panel between cue-initiated and quasi-automatic contexts). Second, when under time pressure, the neural state does not momentarily pause at a stable state prior to the onset of movement-related activity (also see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Michaels et al., 2015</xref>)). Indeed, in the quasi-automatic context, events are so compressed that preparatory-subspace activity is still developing as movement-subspace activity is beginning.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Stability of preparatory activity across the delay period</title><p>We have hypothesized that motor preparation involves achieving a neural state that will appropriately seed movement-period dynamics. In its most idealized form, this hypothesis predicts that an appropriate preparatory state should be achieved soon after target onset and should remain static across any imposed delay. Models incorporating this idealized assumption yield reasonably realistic single-unit responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Churchland et al., 2012</xref>). More sophisticated network models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sussillo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Michaels et al., 2016</xref>) produce similar but less-idealized responses: preparatory activity is relatively stable during the delay but is not perfectly static. Network models do not require perfect stability because multiple similar, but non-identical, preparatory states can produce nearly identical network outputs (as proposed by the âoptimal subspace hypothesisâ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Churchland et al., 2006</xref>)).</p><p>The empirical population response during the cue-initiated context behaved much like that of network models. In the dominant preparatory dimensions, activity developed quickly and remained relatively stable across the delay. However, there were still some fluctuations with time, as can be seen in both state-space plots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>) and in projections as a function of time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Such fluctuations were also present in less-dominant dimensions and in âuntunedâ response components (which were not analyzed here). Thus, the ideal of stable preparatory activity is only a first-order approximation, and this is true for both network models and the empirical data.</p><p>Very unstable activity during a memory period was recently observed in parietal cortex and ventral premotor cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Michaels et al., 2018</xref>). It is possible that neural events unfold differently during a memory period versus a delay period. However, a more interesting possibility is that the stability of preparatory activity may be area-specific. Activity may be more stable in areas where it serves a direct pre-motor purpose (initializing movement-period dynamics) and less so in areas where it relates to anticipation or more cognitive aspects of the task.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Preparing versus deciding</title><p>Our data argue against the conception of preparation as an intrinsically slow, cognitive process. Yet our findings remain consistent with the hypothesis that slow cognitive processes influence preparatory activity. It is well established that pre-movement activity in a variety of brain regions can reflect decisions regarding when or where to move (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Thura et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cisek and Kalaska, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Roitman and Shadlen, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kaufman et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Guo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Murakami et al., 2014</xref>). Such decisions can sometimes unfold slowly or vacillate with time. In motor cortex, preparatory subspace activity may therefore sometimes evolve slowly simply because the overall movement goal is being decided slowly.</p><p>The rising strength of preparatory-subspace activity in the self-initiated context is somewhat reminiscent of the rise of choice-related activity in decision tasks. However, in the present study, the target was always fully specified; target choice did not become more certain with time. Thus, rising preparatory-subspace activity presumably reflects preparation to execute a choice that was clear from the outset (also see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Murakami et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Schurger et al., 2012</xref>)). This implies that having a clear movement goal does not necessarily mean that preparatory processes are fully engaged. Whether or not preparatory-subspace activity develops may depend on whether it is reasonably likely that movement will be initiated soon.</p><p>Our interpretation is that there exist at least three separable pre-movement processes: deciding what to do, preparing to do it, and initiating movement. It appears these processes occur with variable timing relative to one another. They occur very close in time (all within 100 ms) for the quasi-automatic context but are staggered for the self-initiated context. This interpretation is relevant to the finding that there exist pre-movement neural events that precede self-report of the decision to initiate movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Schurger et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Libet et al., 1983</xref>). In particular, preparatory-subspace activity develops hundreds of milliseconds before movement onset in the self-initiated context, presumably before a definitive choice to trigger movement has been made.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Context-dependent movement generation</title><p>It seems a near-certainty that similar movements may be preceded and accompanied by divergent neural events depending on how and why a movement is prepared and initiated. As one example, while a prepared movement can be initiated in response to a learned visualÂ cue, it can also be triggered involuntarily by the subcorticallyÂ mediatedÂ startle reflex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Valls-SolÃ© et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Carlsen et al., 2004</xref>). As another example, the three contexts studied here evoke quite different movement-epoch responses in the supplementary motor area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lara et al., 2018</xref>), despite the similarity of the movements themselves. Yet the present results reveal that motor cortex plays a more consistent role across contexts. While context impacted the timing of neural events, in the end, similar movements were driven by similar patterns of movement-related activity, preceded by similar patterns of preparatory activity.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MaterialsÂ andÂ methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Subjects and task</title><p>Subjects were two adult male macaque monkeys (<italic>Macaca mulatta</italic>) aged 10 and 14 years and weighing 11â13 Kg at the time of the experiments. Daily fluid intake was regulated to maintain motivation to perform the task for juice reward. All procedures were in accord with the US National Institutes of Health guidelines and were approved by the Columbia University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (AC-AAAQ7409).</p><p>Subjects sat in a primate chair facing an LCD display and performed reaches with their right arm while their left arm was comfortably restrained. Hand position was monitored using an infrared optical system (Polaris; Northern Digital) to track (~0.3 mm precision) a reflective bead temporarily affixed to the third and fourth digits. Each trial began when the monkey touched and held a central touch-point. Touch-point color indicated context (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). After the touch-point was held for 450â550 ms (randomized) a colored 10 mm diameter disk (the target) appeared in one of eight possible locations radially arranged around the touch point. Target distance was 130 mm for cue and self-initiated contexts and 40 mm for the quasi-automatic context (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Trials for different contexts/directions were interleaved using a block-randomized design.</p><p>In the cue-initiated context, after a variable delay period (0â1000 ms) the target suddenly grew in size to a diameter of 30 mm and the central touch point simultaneously disappeared. These events served as the go-cue, instructing the monkey to executeÂ aÂ reach. Reaches were successful if they were initiated within 500 ms of the go cue, had a durationÂ &lt;500 ms, and landed within an 18 mm radius window centered on the target. Juice was delivered if the monkey held the target, with minimal hand motion, for 200 ms (this criterion was shared across all three contexts).</p><p>In the self-initiated context, the target slowly and steadily grew in size, starting upon its appearance and ending when the reach began. Growth continued to a maximum size of 30 mm, which was achieved 1200 ms after target appearance (most reaches occurred before this time). The reward for a correct reach grew exponentially starting at 1 drop and achieved a maximum of 8 drops after 1200 ms. Monkeys were free to move as soon as the target appeared. However, monkeys essentially always waited longer in order to obtain larger rewards. Reward (and target size) ceased growing at the moment of movement onset. In rare instances where no movement was detected 1500 ms after target onset, the trial was aborted and flagged as an error. Requirements for reach duration and accuracy were as for the cue-initiated context.</p><p>In the quasi-automatic context, the target moved radially away from the central touch-point at 25 cm / s. Monkeys experienced both trials with and without a delay. In this study we consider only the latter. For these trials, motion began immediately upon target appearance. Target motion ended if a reach succeeded in bringing the hand to the target mid-flight. If the target was not intercepted then it continued moving until off the screen. Target speed and initial location (40 mm from the touch-point) were titrated, during training, such that the target was typically interceptedÂ ~130 mm from the touch-point (the same location as the targets for the other two contexts). For successful interception, reaches had to land within an elliptical acceptance window (16 mm by 20 mm radius, with the long axis aligned with target motion). If the target was successfully intercepted, it grew in size to 30 mm and reward was delivered after the hold period.</p><p>This task was challenging, but monkeys successfully completed the majority of trials (&gt;90% for every context and both monkeys). Percentages of different types of errors are given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>. As documented, monkeys rarely âjumped the gunâ before target onset, even in the quasi-automatic context. A reasonable question is whether, if a delay had been included, monkeys would have been more likely to move during the delay for the quasi-automatic context. Although quasi-automatic trials with a delay are not considered here, monkeys did experience these trials (and were very familiar with them) and did occasionally make the mistake of reaching immediately after target onset, rather than respecting the delay.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Visual display of stimuli</title><p>We used a photodetector (Thorlabs) to synchronize commands from the behavioral control software with the 60 Hz refresh schedule of the display. The photodetector monitored a white spot displayed in the corner of the screen that was masked from view by the monkey. Stimulus-display software (which ran in hard realÂ time at 1000 Hz) waited for the spot to toggle (from off to on, or on to off) before sending commands for the next frame. Those commands included a command to toggle again. In this way, it was insured that all commands sent would register on the next frame, whose timing was known. Because the go cue was a particularly critical event, we used a second photodetector and spot to confirm its timing. The command for the go cue (e.g. the first frame when the target became enlarged for the cue-initiated context, or first moved for the quasi-automatic context) was accompanied by a command to turn on the second spot, and this event was recorded along with the behavioral data. This eliminates what would otherwise be a source of trial-to-trial variability in measurements of reaction time.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Estimating movement onset</title><p>Movement onset was estimated based on hand speed: the magnitude of velocity. Optical tracking sampled hand position at 60 Hz. Because reaches contain negligible frequency contentÂ &gt;15 Hz, appropriate filtering allowed hand velocity to be accurately estimated at every millisecond. Filtering was performed online and used to compute the time of movement onset for behavioral control purposes. The time of movement onset was re-measured offline (see below) after correcting for the 16 ms delay introduced by online filtering. A separate calibration confirmed that velocity-based estimates of movement onset agreed with those obtained using a laser beam that became unbroken when the hand left the touch-point.</p><p>When estimating the time of movement onset (and thus RT) weÂ wished to balance the constraints of accurately estimating the very first moment that the hand began to physically move, while minimizing variability in that estimate due to trial-to-trial noise or idiosyncrasies. That is, we wished to minimize bias while maintaining precision. Using a low speed threshold to estimate movement onset minimizes bias; the threshold is crossed very near the time the hand begins to move. However, a low threshold can introduce unwanted variability, due both to measurement noise and to slight trial-to-trial differences in the temporal profile of the very earliest changes in hand velocity. Such variability can be problematic when aligning trials to movement onset, because velocity profiles (and thus the activity of the neurons and muscles) can become misaligned. This can lead to high-frequency features of the response being smeared or distorted. We wished to minimize such misalignment without introducing a bias by using a higher threshold.</p><p>To do so, for each trial, we estimated the moment of peak acceleration: <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf7"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>k</mml:mi><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>c</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula>.

The alternative method (estimating based on a low velocity threshold for each trial) occasionally resulted in poorly aligned velocity traces across trials, due to small differences in how hand velocity began for different trials. In rare instances a given trial had a velocity trace different from typical, such that it could not be well aligned with the other trials even using the preferred method. In such cases the trial was not analyzed.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Neural and muscle recordings</title><p>After subjects became proficient in the task, we performed sterile surgery to implant a head restraint. At the same time, we implanted a recording chamber centered over the arm area of primary motor cortex (M1) and the dorsal premotor cortex (PMd. All recordings were from the left hemisphere and the task was performed with the right arm. Chamber positioning was guided by structural magnetic resonance images taken shortly before implantation. We used intra-cortical microstimulation to confirm that our recordings were from the forelimb region of motor cortex (biphasic pulses, cathodal leading, 250ÂµS pulse width delivered at 333 Hz for a total duration of 50 ms). Microstimulation typically evoked contractions of the shoulder and upper-arm muscles, at currents from 5 Î¼A â 60 Î¼A depending on location and stimulation depth. We recorded single-neuron responses using traditional tungsten electrodes (FHC) or one or more 24-channel linear-array electrodes (V-probes; Plexon) lowered into cortex using a motorized microdrive. For tungsten-electrode recordings, spikes were sorted online using a window discriminator (Blackrock Microsystems). For linear-array recordings, spikes were sorted offline (Plexon Offline Sorter). We recorded all well-isolated task-responsive neurons; no attempt was made to screen for neuronal selectivity for reach direction or any other response property. Spikes were smoothed with a Gaussian kernel with standard deviation of 20 ms and averaged across trials to produce peri-stimulus time histograms.</p><p>We recorded electromyogram (EMG) activity using intramuscular electrodes from the following muscles: lower and upper aspects of the trapezius, medial, lateral and anterior heads of the deltoid, medial and lateral heads of the biceps, brachialis, pectoralis and latissimus dorsi. The triceps were minimally active and were not recorded. EMG signals were bandpass filtered (10â500 Hz), digitized at 1 kHz, rectified, smoothed with a Gaussian kernel with standard deviation of 20 ms, and averaged across trials to produce a continuous estimate of muscle activity intensity (very roughly analogous to a firing rate).</p><p>For analyses of latency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, and the comparison between the onset of movement-subspace activity and EMG) we used a 10 ms Gaussian kernel, rather than 20 ms.

First, the responses of each neuron were soft-normalized so that neurons with high firing rates had approximately unity firing-rate range (normalization factorÂ =Â firing rate rangeÂ +Â 5). This step ensures that subsequent dimensionality reduction (see below) captures the response of all neurons, rather than a handful of high firing-rate neurons. Second, the responses for each neuron were mean-centered at each time as follows: we calculated the mean activity across all conditions of each neuron at each time point, and subtracted this mean activity from each conditionâs response. This step ensures that dimensionality reduction focuses on dimensions where responses are selective across conditions, rather than dimensions where activity varies in a similar fashion across all conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kaufman et al., 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Identifying preparatory and movement dimensions</title><p>We employed a recently developed dimensionality reduction approach.

Results were robust with respect to the choice of dimensionality.</p><p>The optimization objective is normalized (by the singular values) to be insensitive to the relative dimensionality and amount of response variance in the two subspaces. This normalization is particularly important in the present application as movement activity is stronger and typically has higher dimensionality than the preparatory activity. Visualization required choosing two dimensions spanned by <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf34"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>W</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>p</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> and two by <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf35"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>W</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>v</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> to define the plotted projections (e.g. in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).

Visualization then employed the top two dimensions. The concatenation used to produce a unified estimate of firing rate versus time had essentially no impact on dimensionality reduction; the dimensions found are not sensitive to a discontinuity during the preparatory epoch (which was in any case very small for the cue-initiated context). What is critical is that the preparatory subspace was based entirely on data from well before movement onset, and the movement subspace was found based entirely on data after muscle activity began.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Projections and reconstructions</title><p>For a given time <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf38"><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> and for condition <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf39"><mml:mi>Î¸</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>, the projection of the population response onto the <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf40"><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>k</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>h</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:math></inline-formula> preparatory dimension is simply a weighted sum of all single-neuron responses: <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf41"><mml:msubsup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>x</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>k</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>p</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup><mml:mfenced separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>Î¸</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:munderover><mml:mo movablelimits="false">â</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>N</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:munderover><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>W</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>k</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>p</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup> <mml:mi/><mml:mi>r</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mfenced separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>Î¸</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> where <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf42"><mml:msubsup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>W</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>k</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>p</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup></mml:math></inline-formula> is the element in the <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf43"><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>h</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:math></inline-formula> row and <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf44"><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>k</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>h</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:math></inline-formula> column of <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf45"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>W</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>p</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> (see previous section) and <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf46"><mml:msub><mml:mrow> <mml:mi/><mml:mi>r</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mfenced separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>Î¸</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced></mml:math></inline-formula> is the response of the <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf47"><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>h</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msup> <mml:mi/></mml:math></inline-formula>Â neuron.

Movement subspace occupancy was defined analogously. To estimate the sampling error of the subspace occupancy we used a bootstrap procedure. We created 1000 surrogate populations by redrawing with replacement from the original population. We computed the subspace occupancy for each surrogate population. This yields, for each time, a sampling distribution of the occupancy. This sampling distribution was the basis of statistical measures. For example, the standard deviation of the sampling distribution yields the standard error of the mean, as plotted by the envelopes in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>. P-values were also computed from this sampling distribution. For example, when comparing occupancy at a particular time across contexts, occupancy can be repeatedly redrawn from the two distributions. If 95% of such comparisons yield a value larger for one context versus the other, that corresponds to p=0.05 via a one-tailed test.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Latency of physiological events</title><p>For some analyses we wished to compare timing of muscle activity with the timing of neural activity entering the movement subspace (last section of Results). For the neural data, we filtered the spike trains of all neurons using a Gaussian kernel with 10 ms standard deviation (rather than 20 ms for all other analyses of neural data). We recomputed the preparatory and movement dimensions using these data and calculated the subspace occupancy as before. We measured the latency as the first moment in time when occupancy reached 10% of peak occupancy.</p><p>Similarly, to calculate the latency of the EMG with respect to movement onset, we filtered EMG activity of all muscles using a Gaussian kernel with a 10 ms standard deviation. We then performed PCA on the EMG activity for each context separately and projected the corresponding EMG responses onto the first PC. We measured the latency as the first moment in which activity in the first PC reached 10% of peak activity. EMG was normalized prior to applying PCA, which is a critical step for ensuring that all muscles contribute to the PCs.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We thank Yanina Pavlova and Sean Perkins for technical support.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Jennifer L Raymond as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Timothy Behrens as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this letter to help you assess the concerns of the reviewers.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript takes a systematic approach to investigating the nature of the preparatory activity, which is present in motor cortex before movement. This activity has been studied most extensively during motor tasks with an experimenter-imposed delay between the instruction and the &quot;go&quot; cue, to create a period during which the movement can be planned but not executed. In the current study, neural responses in motor cortex are compared during three reaching tasks: 1) cue-initiated, 2) self-initiated, and 3) a rapid, &quot;quasi-automatic&quot; reach to intercept a moving target. The authors build on elegant analytical approaches they introduced previously to decompose activity during the conventional, cue-initiated delay task into preparatory and movement-related subspaces. They then show that the structure of neural activity in these subspaces is preserved across conditions with greater urgency (quasi-automatic) or less urgency (self-initiated), though the time-course of events is modulated.</p><p>The experiments address an important outstanding question regarding whether or not attaining a certain preparatory state in motor cortex is a pre-requisite for generating a particular movement. The reviewers liked the general concept and analytical approach, however, they felt unconvinced by the conclusion that a particular preparatory state is required for movement, given the experimental logic and the data as currently presented.surname</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The most critical problem is that the authors provide no convincing evidence that the monkeys are performing fundamentally different classes of movement, and the findings could be deemed quite trivial if one takes the view that the monkey has just been cued in different ways to generate the same movement. This is certainly true of the &quot;self-initiated&quot; condition. The very rapid condition is more interesting since in that case it has been argued that this represents a different class of movement perhaps not even relying on cortex. However, the reaction times (RTs) here are still rather long (~250 ms) relative to those found in the Perfiliev paper (~100-150ms). Thus, the reviewers were not convinced that the automatic task was eliciting automatic reaches, nor does it show &quot;an almost innate short latency&quot; consistent with Perfiliev et al., 2010, performed &quot;near a physiological limit&quot;. The reaches are just generated slightly faster on some trials, and could still depend on preparation and so no wonder the neural activity is similar. Thus, in trying to match the kinematics across conditions, the authors might have failed to induce sufficient urgency in the &quot;automatic condition&quot;. It would be easy to generate RT curves observed for the three tasks in the current study, with, say, the pre-cued situation but under different timing/task constraints. Consequently, this paper is limited to telling us that, even across a wide range of reaction times, some kind of cortical events are preserved, a new result perhaps but hardly a fundamental one, and certainly not the one claimed by the authors.</p><p>It is possible that the authors could address this issue with additional analysis. For example, it may be worthwhile to separately analyze trials in the &quot;automatic&quot; reach task with the very shortest reaction times. More generally, sorting trials within a given reach task by reaction time might provide additional evidence that the preparatory subspace is indeed capable of supporting preparation because it measures the state of preparation in a given context as revealed by the reaction time on a subset of trials.</p><p>2) Analysis of the robustness of the results to the analysis methods, and a measure of significance.</p><p>Rigor is lacking in the population analyses - the authors claim that no power analyses are known for the analyses they report. However, this is not the question that most-merits an answer. The issue is whether and how they know the reported results are significant. This requires a serious answer.</p><p>The dimensionality reduction approach and rationale are critical, but not really mentioned at all in the Results - only in the Materials and methods. Subsection âSegregating preparatory and movement responses at the population levelâ, first paragraph could easily be misconstrued as describing PCA done on separate epochs, which turned out to yield orthogonal subspaces (which was not the case). I would recommend being a little more specific here - i.e. explain that these are identified through a joint optimization process and constrained to be orthogonal to one another.</p><p>One issue which I suspect many readers will encounter is suspicion that the clean hand-off between preparatory and movement-related subspaces was an artifact of the dimensionality reduction algorithm. It would be reassuring in this regard to see that the &quot;occupancy&quot; of the null-space over time does not exhibit some systematic increase around the time of transition between preparation and initiation. If that did increase, this might suggest some interaction that is being overlooked by the dimensionality reduction. In particular, could there be some systematic activity in the self-initiated or quasi-automatic conditions that is not accounted for by activity in the cue-initiated condition?</p><p>&quot;It is equally plausible that preparation has a sudden onset that is variable relative to movement onset, resulting in a ramp in the averaged data.&quot; This is an important point that currently barely gets mentioned. There seems no mention in the Discussion, despite abundant reference throughout to &quot;ramping up&quot; or &quot;rising strength&quot; of neural activity. It does not seem infeasible to distinguish in the current data between a gradual ramping up or a more abrupt transition that occurs at a variable time.</p><p>The first paragraph of the subsection âSingle-neuron responses during the cue-initiated contextâ in the Results describes how the spike-trains taken from two distinct epochs were concatenated together, and then filtered to smooth out any discontinuity. It is unclear why this is necessary and this step is not mentioned at all in the methods. Is this stitching-together a critical pre-processing step applied to all the data prior to dimensionality reduction, or was it simply done to aid visualization? It is also unclear to what extent this stitching together of the data might have influenced the results and conclusions. I'm not too concerned that it would have, but I would expect the authors to more cautiously justify that it would not.</p><p>The authors sum up the behavior as mean peak velocity and a reaction time distribution, which is inappropriate given the key claim lies firmly within the details of this behavior. The authors also fail to discuss error trials. To me, this becomes especially notable in the context of the quasi-automatic case where this has been a parameter of great interest for the many papers that have looked at similar reflexive actions. Are the fastest reaction times in the quasi-automatic situations associated with more errors? If so, when does the animal actually start showing above chance directional performance?</p><p>[Editorsâ note: this article was subsequently rejected after discussions between the reviewers, but the authors were invited to resubmit after an appeal against the decision.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Conservation of preparatory neural events in monkey motor cortex regardless of how movement is initiated&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>The reviewers appreciated that the authors had made a serious effort to address the comments raised in the original review, and thought that the additional analyses and edits to the text had significantly improved the manuscript. Nevertheless, after discussion, the reviewers agreed that the lack of a reasonable number of sufficiently short reaction times severely limited the conclusions that could be made. The reviewers were just not convinced that the RTs for the quasi-automatic condition were fast enough to provide an interesting comparison with the cue-initiated condition.</p><p>Specific comments from the discussion among reviewers are included here, for the authors' information:</p><p>If there is such a thing as a distinct &quot;automatic&quot; movement mechanism, they may not have pushed the monkeys hard enough to engage in it. The average RTs of ~190ms are quite high compared to the 160ms in Perfiliev et al. (with still more or less perfect performance). Because the monkeys were not making any mistakes (error rate was very similar across all conditions), it is difficult to know whether they could have performed the task any faster, perhaps engaging an alternative mechanism if they did so. Had there been a clear decline in performance at very low RTs, they could have established a floor on the RT to base their low-RT analysis on and address this concern. As it is, all we can do is compare their monkey's behavior to RTs reported elsewhere in the literature.</p><p>The authors seek to get around the problem with the RTs being very different from Perfiliev by examining the latency of EMG responses. Target-specific EMG responses do seem to emerge within ~100ms, just as in Perfiliev et al., and the authors say this effect is driven by the very fastest trials. But there is a worrisome discrepancy between the EMG analysis and the RT analysis. Judging by Figure 2A, there seem to be very few trials with RTs below ~180ms. It certainly doesn't seem like enough trials to drive the early EMG effects in Figure 3, even given that EMG might precede movement by 30-50ms.</p><p>I don't think the median split on the RT is adequate. Since they are essentially claiming to be demonstrating the existence of preparatory activity during the Perfiliev effect, it is very important that they focus their analysis only on trials in which behavior is similar to that reported by Perfiliev et al., and the median split does not sufficient to ensure this. I worry that if they look at a lower percentile of RTs they won't have enough data left to establish whether or not there is preparatory activity.</p><p>The downward trend in preparatory occupancy for lower RTs is somewhat worrisome. One wonders how it might continue for even lower RTs.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>Overall, the authors have done a good job addressing the previous concerns and revising the manuscript. I believe the manuscript now provides an important and rigorous contribution to our understanding of movement generation by motor cortex.</p><p>I have just a couple of outstanding concerns:</p><p>Regarding the similarity of preparatory-subspace and movement-subspace activity across conditions: Establishing this similarity is the critical result in the paper (I don't think arguments based on occupancy alone are really sufficient to support the claim of 'preserved events'). To test whether movement-related activity is similar across contexts, the authors correlate activity across all 12 dimensions. However, to test whether planning-related activity is similar, the authors restrict their analysis only to the first two dimensions (i.e. the two with the greatest variance). The justification for this disparity feels a bit loose (that, for the preparatory subspace, the variance in the third dimension is only 14% that of the first dimension, while the variance is more evenly distributed across dimensions for the movement subspace). Why have a cut-off for the preparatory subspace, but no cut-off for the movement subspace? Given that the analysis in Figure 10 is based on covariance, shouldn't this naturally downweight dimensions in which there is not much variance? Are the results qualitatively similar if covariance is summed across all dimensions in this analysis?</p><p>Examining only short-RT trials in the quasi-automatic condition is important to support the central claim of the paper. However, the authors only extended this line of reasoning as far as the 'occupancy' analysis. Does the more fine-grained comparison of activity across contexts (i.e. Figs 9-10) hold when examining only short-RT quasi-automatic trials?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>In this revision the authors provide new analyses and significant revisions. The revisions improve the manuscript but do not really address the central underlying concern. The authors say we should not necessarily expect time-consuming preparation-like events to take place in an automatic task, but the events still take place. The problem is they don't state how long, or short, the time taken is that should be surprising, and they don't show that the automatic task offers an opportunity to perform the necessary test. We are still left with the concern that &quot;the authors might have failed to induce sufficient urgency&quot; in the automatic task which renders the results unsurprising.</p><p>The problem is that the automatic movements are generated with only slightly shorter RTs and not as quickly as the motivating study they cite. There is substantial overlap between the RTs associated with a delayed reach and an automatic reach. Despite the new data analysis, the revision does not assuage the original concern. In particular, the authors did not perform the analysis suggested, or they did not see a difference when they did. As a result, we still do not have a sense for how long RTs in the automatic task differ from short RTs in the delayed task, nor how the short RTs in the automatic task are particularly automatic. For those analyses provided, the results are not consistent with the expectation that the automatic reaches are indeed automatic. Instead the authors emphasize how the reach kinematics are the same for the two tasks, with almost no changes in endpoint accuracy, or evidence that the animals emit fast automatic reaches that then shift toward the target. This is claimed to be desirable because they want to control for the influence of kinematics on neural activity. However, this is a red-herring. The authors can subsample movements from the two different classes to have similar kinematics. What remains at issue from the first round of review is whether the movement categories differ in the first place.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31826.030</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editorsâ note: the author responses to the first round of peer review follow.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The most critical problem is that the authors provide no convincing evidence that the monkeys are performing fundamentally different classes of movement, and the findings could be deemed quite trivial if one takes the view that the monkey has just been cued in different ways to generate the same movement.

The reviewers raise the concern that the âvery rapid conditionâ (the quasi-automatic context) might not be that rapid compared with the original Perfiliev study. The reviewers suggest that this concern could be addressed with an additional analysis: separately analyzing trials with particularly short RTs. We understand the nature of these concerns and have made multiple changes to address them. Most importantly this includes performing the requested analysis, and adding a new analysis showing that EMG response latencies in our study are in fact nearly identical to those in Perfiliev. We have also heavily revised aspects of the paper including the Introduction. We agree that these additions were needed and are glad that the reviewers motivated us to make them. These additions and changes are enumerated below.</p><p>i) We have performed the requested analysis. The motivation for that request is as follows: if our response latencies are on average longer than in Perfiliev, then that shortcoming could be mitigated if we down-selected our data to approximate Perfilievâs range of latencies. As will be addressed below, our response latencies, based on EMG, are in fact comparable to those in Perfiliev (this just wasnât clear in the original manuscript). That said, we still very much like the suggested analysis: it provides an additional test of the hypothesis that a preparatory stage occurs even for particularly short-latency movements. The results of this new analysis are shown in the new Figure 8 and are clear: the preparatory subspace is occupied for both short-RT trials and long-RT trials. In fact, in both cases, peak preparatory subspace occupancy was actually slightly higher for the quasi-automatic context relative to the cue-initiated context. This is important because it had historically been controversial whether delay-period-like events occurred during zero-delay trials, even of the ânormalâ sort. The new analysis showi.e.i.e.s that not only do they occur in the absence of a delay, they do so even for a context that evokes low-latency responses, and even when analyzing particularly low-latency trials. Text describing this new analysis begins in the subsection âThe preparatory subspace is occupied for short-RT quasi-automatic trialsâ.)</p><p>ii) We have added a new figure documenting that the quasi-automatic context produces EMG response latencies nearly identical to those in Perfiliev et al. The new Figure 3 includes examples of raw EMG on individual trials, and an analysis of average EMG with minimal filtering (both requested by the reviewers). This new analysis demonstrates that, when making an apples-to-apples comparison between our responses and those of Perfiliev, the latency of muscle activity is virtually identical. Perfiliev et al. reported that âthe earliest onset of electromyographic activityâ¦ ranged from 90 to 110 msâ. Thus, in their study, the trials with the shortest latencies exhibited EMG that began changing 90-110 ms (depending on the subject) following the onset of target motion. Our findings replicate theirs almost perfectly: the earliest onset of EMG occurred ~100 ms after target onset. We apologize that this was not documented before, and are glad to have been motivated to make this important addition.</p><p>iii) The Introduction, and sections of the Results, have been revised to highlight a key reason why we employed the self-initiated context: it distinguishes between the competing hypotheses that delay period activity is preparatory versus suppressive. These hypotheses produce opposing predictions in the self-initiated context. Given the existing controversy on this topic (see below), the self-initiated context provides a very useful test. We apologize that this was not better explained in the original submission.</p><p>iv) The Introduction has been heavily written to convey why, given the literature, it was controversial whether delay-period-like activity would appear without a delay. The reviewers note that it was unclear from the original manuscript how surprised a reader should be that putatively preparatory activity (i.e., activity in the same subspace and with the same structure as delay-period activity) reappears in other contexts. We understand the nature of this concern. If you accept that delay period activity is preparatory, then that predicts that similar activity will likely reappear if there is time to prepare. Yet critically, that prediction is premised on a specific hypothesis: that delay period activity is fundamentally preparatory and consistently occurs, in a similar way, before movements made under very different amounts of time pressure. That hypothesis has been controversial for a variety of reasons. The Introduction has been restructured to convey these points.</p><p>v) The Introduction has been rewritten to highlight that the quasi-automatic context is intrinsically a zero-delay condition, and that the existing literature has yielded ambiguous results regarding whether putatively preparatory activity appears for zero-delay trials. In our original submission, we failed to adequately stress that multiple prior studies (including the recent influential Ames et al., 2014 study) have yielded ambiguous results regarding whether delay-period events reappear during zero-delay conditions (even ânormalâ zero-delay trials without moving targets).The Introduction now contains the following passage: âWe also compared neural activity with and without a delay, but employed a different analysis approach and compared neural activity across a broader range of behavioral âcontextsâ... To examine preparation without a delay, we did not simply reduce the cue-initiated delay to zero (as in Crammond and Kalaska, 2000; Churchland et al., 2006; Ames, Ryu and Shenoy, 2014), but instead adopted the paradigm of Perfiliev et al., 2010 and used moving targets... This âquasi-automaticâ context provides a particularly stringent test of the prediction that delay-period-like activity will reappear in the absence of a delay.â This new text highlights that we are revisiting the âclassicâ comparison between trials with and without a delay, with the additional benefit of using zero-delay trials with very short RTs. This provides a particularly stern test of whether preparation occurs.</p><p>vi) We have made a small correction to our velocity-based RT measurements, allowing for a more appropriate comparison with prior literature. Although EMG-based response latencies in our study were nearly identical to those in Perfiliev et al., we observed a slightly longer delay between EMG onset and detectible changes in hand velocity. Thus, as the reviewers noted, our velocity-based RTs are slightly longer than theirs. This may relate to the fact that reaches had to break the friction of the screen in our task (mechanical factors are known to impact the time from EMG onset to movement onset; e.g., Anson et al., 1982, J Mot. Beh.). However, 16 ms of discrepancy occurs for a trivial reason that we should have corrected for.Perfiliev et al. used a 500 Hz optical tracking system to identify the onset of hand velocity. We used a 60 Hz tracker, and online filtering converted the resulting âstaircaseâ into a 1000 Hz stream used for behavioral control. Because hand movement has negligible frequency content above 15 Hz, filtering produces an essentially perfect estimate of hand position at each millisecond. However, that estimate follows the âtrailingâ edge of the staircase rather than the leading edge; i.e. it occurs exactly 16 ms late relative to what would be measured by a 1000 Hz tracking system.We should have corrected for this lag in our original calculations and have now done so. The correction doesnât change comparisons internal to the study (the RT difference between cue-initiated and quasi-automatic contexts remains identical) but corrects a small bias and thus improves the ability to compare with other studies including the important Perfiliev study. We have also now performed a calibration procedure using a laser beam and a photodetector. This verified the accuracy of the velocity-based RT measurements. These details, along with other procedures to ensure accurate RT measurements are now described in the Results (subsection âReaction times (RTs)â). The new Figure 3 shows examples of when movement was detected, on top of single-trial velocity and EMG traces.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Analysis of the robustness of the results to the analysis methods, and a measure of significance.</p></disp-quote><p>We understand and agree with these criticisms, and have made multiple additions to address them.

In other cases, p-values and/or 95% confidence intervals are given in the text. For example, in multiple cases we use correlation to compare events within across contexts. The text gives 95% confidence intervals and/or p-values for these comparisons.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The dimensionality reduction approach and rationale are critical, but not really mentioned at all in the Results - only in the Materials and methods.

We had previously avoided this line of inquiry for two reasons. First, although important, it was somewhat separate from the main questions of our study. Second, we didnât think we would be able to address this topic without very large-scale simultaneous recordings. However, motivated by the reviewers, we realized there was a simple analysis that we could perform. This analysis addresses whether activity is a ramp of variable slope, or instead follows a stereotyped temporal profile beginning a variable time after target onset. The new analysis does not attempt to resolve the exact profile of preparatory activity on single trials, but nevertheless yields some compelling results. We are glad to have been motivated to add it. This new analysis is described in the Results:</p><p>âRising preparatory-subspace occupancy in the self-initiated context could reflect steady ramping on individual trials (with short RTs associated with a steeper ramp) or a more sudden onset at a variable time.

This is summarized at the top of the review:</p><p>âthe lack of a reasonable number of sufficiently short reaction times severely limited the conclusions that could be made.â</p><p>This claim is incorrect. Our responses are not longer-latency than in Perfiliev. If anything, our responses are slightly shorter latency.</p><p>We believed the low-latency of responses would be adequately conveyed by Figure 3, which showed that trial-averaged EMG begins changing ~100 ms after target onset, consistent with the 90-110 ms earliest onset of EMG in Perfiliev. That point was further illustrated via example trials with latencies of 100-150 ms (the average in Perfiliev was 144 ms). However, Figure 3 received the following criticisms:</p><p>i) Perhaps only a small handful of our trials have early EMG onset latencies. If so, plots of average EMG could be misleading.</p><p>ii) Perhaps the example trials we chose are unusually fast and un-representative.</p><p>In fact, both average EMG plots and the examples are quite representative. We have added new figures (Figure 4 and Figure 4âfigure supplements 1 and 2) to reinforce this. These figures document EMG latencies on single trials. This is done for muscles with low baseline activity, such that the onset of EMG can be detected on single trials. These figures clarify that EMG latencies are as at least as short as in Perfiliev.</p><p>In addition to adding these figures to the manuscript, we also include below tables and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>.

See below.</p><p>Is there a discrepancy between our EMG latencies and hand-velocity-based latencies?</p><p>The review notes that âJudging by Figure 2A, there seem to be very few trials with RTs below ~180 msâ which âdoesn't seem like enough trials to drive the early EMG effects in Figure 3, even given that EMG might precede movement by 30-50ms.â As stated in the text, RTs for our two monkeys were 205 Â± 32 ms and 192 ms Â± 27 ms (mean and SD after pooling across all sessions). Given these SDs, one expects RTs &lt; 180 ms and this was indeed the case: 21% (Ba) and 36% of trials had RTs &lt; 180 ms. Furthermore, 12% and 21% had RTs &lt; 170 ms. EMG onset precedes movement onset by 40-80 ms (depending on the muscle and monkey, see below) not â30-50 msâ. Thus, EMG latencies as early as 90-110 ms are entirely expected.</p><p>Thus, the numbers are correct. However, the reviewers were correct in noting something slightly wrong with the corresponding figure: all traces were shifted a few pixels to the right and are thus not centered on the numbers given in the text. This was a small error, but of course hurt the point we were trying to make. We are not sure how this mistake occurred. The figure generated by matlab was/is correct. But at some point, presumably while panels were assembled in Illustrator, a mistake was introduced. This has been rectified. We have also had both the senior author and one of the middle authors re-compute mean RTs. All measurements agree within one millisecond.</p><p>Is there a discrepancy between our hand-velocity-based latencies and those of Perfiliev?</p><p>The EMG-to-velocity lag in our task fully explains why our velocity-based RTs are slightly longer than in Perfiliev, even though our EMG latencies tended to be slightly <italic>shorter</italic>. We observed lags of ~40-80 ms, depending on the muscle and monkey. These lags are an expected consequence of both physiology and our task geometry: the hand rests on a screen whose considerable friction helps the monkey to keep his hand stationary. It is difficult for hand velocity to build until the hand is lifted slightly off the screen. Had our screen been pressure sensitive, we would presumably have found slightly shorter physical latencies.</p><p>Given the empirical 40-80 ms lags, our velocity-based RTs <italic>should</italic> be at the long end of the range in Perfiliev. The magnitude of this effect is exactly as expected, and is not as large as stated in the review. In the review, velocity-based RTs from Perfiliev are described (at different points) as being â100-150 msâ and â160 msâ. The 100-150 range is incorrect. 160 ms is a better estimate, but still doesnât give credit to the considerable subject-to-subject variability in Perfiliev:</p><p>Average velocity-based RTs, Perfiliev</p><p><table-wrap id="inlinetable15" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><td valign="top"><italic>*Monkeys*</italic> </td><td valign="top">120-200 ms Range is across subjects.

(Reviewer 2 also makes helpful requests for extensions to analyses, which we have performed).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Specific comments from the discussion among reviewers are included here, for the authors' information:</p><p>If there is such a thing as a distinct &quot;automatic&quot; movement mechanism, they may not have pushed the monkeys hard enough to engage in it. The average RTs of ~190ms are quite high compared to the 160ms in Perfiliev et al. (with still more or less perfect performance). Because the monkeys were not making any mistakes (error rate was very similar across all conditions), it is difficult to know whether they could have performed the task any faster, perhaps engaging an alternative mechanism if they did so. Had there been a clear decline in performance at very low RTs, they could have established a floor on the RT to base their low-RT analysis on and address this concern. As it is, all we can do is compare their monkey's behavior to RTs reported elsewhere in the literature.</p></disp-quote><p>This concern is largely addressed by the documentation above, showing that our EMG latencies are at least as fast as in Perfiliev, and that our velocity-based RTs are only slightly different (and for an expected reason).</p><p>Monkeys do miss the target more than twice as often for the quasi-automatic context versus the cue-initiated context, as stated in the text. Another failure mode is revealed for a trial-type not analyzed in the present study: quasi-automatic trials with a delay. Although very practiced at these, monkeys still had an increased tendency to reach immediately following target onset and fail the trial. This is now stated in the Materials and methods:</p><p>âAs documented, monkeys rarely âjumped the gunâ before target onset, even in the quasi-automatic context. [â¦] Although quasi-automatic trials with a delay are not considered here, monkeys did experience these trials (and were very familiar with them) and did indeed often make the mistake of reaching immediately after target onset, rather than respecting the delay.â</p><p>We do not believe or argue that there is a distinct automatic movement mechanism. Nowhere in our manuscript do we suggest this â indeed we caution against it.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors seek to get around the problem with the RTs being very different from Perfiliev by examining the latency of EMG responses. Target-specific EMG responses do seem to emerge within ~100ms, just as in Perfiliev et al., and the authors say this effect is driven by the very fastest trials. But there is a worrisome discrepancy between the EMG analysis and the RT analysis. Judging by Figure 2A, there seem to be very few trials with RTs below ~180ms. It certainly doesn't seem like enough trials to drive the early EMG effects in Figure 3, even given that EMG might precede movement by 30-50ms.</p></disp-quote><p>This is addressed by the rebuttal above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I don't think the median split on the RT is adequate. Since they are essentially claiming to be demonstrating the existence of preparatory activity during the Perfiliev effect, it is very important that they focus their analysis only on trials in which behavior is similar to that reported by Perfiliev et al., and the median split does not sufficient to ensure this. I worry that if they look at a lower percentile of RTs they won't have enough data left to establish whether or not there is preparatory activity.</p></disp-quote><p>The extensive documentation above demonstrates that the median split is more than adequate. Even without the split, our latencies are already slightly faster on average than in Perfiliev. After the median split, our latencies are quite a bit faster (see the third table under heading âMean EMG latenciesâ above).</p><p>Further restricting analysis would result in only a small (~10 ms, see above) further shortening of mean latency. And as the review notes, there would then be too few trials to analyze. For example, if we were to analyze only the fastest quartile, some neurons would contribute only 1-2 trials per condition. This would mean that we would be essentially performing a single-trial analysis, which our method is not meant to handle (it lacks an appropriate noise model). Even the median-split was a bit of a stretch (we could count on only &gt;= 3 trials per condition). Empirically it worked well and yielded results that were not dominated by noise. Yet we would not wish to push this further (and essentially nothing would be gained by trying to do so).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The downward trend in preparatory occupancy for lower RTs is somewhat worrisome. One wonders how it might continue for even lower RTs.</p></disp-quote><p>As noted above, RTs really canât get much lower. Trials faster than the median are already very fast and further down-selection would have minimal further effect.</p><p>More critically, there isnât really a âdownward trendâ. The critical question of our study is whether events that occur during an imposed delay also occur in the absence of that delay. This was indeed the case: preparatory-subspace occupancy was always <italic>at least as high</italic> for quasi-automatic trials (with no delay) as for the corresponding cue-initiated trials (with a delay). We have simplified Figure 9 to better highlight this central finding. Importantly, yellow traces (quasi-automatic context) <italic>always peak higher</italic> than red traces (cue-initiated context). Thus, there is no evidence that delay-period-like events are absent or reduced in the quasi-automatic context â if anything they are slightly stronger.</p><p>A <italic>separate</italic> effect is that peak preparatory-subspace occupancy is slightly higher for long-RT trials, and slightly lower for short-RT trials. This goes against the common (but incorrect) notion that higher firing rates should be associated with more rapid responses. Indeed, these lower peaks are expected: the event that prompts movement onset creates a rise in occupancy. Occupancy is then truncated just before movement onset. Later onsets thus give more time for the rise to occur before it is truncated. This effect can be observed in the new Figure 10âfigure supplement 2, where the pattern of states for short-RT trials expands in the same way as for all trials, but then start to contract earlier. However, we stress that this is a small effect â it seems sizeable in Figure 9 only because occupancy is a squared measure. This is now better highlighted in the text:</p><p>âWe also observed that, across all comparisons, long-RT trials tended to have slightly higher preparatory-subspace peaks compared to short-RT trials. [â¦] Subsequent state-space analyses show this effect more directly, and also reveal that it is very modest (it is magnified when considering occupancy, which quantifies variance).â</p><p>We have also added Figure 11âfigure supplement 1. This figure confirms that, for short-RT trials, the neural states in the preparatory subspace achieve a similar arrangement across contexts. Data are slightly noisier after the down-selection, but there is certainly no lack of preparatory subspace activity for short-RT trials.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>Overall, the authors have done a good job addressing the previous concerns and revising the manuscript. I believe the manuscript now provides an important and rigorous contribution to our understanding of movement generation by motor cortex.</p><p>I have just a couple of outstanding concerns:</p><p>Regarding the similarity of preparatory-subspace and movement-subspace activity across conditions: Establishing this similarity is the critical result in the paper (I don't think arguments based on occupancy alone are really sufficient to support the claim of 'preserved events'). To test whether movement-related activity is similar across contexts, the authors correlate activity across all 12 dimensions. However, to test whether planning-related activity is similar, the authors restrict their analysis only to the first two dimensions (i.e. the two with the greatest variance). The justification for this disparity feels a bit loose (that, for the preparatory subspace, the variance in the third dimension is only 14% that of the first dimension, while the variance is more evenly distributed across dimensions for the movement subspace). Why have a cut-off for the preparatory subspace, but no cut-off for the movement subspace? Given that the analysis in Figure 10 is based on covariance, shouldn't this naturally downweight dimensions in which there is not much variance? Are the results qualitatively similar if covariance is summed across all dimensions in this analysis?</p></disp-quote><p>We have extended the correlation-based analysis of preparatory states to all 12 dimensions. These results support our original conclusions. We originally avoided using all dimensions because, past the first two, they mostly contribute noise. This choice also allowed quantification to link directly to the 2D plots. However, we agree that it seems odd to use a cutoff for the preparatory subspace but not the movement subspace. The reviewer is also correct that covariance/correlation-based analyses naturally down-weight low-variance dimensions. Results for 12 dimensions are thus very similar to results for 2 dimensions:</p><p>correlations are slightly reduced due to added noise but are still high (r = 0.73-0.95). This is now described:</p><p>âResults were similar if we considered all twelve preparatory dimensions. Although higher dimensions primarily captured noise, their inclusion reduced the correlation only moderately given that they contributed little variance. [â¦] Correlations were intermediate (0.77-0.98) when measured in six dimensions.â</p><p>The covariance-based analysis in Figure 11C, D (which had been Figure 10C, D) was always based on all 12 dimensions (though as the reviewer anticipated, the number of dimensions analyzed makes essentially no difference to this analysis â results are virtually identical either way). The fact that we used 12 dimensions was admittedly not at all clear from the manuscript. It is now stated in the figure legend.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Examining only short-RT trials in the quasi-automatic condition is important to support the central claim of the paper. However, the authors only extended this line of reasoning as far as the 'occupancy' analysis. Does the more fine-grained comparison of activity across contexts (i.e. Figs 9-10) hold when examining only short-RT quasi-automatic trials?</p></disp-quote><p>[Note that Figures 9 and 10 are now Figures 10 and 11]</p><p>These results do indeed hold when examining for the short-RT quasi-automatic trials.

The revisions improve the manuscript but do not really address the central underlying concern. The authors say we should not necessarily expect time-consuming preparation-like events to take place in an automatic task, but the events still take place. The problem is they don't state how long, or short, the time taken is that should be surprising, and they don't show that the automatic task offers an opportunity to perform the necessary test. We are still left with the concern that &quot;the authors might have failed to induce sufficient urgency&quot; in the automatic task which renders the results unsurprising.</p></disp-quote><p>The premise of this concern is that the presence of delay-period-like events without a delay is interesting (âsurprisingâ) <italic>only</italic> if latencies are shorter than some difficult-to-determine threshold. It is indeed true that the presence of delay-period-like events is particularly compelling when responses are short latency. The documentation above underscores that we have achieved very short latencies. However, we would still like to largely disagree with the premise. Our study is not just (or even primarily) about examining the neural basis of âthe Perfiliev effectâ. As described in the Abstract and Introduction, our study is about testing the hypothesis that the events that occur during a delay deserve to be called preparatory. A critical test of that hypothesis is whether delay period-like events appear in the absence of a delay. This has been controversial, and recent studies (e.g., Ames et al.) have been taken as evidence that delay-period events are not a ânormalâ part of the sequence of movement generation. We are frequently asked at meetings (including as recently as a few weeks ago) whether we believe that delay-period activity would ânaturallyâ be seen without a delay, or whether it results from the artificial situation of an experimenter-imposed delay. This is a fundamental question, and multiple studies (Ames et al., Crammond and Kalaska, our own prior work) have tried to address it by comparing long-delay trials with plain-old garden-variety zero-delay trials.</p><p>In the present study we are in a better position to address this fundamental question because we are able to segregate putatively preparatory and movement-related events via subspace. In leveraging this new ability, it would have been quite acceptable (as in prior studies) to simply compare long-delay trials with zero-delay trials (i.e., to use only the cue-initiated context). That said, we certainly agree that the quasi-automatic context provides a particularly stringent test of whether delay-period-like events occur without a delay, and we used it for that reason. We have revised the text to further highlight this motivation:</p><p>âThe low latency of the quasi-automatic reaches aids interpretation when asking whether delay-period-like events occur without a delay.

Our latencies are at least as fast as in Perfiliev.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There is substantial overlap between the RTs associated with a delayed reach and an automatic reach.</p></disp-quote><p>We do not agree that this is a problem â indeed it would be concerning if there werenât some overlap. For cue-initiated trials, the monkey benefits from a delay and can prepare in advance. If RTs for the cue-initiated context had a mean RT so long that it eliminated overlap, that would imply that the monkeys are likely not taking advantage of the delay and are not preparing in advance. We are thus pleased that RTs in the cue-initiated context are relatively brisk. This is stated in the text:</p><p>âCue-initiated RTs were 253 Â± 50 ms and 235 Â± 37 ms (mean Â± s.d.) for monkey Ba and Ax (Figure 2A, B,red traces). These RTs are on the brisk side of the range in prior studies, consistent with the goal of the cue-initiated context: to encourage monkeys to prepare during the delay and reach promptly after the go cue.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Despite the new data analysis, the revision does not assuage the original concern. In particular, the authors did not perform the analysis suggested, or they did not see a difference when they did.</p></disp-quote><p>We performed the analysis exactly as outlined in the âaction planâ submitted for approval. The median split is more than sufficient: mean EMG onset latencies for short-RT trials are noticeably faster than the mean Perfiliev latency (see âMean EMG latenciesâ section above). Further splitting the data into smaller and smaller groups would yield diminishing returns (e.g., only an ~10 ms speedup if we restricted to the fastest quartile). Furthermore, we would then be left with so little data (1-2 trials per condition for some neurons) that we would not trust the results. We would be close to performing a single-trial analysis. We 100% stand by our decision to use the median split, and to not attempt analyses that would yield little additional value and would likely become difficult to interpret. It is certainly <italic>not</italic> the case that we performed a highly restricted analysis but failed to report results we did not like.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>As a result, we still do not have a sense for how long RTs in the automatic task differ from short RTs in the delayed task, nor how the short RTs in the automatic task are particularly automatic. For those analyses provided, the results are not consistent with the expectation that the automatic reaches are indeed automatic. Instead the authors emphasize how the reach kinematics are the same for the two tasks, with almost no changes in endpoint accuracy, or evidence that the animals emit fast automatic reaches that then shift toward the target. This is claimed to be desirable because they want to control for the influence of kinematics on neural activity. However, this is a red-herring. The authors can subsample movements from the two different classes to have similar kinematics. What remains at issue from the first round of review is whether the movement categories differ in the first place.</p></disp-quote><p>Our motivations for using the quasi-automatic context are not based on any presumption of different categories of movement. The Abstract and Introduction explain our motivations (also see above) and make no reference to different categories. Indeed, we work to dispel the idea that we believe the different contexts are fundamentally different categories. The original submission contained the following:</p><p>âHowever, we stress that this term should not be taken to imply that quasi-automatic reaches are necessarily a different class of movement at the level of motor cortex.â</p><p>The revised submission contained the following:</p><p>âThis allows us to revisit the traditional comparison between trials with a long delay versus no delay (Crammond and Kalaska, 2000; Churchland et al., 2006; Ames, Ryu and Shenoy, 2014). The quasi-automatic context provides a stringent version of this comparison; the moving target evokes low-latency responses (see below) raising the question of whether preparation is even possible. The term âquasi-automaticâ should not be taken to imply a different class of movement at the neural level. It is possible that quasi-automatic reaches involve a dedicated mechanism for rapid initiation. Yet quasi-automatic reaches could also represent an extreme version of âzero-delayâ trials, with high time-pressure and a particularly effective go cue. In either case, a key question is whether movement onset is preceded by putatively preparatory events.â</p><p>We have further revised the text:</p><p>âThe low latency of the quasi-automatic reaches aids interpretation when asking whether delay-period-like events occur without a delay. This question has traditionally been addressed by including zero-delay trials that are otherwise identical to long-delay trials<sup>6,11,22</sup>. While valid, that approach raises a potential concern: might monkeys, once accustomed to a delay, start to treat zero-delay trials as if they have a delay? For example, monkeys might increase their RT to accommodate the expectation of a delay, and might begin to generate delay-period-like neural events that would otherwise not occur. The low-latency of quasi-automatic trials addresses such concerns. Monkeys cannot be âaddingâ their own delay, otherwise RTs would be longer rather than shorter than for the cue-initiated context. Indeed, quasi-automatic responses are sufficiently swift that it becomes reasonable to question whether preparation is possible<sup>20,23</sup>, given that preparation is usually proposed to be time-consuming.[â¦] That said, we do not propose that the quasi-automatic trials represent a different âclassâ of movement. Rather, we use the quasi-automatic context as a stringent test of the hypothesis that delay-period events are preparatory and will thus typically occur â if only briefly â even in the absence of a delay.â</p></body></sub-article></article>
