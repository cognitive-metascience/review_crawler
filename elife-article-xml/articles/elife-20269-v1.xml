The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is thought to mediate reward anticipation. However, the precise role of the PFC in mediating reward responses to highly palatable foods (HPF) after REM sleep deprivation is unclear. We selectively reduced REM sleep in mice over a 25–48 hr period and chemogenetically inhibited the medial PFC (mPFC) by using an altered glutamate-gated and ivermectin-gated chloride channel that facilitated neuronal inhibition through hyperpolarizing infected neurons. HPF consumption was measured while the mPFC was inactivated and REM sleep loss was induced. We found that REM sleep loss increased HPF consumption compared to control animals. However, mPFC inactivation reversed the effect of REM sleep loss on sucrose consumption without affecting fat consumption. Our findings provide, for the first time, a causal link between REM sleep, mPFC function and HPF consumption.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.20269.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.20269.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>REM sleep</kwd><kwd>appetite</kwd><kwd>reward anticipation</kwd><kwd>paradoxical sleep</kwd><kwd>prefrontal cortex</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P14762</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>McEown</surname><given-names>Kristopher</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2604762</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lazarus</surname><given-names>Michael</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001700</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>16H01629</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lazarus</surname><given-names>Michael</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002241</institution-id><institution>Japan Science and Technology Agency</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>16814578</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lazarus</surname><given-names>Michael</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Loss of REM sleep increases sucrose and fat consumption in mice; and inhibiting the prefrontal cortex reverses the increased consumption of sucrose, but not fat, following REM sleep loss.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>A strong link exists between insufficient sleep and weight gain. A study of more than 30,000 participants found that those who slept less than 6 hr per night were more likely to gain weight over a 1-year period compared to people who slept 7 to 8 hr per night (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Watanabe et al., 2010</xref>). Moreover, when healthy adults obtain insufficient sleep (i.e., 5 hr per night) they are more likely to consume weight-promoting foods compared to persons who obtain sufficient sleep (i.e., 9 hr per night; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Markwald et al., 2013</xref>). Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep loss itself may be sufficient to increase consumption of weight promoting, highly palatable foods (HPF). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Shechter et al. (2012)</xref> found that REM sleep loss in humans, over a period of 5 d, was inversely associated with hunger ratings and fat consumption. Indeed, increased intake of weight promoting, highly palatable foods may, over time, lead to adverse health outcomes such as obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular diseases.</p><p>Several studies have attempted to uncover the underlying neural mechanisms responsible for mediating an increased desire to consume HPF in response to sleep deprivation. Healthy adults who were subjected to one night of total sleep loss reported an increased desire to consume high-calorie foods compared to non-sleep deprived controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Greer et al., 2013</xref>). In addition, sleep deprivation decreased activation, assessed by fMRI scans, in areas of the brain thought to mediate reward anticipation and inhibitory control, namely the anterior cingulate and orbitofrontal cortex, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Greer et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Liu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Stuss, 2011</xref>). However, the relationship between brain function and sleep loss are not consistent. For example, presentation of HPF to sleep deprived healthy adults was not associated with anterior cingulate activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">St. Onge et al., 2014</xref>) while in other instances a positive association was found between appetite for HPF and anterior cingulate function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Benedict et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Therefore, the current investigation sought to determine the role of the medial prefrontal cortex (medial PFC, mPFC) in mediating appetite for highly palatable foods in mice experiencing REM sleep loss. To achieve this aim, we used a well-validated chemogenetic method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Lerchner et al., 2007</xref>) to produce a modified invertebrate chloride channel (GluClαβ) that when activated by the drug ivermectin (IVM) facilitates neuronal inhibition in the mPFC over several days. We then examined the effect of mPFC inactivation and REM sleep loss on appetite for HPF in mice.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Wire-mesh-grid device exposure produced REM sleep loss</title><p>During the dark period, mice exposed to a wire-mesh-grid device (WMGD) in their housing cage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) over a 72-hr period showed significantly less REM sleep after device introduction compared to baseline polygraphic recordings obtained without the device (F<sub>3,6</sub> = 23.835, p = 0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">McEown et al., 2016</xref>).

We found that REM sleep loss increased fat consumption by 26% compared to non-sleep deprived saline injected controls (p = 0.001) and 35% compared to non-sleep deprived propylene glycol injected controls (p = 0.000). However, mPFC inhibition paired with REM sleep loss did not affect fat consumption compared to sleep deprived controls (p = 0.199).</p><p>Baseline and follow-up weights of mice in the non-sleep deprived saline injected, non-sleep deprived propylene glycol injected, REM sleep reduced and mPFC inactivated groups were non-significant (Baseline: F<sub>3,16</sub> = 0.414, p = 0.745; Follow-up: F<sub>3,16</sub> = 0.538, p = 0.663). In addition, body weight did not significantly change between baseline and follow-up time points for the non-sleep deprived saline injected mice (t<sub>8</sub> = 0.468, p = 0.652), non-sleep deprived propylene glycol injected mice (t<sub>2</sub> = 0.756, p = 0.529), REM sleep reduced (t<sub>3</sub> = 0.157, p = 0.885) or PFC inactivated groups (t<sub>3</sub> = 0.001, p = 0.999). Finally, the amounts of sucrose (r = −0.175, p = 0.400) and fat (r = 0.246, p =0.240) consumed were not associated with baseline body weight (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>, Panel B).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We were successfully able to mitigate the increased consumption of sucrose that resulted from REM sleep loss. We achieved this aim by chemogenetically inhibiting mPFC function. These results are the first to demonstrate a clear, causative link between mPFC function, REM sleep and HPF consumption. Specifically, REM sleep loss increased consumption of two highly palatable foods, namely sucrose and fat. Whereas, mPFC inhibition completely reversed increased sucrose intake by attenuating the effect of REM sleep loss on sucrose consumption. On the other hand, mPFC inhibition did not attenuate the effect of REM sleep loss on fat consumption.</p><p>The PFC appears to play a role in mediating goal directed behavior toward highly appetitive food stimuli. Brain circuits responsible for judging the palatability of foods such as taste, texture and smell are mediated by areas of the PFC including the orbitofrontal and anterior cingulate cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Rolls, 2015</xref>). More specifically, the anterior cingulate appears to mediate taste for glucose in primates as feeding fruit juice (i.e., a high-glucose food) to satiety decreased neuronal firing in the anterior cingulate cortex using single cell recordings, whereas initial juice feeding increased neuronal firing in these animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Rolls, 2008</xref>). Chocolate flavor also increases activation, as measured by fMRI, in the anterior cingulate cortex in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Rolls and McCabe, 2007</xref>). In addition, obese patients display increased PFC activity in response to high-calorie visual food stimuli; specifically, increased activity in the orbitofrontal and anterior cingulate cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Stoeckel et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Rothemund et al., 2007</xref>). Alterations in PFC brain activity may, over time, result in the inability of these persons to inhibit salient food cues leading to excess high calorie food consumption and weight gain. Our results support these data by directly manipulating mPFC function in mice, which resulted in a substantial decrease in sucrose consumption, but had no effect on fat consumption. On the other hand, it is unknown whether consumption of other highly palatable foods may be effected by mPFC inactivation and/or REM disruption (e.g., foods high in salt content). Future research is needed to explore this possibility. The mPFC contains heterogeneous neurons that include some inhibitory GABAergic interneurons (approximately 20%) and excitatory pyramidal neurons (approximately 80%; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Riga et al., 2014</xref>). Moreover, mPFC neurons expressing dopamine D1 receptors mediate food consumption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Land et al., 2014</xref>); however, it is currently unknown what role this neuronal subtype may play in controlling highly palatable food consumption in response to REM sleep disruption.</p><p>Furthermore, in humans REM sleep loss adversely affects dietary behavior which may lead to weight gain. For example, REM sleep loss in humans enhances the desire to consume food and increases food consumption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Gonnissen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Shechter et al., 2012</xref>). In addition, REM sleep loss in children and adolescents, of 1 hr per night measured over three nights, was associated with a marked increase in the likelihood of these children being overweight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Liu et al., 2008</xref>). In agreement with these findings, we observed that reducing REM sleep, over a 25–48 hr period, during the dark phase resulted in increased HPF consumption. On the other hand, it should be noted that, in the current investigation, REM sleep was not effected during the light phase. It is unknown why our observed reduction in REM sleep was restricted to the dark phase and not during the light phase. Indeed, sleep pressure is greater during the light phase compared to the dark phase in mice; therefore, it is possible that our device was only able to produce REM reduction during the dark phase when sleep pressure was weaker. In addition, the REM sleep disruption observed in the current investigation did not occur during the first 24 hr after WMGD introduction. A plausible explanation is that the sleep reducing effect of our device requires time to build-up and thus produce disturbances in sleep.</p><p>In conclusion, our results demonstrated that mPFC inhibition reduced sucrose consumption in REM sleep deprived mice. Our results clearly indicate that increased HPF consumption, resulting from REM sleep loss, is mediated by mPFC function thereby providing clear findings that elucidate the role of the mPFC and REM sleep loss in mediating unhealthy dietary behavior, which may lead to adverse health outcomes.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Subjects and chemicals</title><p>A male mouse line on a C57BL/6 background, which was maintained at the International Institute of Integrative Sleep Medicine and weighed between 23 and 34 g (9–10 weeks old) at the beginning of the experiments, was used for all experiments.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Timothy Behrens (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>McEown and colleagues describe results from a series of studies investigating the role of neurons in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) in regulating and linking REM sleep to consumption of highly palatable food. They demonstrate that sleep loss induces an increase of a diet rich in sucrose. Notably, chemogenetic inhibition of mPFC neurons blunted that increase. They did not find an effect to blunt a high fat diet. Collectively, the results are novel and are potentially of wide interest. It is widely accepted that sleep disruption affects metabolism and energy balance. However, the CNS sites and mechanisms linking sleep disruption and obesity are poorly defined. However, as it currently stands the manuscript has several issues that need to be addressed.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The feeding studies are not well described and at this point seem somewhat preliminary. It is not clear if the mice were singly housed and how long they were acclimated to the diets and conditions. Also, it would be useful to know if the REM disruption paradigm affects body weight and composition over time. If this has been published it needs to be pointed out.</p><p>The authors allude to the fact that the mPFC neurons are affecting taste/palatability. Have previous studies investigated the role of these neurons in regulating taste?</p><p>Is this effect really specific for sucrose? By only having one comparison it is hard to judge the behavioral specificity of the PFC action.</p><p>The control of the effect of inactivation of the medial prefrontal cortex in basal condition on food consumption is missing. Indeed, it is important to verify whether the medial prefrontal cortex has also an effect in control condition. One question raised by the results is indeed whether the results are specific to the REM condition. It might be that the medial prefrontal cortex is indeed needed for sucrose consumption.</p><p>What is the difference between loss of REM in dark v. light period? Since the WMGD has the largest effect in the dark period, when mice are normally awake, the exact role of REM loss is a bit ambiguous. Some further clarification for how this works and that the mice do not catch up the light period would be helpful.</p><p>The authors used an original way to deprive mice of REM sleep. They put a wire mesh grid on the bottom of the mice cages. By this means, they obtained a significant decrease of REM sleep quantities during nighttime but not during the day. They also induced a small increase in wake quantities and a non-significant decrease in SWS quantities. I'm wondering why they did not see an effect in the first 24h? This is not mentioned in the manuscript. They should also discuss why there is such a delayed onset of the effect? Also, how they explained it occurs only during the night?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.20269.013</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>[…] Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>The feeding studies are not well described and at this point seem somewhat preliminary. It is not clear if the mice were singly housed and how long they were acclimated to the diets and conditions. Also, it would be useful to know if the REM disruption paradigm affects body weight and composition over time. If this has been published it needs to be pointed out.</italic> </p><p>We have added further detail to the feeding studies methods to better describe our experiments (please see subsection “HPF data collection”). Mice were singly housed and this point is now stated in the aforementioned subsection. Subjects were acclimated to the housing conditions for one week prior to introduction of the highly palatable diet or the wire-mesh-grid-device. Mice were not acclimated to the highly palatable diets prior to commencing the feeding studies and the REM disruption did not affect body weight over our 72 h testing period (please see subsection “GluClαβ-mPFC neuronal inhibition reverses the effect REM sleep loss on HPF consumption”, last paragraph). We did not measure body composition over this 72 h period, however it is unlikely that our intervention would affect body composition (e.g., muscle, fat, etc.) over this short time period. We have not examined whether REM disruption, using our device, would affect body weight or composition over longer periods of time.</p><p><italic>The authors allude to the fact that the mPFC neurons are affecting taste/palatability. Have previous studies investigated the role of these neurons in regulating taste?</italic> </p><p>Previous studies have investigated the role of mPFC neurons in regulating taste/palatability. We have added a few examples of this research as follows:</p><p>“More specifically, the anterior cingulate appears to mediate taste for glucose in primates as feeding fruit juice (i.e., a food high in glucose) to satiety decreased neuronal firing in the anterior cingulate cortex using single cell recordings, whereas initial juice feeding increased neuronal firing in these animals (Rolls et al. 2008). Chocolate flavor also increases activation, as measured by fMRI, in the anterior cingulate cortex in humans (Rolls and McCabe 2007).”</p><p><italic>Is this effect really specific for sucrose? By only having one comparison it is hard to judge the behavioral specificity of the PFC action.</italic></p><p>The mPFC may mediate the taste/palatability for other foods. Therefore, the effect of REM disruption may not be specific to only sucrose. Future research is needed to address this possibility. We have added sentences to the Discussion to address this possibility as follows:</p><p>“On the other hand, it is unknown whether consumption of other highly palatable foods may be effected by mPFC inactivation and/or REM disruption (e.g., foods high in salt content). Future research is needed to explore this possibility.”</p><p><italic>The control of the effect of inactivation of the medial prefrontal cortex in basal condition on food consumption is missing. Indeed, it is important to verify whether the medial prefrontal cortex has also an effect in control condition. One question raised by the results is indeed whether the results are specific to the REM condition. It might be that the medial prefrontal cortex is indeed needed for sucrose consumption.</italic> </p><p>We have now added these data to the text (subsection “GluClαβ-mPFC neuronal inhibition reverses the effect REM sleep loss on HPF consumption”, third paragraph) and in a supplement to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> (i.e., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>, Panel A). Our data show that the medial prefrontal cortex did not mediate sucrose consumption as non-sleep deprived medial prefrontal cortex inactivated mice did not differ in the amount of sucrose consumed compared to non-sleep deprived control mice.</p><p><italic>What is the difference between loss of REM in dark v. light period? Since the WMGD has the largest effect in the dark period, when mice are normally awake, the exact role of REM loss is a bit ambiguous. Some further clarification for how this works and that the mice do not catch up the light period would be helpful.</italic> </p><p>It is unknown why REM disruption was confined to the dark period in our study. We have addressed these points as follows:</p><p>“It is unknown why our observed reduction in REM sleep was restricted to the dark phase and not during the light phase. Indeed, sleep pressure is greater during the light phase compared to the dark phase in mice, therefore it is possible that our device was only able to produce REM reduction during the dark phase when sleep pressure was weaker.”</p><p>We have added a supplement to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> (i.e., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) showing that REM sleep does not rebound during the first three hours of the light period 25-48 h after WMGD introduction. We have also addressed this in text (subsection “Wire-mesh-grid device exposure produced REM sleep loss”, first paragraph).</p><p><italic>The authors used an original way to deprive mice of REM sleep. They put a wire mesh grid on the bottom of the mice cages. By this means, they obtained a significant decrease of REM sleep quantities during nighttime but not during the day.

This is not mentioned in the manuscript. They should also discuss why there is such a delayed onset of the effect? Also, how they explained it occurs only during the night?</italic> </p><p>Indeed, we do not know why our device successfully reduced REM sleep during the dark period but not during the light period. However, we have addressed this point in the third paragraph of the Discussion. In addition, we have addressed the delayed onset of the REM effect as follows:</p><p>“In addition, the REM sleep disruption observed in the current investigation did not occur during the first 24 h after WMGD introduction. A plausible explanation is that the sleep reducing effect of our device requires time to build-up and thus produce disturbances in sleep.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
