suggesting that PP-InsPs may regulate Pi homeostasis. Here we report that deletion of two diphosphoinositol pentakisphosphate kinases VIH1/2 impairs plant growth and leads to constitutive Pi starvation responses. Deletion of phosphate starvation response transcription factors partially rescues vih1 vih2 mutant phenotypes, placing diphosphoinositol pentakisphosphate kinases in plant Pi signal transduction cascades. VIH1/2 are bifunctional enzymes able to generate and break-down PP-InsPs. Mutations in the kinase active site lead to increased Pi levels and constitutive Pi starvation responses. ATP levels change significantly in different Pi growth conditions. ATP-Mg2+ concentrations shift the relative kinase and phosphatase activities of diphosphoinositol pentakisphosphate kinases in vitro. Pi inhibits the phosphatase activity of the enzyme. Thus, VIH1 and VIH2 relay changes in cellular ATP and Pi concentrations to changes in PP-InsP levels, allowing plants to maintain sufficient Pi levels.</p></abstract><kwd-group

taken up from the soil as inorganic phosphate (H<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub><sup>-</sup>, Pi). Plants can also take up phosphite (Phi), a reduced form of Pi which however cannot be used as a source of phosphorus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ticconi et al., 2001</xref>). Plants and other soil-living eukaryotes have evolved sophisticated Pi sensing, uptake, transport and storage mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Puga et al., 2017</xref>). Many of the proteins involved in these processes contain small hydrophilic SPX domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Secco et al., 2012</xref>). We have previously shown that these domains act as cellular receptors for inositol pyrophosphate (PP-InsP) signaling molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wild et al., 2016</xref>). PP-InsPs are composed of a fully phosphorylated inositol ring containing one or two pyrophosphate moieties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Shears, 2018</xref>). PP-InsPs bind to a basic surface cluster highly conserved among SPX domains to regulate divers biochemical and cellular processes in fungi, plants and animals: The N-terminal SPX domains of the yeast VTC complex stimulates its inorganic polyphosphate polymerase activity when bound to 5PP-InsP<sub>5</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hothorn et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wild et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gerasimaite et al., 2017</xref>). In plant and human phosphate exporters, mutations in the PP-InsP binding surfaces of their N-terminal SPX domains affect their Pi transport activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Legati et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wild et al., 2016</xref>). Plants contain additional soluble, stand-alone SPX proteins, which have been shown to bind PHOSPHATE STARVATION RESPONSE (PHR) transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rubio et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Puga et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Qi et al., 2017</xref>). PHR1 and its homolog PHL1 are master regulators of the plant Pi starvation response, which enable plants to grow and survive in Pi limiting growth conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bustos et al., 2010</xref>). PP-InsP-bound SPX domains can physically interact with PHR1, keeping it from binding DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Puga et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wild et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Qi et al., 2017</xref>). In the absence of PP-InsPs, the SPX – PHR1 complex dissociates and PHR1 oligomers can target the promoters of Pi starvation induced (PSI) genes, resulting in major changes in plant metabolism and development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wild et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jung et al., 2018</xref>). These findings suggest that changes in cellular PP-InsP levels may regulate eukaryotic Pi homeostasis. 5PP-InsP<sub>5</sub> levels are indeed reduced in yeast and in animal cells grown in Pi starvation conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lonetti et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wild et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gu et al., 2017a</xref>), suggesting that PP-InsP metabolic enzymes may be key regulators of Pi homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gu et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Azevedo and Saiardi, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Shears, 2018</xref>).</p><p>PP-InsP biosynthesis is well understood in yeast and mammals, where inositol hexakisphosphate kinases Kcs1/IP6K catalyze the synthesis of 5PP-InsP<sub>5</sub> from InsP<sub>6</sub>. 5PP-InsP<sub>5</sub> can be further phosphorylated by diphosphoinositol pentakisphosphate kinases Vip1/PPIP5K to 1,5(PP)<sub>2</sub>-InsP<sub>4</sub> (referred to as InsP<sub>8</sub> in this study) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Shears, 2018</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). How these enzymes may sense changes in cellular Pi concentration remains to be elucidated in mechanistic detail. Currently, it is known that Kcs1/IP6Ks have a K<sub>m</sub> for ATP in the low millimolar range and may therefore generate 5PP-InsP<sub>5</sub> in response to changes in cellular ATP levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Saiardi et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gu et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gu et al., 2017b</xref>). In addition, human PPIP5Ks can be regulated by Pi itself, stimulating their 5PP-InsP<sub>5</sub> kinase activity, and inhibiting their InsP<sub>8</sub> phosphatase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gu et al., 2017a</xref>). Vip1/PPIP5Ks are bifunctional enzymes harboring an N-terminal InsP kinase and a C-terminal phosphatase domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mulugu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fridy et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wang et al., 2015</xref>). The yeast and animal kinase domain acts on the phosphate group at the C1 position of the inositol ring of both InsP<sub>6</sub> and 5PP-InsP<sub>5</sub>, yielding 1PP-InsP<sub>5</sub> or InsP<sub>8</sub> reaction products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mulugu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fridy et al., 2007</xref>). The phosphatase domain has been characterized as a specific 1PP-InsP<sub>5</sub> / InsP<sub>8</sub> phosphatase in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wang et al., 2015</xref>). Deletion of PPIP5K in human cells results in lower InsP<sub>8</sub> and elevated ATP levels, due to enhanced mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and increased glycolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gu et al., 2017b</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43582.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title><italic>vih1 vih2</italic> loss-of-function mutants show severe growth phenotypes and hyperaccumulate Pi.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic overview of VIH1 and VIH2: (upper panel) VIH1 and VIH2 genes with exons described as rectangles, introns as lines.

We next incubated ScVip1 with 5PP-InsP<sub>5</sub> while varying ATP substrate concentrations in gel-based activity assays. We found that at low ATP concentrations the ScVip1 phosphatase activity predominates, releasing InsP<sub>6</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Increasing ATP levels resulted in stimulation of the PP-InsP kinase activity, producing increasing amounts of InsP<sub>8</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Interestingly, at intermediate ATP concentrations, the kinase and phosphatase activities appear balanced, as we did not observe net production of either InsP<sub>6</sub> or InsP<sub>8</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). To further substantiate these qualitative experiments, we next quantified conversion of 5PP-InsP<sub>5</sub> to InsP<sub>6</sub> in NMR experiments (see Materials and methods). We found low ATP-Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentrations to correlate with high ScVIP1 phosphatase activity, and <italic>vice versa</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>).

To test if this mechanism may be of relevance to plant Pi homeostasis, we next quantified the ATP/ADP levels in seedlings grown in Pi deficient medium, or after re-feeding with 0.5 mM Pi or 0.5 mM Phi, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). We found, that ATP/ADP ratios increased after Pi re-feeding over a 48 hr time course, and were significantly higher when compared to the 0 mM Pi control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Importantly, this was not the case when we used 0.5 mM Phi instead of Pi in the experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>).

The Pi content was significantly increased compared to the 0 mM Pi control already at 8 hr after re-feeding, while significant differences in seedling fresh weight and root length became apparent after 48 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C,F</xref>).

This confirms that VIHs, their PP-InsP reaction products and PHR1/PHL1 are part of a common signaling cascade. Our observation that <italic>vih1-2 vih2-4</italic> mutant seedlings show constitutive Pi starvation responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>), and less severe root phenotypes in Pi deficient conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), suggests that <italic>vih1-2 vih2-4</italic> seedling may hyper-accumulate Pi to toxic levels. It is of note that deletion of inositol hexakisphosphate kinases 1 and 2 from human cells, which blocks synthesis of InsP<sub>7</sub> and InsP<sub>8</sub> isoforms, also lead to elevated cellular Pi levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wilson et al., 2019</xref>). Our work is in good agreement with the recent observation that mutations in the inositol polyphosphate biosynthesis pathway impact Pi signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kuo et al., 2018</xref>). The fact that our quadruple mutant does not resemble wild-type plants may indicate that PP-InsPs regulate the activity of other components of the Pi starvation response, such as additional transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sun et al., 2016</xref>), Pi transporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hamburger et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Liu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Liu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wild et al., 2016</xref>), or other SPX-domain containing proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Park et al., 2014</xref>). The strong growth and developmental phenotypes of the <italic>vih1-2 vih2-4</italic> double mutant may also hint at additional signaling functions for PP-InsPs unrelated to Pi homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tan et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sheard et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mosblech et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Laha et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Laha et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wild et al., 2016</xref>). Together, our genetic analysis firmly places VIH1 and VIH2 in the plant Pi starvation response pathway.</p><p>It is known that several PP-InsP isoforms are present in eukaryotic cells. We found increased InsP<sub>7</sub> and non-detectable InsP<sub>8</sub> levels in our <italic>vih1-2 vih2-4</italic> mutant in vivo. In vitro, the AtVIH2 kinase domain prefers 5PP-InsP<sub>5</sub> as substrate to generate InsP<sub>8</sub> (1,5(PP)<sub>2</sub>-InsP<sub>4</sub>). Importantly, the 1PP-InsP<sub>5</sub> kinase activity of VIHs is essential for plant growth and development, as mutations targeting the kinase active site cannot rescue the <italic>vih1-2 vih2-4</italic> mutant phenotypes. These findings are in agreement with previous reports showing that InsP<sub>7</sub> isoforms accumulate and InsP<sub>8</sub> levels decrease in the <italic>vih2-4</italic> single mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Laha et al., 2015</xref>). Together, these findings support a role for InsP<sub>8</sub> as a central signaling molecule in plant Pi sensing, homeostasis and starvation responses.</p><p>Eukaryotic diphosphoinositol pentakisphosphate kinases are bifunctional enzymes. The biochemical activities of plant, yeast and human PPIP5Ks kinase domains are indeed similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mulugu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pascual-Ortiz et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lin et al., 2009</xref>). This notion is further supported by our observation that the <italic>vih1-2 vih2-4</italic> mutant can be complemented with human PPIP5K2 harboring an active kinase domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). In addition to their 1PP-InsP<sub>5</sub> kinase domain, PPIP5Ks also harbor a C-terminal phosphatase domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Shears et al., 2017</xref>). For fission yeast Asp1 and human PPIP5K2 it has been previously shown that the phosphatase domain has inositol pyrophosphatase activity, with a preference for C1 pyrophosphorylated substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gu et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pascual-Ortiz et al., 2018</xref>). In our biochemical assays using Arabidopsis VIH2 and yeast Vip1 phosphatase domains, we observed inositol pyrophosphatase activity against both C1 and C5 pyrophosphorylated substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D,E</xref>). This suggests that the C-terminal phosphatase domain of diphosphoinositol pentakisphosphate kinases is able to dephosphorylate the reaction product of the kinase domain.</p><p>Previously, single point mutations targeting the phosphatase domain have been assayed in vivo and in vitro, with conflicting results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mulugu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Choi et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gu et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pascual-Ortiz et al., 2018</xref>). In our qualitative and quantitative phosphatase assays, we found the corresponding mutations in AtVIH2-PD<sup>RH/AA</sup> and ScVip1-PD<sup>RH/AA</sup> to still harbor residual enzymatic activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>). The catalytic mechanism of histidine acid phosphatase domains in diphosphoinositol pentakisphosphate kinases is currently unknown. We thus cannot rule out that the phosphatase mutant proteins expressed in our <italic>vih1-2 vih2-4</italic> complementation lines are still partially functional. In any case, we do observe statistically significant differences in Pi shoot content only in VIH2<sup>RH/AA</sup> complementation lines at adult stage, with young seedling behaving similar to wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). In line with this, our <italic>vih2-6</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kuo et al., 2018</xref>), which may express a kinase-only VIH2 protein, shows a similar behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). It is thus presently difficult to clearly assign a physiological function for the VIH1 and VIH2 phosphatase domains. However, the strict conservation of the bifunctionality in PPIP5Ks and the fact that we could rescue our <italic>vih1-2 vih2-4</italic> double mutant only with a phosphatase-mutated version of human PPIP5K2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>) together suggest a potential regulatory role for the phosphatase domain, as previously characterized for the human and yeast enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gu et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pascual-Ortiz et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>It has been previously proposed that plants may directly sense cellular Pi levels by inorganic phosphate directly binding to SPX sensor domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Puga et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). Our structural and quantitative biochemical characterization of SPX domains as receptors for PP-InsPs together with the new evidence presented here now argues for a function of PP-InsPs as central signaling molecules in plant Pi homeostasis and starvation responses. We speculate that in our <italic>vih1-2 vih2-4</italic> mutant PHR1/PHL1 are not under the negative regulation of SPX proteins, due to the lack of the InsP<sub>8</sub> signaling molecule normally promoting their interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Puga et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wild et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Qi et al., 2017</xref>). In line with this, PSI gene expression is constitutively upregulated in the double mutant, and deletion of PHR1 and PHL1 can partially rescue the <italic>vih1-2 vih2-4</italic> mutant phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). It has been well established in yeast that PP-InsP levels change in response to changes in Pi availability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lonetti et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wild et al., 2016</xref>). How changes in Pi levels in planta may relate to accumulation or depletion of PP-InsPs is poorly understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Azevedo and Saiardi, 2017</xref>), but our genetic findings now allow us to speculate that the VIH kinase and phosphatase activities may be involved in this process. In line with this, over-expression of kinase and phosphatase mutated versions of VIH2 lead to elevated and reduced cellular Pi levels, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). VIH1 and 2 protein levels are stable in different Pi growth conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Thus, concerted regulation of the enzymatic activities of the VIH PP-InsP kinase and phosphatase activities may antagonistically control Pi homeostasis, growth and development.</p><p>It is of note that cellular ATP levels are reduced when extracellular Pi becomes limiting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Choi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gu et al., 2017a</xref>). Human cells deprived of PP-InsPs conversely showed increased amounts of ATP and elevated Pi levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wilson et al., 2019</xref>). We found cellular ATP levels to be lower in Arabidopsis seedling grown under Pi deficient when compared to Pi replete conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>), in good agreement with what has been reported in other plant species, and in other organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Duff et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Choi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gu et al., 2017a</xref>).</p><p>This prompted us to assay the kinase and phosphatase activities of full-length Vip1 from yeast, which we can purify to homogeneity from insect cells, in the presence of different ATP concentrations. Indeed, we found that at low ATP-Mg<sup>2+</sup> levels, Vip1 mainly acts as PP-InsP phosphatase, while at higher ATP-Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentrations significant InsP<sub>8</sub> synthesis could be observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,B</xref>). We thus speculate that eukaryotic diphosphoinositol pentakisphosphate kinases/phosphatases have evolved to precisely sense cytosolic ATP concentration, or ATP/ADP ratios, relating changes in Pi levels to changes in PP-InsP pools.</p><p>PPIP5Ks may also respond to changing Pi levels directly, as recently reported for human PPIP5K2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gu et al., 2017a</xref>). Using the isolated phosphatase and full-length ScVip1, we further characterized Pi as an inhibitor of the phosphatase activity, while promoting InsP<sub>8</sub> synthesis in the context of the full-length enzyme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). This points to a complex regulation of PPIP5Ks in vivo, which merits further exploration in the future. Importantly, while transfer of seedlings to Phi containing media does not induce ATP level changes, or physiological responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D,F</xref>), the Phi re-feeding suppresses PSI starvation responses and PSI target gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>), as previously shown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ticconi et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jost et al., 2015</xref>). Indeed, we found Phi to stimulate InsP<sub>8</sub> synthesis by full-length ScVip1 to a similar extend as the Pi control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). We hypothesize that Phi in plants stimulates the VIH1/VIH2-catalyzed synthesis of InsP<sub>8</sub>, and suppresses Pi starvation responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E–F</xref>), rationalizing physiological studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ticconi et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jost et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, our findings support a signaling cascade in which InsP<sub>8</sub> is generated and broken down by VIH1/VIH2 in response to changing concentrations of ATP and Pi, to maintain Pi homeostasis and to trigger Pi starvation responses via their SPX domain receptors.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Two bifunctional inositol pyrophosphate kinases/phosphatases control plant phosphate homeostasis&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Ian Baldwin as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission. Both reviewers were very positive about your work on phosphate homeostasis, but also were reserved about the bifunctional mode of action. They outlined several suggestions (see reviewer's comments below), which may guide you to further strengthen your nice manuscript. The reviewers came to a constructive consensus, which we would like you to experimentally assess.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Both reviewers came to the conclusion that the molecular analysis of the Pi starvation response would have been greatly benefited from the examination of a large set of Pi starvation responsive genes.</p><p>2) Moreover, they believe it is essential to perform in vitro analysis of the impact of phosphate and phosphite on the kinase and phosphatase activity of the VIH proteins. In detail they suggest to examine ATP levels after Pi starvation and after re-feeding the starved plants with phosphite (and phosphate as control). Re-feeding could be for 8, 24 and 48 hours. In the analysis, in addition to ATP, Pi levels and plant biomass should be measured, and the expression of Pi starvation induced genes should be tested.</p><p>3) The reviewers also suggested to use in vitro analysis to compare ksc1 with the vih1/vih2 double mutant. Instead of expanding all figures, the reviewers proposed to use the before suggested in vitro experiment also to compare ksc1 with the double mutant.</p><p>4) Introducing SPX3 or SPX1 fusion with e-GFP in the vih1/vih2 double mutant background will not be feasible within two months (or only in transient assay, which would be less reliable). Hence, the reviewers did not insist, but encouraged to include such data, if available.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>In this very interesting manuscript the authors provide numerous data supporting a key role of PP-Ins to control Pi homeostasis. In a previous article they demonstrated that PP-Ins could bind SPX regulatory domain. Here by genetic manipulations of two key enzymes (VIH1 and VIH2) involved in the biosynthesis in planta of these components they promoted important physiological effect related to Pi content and Pi homeostasis.</p><p>Results are of high quality but very dense and sometime confusing due to the impressive amount of data provided. In particular theses enzymes turn out to be putatively bifunctional exhibiting kinase and phosphatase activities. If the authors could clearly demonstrate the importance of the kinase activity, the results on the phosphatase part remains far to be so clear. I would therefore suggest to reduce part of the Results concerning them to generate a more fluid manuscript. I am also surprised that SPX3 or SPX1 fusion with e-GFP (used here as control in some experiments) have not been introduced in the vih1/vih2 double mutant background to investigate the impact of manipulating PP InsP on their putative direct targets.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>This study concerns the functional analysis of two bifunctional inositol pyrophosphate kinases/phosphatases from Arabidopsis, VIH1 and VIH2 revealing their role in Pi homeostasis. With the contentions mentioned below, this is an important finding because it adds support to the emerging idea that inositol pyrophosphates act as signal molecules in Pi homeostasis. Specifically, here the authors show that the double mutant vih1vih2 displays constitutive activation of Pi starvation responses leading to severe growth impairment. In fact, inactivation of PHR1 and PHL1 master regulators of Pi starvation responses greatly rescue vih1vih2 phenotype. The authors also analyzed site-specific mutants of vih1 and 2 at the kinase and phosphatase domains and find they have opposing effects on Pi accumulation and on expression of Pi starvation induced genes. Finally, biochemical analyses in vitro show the levels of ATP determine the relative kinase/phosphatase activity of these bifunctional enzymes. Since ATP levels have been shown to drop under Pi starvation, it has been argued ATP could help to translate to inositol polyphosphate the information on Pi levels. A remaining issue is to examine whether Pi can directly impact these enzymatic activities (as it was shown for the animal counterparts, Gu et al., 2017). This is important because this provides a direct mechanism of translation to insPP of information on P levels). In addition, it could help to explain some longstanding observations in plant physiology regarding the inhibition of Pi starvation responses by phosphite, a non-metabolizable analog of Pi).</p><p>Overall, in this reviewer's opinion the study is technically sound and potentially interesting but the analysis of the impact of Pi (and phosphite) on VIH in vitro activity is necessary to complete the story. In line with this, it is also important to examine whether phosphite affect ATP levels in vivo.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43582.032</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Both reviewers came to the conclusion that the molecular analysis of the Pi starvation response would have been greatly benefited from the examination of a large set of Pi starvation responsive genes.</p></disp-quote><p>As requested, we have re-performed all qPCR analyses, now using a set of ten validated PSI marker genes (and two non-PSI genes PHR1 and LPR1).

These new experiments are now shown as heat maps in revised Figure 1G (previously Figure 2), Figure 2E (previously Figure 3), Figure 2—figure supplement 3, Figure 3D (previously Figure 4), and Figure 6—figure supplement 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Moreover, they believe it is essential to perform in vitro analysis of the impact of phosphate and phosphite on the kinase and phosphatase activity of the VIH proteins.

The respective paragraph in the Results section reads: “To rationalize the puzzling finding that Phi and Pi can both suppress Pi starvation responses, yet only Pi can promote physiological changes, we next tested if Pi and/or Phi would have an effect on PPIP5K enzyme activity. […] In physiologically relevant growth conditions, Pi and ATP/ADP levels may together shape the output of the Pi starvation response, by controlling the synthesis and breakdown of the InsP<sub>8</sub> signaling molecule generated by VIH1 and VIH2.”</p><p>The Discussion section has been changed accordingly: “Using the isolated phosphatase and full-length ScVip1, we further characterized Pi as an inhibitor of the phosphatase activity, while stimulating the kinase activity in the context of the full-length enzyme (Figure 6—figure supplement 2). […] We hypothesize that Phi in plants stimulates the VIH1/VIH2-catalyzed synthesis InsP<sub>8</sub>, and suppresses Pi starvation responses (Figure 6E-F), rationalizing physiological studies (Ticconi et al., 2001; Jost et al., 2015).”</p><p>We have quantified ATP/ADP levels in the suggested time course experiment (8, 24, 48h) in seedlings grown in Pi deficient medium, or after re-feeding with 0.5 mM Pi or Phi, respectively (newly added Figure 6C). We find: “… that ATP/ADP ratios increased after Pi refeeding over a 48h time course, and were significantly higher when compared to the 0 mM Pi control.

In a previous article they demonstrated that PP-Ins could bind SPX regulatory domain. Here by genetic manipulations of two key enzymes (VIH1 and VIH2) involved in the biosynthesis in planta of these components they promoted important physiological effect related to Pi content and Pi homeostasis.</p><p>Results are of high quality but very dense and sometime confusing due to the impressive amount of data provided. In particular theses enzymes turn out to be putatively bifunctional exhibiting kinase and phosphatase activities. If the authors could clearly demonstrate the importance of the kinase activity, the results on the phosphatase part remains far to be so clear. I would therefore suggest to reduce part of the Results concerning them to generate a more fluid manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>PPIP5Ks are bifunctional enzymes not only in plants but also in fungi and animals, where the regulatory function of the phosphatase domain has been recently appreciated (Guo et al., 2017a, Pascual-Ortiz et al., 2018). We now provide new experimental evidence for the functional relevance of the phosphatase domains: We now show in vitro enzyme assays that the catalytic activity of the phosphatase domain is directly regulated by Pi (Figure 6—figure supplement 2A). Also, we have confirmed using quantitative kinetic NMR assays that the RH/AA mutation is indeed still catalytically active (newly added Figure 5F). We strongly feel that this data should be included in the manuscript, as these mutations have not only been used by us, but previously as catalytic dead mutations by many labs studying PPIP5Ks in fungi and animals.</p><p>We have however followed the advice of the reviewer to clarify our experiments on the phosphatase domain and to tone down our discussion.

With the contentions mentioned below, this is an important finding because it adds support to the emerging idea that inositol pyrophosphates act as signal molecules in Pi homeostasis. Specifically, here the authors show that the double mutant vih1vih2 displays constitutive activation of Pi starvation responses leading to severe growth impairment. In fact, inactivation of PHR1 and PHL1 master regulators of Pi starvation responses greatly rescue vih1vih2 phenotype. The authors also analyzed site-specific mutants of vih1 and 2 at the kinase and phosphatase domains and find they have opposing effects on Pi accumulation and on expression of Pi starvation induced genes. Finally, biochemical analyses</italic> in vitro <italic>show the levels of ATP determine the relative kinase/phosphatase activity of these bifunctional enzymes. Since ATP levels have been shown to drop under Pi starvation, it has been argued ATP could help to translate to inositol polyphosphate the information on Pi levels.</italic> </p><p>We have performed the suggested experiments in collaboration with Alisdair Fernie, Max Planck Institute for Molecular Plant Physiology, Golm and can now show that ATP levels are significantly reduced under Pi starvation (revised Figure 6D, please see above).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A remaining issue is to examine whether Pi can directly impact these enzymatic activities (as it was shown for the animal counterparts, Gu et al., 2017). This is important because this provides a direct mechanism of translation to insPP of information on P levels).</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for suggesting this interesting experiment. We now present quantitative enzymatic assays by NMR that revealed that indeed Pi can inhibit the phosphatase activity (Figure 6—figure supplement 2A). Using a full-length PPIP5K we can now demonstrate that Pi promotes InsP<sub>8</sub> synthesis (Figure 6—figure supplement 2B), which based on our in planta HPLC analyses represents the active signaling in Pi homeostasis and starvation responses (newly added Figure 3E, G). We have added these findings to our Abstract (“Pi inhibits the phosphatase activity of the enzyme”), Results: “We found that 5PP-InsP<sub>5</sub> hydrolysis by the isolated ScVip1 phosphatase domain is inhibited in the presence of 10 mM Pi in quantitative NMR time course experiments (Figure 6—figure supplement 2). […] We found that addition of Pi or Phi promoted the synthesis of InsP<sub>8</sub>, which based on our in vivo and in vitro analyses represents the active signaling molecule in plant Pi homeostasis and starvation responses.” and Discussion section: “Using the isolated phosphatase and full-length ScVip1, we further characterized Pi as an inhibitor of the phosphatase activity, while promoting InsP<sub>8</sub> synthesis in the context of the full-length enzyme (Figure 6—figure supplement 2).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition, it could help to explain some longstanding observations in plant physiology regarding the inhibition of Pi starvation responses by phosphite, a non-metabolizable analog of Pi).</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, we found that also Phi can stimulate InsP<sub>8</sub> synthesis by PPIP5Ks (newly added Figure 6—figure supplement 2B). The revised Results section reads: “This prompted us to analyze the enzymatic reaction profiles of full-length ScVip1 in the presence of 0 and 10 mM Pi, or in the presence of 10 mM Phi. […] Thus, Phi may suppress PSI gene expression by stimulating the kinase activities of VIH1 and VIH2, even though the cellular ATP/ADP ratio remains relatively constant (Figure 6D).”</p><p>We have added a statement in the Discussion: “Importantly, while transfer of seedlings to Phi containing media does not induce ATP level changes, or physiological responses (Figure 6D, F), the Phi re-feeding suppresses PSI starvation responses and PSI target gene expression (Figure 6E), as previously shown (Ticconi et al., 2001; Jost et al., 2015). […] We hypothesize that Phi in plants stimulates the VIH1/VIH2 catalyzed synthesis of InsP<sub>8</sub>, and suppresses Pi starvation responses (Figure 6E-F), rationalizing physiological studies (Ticconi et al., 2001; Jost et al., 2015).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Overall, in this reviewer's opinion the study is technically sound and potentially interesting but the analysis of the impact of Pi (and phosphite) on VIH in vitro activity is necessary to complete the story. In line with this, it is also important to examine whether phosphite affect ATP levels in vivo.</p></disp-quote><p>We hope that our newly added physiological and enzymatic assays clarify the regulatory roles of Pi and Phi (Figure 6).</p></body></sub-article></article>
