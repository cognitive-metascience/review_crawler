(orexigenic) agouti-related peptide (AgRP)-expressing neurons are key components of the neuronal circuits that control food intake and energy homeostasis. Here, we assessed whether the catecholamine noradrenalin directly modulates the activity of these neurons in mice. Perforated patch clamp recordings showed that noradrenalin changes the activity of these functionally antagonistic neurons in opposite ways, increasing the activity of the orexigenic NPY/AgRP neurons and decreasing the activity of the anorexigenic POMC neurons. Cell type-specific transcriptomics and pharmacological experiments revealed that the opposing effect on these neurons is mediated by the activation of excitatory α<sub>1A</sub> - and β- adrenergic receptors in NPY/AgRP neurons, while POMC neurons are inhibited via α<sub>2A</sub> – adrenergic receptors. Thus, the coordinated differential modulation of the key hypothalamic neurons in control of energy homeostasis assigns noradrenalin an important role to promote feeding.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.25770.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.25770.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>noradrenalin</kwd><kwd>neuromodulation</kwd><kwd>AgRP-neuron</kwd><kwd>POMC-neuron</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>TR-SFB 134/TP A03</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kloppenburg</surname><given-names>Peter</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Excellence Cluster on Cellular Stress Responses in Aging Associated Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kloppenburg</surname><given-names>Peter</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004189</institution-id><institution>Max-Planck-Gesellschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brüning</surname><given-names>Jens</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003043</institution-id><institution>EMBO</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Marie Curie Long-Term Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Karakasilioti</surname><given-names>Ismene</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The coordinated differential modulation of satiety signaling POMC- and hunger signaling AgRP- neurons in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus assigns an important role to noradrenalin to promote feeding.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Substantial progress has been made identifying central neuronal circuits that are crucial for controlling feeding behavior and energy homeostasis. Understanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms mediating information processing in neuronal circuits that regulate energy homeostasis is essential to devise specific pharmacological strategies, which assist obese patients in starting and maintaining a program of weight loss with no or minimized side effects on other neuronal systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gouni-Berthold et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Holes-Lewis et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Misra, 2013</xref>). Important microcircuits in control of energy balance are localized in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus (ARH), which contains two main neuron populations with antagonistic functions: Neuropeptide Y and agouti-related peptide (NPY/AgRP) co-expressing neurons signaling hunger, promoting food intake, and pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) - expressing neurons which signal satiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sohn et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Varela and Horvath, 2012</xref>).</p><p>Many important fuel-sensing endocrine and metabolic factors, such as insulin, leptin, glucose, serotonin, dopamine, free fatty acids and uridine diphosphate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gao and Horvath, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jo et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jordan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sohn et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Steculorum et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Varela and Horvath, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zhang and van den Pol, 2016</xref>) have been identified and various immediate actions of these modulators and nutrient components on the POMC and AgRP neurons are well understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Belgardt et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Claret et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jo et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Parton et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Spanswick et al., 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">2000</xref>). However, the effect of the catecholamine noradrenalin (NA) on the ARH is not well defined. Noradrenalin is associated with a number of important CNS functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Szabadi, 2013</xref>) including energy homeostasis and food intake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Commins et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ste Marie et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Thomas and Palmiter, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wellman, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">2000</xref>). Potentially, NA could be a direct modulator of the energy homeostasis-regulatory POMC- and AgRP neurons in the ARH, since noradrenergic projections from the hindbrain (A1, A2 noradrenergic cell groups) and the locus coeruleus (LC) to the ARH have been described in rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fraley, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fraley and Ritter, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Yoon et al., 2013</xref>) and manipulation of the noradrenergic system in the hypothalamus has been found to modify feeding behavior and food intake. Impairment of the dorsal or the ventral noradrenergic bundle, which contain efferent projections from the LC to the forebrain, caused hyper- or hypophagia, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahlskog and Hoebel, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hoebel et al., 1989</xref>). In line with these lesion experiments, local NA injections into defined hypothalamus regions either elicits or inhibits feeding in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Booth, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Leibowitz, 1978</xref>). These findings not only demonstrate noradrenergic modulation of food intake, but also indicate that the NA effect on feeding behavior is versatile and site-specific. Additional evidence that NA is associated with the regulation of the homeostatic system in the ARH came from extracellular recordings of unidentified ARH neurons in rats, which responded to NA application (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kang et al., 2000</xref>). Furthermore, NA increases the expression of <italic>Agrp</italic> and <italic>Npy</italic> mRNA in the rat ARH in response to glucoprivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fraley and Ritter, 2003</xref>). This effect is abolished if NA terminals in the ARH are eliminated by the injection of saporin-conjugated anti-dopamine-β-hydroxylase (anti-dβh), a selective NA immunotoxin. Specifically, the immunotoxin also eliminated a large number of neurons in the ventrolateral medulla (A1/C1 cell groups), which have been identified as mediators of glucoprivic feeding. Together, these findings provide strong evidence that NA modulates eating behavior by changing functional properties of ARH neurons.</p><p>Recent work by the Bouret lab provides a plausible hypothesis in regard to the question in which behavioral context the noradrenergic LC projections into the ARH play a key role and what response they facilitate. Based on in vivo electrophysiological recordings in primates, it is hypothesized that the LC plays a key role in mobilizing the required energy to face anticipated physical challenges, such as to obtain rewards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bouret and Richmond, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Varazzani et al., 2015</xref>). In this model, the LC activity is directly related to the energetic need that is required to master the challenge. NA release in the ARH might then promote compensatory energy intake.</p><p>On the cellular level NA action can be mediated by a variety of ARs that can inhibit or excite neurons. NA and adrenalin activate three major classes of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs): α<sub>1</sub>-, α<sub>2</sub>- and β-ARs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hein, 2006</xref>). These receptor types can be further subdivided in a number of different isoforms. The intracellular signaling cascades of ARs are well investigated. While excitatory α<sub>1</sub>-ARs are coupled to Gq/11 and mediate an increase in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels and closure of G protein-coupled inwardly rectifying potassium channels (GIRKs), inhibitory α<sub>2</sub>-ARs couple to Gi/o leading to inhibition of voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (VGCCs) and opening of GIRKs. β-ARs mediate excitation via activation of Gs proteins and subsequent elevation of internal Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations and opening of VGCCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Marzo et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we assessed if NA can directly modulate orexigenic NPY/AgRP and anorexigenic POMC neurons, which are key components of the control circuits in ARH that regulate food intake and energy homeostasis. In electrophysiological recordings, NA had clear opposite effects on these neurons, increasing the activity of NPY/AgRP neurons and inhibiting POMC neurons. Cell type-specific transcriptomics and pharmacological experiments revealed that the activation of NPY/AgRP neurons is predominantly mediated by α<sub>1A</sub>-ARs, while POMC neurons are inhibited via α<sub>2A</sub>-ARs. Collectively, our data indicate a strong orexigenic influence of NA on the ARH circuitry that controls energy balance.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Here we asked, if and how NA directly modulates the activity of NPY/AgRP and POMC expressing neurons of the ARH. This question was addressed in three steps. First, electrophysiological recordings were performed to analyze the modulatory effect of NA on these neurons. Second, we used cell type-specific transcriptomics to build an inventory of adrenergic receptors that are expressed in NPY/AgRP and POMC neurons and potentially could mediate the modulation of these neurons. Third, pharmacological tools were used to test which adrenergic receptors are functionally expressed and how they contribute to the net modulatory effect of NA.</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>Noradrenalin modulates electrophysiological activity differentially in NPY/AgRP and POMC neurons</title><p>In the first set of experiments, we probed if NA modulates the electrophysiological activity of NPY/AgRP and POMC neurons.

Bath-applied 10 µM NA had clear opposite effects on these functionally antagonistic neuron types. NA depolarized orexigenic NPY/AgRP neurons and increased their action potential frequency from 2.0 ± 0.9 Hz to 5.0 ± 1.0 Hz (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>; NPY/AgRP neurons, Wilcoxon matched pairs signed rank test, n = 8, p=0.0012).

Because of the extensive and complex projection pattern, the NA system is associated with a number of important CNS functions including control of wake-sleep-cycles, nociception and memory consolidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Berridge and Waterhouse, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Samuels and Szabadi, 2008a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">2008b</xref>). One important role that has been clearly linked to the NA system by a combination of anatomical, pharmacological, lesion and behavioral studies is the modulation of energy homeostasis and food intake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wellman, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">2000</xref>)</p><p>Here, we show for the first time that NA directly modulates NPY/AgRP and POMC neurons of the ARH, which are key components of the neuronal circuits that control food intake and energy homeostasis. Interestingly, NA changes the activity of these functionally antagonistic neurons in opposite ways, increasing the activity of the orexigenic NPY/AgRP neurons and decreasing the activity of the anorexigenic POMC neurons. The strong differential modulation, which was reproducible in virtually all recorded neurons, is remarkable, since other important fuel sensing modulators like insulin, leptin, glucose, oleic acid and UDP typically affect only a subpopulation of these neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jo et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Parton et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Steculorum et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Williams et al., 2010</xref>). On the network and systems level, this clear differential NA modulation of functionally antagonistic neuron types should generate a strong orexigenic drive on the homeostatic circuits of the ARH. This conclusion is consistent with early behavioral experiments from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Clark et al. (1988)</xref> showing that injection of NA into the third ventricle increased food intake. Furthermore, the authors showed that blockade of α<sub>2</sub>-AR attenuated the NA-induced feeding behavior, which is in line with our finding that satiety signaling POMC- neurons are inhibited by NA via α<sub>2</sub>-AR.</p><p>Since the modulatory effects of NA were observed in synaptically isolated neurons, the data suggest that NA directly activated intrinsically expressed ARs. Our cell type-specific transcriptomic data showed expression of excitatory and inhibitory receptor subtypes in both NPY/AgRP and POMC neurons, which is in line with recent data from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Henry et al. (2015)</xref>. NPY/AgRP neurons expressed excitatory α<sub>1A</sub>-, β-ARs and inhibitory α<sub>2A</sub>-ARs, while POMC neurons only express excitatory α<sub>1A</sub>-ARs and inhibitory α<sub>2A</sub>-ARs. Expression of other AR-subtypes was not detected in these neurons.</p><p>To unravel which of the expressed AR-subtypes contribute to the cell type-specific physiological effects of NA on NPY/AgRP and POMC neurons, we used pharmacological tools that have been previously shown to be selective for AR subtypes. While in NPY/AgRP the robust excitation is mediated by excitatory α<sub>1A</sub>- and β-ARs, α<sub>2A</sub>-ARs mediated the strong inhibition in POMC neurons.</p><p>The functional consequences of these diverse expression and activation profiles on the systems and behavioral level is not entirely clear and has to be investigated in future studies. Previous studies in other neuron types revealed similar phenomena and suggested that simultaneous expression of excitatory and inhibitory (NA) receptors might derive from developmental effects or localized, differential expression of ARs in different functional compartments.</p><p>Simultaneous expression of excitatory and inhibitory adrenergic receptors has been found in neurons of the LC. In juvenile mice, mRNA for excitatory α<sub>1A,B,D</sub>- and inhibitory α<sub>2A,B,C</sub>-ARs has been detected and application of NA caused excitation, while in adult mice NA hyperpolarizes LC neurons. Here, α<sub>1</sub>-ARs attenuate the NA-induced hyperpolarization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Osborne et al., 2002</xref>). As in LC neurons, POMC neurons might change their response to NA during development. In the ARH developmental changes of electrophysiological responses to leptin have been described for NPY/AgRP neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baquero et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nilsson et al., 2005</xref>). Simultaneous expression of excitatory and inhibitory ARs has also been found in dentate neurons of the human cerebellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Schambra et al., 2005</xref>). Here, α<sub>2B</sub>-ARs are thought to modulate excitatory glutamatergic input, while α<sub>1A,B</sub>-ARs may play a role in timing and computation of inhibitory input. Previous studies in dentate neurons of the cerebellum suggested that α<sub>1</sub>-ARs are expressed on the cell body while α<sub>2</sub>-ARs are expressed on the terminals, in order to locally regulate transmitter release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Milner et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>This raises the question regarding the NA source and under which physiological conditions NA is active to modulate food intake. While the blood brain barrier in adult animals is considered mostly impermeable for catecholamines, there is evidence from early work that catecholamines can cross the blood brain barrier in the hypothalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Weil-Malherbe et al., 1959</xref>). However, the site specific effects of local lesions and local NA injections into the hypothalamus might argue for local, site specific NA release from neurons. In rats, projections from the hindbrain/brainstem and the LC to the ARH have been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fraley, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fraley and Ritter, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Yoon et al., 2013</xref>). Specific deletion of projections from the ventro-lateral medulla (A1/C1 cell group) is sufficient to eliminate an increase in AgRP and NPY mRNA expression in response to glucoprivation induced by 2-DG. Furthermore, homeostatic feeding in response to local hypoglycemia in the hindbrain was decreased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fraley and Ritter, 2003</xref>). In this context, recent work in primates from the Bouret group suggested that the LC plays a key role in mobilizing the required energy in order to face anticipated physical challenges, such as obtaining rewards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bouret and Richmond, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Varazzani et al., 2015</xref>). In this model, the LC activity is directly related to the energetic need that is required to master the challenge. Consistent with this hypothesis, our data suggest that NA release into the ARH upon LC activation generates an orexigenic drive to compensate for the required energy. In line with this hypothesis, previous studies revealed that NA injections into the hypothalamus elicit food intake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Booth, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Leibowitz, 1978</xref>).</p><p>Together, these behavioral experiments are strong evidence for the orexigenic nature of NA signaling in the control of food intake. In this context, the orexigenic hormones insulin and leptin may modulate NA signaling in the ARH. While insulin selectively decreased α<sub>2</sub>-AR expression in the ARH and dorsomedial hypothalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Levin et al., 1998</xref>), leptin inhibits NA release in rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brunetti et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Francis et al., 2004</xref>), Both effects would augment the net anorexigenic signal. In support of the latter relation, obese mice that lack the gene to produce leptin (Lep<sup>ob/ob</sup>) exhibit increased NA levels within the hypothalamus, which further decreases the anorexigenic signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Oltmans, 1983</xref>).</p><p>Several drugs that were developed to modify food intake, act on the monoaminergic transmitter system in the brain. Since the molecular and cellular targets that mediate the effects of these drugs are often not clearly identified, they often cause strong side effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hainer et al., 2006</xref>). To successfully support obese patients to manage their food intake with minimized side effects, it is important to precisely define the targets of these drugs. Since the current findings reveal cell type-specific pathways that mediate NA modulation in the ARH they might help to better define specific targets for anti-obesity drugs.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animal care</title><p>All animal procedures were conducted in compliance with guidelines approved by local government authorities (Bezirksregierung Köln, Cologne, Germany) and were in accordance with NIH guidelines.

All experiments have been performed with adult male and female NPY/AgRP-hrGFP (Lowell 2009) or POMC-EGFP (Cowley 2001) mice. The mice for the electrophysiological recordings were 15–20 weeks old.

Each sample contained hypothalami from four mice (males and females) and tissue samples were processed in ice-cold HBSS, until enzymatic treatment. Samples were centrifuged to remove HBSS and were subsequently incubated for 15 min in pre-incubation buffer, at 37°C. Enzyme mix was added and each sample was manually dissociated by gentle pipetting, throughout a total duration of 35 min and according to manufacturer’s instructions (Neural tissue dissociation kit, Miltenyi Biotec, Germany). Subsequently, samples were centrifuged at 500 x g, 10 min, 4°C, and the cell pellet was re-suspended in cold PBS, containing 5% fetal calf serum.</p><p>NPY/AgRP-hrGFP or POMC-EGFP-expressing neurons were gated and sorted with a blue laser. GFP-positive neurons were sorted directly into total RNA extraction buffer (PicoPure RNA isolation kit, ThermoFisher Scientific, USA). Samples were lysed for 30 min by incubation at 42°C and subsequently frozen to −80°C, to allow for simultaneous processing among replicates. Total RNA was extracted according to manufacturer’s instructions (PicoPure RNA isolation kit, ThermoFisher Scientific, USA) and all samples were DNAse-treated (ThermoFisher Scientific, USA). RNA quality was assessed with an Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer and samples with low degradation (RIN &gt;7.5) were further processed for library preparation and sequencing. Due to low amount of input material, pre-amplification using the Ovation RNASeq System V2 was performed. Total RNA was used for first strand cDNA synthesis, using both poly(T) and random primers, followed by second strand synthesis and isothermal strand-displacement amplification. For library preparation, the Illumina Nextera XT DNA sample preparation protocol (Part # 15031942 Rev. C) was used, with 1 ng cDNA input. After validation (Agilent 2200 TapeStation) and quantification (Invitrogen Qubit System) all five transcriptome libraries were pooled.

They determine that NA activates NPY neurons but inhibits POMC neurons, and go on to elucidate the receptors involved by a combination of molecular biology and functional pharmacology combined with electrophysiology. The authors believe this activity to be dependent upon α1A – and β- adrenergic receptors in NPY/AgRP neurons and α2A – adrenergic receptors in POMC neurons. The finding are interesting, especially in the context of recent work by Buret linking NA-releasing neurons to signaling energy need. The experiments are well performed and the data support the conclusions of the authors. However, there are some concerns of the methodology that limit enthusiasm.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>.

The gene expression analysis was performed because our initial electrophysiological experiments revealed a clear differential modulation: excitation in NPY/AgRP and inhibition in POMC neurons. Accordingly, we expected clear differential expression of excitatory and inhibitory ARs, which did not match the data by the Sternson lab. To clarify this discrepancy, we repeated the gene expression analysis, which confirmed the data from the Sternson lab, and unequivocally revealed that ARs are differentially expressed between NPY and POMC neurons.</p><p><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> – The authors use various agonists/antagonists to examine the requirement of ARs in the acute activation of NPY/AgRP neurons.

We now provide the right legend for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>. In addition we have corrected an error in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>: the bar indicating the NA application is shifted to the correct position.</p><p>We absolutely agree with the reviewers that repeated drug applications potentially can cause desensitization. However, note that this experimental scheme allowed us to confirm that each recorded cell was responsive to NA in the first place. We consider this type of “intrinsic control” as a real experimental advantage. In our opinion, this did not compromise our conclusions (see below).</p><p>Specific response: As suggested by the reviewer we tested if desensitization for NA and A61603 occurs. Under our experimental conditions, the effect of both substances is reversible and did not cause desensitization (NA: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> and A61603: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>NA: The effect of NA is reversible and we did not observe desensitization using sequential application. In our opinion this supports the validity of the conclusions that we have drawn from the data of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and B</xref>. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> NA induced the same response in control conditions and in synaptic blockers, suggesting that the excitatory NA effect is fully mediated by cell-intrinsic ARs (Results, subsection “NPY/AgRP neurons, NA concentration-response relation”). These data alone show the lack of desensitization. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref> NA induced a smaller response during the NA application in synaptic blockers. Since we have shown that the reduced response is not caused by desensitization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), we conclude that the NA effect is intrinsic and in (a small) part mediated by presynaptic effects (Results, subsection “POMC neurons, NA concentration-response relation”). Since the same line of arguments is valid for the data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, we conclude that the complete (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>) and the partial block (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>) of the NA response is caused by the AR blockers (Results, subsection “NA excites NPY/AgRP neurons predominantly via the activation of α<sub>1A</sub>-Ars”) and not by desensitization.</p><p>A61603: The effect of A61603 is reversible and we did not observe desensitization using sequential application. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> showed that the α<sub>1A</sub>-AR agonist A61603 can reproduce the excitatory NA effect on the APF in NPY/AgRP-neurons. The main purpose of the following NA applications was to confirm that the investigated neurons were responsive to NA in the first place – which they were. Between the A61603- and the NA response was no significant difference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>).</p><p>Nevertheless, the quantification showed that the NA response tended to be slightly smaller than the A61603 response. This result, however, has to be seen in the context of the subsequent experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C and D</xref>). The analysis on a finer scale revealed that NA not only activated excitatory α<sub>1</sub>-AR, but also inhibitory α<sub>2</sub>-AR. Together this caused a smaller net excitation than A61603 alone. This issue is addressed in more detail next (and in Results, subsection “NA excites NPY/AgRP neurons predominantly via the activation of α<sub>1A</sub>-Ars”).</p><p><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref> – Is it possible that the dosages used are confounding the interpretation of the current results? In particular, in the current study the authors used 1µM A-61603. A-61603 is highly selective for α1A-AR when compared to α1B-AR or α1D-AR by almost 100 fold or more. However, early studies suggested that A-61603 is selective at binding α1A-AR over α2-AR by as little as 10 fold – Ki 8.89nM for α1A-AR and Ki 100nM for α2-AR (Knepper et al., 1995). Due to the dosage used, how can the authors be certain that the effects observed are not dependent upon α2-ARs.</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewers that the drug concentrations used in this type of experiments can play an important role for interpreting the data. In this context, it is important to note that it is not straightforward “to transfer” Ki values between preparations. Therefore, our experiments and conclusions are typically based on the application of more than one drug, e.g., the application of agonists and antagonists.</p><p>In case of the NPY/AgRP neurons we observed that the net NA effect was excitatory. However, as already mentioned above, a more detailed analysis revealed that theses neurons are excited by α<sub>1A</sub>-AR and inhibited by α<sub>2A</sub>-AR when α-<sub>1A</sub>-AR are blocked. This conclusion is based on the following reasoning: The α<sub>1A</sub>-AR A61603 agonist had a similar excitatory effect as NA, while the α<sub>1A</sub>-AR antagonist WB4101 blocked the excitatory NA effect. Interestingly, in the presence of WB4101 (when the excitatory action is blocked) NA had an inhibitory effect, which could be blocked by the α<sub>2A</sub>-AR antagonist BRL44408. In summary, the experiments show that NA activates both excitatory α<sub>1</sub>-AR and inhibitory α<sub>2</sub>-AR, causing net excitation. This dual effect of NA on NPY/AgRP neurons is explained in the legend of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> and in text (Results, subsection “NA excites NPY/AgRP neurons predominantly via the activation of α<sub>1A</sub>-Ars”).</p><p> <italic>Similarly, WB4101 has been shown to label platelet α-2 adrenergic receptors (Sundaresan et al., 1983) and WB4101 appears to bind to a nonadrenergic low-affinity site in both calf and human brain (Weinreich and Seeman, 1981; Lyon and Randall, 1980).</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewers for pointing out these references.</p><p> <italic>Also, BRL 44408 is selective for α2A-AR over α2B-AR (Ki = 1.7 nM and 144.5 nM), however the authors used BRL 44408 at 10µM likely eliminating this selectivity. These points warrant further experimentation if the authors are to conclude AR specific effects.</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewers that the experiments with the α<sub>2A</sub>-AR blocker BRL 44408 alone are not sufficient to differentiate between α<sub>2A</sub>-AR or α-<sub>2B</sub>-AR inhibitory action. Therefore, we want to refer to the complete series of experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). The BRL 44408 experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>) and the yohimbine experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>) strongly suggest that the inhibitory NA effect on POMC-neurons is caused by α<sub>2</sub>-AR. Following the argument of the reviewers, these experiments alone cannot differentiate between α<sub>2A</sub>-AR and α<sub>2B</sub>-AR effects. However, since α<sub>2B</sub>-AR antagonist ARC239 did not block the NA inhibitory NA response, we conclude that the inhibitory NA effect is indeed mediated by α<sub>2A</sub>-AR. In addition, and very importantly, the transcriptome of the POMC- neurons did show α<sub>2A</sub>-AR, but no α<sub>2B</sub>-AR expression (Results, subsection “Αdrenergic receptors are expressed in NPY/AgRP and POMC neurons of the ARH”).</p><p> <italic>Given the authors focus on the role of NPY/AgRP and POMC neurons in feeding behavior, how might the current results fit with earlier work which suggested that α2-AR blockade attenuates feeding behavior induced by both NPY and epinephrine (Clark et al., 1988).</italic> </p><p>Our results fit very well with the behavioral data form Clark et al., 1988. Here we show that NA markedly inhibits satiety signaling POMC neurons via α<sub>2</sub>-AR. This alone (even independently from the excitatory NA action on the hunger signaling NPY/AgRP neurons) would increase the orexigenic drive from the NPY/AgRP – POMC system and should lead to increased food intake. The α<sub>2</sub>-AR antagonist yohimbine blocks the strong inhibitory effect of NA on the POMC neurons, increasing their anorexigenic effect, which in turn should reduce feeding. We have included this Discussion in the revised manuscript (Discussion section).</p><p>Given the state of research at the time, Clark et al., 1988 suggested cellular mechanisms, which focused exclusively on the role of NPY. Since, these mechanisms were formulated relatively vaguely at the time (For example: “Yohimine attenuation of NPY and adrenergic transmitter-evoked feeding behavior may involve α<sub>2</sub>-adrenoceptors located on presynaptic elements, or, as suggested by a number of studies (e.g. [18,19]), postsynaptic elements, or both.”) our results neither support nor strictly contradict their hypotheses.</p><p> <italic>Why are the resting membrane potentials of POMC neurons so hyperpolarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>? Results, subsection “Noradrenalin modulates electrophysiological activity differentially in NPY/AgRP and POMC neurons” suggests that POMC neurons were spontaneously active under control conditions. Were these neurons spontaneously active? A search of the literature (including work from the same authors e.g. L. Plum et al., 2006, AJ Newton et al., 2013) reports RMP of POMC neurons from ~-40mV to ~-60mV. RMPs of -70mV or -80mV would appear to exceed this range and these cells appear quite different from those reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. Could the data be susceptible to cell selection biases?</italic></p><p>First of all, we want to apologize for not having stated the age of the mice that were used for the electrophysiological recordings. The recordings have been performed on 15 – 20 weeks old animals, which is now clearly stated in ‘Materials and methods, subsection “Animal care” and subsection “Electrophysiology” of the revised manuscript. This is important to consider, since previous work suggests that the POMC neurons hyperpolarize with increasing age (Yang et al., 2012 Neuron 75:425-436; Newton et al., 2013). Yang et al., report a mean RMP of ~-65 mV in 24 weeks old mice (estimated from their <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The authors do not provide absolute values, but the boxplot shows several neurons that are clearly more hyperpolarized. In Newton et al., we report a mean RMP of -60 mV (SEM: 1.1; SD: 5.2; Range: -68 mV to -50 mV) in 15-week-old mice.</p><p>In the current manuscript, the boxplot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>) shows the whole range of the measured RMP with a mean of 65.3 mV (SEM: 3.4; SD: 10.2). Based on the previous reports this is in a range, which we would expect for this age and it is also consistent with data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. The boxplot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>) also reveals that the mean is influenced by 3 very hyperpolarized neurons, while the other 6 neurons are more depolarized. Since the recordings of the hyperpolarized neurons were of high quality, we had no reason to classify them as outliers. The boxplot also shows that NA affects all neurons in the same way, independently of the control RMP. Thus, the NA effect is not limited to the hyperpolarized neurons or stronger in these neurons.</p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7A and B</xref> we replaced the example, which showed a very hyperpolarized RMP, with an example in which the RMP is close to the mean RMP.</p></body></sub-article></article>
