progression, and neuropathology. They are linked to tau prion strains, self-replicating assemblies of unique quaternary conformation, whose origin is unknown. Strains can be propagated indefinitely in cultured cells, and induce unique patterns of transmissible neuropathology upon inoculation into mice. DS9 and DS10 cell lines propagate different synthetic strains that derive from recombinant tau. We previously observed that tau monomer adopts two conformational states: one that is inert (M<sub>i</sub>) and one that is seed-competent (M<sub>s</sub>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Mirbaha et al., 2018</xref>). We have now found that M<sub>s</sub> itself is comprised of multiple stable ensembles that encode unique strains. DS9 monomer inoculated into naive cells encoded only DS9, whereas DS10 monomer encoded multiple sub-strains. Sub-strains each induced distinct pathology upon inoculation into a tauopathy mouse model (PS19). M<sub>s</sub> purified from an Alzeimer's disease brain encoded a single strain. Conversely, M<sub>s</sub> from a corticobasal degeneration brain encoded three sub-strains, in which monomer from any one re-established all three upon inoculation into cells. Seed competent tau monomer thus adopts multiple, stable seed-competent conformations, each of which encodes a limited number of strains. This provides insight into the emergence of distinct tauopathies, and may improve diagnosis and therapy.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Tau</kwd><kwd>prion</kwd><kwd>strain</kwd><kwd>biosensor cell</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1R01NS071835</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Diamond</surname><given-names>Marc I</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01NS089932</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Diamond</surname><given-names>Marc I</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Rainwater Charitable Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Tau Consortium</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Diamond</surname><given-names>Marc I</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Tau monomer from aggregate-containing cell models and tauopathy brains adopts discrete structures that act as templates, dictating the conformation of distinct strains that result from its seeding activity.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Tauopathies are a diverse group of neurodegenerative diseases defined by the accumulation of tau amyloids in neurons and glia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Lee et al., 2001</xref>). They include Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and corticobasal degeneration (CBD), among many clinical and neuropathological syndromes. Most are sporadic, and some are caused by dominant mutations in the microtubule associated protein tau (MAPT) gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Lee et al., 2001</xref>). The origin of different sporadic tauopathies is poorly understood. We initially hypothesized that they might arise from distinct, self-propagating assemblies based on our observation that a single tau monomer stably propagates different structures in vitro, depending on the template to which it is initially exposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Frost et al., 2009a</xref>). Experiments from our group and others subsequently indicated that tau transmits amyloid pathology into cultured cells and mouse brain that can move from cell to cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Frost et al., 2009b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Clavaguera et al., 2009</xref>), and led to the idea that it is ‘prion-like.’</p><p>Prion protein (PrP) prions form ‘strains,’ which are distinct amyloid structures derived from a single protein that propagate indefinitely in living systems, and which underlie diverse and predictable patterns of neuropathology in humans and mice. We found that tau forms strains that can be isolated and propagated from cell to cell in a stable line that expresses the repeat domain (RD) containing two disease-associated mutations (P301L/V337M) fused to yellow fluorescent protein (RD-YFP). We initially created two ‘artificial’ strains based on inoculation of recombinant fibrils into RD-YFP cells and isolation of two clonal lines that stably propagated aggregates of distinct conformation: DS9 and DS10. Inoculation of DS9 and DS10 lysates into a mouse model of tauopathy (PS19) that is based on expression of 1N4R human tau with a single disease-associated mutation (P301S) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Yoshiyama et al., 2007</xref>), created distinct neuropathological phenotypes. These could be transmitted stably across multiple generations of mice, and finally back into the RD-YFP biosensor cells, where DS9 and DS10 strains displayed their original morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Sanders et al., 2014</xref>). Additionally, using the RD-YFP biosensor cells we isolated distinct tau strain ensembles from the brains of patients with different tauopathies. This linked different strains to the various neuropathological syndromes. Unlike the prion protein (PrP), tau is not known to cause infectious neurodegenerative disease in humans. However, after creating two classes of infectious proteinaceous particles from recombinant protein that accounted for distinct and stably transmissible patterns of neuropathology, we proposed that tau should be considered a prion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Sanders et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Subsequently, we created 18 distinct tau prion strains and observed that following intracerebral inoculation in mice they created distinct pathological patterns and rates of progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Kaufman et al., 2016</xref>). Indeed, others had previously made similar observations of neuropathological diversity upon inoculation of tau fibril preparations from human tauopathies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Clavaguera et al., 2013</xref>). We have concluded that, in addition to probable contributions of environmental and genetic factors, the diversity of tauopathy can be explained in large part by the strains that underlie them, in other words, by protein conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Kaufman et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>In work to define the minimal infectious unit, or ‘seed’ of tau prions, we previously determined that tau monomer adopts multiple, stable structures that we have grouped into two general categories: ‘inert’ (M<sub>i</sub>) or ‘seed-competent’ (M<sub>s</sub>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Mirbaha et al., 2018</xref>). Although M<sub>i</sub> does not spontaneously self-assemble or seed aggregation, M<sub>s</sub> has a distinct conformation that allows self-assembly and seeding activity. We have isolated M<sub>s</sub> from recombinant sources and human brain. It retains its activity following isolation by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) and passage through a 100kD cutoff filter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Mirbaha et al., 2018</xref>). Structural studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Mirbaha et al., 2018</xref>) suggest that M<sub>s</sub> is differentiated from M<sub>i</sub> based on exposure of critical amino acids (<sup>275</sup>VQIINK<sup>280</sup>/<sup>306</sup>VQIVYK<sup>311</sup>) that have previously been determined to mediate amyloid formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">von Bergen et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">von Bergen et al., 2001</xref>). In M<sub>i</sub> they are predicted to be buried in hairpins and rendered relatively inaccessible for intermolecular interactions.</p><p>The existence of M<sub>s</sub> as a unique conformational ensemble raised the question of what is the role of monomer in strain formation. We considered two possibilities. First, a single structure of M<sub>s</sub> might underlie multiple distinct assemblies. This has been suggested as the basis of two different fibril morphologies isolated from an AD patient, in which the same essential monomeric building block appears to constitute the ‘core’ of the amyloid in both structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Fitzpatrick et al., 2017</xref>). Second, an M<sub>s</sub> protein might adopt multiple distinct conformations as an ensemble, each producing a single strain or subset of strains upon self-association in a multimeric assembly. This would predict that the diversity of tau prion strains we have previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Sanders et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Kaufman et al., 2016</xref>) could be linked back to a distinct set of conformers of tau monomer. We have addressed this question by studying strains propagated in HEK293T cells, DS9 and DS10, that were derived from recombinant fibrils, and others derived from AD and CBD brain.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Tau monomer dictates strain identity</title><p>We previously characterized in detail two tau strains, DS9 and DS10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Sanders et al., 2014</xref>). We hypothesized that if M<sub>s</sub> acts as an ‘unrestricted’ building block, monomer derived from either DS9 or DS10 would produce a diversity of strains. We isolated total lysate or monomer from DS9 by using size exclusion chromatography (SEC) or by passage through a 100kD size-exclusion filter, methods that we have previously determined to faithfully exclude larger assemblies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Mirbaha et al., 2018</xref>). We then inoculated DS1 cells, which lack any aggregates, and used FACS to isolate single aggregate-containing cells, with which we established monoclonal lines for further analysis. We initially used epifluorescence microscopy to characterize the various colonies for inclusion morphology, which serves as a rough surrogate for strain identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Sanders et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Kaufman et al., 2016</xref>). For M<sub>s</sub> derived from DS9, we observed no variation—each of 52 clones exhibited the speckled conformation previously observed for DS9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Sanders et al., 2014</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We isolated six typical ‘sub-strains,’ termed DS9.1–9.6, for further characterization in detail. In addition, we passed the lysate through a 100 kD size exclusion filter and used it to inoculate DS1 cells, creating 31 monoclonal lines. All were indistinguishable from DS9 by confocal microscopy. Inoculation using unfractionated DS9 lysate, or lysate of any of the sub-strains produced a single population of clones, all identical to DS9 in morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.37813.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Tau M<sub>s</sub> from DS9 retains strain identity.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Clones isolated from DS9 monomer (9.1–9.6) show morphological characteristics similar to DS9.

DS9 and DS9.1–9.6 exhibited similar fractionation patterns, with most tau being insoluble (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Finally, we used an established biosensor cell line that expresses tau RD (P301S) fused to cyan and yellow fluorescent proteins (RD-CFP/YFP) to monitor the ability of strains to trigger intracellular aggregation. DS9 and DS9.1–9.6 had identical maximal seeding, with variation in the dose responses within ~1 log of concentration, which is typical for independent isolates of the same strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).

Approximately 21% of cells formed a fifth strain, DS10.5, that rapidly ‘sectored,’ that is, lost its inclusions, and thus could not be further characterized. All strain images were analyzed by a blinded reviewer (D.R.W.). DS10 monomer was also isolated using a 100 kD cutoff filter.

DS10.3 had a much weaker seeding activity with an EC<sub>50</sub> at &gt;10 μg (unable to be determined accurately), and reduced maximal seeding efficiency at ~50%. DS10.4 had an EC<sub>50</sub> of 100 ng. Based on multiple measures, we concluded that unlike DS9, DS10 monomer encoded distinct sub-strains, each with unique morphological and biochemical characteristics.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Conformational ensembles of M<sub>s</sub></title><p>Sub-strains of DS10 could arise because multiple distinct monomers co-exist, each constrained to form only a single sub-strain. In this case, M<sub>s</sub> from each sub-strain would be predicted to recreate only that sub-strain (as for DS9.1–9.6). Alternatively, M<sub>s</sub> derived from DS10 might exist as a conformationally restricted ensemble, with relatively low kinetic and energetic barriers between various states that become ‘locked in’ upon higher-order assembly. In this case, monomer from any sub-strain would establish all of the others upon re-inoculation. To test these ideas, we isolated monomer from each of the DS10 sub-strains, re-introduced them into DS1, and isolated n = 47–51 monoclonal cell lines bearing inclusions from each inoculation. We analyzed each of these using blinded scoring of intracellular inclusion morphology. In 49 sub-strains derived from DS10.1 monomer, 45 appeared identical to DS10.1, except for four that formed DS10.5 (sectored) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>). This suggested M<sub>s</sub> from DS10.1 was relatively restricted in its conformation. We obtained very different results with the other DS10 sub-strains. M<sub>s</sub> derived from each of DS10.2, DS10.3, or DS10.4 gave rise to all sub-strains, including DS10.1, with predomination of the original sub-strain (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>). This indicated that M<sub>s</sub> from these DS10 substrains existed as conformational ensemble. Taken together, our experiments revealed that while multimeric assemblies from total lysate exhibit consistent strain behavior in all cases, that is, faithful replication, tau monomer (M<sub>s</sub>) is less constrained. While M<sub>s</sub> derived from DS9 was completely restricted to forming a single strain, and M<sub>s</sub> from DS10.1 predominantly encoded one sub-strain, others (DS10.2, DS10.3, DS10.4) adopted a defined set of strains in which M<sub>s </sub>from any could give rise to all five.</p><table-wrap id="table3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.37813.008</object-id><label>Table 3.</label><caption><title>Quantification of second generation of sub-strains obtained from DS10.</title><p>M<sub>s</sub> from each sub-strain of DS10 (10.1–10.5) was inoculated into DS1, and clones of the induced strains were characterized.

It has been unclear whether monomeric tau encodes strain information, or if this is determined by multimeric assemblies. We now conclude that M<sub>s</sub> represents an ensemble of structures, in which each encodes a restricted set of strains. M<sub>s</sub> derived from artificially derived strains (DS9 and DS10) replicated the parent strain exclusively (DS9), or a series of sub-strains, one of which closely resembled the parent strain (DS10). These sub-strains each produced unique pathology upon inoculation into the PS19 tauopathy mouse model. Turning to patient-derived samples, we observed that, like total brain lysate, M<sub>s</sub> from an AD patient encoded a single strain. Conversely, while total lysate from a CBD patient encoded two strains, M<sub>s</sub> derived from CBD lysate encoded these two strains, plus a third. Thus we hypothesize that tau, despite being unstructured by classical biophysical measures, can adopt multiple, stable conformational ensembles in its seed-competent form, M<sub>s</sub>. These may restrict subsequent assembly to a single fibril conformation (as for M<sub>s</sub> derived from DS9 and AD), or may enable formation of a limited number of assembly structures that constitute individual strains (as for M<sub>s</sub> derived from DS10 and CBD).</p><p>Intriguingly, monomer from DS10 produced five sub-strains. DS10.1 resembled DS10 in every respect, except that monomer from this sub-strain did not recreate the original diversity seen in monomer from DS10. This suggests that in forming DS10.1, M<sub>s</sub> adopts a structure very similar to that of DS10 monomer, but with energetic or kinetic barriers that restrict its conformation. It appears that in isolating M<sub>s</sub> from DS10 we enabled a new, restricted M<sub>s</sub> conformation to emerge and be trapped within the DS10.1 strain. Nonetheless, the overall similarity of DS10 and DS10.1 in terms of inclusion morphology, seeding activity, proteolytic patterns, and neuropathology suggests that the core amyloid conformations are likely to be almost identical.</p><p>A major caveat of this work is that we amplified strains using tau RD-YFP containing two mutations (P301L/V337M), not full-length protein. We recognize that our system may bias detection of strains. Also, it remains to be determined (and studies are ongoing) whether RD-YFP captures the critical core structures of fibrils that occur in patients. For example, prior work by Fitzpatrick et.al. indicated that two distinct fibril morphologies (paired helical filaments and straight filaments) could be detected in AD brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Fitzpatrick et al., 2017</xref>). These appeared to derive from different configurations of a single monomer template. This is consistent with our prior work, where 2/6 AD patients we analyzed contained two distinct strains, whereas in 4/6 patients, we observed a single strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Sanders et al., 2014</xref>). Nonetheless, based on our characterization of strains derived from M<sub>s</sub> extracted from the AD and CBD brains, we feel confident in our primary conclusions. In this regard, we were excited to see recent work by Ohhashi et.al, who found that the intrinsically disordered region of Sup35 harbored local compact structure, and also that distinct forms of monomer could give rise to unique Sup35 amyloid conformations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ohhashi et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Based on this work, we predict that related ‘families’ of strains will be described in patients, linked by structural similarity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). More specifically, we hypothesize that strain families will utilize distinct combinations of amino acids to form local ‘core’ structures that are largely preserved, even within a monomer. Similarly, seed competent monomers will adopt a series of structurally related conformations that further assemble into amyloid fibrils. Once a multimeric assembly forms, our observations suggest that it replicates faithfully as a strain. This explains how a single patient might harbor multiple strains, each potentially derived from a topologically restricted ensemble of tau monomer, M<sub>s</sub>. By extension, each distinct tauopathy may develop based on emergence of a restricted conformation of M<sub>s</sub>. This could be due to stochastic or environmental effects, post-translational modifications, or other interactions that facilitate conversion of M<sub>i</sub> to a particular ensemble of M<sub>s</sub> conformations.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.37813.018</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Model for families of monomer conformations.</title><p>We propose a model that discriminates two general conformational ensembles: M<sub>i</sub> and M<sub>s</sub>. M<sub>i</sub> is inert, whereas M<sub>s</sub> has seeding activity. Within M<sub>s</sub>, multiple conformations exist that can encode individual or multiple strains. Once an assembly forms, a strain will be faithfully replicated; however, if M<sub>s</sub> is isolated from the strain, it can assemble to form a defined set of sub-strains.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-37813-fig6-v1.tif"/></fig><p>In summary, we present a model to explain how diverse aggregate structures form and give rise to phenotypic diversity in the tauopathies. This predicts a family restricted M<sub>s</sub> structural ensembles with varying degrees of relatedness. The original topological restrictions of M<sub>s</sub> that give rise to tau prion strains, and the diseases they cause, thus may depend ultimately on initial conformational determinants of tau monomer. Ultimately, an understanding the conformational basis of different tauopathies will facilitate more accurate diagnosis and treatment.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Gene <break/>(human)</td><td>tau RD <break/>(LM)-YFP</td><td>PMID: 24857020</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Cell line <break/>(human)</td><td>DS1; DS9; DS10</td><td>PMID: 24857020</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Cell line <break/>(human)</td><td>Tau RD P301S <break/>FRET Biosensor</td><td>PMID: 25261551, <break/>ATCC</td><td>ATCC CRL-3275, <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_DA04">CVCL_DA04</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Cell line <break/>(human)</td><td>DS9.1; <break/>DS10.1; <break/>DS10.2; <break/>DS10.3,DS10.4, <break/>AD(t); AD(m); <break/>CBD1(t); CBD2(t); <break/>CBD1(m); CBD2(m); <break/>CBD3(m)</td><td>This paper</td><td/><td>These are cell <break/>lines created <break/>from tau seeds <break/>(total lysate <break/>and/or <break/>seed-competent <break/>monomer) that derived <break/>either from clonal <break/>cell lines DS9 <break/>and DS10, or <break/>Alzheimer’s or <break/>Corticobasal <break/>Degeneration disease <break/>brain samples <break/>that were inoculated <break/>into DS1 cell lines, <break/>as described in <break/>the Materials and <break/>Methods, and <break/>Results sections.</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody (rabbit)</td><td>TauA (polyclonal against <break/>QTAP…KIGSTENL)</td><td>This paper</td><td/><td>Antibodies used <break/>at dilution <break/>indicated in <break/>Materials and <break/>Methods <break/>section (1:1000).</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody (rabbit)</td><td>Anti-GFP <break/>(polyclonal)</td><td>Rockland Inc.</td><td>Rockland <break/>antibodies: <break/>600-401-215, <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_828167">AB_828167</ext-link></td><td>Antibodies used at <break/>dilution indicated <break/>in Materials and <break/>Methods section <break/>(1:1000)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody (mouse)</td><td>HJ 9.3 (monoclonal <break/>against tau RD)</td><td valign="bottom">PMID:24075978, <break/>PMID:29566794</td><td valign="bottom">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2721235">AB_2721235</ext-link></td><td>Antibodies used at <break/>dilution indicated <break/>in Materials and <break/>Methods section <break/>(1:2000)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody (donkey)</td><td>ECL <break/>Anti-Rabbit</td><td valign="bottom">GE Lifesciences</td><td valign="bottom">NA9340V,</td><td>Antibodies <break/>used at dilution <break/>indicated in <break/>Materials and <break/>Methods <break/>section <break/>(1:2000)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody (sheep)</td><td>ECL <break/>Anti-Mouse</td><td valign="bottom">GE <break/>Lifesciences</td><td valign="bottom">NA931V</td><td>Antibodies used at <break/>dilution indicated <break/>in Materials and <break/>Methods section <break/>(1:2000)</td></tr><tr><td>Commercial <break/>assay</td><td>Amersham ECL <break/>Western Blotting <break/>reagent</td><td>GE <break/>Lifesciences</td><td>GE Lifesciences: <break/>RPN2236</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Commercial <break/>assay</td><td>100 kD Spin filter</td><td>Corning <break/>Spin-X UF</td><td>Corning: 431481</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Commercial <break/>assay</td><td>Agarose <break/>beads</td><td>Pierce protein <break/>A/G Plus</td><td>Thermo <break/>fisher: 20423</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Software</td><td>Graphpad <break/>Prism</td><td>Graphpad <break/>software LLC</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Software</td><td>FlowJo</td><td>FlowJo LLC</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Other</td><td>Lipofectamine <break/>2000</td><td>Thermofisher</td><td>Thermo <break/>fisher: 11668019</td><td>transfection <break/>reagent</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s3-1"><title>Cell culture</title><p>All cells were grown in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s medium (Gibco) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone), 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Gibco), and 1% Glutamax (Gibco).

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Tau monomer encodes strains&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Anna Akhmanova as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Jeffery W Kelly (Reviewer #2).</p><p>Reviewers discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This report provides support for the concept that tau monomers contain information that will seed specific types of tau aggregates, designated in this manuscript as &quot;tau strains&quot;. The report is an extension of prior report showing that monomer liberated from fibrils can retain structural features that promote seeding capacities, leading to the conclusion that tau monomers are either seeding competent (M<sub>s</sub>) or seeding inert (M<sub>i</sub>). Importantly the Tau M<sub>s</sub> retains additional structural information that produces distinct cellular tau assemblies. This is potentially a revolutionary idea that could have significant impact on understanding the structural basis for tauopathies as well as other diseases associated with protein aggregation.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) While authors use several approaches to minimize potential contamination, use of the cell derived material poses some complications. For example, if potential &quot;soluble&quot; oligomers are proteolytically processed within the cell, filtration using 100kDa cut-off filters may not remove any &quot;processed&quot; oligomers. While one could attempt to detect such &quot;oligomers&quot; but such effort is challenged if the oligomers are present at very low levels. One suggestion would be to see if depletion of YFP-containing &quot;monomers&quot; significantly reduce the &quot;seeding&quot; capacity of the monomers from the clones. While this is not perfect, at least the authors could rule out any spurious oligomers containing the only the &quot;tau RD&quot; domain.</p><p>2) Use of &quot;strain&quot; in the context of this report indicate direct structure determinant. The outcome in this report is completely based on the gross cellular morphology of &quot;aggregates&quot; and neuroanatomical distribution of tau pathology. Other than protease sensitivity assay of cell derived material, there is no demonstration that strains are structurally distinct. For example, do the cell derived monomers directly seed in vitro aggregation of tau fibrils with different structures/morphologies?</p><p>3) At various places in the manuscript that they consider tau as a prion. Tau should not be considered as a prion yet, because tau still lacks certain properties that classifies prions. Most importantly, no epidemiological data exit that demonstrate the inter-individual transmissibility of tau aggregates in humans. As long as tau does not meet all criteria classifying prions, it should not be designated as a prion.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.37813.023</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) While authors use several approaches to minimize potential contamination, use of the cell derived material poses some complications.

To address this concern, we precipitated seeding activity from DS10.2 cell lysates using HJ9.3 (for reasons we have found it impossible to IP seeds using anti-GFP antibody). HJ9.3 immunoprecipitated the entirety of seeding activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>).</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Immunoprecipitation of seeding activity from DS10.2.</title><p>Lysates from DS10.2 cells expressing tau RD-YFP in an aggregated form were exposed to HJ9.3 antibody, which recognizes tau aa306-321, followed by immunoprecipitation. Total, supernatant, and pellet fractions were transduced via Lipofectamine into tau RD-CFP/YFP FRET biosensor cells, and the percentage of cells with aggregates was quantified by flow cytometry. After exposure to anti-tau antibody, no seeding activity remained in the supernatant, and all had been removed to the pellet fraction.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-37813-resp-fig1-v1"/></fig><p>To test for the possibility that an RD fragment lacking the GFP epitope was accounting for the strain activity, we probed the western blots with HJ9.3, and anti-GFP antibody. We detected two bands with each antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2</xref>). The dominant band, at ~45kDa is consistent with full-length RD-YFP. A smaller band at ~35kDa was detected by both HJ9.3 and anti-GFP antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2</xref>). We did not observe bands whose reactivity is consistent with a cleavage product of RD alone (which would be closer to ~14kDa). In parallel, we carried out studies of tau monomer from AD brain, which, like RDYFP, carries strain information. We observed no evidence of tau RD fragments.</p><fig id="respfig2"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Tau monomer from DS10.2 is predominantly full-length.</title><p>Diagram indicates tau RD-YFP and the epitope of HJ9.3, which was used for initial</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-37813-resp-fig2-v1"/></fig><p>immunoprecipitation (IP). Following IP, SDS-PAGE was performed, followed by western blot using secondary antibodies of either HJ9.3 (left) or anti-GFP (right). HEK cell lysate was negative control. AD brain lysate was also analyzed. Tau RD-YFP at ~45kDa is the predominant band, with a secondary band (which is only occasionally observed, but recorded here) at ~35kDa that contains the GFP epitope and the HJ9.3 epitope. Note that tau monomer derived from AD brain (which also encodes strains) has no obvious truncation products.&lt;/<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2</xref> title/legend&gt;</p><p>In summary, while we cannot exclude the possibility that a small number of invisible RD oligomers of tau are encoding strains within the cell lines, our biochemical studies speak to the dominant form of tau monomer as intact RD-YFP, with a minor product that is a small fraction the sample (and, indeed, is not consistently visible when we perform repeated studies) that contains both RD and YFP epitopes. Finally, with regard to the central point of our manuscript, we have observed no fragments of full-length tau that can account for strain-encoding seeding activity as would be predicted by cryptic monomers, and so we stand by our central conclusions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Use of &quot;strain&quot; in the context of this report indicate direct structure determinant.

For example, do the cell derived monomers directly seed in vitro aggregation of tau fibrils with different structures/morphologies?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer brings up a valid point that has bedeviled the field of prion research, although we strongly disagree with the statement that we have provided “no demonstration” that strains are structurally distinct – we have used inclusion morphology, seeding activity, biochemical characteristics, inoculation in vivo, and limited proteolysis. Together these represent a fairly comprehensive, if indirect, assessment of a prion’s conformation, or strain identity. In fact, we would like to emphasize that what we have done exceeds what is typically performed in PrP research to discriminate strains. It is currently impossible in our lab (and in others, as far as we know) to faithfully amplify a single tau prion strain in vitro. Thus we are left with the above mentioned “indirect” structural probes, the best of which appears to be limited proteolysis. While we are working on this problem, so far we have failed to develop a method to directly determine the conformation of tau prion strains. Within the limits of our experimental expertise we feel safe in concluding we are in fact generating distinct strains. It is worth mentioning that in our analyses of over two dozen distinct strains, we have never observed that strains with different cell morphological patterns (which we used initially to select distinct strains) harbor the same strain. The reverse is not true. Cells that have similar inclusion morphological can in fact harbor distinct strains. So if anything, by using cell morphology as a probe we are <italic>underestimating</italic> the prevalence of distinct strains.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) At various places in the manuscript that they consider tau as a prion. Tau should not be considered as a prion yet, because tau still lacks certain properties that classifies prions. Most importantly, no epidemiological data exit that demonstrate the inter-individual transmissibility of tau aggregates in humans. As long as tau does not meet all criteria classifying prions, it should not be designated as a prion.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer brings up a valid and common criticism of our use of the term “prion.” However, even Stanley Prusiner, who invented the term, now refers to tau as a “prion” in his work. In our 2014 publication in Neuron we carried out a series of experiments that we feel are definitive in establishing tau as a bona fide, infectious prion. We created infectious tau by in vitro fibrillization reactions, inoculated cell lines, isolated distinct strains that stably propagated transmissible tau species in vitro, and created transmissible pathology across three generations of mouse models through brain inoculation. In our opinion, the lack of observed human transmissibility “in the wild,” is not a reason to use a different term for tau prions, as in every respect in a laboratory environment they meet the criteria that have been used to study and propagate PrP prions for decades.</p><p>We would also point out that without extraordinary transmission events such as extreme agricultural practices (e.g. feeding sheep offal to cows), cannibalism and inoculation through tissue transplantation or brain surgery, even human PrP disease would not spontaneously transmit between individuals. Now that commonsense practices are in place there is essentially no human-human transmission of PrP prion disease. Thankfully, there are no known cases of tau transmission through tissue transplantation or brain surgery, although the absence of this type of inter-person transfer (which would presumably satisfy the reviewer that tau is a prion) does not mean it hasn’t happened, or couldn’t happen. Certainly our prior transmission of tau pathology in mice suggests transmission between individuals would be feasible under unfortunate circumstances.</p><p>In summary, we respectfully request that we keep this term, as for all practical purposes, we maintain that tau meets the biochemical, biological, and experimental criteria of a prion.</p></body></sub-article></article>
