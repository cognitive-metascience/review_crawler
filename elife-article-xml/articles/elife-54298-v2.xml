heart failure in response to pathological stresses, therefore, a therapeutic strategy to maintain cardiac insulin pathways requires further investigation. We demonstrated that insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) was reduced in failing mouse hearts post-myocardial infarction (MI) and failing human hearts. The mice manifesting severe cardiac dysfunction post-MI displayed elevated <italic>mir128-3p</italic> in the myocardium. Ischemia-upregulated <italic>mir128-3p</italic> promoted <italic>Irs1</italic> degradation. Using rat cardiomyocytes and human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes, we elucidated that mitogen-activated protein kinase 7 (MAPK7, also known as ERK5)-mediated CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein beta (CEBPβ) transcriptionally represses <italic>mir128-3p</italic> under hypoxia. Therapeutically, functional studies demonstrated gene therapy-delivered cardiac-specific MAPK7 restoration or overexpression of CEBPβ impeded cardiac injury after MI, at least partly due to normalization of <italic>mir128-3p</italic>. Furthermore, inhibition of <italic>mir128-3p</italic> preserved <italic>Irs1</italic> and ameliorated cardiac dysfunction post-MI. In conclusion, we reveal that targeting <italic>mir128-3p</italic> mitigates myocardial insulin resistance, thereafter slowing down the progression of heart failure post-ischemia.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cardioprotection</kwd><kwd>myocardial infarction</kwd><kwd>cardiac insulin resistance</kwd><kwd>IRS1</kwd><kwd>miRNA</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000274</institution-id><institution>British Heart Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FS/15/16/31477</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Wei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000274</institution-id><institution>British Heart Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FS/18/73/33973</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Wei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000274</institution-id><institution>British Heart Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PG/12/76/29852</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Xin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000274</institution-id><institution>British Heart Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PG/14/71/31063</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Xin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000274</institution-id><institution>British Heart Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PG/14/70/31039</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Xin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010447</institution-id><institution>German Centre for Cardiovascular Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81Z0700201</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Müller</surname><given-names>Oliver J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Targeting mir128-3p could prevent cardiac insulin resistance in the non-infarcted myocardium and limit cardiac injury after myocardial infarction, delaying the development of heart failure.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Ischemic heart disease is a leading cause of mortality worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Benjamin et al., 2019</xref>). Although significant advances in treatment have improved early survival after myocardial infarction (MI), such as bypass surgery, percutaneous coronary intervention, and thrombolytic therapy, the high prevalence of post-MI-associated heart failure (HF) remains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sanchis-Gomar et al., 2016</xref>). Clinical studies suggest that promoting reliance on glucose under ischemic condition represents an indispensable adaption, which may have beneficial effects on survival in patients suffering from ischemic heart disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Montessuit and Lerch, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ritterhoff and Tian, 2017</xref>). At an early stage post-ischemia, enhanced insulin-dependent glucose utilization in cardiomyocytes protects the heart against injury exacerbation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nagoshi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ussher et al., 2012</xref>). Conversely, myocardial insulin resistance precedes and prophesies the onset and progression of HF during prolonged stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aroor et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ciccarelli et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Riehle and Abel, 2016</xref>). Impaired insulin signaling pathways in cardiomyocytes leads to loss of the major energy source, increased oxidative stress due to metabolic shift toward fatty acids, and deleterious cardiac remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aroor et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tian and Abel, 2001</xref>). However, few studies have investigated the molecular pathogenesis of cardiac insulin resistance post-ischemia.</p><p>In the heart, insulin receptor substrate (IRS) is a key modulator in the insulin signal transduction pathway. Upon activation by insulin receptor (INSR), IRS facilitates glucose transporter 4 (SLC2A4, also known as as GLUT4) translocation, as well as initiates cell survival pathways in cardiomyocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Guo and Guo, 2017</xref>). Notably, human heart samples from subjects with advanced heart failure display an impaired IRS signaling and reduced plasma membrane SLC2A4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chokshi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cook et al., 2010</xref>). Myocardial loss of both IRS1 and IRS2 renders the heart more vulnerable to cardiac dysfunction in mice suffering from diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Desrois et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Qi et al., 2013</xref>). In addition, cardiac IRS1 and IRS2 double knockout mice displayed contractile dysfunction in early life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Riehle et al., 2013</xref>). More importantly, impaired insulin sensitivity in ischemic myocardium is attributed to defective IRS1 function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ciccarelli et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fu et al., 2016</xref>). Noting the protective role of cardiac IRS1, the feasibility of ameliorating cardiac insulin sensitivity and heart injury via maintaining IRS1 following ischemia has been underscored.</p><p>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) act as post-transcriptional gene regulators by either degrading target transcripts or suppressing their protein translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ambros, 2004</xref>). Signature alterations of cardiac miRNAs have been implicated in a multitude of pathological processes, including cardiac hypertrophy, ischemic injury and heart failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Caroli et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wojciechowska et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore, silencing disease-prompted miRNAs using antagomiRs is considered as a potential therapeutic intervention for heart diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">van Rooij et al., 2008</xref>). Approximately 50% of human miRNAs are expressed from the introns of encoding transcripts, referred to as intronic miRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rodriguez et al., 2004</xref>), which are transcribed from the primary transcripts (Pri-miRNAs) along with their host genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Saini et al., 2007</xref>). <italic>Mir128</italic> is an intronic miRNA, which promotes cardiomyocyte apoptosis during ischemia/reperfusion injury in rabbits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zeng et al., 2016</xref>), while its loss advances mouse cardiac regeneration after MI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Huang et al., 2018</xref>). However, whether <italic>mir128</italic> is implicated in myocardial insulin resistance post-MI is unexplored.</p><p>In this study, we seek to ascertain that cardiac IRS1 reduction is causative for HF progression post-MI via impairing insulin sensitivity in the myocardium. In addition, we demonstrate that upregulated <italic>mir128-3p</italic> directly targets the 3’-UTR of <italic>Irs1</italic> and represses its expression in response to hypoxic stress. <italic>mir128-3p</italic> is processed from <italic>Pri-mir128-1</italic> transcript, which is negatively regulated by the transcription factor CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein beta (CEBPβ). Phenotypic and molecular analyses revealed that CEBPβ suppression of <italic>mir128-3p</italic> and maintenance of IRS1-conferred insulin sensitivity under ischemic insult. Furthermore, this regulatory signaling cascade is reinforced by functional evidence showing that adeno-associated virus (AAV9)-delivered <italic>Cebpb</italic> (encoding CEBPβ) or <italic>mir128-3p</italic> antagomiR retain IRS1 expression and alleviate injury expansion in mouse hearts post-MI. Taken together, our findings unveil a novel cardio-protective mechanism that provides new insights into treatment strategies for heart failure by relieving insulin resistance in ischemic myocardium.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>IRS1 is downregulated in long-term ischemia-induced failing hearts</title><p>We first investigated whether cardiac dysfunction correlates with impaired glucose pathway following MI. To do so, we applied permanent occlusion of left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery on male C57BL/6N mice. Four weeks post-MI, the mice displayed cardiac dysfunction exemplified by reduced fractional shortening (FS%), increased end-diastolic left ventricular internal diameter (dLVID) and end-systolic left ventricular internal diameter (sLVID) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). Deleterious heart function was coupled to severe infarction and interstitial fibrosis in the non-infarct region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>). To assess genome-wide manifestation of glucose pathways, we performed RNA-Seq from the non-infarct area. We focused on analyzing the key genes involved in cardiac glucose metabolism, revealing that a significant number of genes responsible for glucose uptake and glycolysis were differentially expressed in the failing hearts post-MI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Among these altered genes, IRS1 was prominently decreased, which was validated by quantitative PCR (qPCR) and immunoblots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F and G</xref>); however, the levels of other factors involved in glucose uptake (<italic>Insr</italic>, <italic>Slc2a4,</italic> and <italic>Slc2a1</italic>) were not significantly changed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F and G</xref>). As a result, the insulin pathway was blocked, as indicated by diminished phosphorylation of IRS1 and AKT in response to insulin stimulation after 4 week MI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). More importantly, cardiac insulin resistance is a feature of human HF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aroor et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Riehle and Abel, 2016</xref>), and IRS1, but not IRS2, was found to be downregulated in failing human hearts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>). In line with observations from mouse and human heart samples, IRS1 transcript level and protein expression were both decreased in adult rat cardiomyocytes (ARCMs) under prolonged hypoxic (1.5% O<sub>2</sub>) stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J and K</xref>); however, the levels of <italic>Insr</italic>, <italic>Slc2a4</italic> and <italic>Slc2a1</italic> were unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>). SLC2A4 is the most abundant glucose transporter in adult cardiomyocytes residing in intracellular vesicles under basal condition. It translocates to the plasma membrane to facilitate insulin-dependent glucose entering cardiomyocytes in response to insulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cook et al., 2010</xref>). Intriguingly, insulin-stimulated plasma membrane-enriched SLC2A4 was significantly lower under long-term hypoxic condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L</xref>). These data suggest that downregulated IRS1 could be causative for impaired insulin-dependent glucose pathway in ischemic hearts.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>IRS1 is downregulated in failing hearts and prolonged hypoxia-stressed cardiomyocytes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Experimental design of male C57BL/6N mice subject to 4w-MI.

Among three potential cardiac-abundant miRNAs (<italic>mir128-3p</italic>, <italic>mir144-3p</italic> and <italic>mir145-5p</italic>) targeting <italic>Irs1</italic> 3’UTR, only <italic>mir128-3p</italic> displayed upregulation in the myocardium of long-term MI-induced failing hearts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). In situ hybridization of <italic>mir128-3p</italic> further confirmed an increased signal in ischemic myocardium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Consistently, increased <italic>mir128-3p</italic> was detected in ARCMs treated with prolonged hypoxia for 4–6 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Mir128 is an intronic miRNA, which localizes in two gene <italic>loci</italic> in human, rat, and mouse: mir128-1 in <italic>R3hdm1</italic> and mir128-2 in <italic>Arpp21</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). To investigate which of the gene <italic>loci</italic> is regulated under ischemic condition, we evaluated the transcripts of these two primary forms of mir128 (<italic>Pri-miR-128–1</italic> and <italic>Pri-mir128-2</italic>). Endogenous <italic>Pri-mir128-1</italic> level was augmented in sustained MI-induced failing hearts; however, no change of <italic>Pri-mir128-2</italic> was detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Consistently, <italic>Pri-mir128-1</italic> was increased in ARCMs stressed by 4 and 6 hr hypoxia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>). Next, we evaluated whether <italic>mir128-3p</italic> inhibits <italic>Irs1</italic> expression. The seed sequence of <italic>mir128-3p</italic> is highly conserved among mouse, rat, and human (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). In silico screening detected two potential binding sites in the 3’UTR of human <italic>IRS1</italic>, one of which is highly conserved across mammalian species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). <italic>IRS1</italic> 3’UTR luciferase reporter assay was performed to confirm <italic>IRS1</italic> as a direct target of <italic>mir128-3p</italic> in H9C2 cardiomyocytes. The validated <italic>mir128-3p</italic> mimic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5A</xref>) caused a decrease in luciferase activity with respect to the control plasmid; however, mutations that disrupt base pairing between <italic>mir128-3p</italic> and native <italic>IRS1</italic> 3’UTR upheld the luciferase expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). More convincingly, enforced <italic>mir128-3p</italic> reduced both transcript and protein levels of IRS1 in ARCMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I and J</xref>). Conversely, <italic>IRS1</italic> 3’UTR luciferase activity was enhanced by eliminating hypoxia-induced endogenous <italic>mir128-3p</italic> using validated <italic>mir128-3p</italic> antagomir (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K</xref>). As anticipated, antagomir maintained IRS1 expression in ARCMs albeit exposure of prolonged hypoxia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2L and M</xref>). Furthermore, we assessed whether manipulation of <italic>mir128-3p</italic> levels could affect glucose intake in cardiomyocytes. <italic>Mir128-3p</italic> mimic impeded insulin-stimulated glucose uptake (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2N</xref>); on the contrary, antagomir showed retained glucose enter into ARCMs under hypoxia for 6 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2O</xref>). Taken together, these data reveal that sustained hypoxic circumstance triggers upregulation of <italic>mir128-3p</italic>, which eventually recognizes and binds to <italic>IRS1</italic> 3’UTR. Consequently, reduced IRS1 may cause impaired insulin-dependent glucose uptake in cardiomyocytes.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Hypoxia-upregulates <italic>mir128-3p</italic> and degrades <italic>Irs1</italic>.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Mature <italic>mir128-3p</italic> was increased in 4w-MI myocardium (N = 6–8 mice).

Intronic miRNA can be transcribed along with its host gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Saini et al., 2007</xref>). However, the promoter region localized 1.5 kbp downstream from transcription start site (TSS) of human <italic>R3hdm1</italic> exon1 did not respond to hypoxia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). By further screening, <italic>Pri-mir128-1</italic> promoter luciferase reporter assay targeting another putative TSS located between exon1 and exon2 of <italic>R3hdm1</italic> illustrated that only long-term hypoxia (4 and 6 hr) promoted transcription of <italic>Pri-mir128-1</italic> in H9C2 cardiomyocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Using Ensembl and UCSC Genome Browser, we found that there are CEBP consensus binding sites in this region, which are well conserved across species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Interestingly, cardiac-abundant <italic>Cebpb</italic> (encoding CEBPβ), but not <italic>Cebpa</italic> (encoding CEBPα), was decreased in C57BL/6N mouse hearts subject to prolonged ischemia for four weeks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Similarly, <italic>Cebpb</italic> was also reduced by long-standing hypoxic stress in ARCMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). CEBPβ is known as a critical co-transcription factor to activate or repress metabolic genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">van der Krieken et al., 2015</xref>). We hypothesized that CEBPβ (LAP isoform, the most dominant and functioning isoform of CEBPβ) acts to transcriptionally repress <italic>mir128-3p</italic>, which was supported by <italic>CEBPβ</italic> overexpression minimizing <italic>Pri-mir128-1</italic> and <italic>mir128-3p</italic> expression, and consequently retaining <italic>Irs1</italic> transcript despite prolonged hypoxia, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3C</xref>). Conversely, rising <italic>Pri-mir128-1</italic> was detected in <italic>Cebpb</italic>-knockdown ARCMs in response to short-term hypoxia for 2 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>), which consolidated a negative correlation between <italic>Cebpb</italic> and <italic>Pri-mir128-1</italic> in hypoxic conditions.

Interestingly, we detected decreased MAPK7 in 4 week MI-induced failing hearts in C57BL/6N mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Consistently, MAPK7 was also declined in ARCMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>) or neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (NRCMs) upon prolonged hypoxia for 6 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>). Of note, phosphorylation of MAPK7 was increased by short-term hypoxia, while abrogated by long-term stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>). It has been demonstrated that MAPK7 is related to the expression of IRS1 in the hearts under diabetic stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liu et al., 2017</xref>), we thereafter focused our attention on the plausible link of MAPK7 to CEBPβ and <italic>mir128-3p</italic> under hypoxic condition. Indeed, decreased <italic>Cebpb</italic> along with increased <italic>mir128-3p</italic> was shortly detected in <italic>Mapk7</italic>-deficient ARCMs after 2 hr hypoxia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J</xref>); however, MAPK7 overexpression preserved <italic>Cebpb</italic> and <italic>mir128-3p</italic> in a normal range even under long-term hypoxia for 6 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3K</xref>). The finding that MAPK7-mediated CEBPβ negatively regulates <italic>mir128-3p</italic> was further evidenced by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-quantitative PCR (qPCR) assay. Short-term hypoxia promoted binding of CEBPβ to <italic>Pri-mir128-1</italic> promoter regions between exon1 and exon2 of <italic>R3hdm1</italic> containing consensus CEBP binding sequence; however, <italic>Mapk7</italic> knockdown led to a remarkable reduction of association at various putative binding regions (−429 to −259; −2550 to −2383; −4047 to −3873 and −4176 to −4026 from intronic TSS) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3L</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5</xref>). These results indicate that MAPK7 activation is likely required for CEBPβ negative regulation of <italic>mir128-3p</italic> during short-term hypoxia; on the contrary, MAPK7 abrogation due to long-lasting hypoxia may lead to defective CEBPβ repression on <italic>mir128-3p</italic>.</p><p>Next, we made a further endeavor to explore how MAPK7 exerts its positive action on CEBPβ expression and activation.

Acute hypoxia-triggered CREB1 phosphorylation was inhibited by <italic>Mapk7</italic> knockdown in ARCMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s6">Figure 3—figure supplement 6</xref>). Moreover, immunofluorescent staining confirmed that short-term hypoxia-induced nuclei accumulation of activated CREB1 and CEBPβ; however, their signals were diminished as a result of <italic>Mapk7</italic> knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3M</xref>). Consistent observations were gained in NRCMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s7">Figure 3—figure supplement 7</xref>), indicating the potential relevance of activated CREB1 and CEBPβ nuclear translocation. CREB1 is able to bind and positively facilitate CEBPβ expression and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zhang et al., 2004</xref>). Immunoprecipitation demonstrated that 2 hr hypoxia resulted in the physical association of phosphorylated CREB1 and CEBPβ; however, this affinity was unseen in the absence of MAPK7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3N</xref>). To further evaluate whether CREB1, as a downstream effector of MAPK7, is also required for maintaining CEBPβ expression, we knocked down <italic>Creb1</italic> in rat cardiomyocytes, which displayed decreased CEBPβ and reduced IRS1 expression following 2 hr hypoxia exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3O</xref>). The same effects detected from <italic>Mapk7</italic>-knockdown cells were rescued by CREB1 overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3O</xref>). In summary, these data unveil that MAPK7 is required for activation of CREB1, thereafter upregulating CEBPβ as a transcriptional repressor of <italic>mir128-3p</italic> in response to short-term hypoxia.

Furthermore, cardiac MAPK7 disruption contributed to larger infarct area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>) as well as more reactive myocardial fibrosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Hypertrophic growth in the ischemic hearts is a compensatory response after acute MI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Olivetti et al., 2000</xref>).

Meanwhile, although serum cTnI level 24 hr after ligation was not affected, LDH amount one week post-ligation suggested an alleviated cardiac injury by MAPK7 re-establishment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Infarct area, interstitial fibrosis, and apoptosis rate in the non-infarct region were all reduced by AAV9-<italic>Mapk7</italic> administration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D and F</xref>), while the hypertrophic response was recovered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B and C</xref>).

RNA-seq data indicated distorted cardiac glucose pathways from non-infarct area of the failing hearts suffering from prolonged non-reperfused hypoxia, supporting the concept that cardiac insulin resistance contributes to the onset and development of heart failure in ischemic circumstances. Although there are concerns on whether the heart is able to endure the strain of obtaining energy predominantly from glycolysis for a long-term, sustained provision of glucose is particularly beneficial to the continual energy requirement of the heart during ischemia and can serve as a potential adjuvant treatment with current clinical interventions after MI.</p><p>Recent studies have described a causative relation between cardiac insulin resistance and cardiac dysfunction in pathological conditions, independent of diabetes mellitus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ciccarelli et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Riehle and Abel, 2016</xref>). In particular, cardiac insulin resistance manifests as insufficient IRS-facilitated glucose uptake and compromised AKT-involved cell protection in the myocardium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Guo and Guo, 2017</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Qi et al. (2013)</xref> reported that mice with myocardial loss of both IRS1 and IRS2 die at the ages of 6–8 weeks due to HF under unstressed condition. It was also reported that cardiomyocyte-specific double knockout of IRS1 and IRS2 leads to cardiac dysfunction in early life by augmenting autophagy in neonatal heart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Riehle et al., 2013</xref>). Our study elicits that reduced IRS1 in the low-flow myocardial region contributed to accentuated cardiac injury, enlarged infarct area and impaired cardiac contractility, which could be the mechanistic explanation of HF onset and development during chronic stage post-MI. Consistently, we demonstrate that IRS1 deficiency in cardiomyocytes led to cytosolic retention of SLC2A4 and blunted ATP production, as well as intensified cell death. Of note, although IRS1 and IRS2 are homologous, they have distinct functions in various tissues. IRS2-mediated insulin pathway in liver and cancer cells is upregulated in hypoxic condition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mardilovich and Shaw, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wei et al., 2013</xref>). However, IRS2 was not altered by ischemia/hypoxia in the cardiomyocytes, which even failed to compensate the harmful effects due to IRS1 reduction. The role and regulation of IRS2 in the myocardium will be further studied. Equally important, insulin-independent glucose uptake via SLC2A1 is considered as an essential compensatory factor for basal glucose entry. Several studies on mammals have detected upregulation of SLC2A1 at various durations of MI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brosius et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jóhannsson et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tardy-Cantalupi et al., 1999</xref>). What is more, the hearts with SLC2A1 overexpression decrease aging-associated susceptibility to ischemic injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Luptak et al., 2007</xref>). However, we did not detect a significant change of cardiac SLC2A1 in ischemia or hypoxia, indicating that the physiological level of SLC2A1 is insufficient to provide enough energy for maintenance of cardiac function under MI stress. These findings affirm the importance of strategies aiming to prevent cardiac insulin resistance as a potential therapy post-MI.</p><p><italic>Mir128</italic>, dominantly expressed in neurons, negatively regulates stem cell-derived neurogenesis and neural system development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Krichevsky et al., 2006</xref>). In the heart, <italic>mir128</italic> inhibits postnatal cardiomyocytes proliferation by impeding cell cycle-related genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Huang et al., 2018</xref>). In this report, insulin resistance was at least in part caused by augmented <italic>mir128-3p</italic> in the myocardium in response to ischemic stress. With regard to the reduction of Irs1 at transcript and protein levels, <italic>mir128-3p</italic> was identified to directly target <italic>Irs1</italic> 3’UTR (no <italic>mir128-3p</italic> binding site was found on <italic>Irs2</italic> 3’UTR) and stimulate its degradation. Eliminating <italic>mir128-3p</italic> was able to retain insulin-dependent glucose uptake despite facing hypoxic stress. Therefore, this study, for the first time, reveals that <italic>mir128-3p</italic> appears to play a role in cardiac glucose metabolism. In addition, since glucose utilization reinforces cardiomyocytes proliferation in early developmental stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">de Carvalho et al., 2017</xref>), our findings may also provide another explanation for the previous observations that inhibition of <italic>mir128-3p</italic> enhances postnatal and adult cardiac regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Huang et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Next, we have dissected the molecular basis underlying prolonged ischemia-upregulated <italic>mir128-3p</italic> in the heart. CEBPβ, primarily studied in liver and adipose tissue, modulates the transcription of a number of genes involved in metabolic regulation. Particularly, CEBPβ disruption results in dysregulation of genes facilitating glucose uptake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">van der Krieken et al., 2015</xref>). In the heart, CEBPβ has been initially reported to repress exercise-induced cardiomyocyte growth and proliferation by negative regulation of serum response factor and ED-rich carboxy-terminal domain 4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boström et al., 2010</xref>). Contradictorily, CEBPβ is considered to promote phenylephrine-triggered cardiomyocyte growth via inhibition of nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zou et al., 2014</xref>). Of note, there are three isoforms of CEBPβ (LAP*, LAP and LIP) differentially expressed in various tissues, being translated from a single mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">van der Krieken et al., 2015</xref>). LAP isoform was predominantly detected in the myocardium in this work, which is consistent with previous observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boström et al., 2010</xref>). A large number of studies describe CEBPβ (especially LAP isoform) as a transcriptional activator or repressor, including primary transcripts of miRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">van der Krieken et al., 2015</xref>). Multiple CEBP binding sites were found in promoter regions of <italic>Pri-mir128-1</italic>. Our study depicts that CEBPβ negatively regulates <italic>Pri-mir128-1</italic> in hypoxia, subsequently maintaining IRS1 expression. These findings corroborate that CEBPβ is involved in the regulation of cardiac metabolism.</p><p>We and others have revealed that cardiac MAPK7 (also known as ERK5) plays a protective role in response to pathological stresses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kimura et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Le et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Shishido et al., 2008</xref>). Especially, MAPK7 facilitates the action of carboxyl terminus of Hsc7 interacting protein E3 ligase after MI in diabetic condition, which favors cell survival by preventing mitochondria-associated apoptotic pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Le et al., 2012</xref>). It is acknowledged that MAPK7 mediates insulin sensitivity in adipocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhu et al., 2014</xref>); however, there is a lack of conclusive evidence that MAPK7 is involved in myocardial insulin pathway regulation in the heart. This study once again highlights the cardioprotective role of MAPK7 in the ischemic myocardium. MAPK7 disruption resulted in a reduction of IRS1 in response to ischemia, akin to the previous observations in <italic>Mapk7</italic>-knockout diabetic hearts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liu et al., 2017</xref>). As a consequence, distorted insulin pathway made the heart more vulnerable to cardiac dysfunction post-MI. In contrast, AAV9 gene-delivered MAPK7 restoration in <italic>Mapk7</italic>-cko mice maintained IRS1 expression and limited cardiac injury under ischemic insult.</p><p>The current study has shown MAPK7 phosphorylation was boosted after short-term MI, however, total MAPK7 expression declined in prolonged ischemia-stressed myocardium.Such an oscillation of phosphorylation and expression indicated that MAPK7 activation might manifest a biological function during acute hypoxia, while MAPK7 loss triggers the downstream signaling defects. Of note, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Shishido et al. (2008)</xref> reported that MAPK7 phosphorylation is inhibited by ubiquitin-SUMOylation modification seven days after MI, particularly in type 1 diabetes. These discrepancies likely originate from the distinct backgrounds of experimental mice and the extent of ischemic injury. On the other hand, we have previously unveiled that MAPK7 expression is reduced in myocardium by protease-related degradation in high-fat-diet-induced diabetes mellitus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liu et al., 2017</xref>). However, the mechanism whereby MAPK7 was downregulated in the ischemic myocardium after prolonged stress remains to be elucidated.</p><p>Our previous studies have revealed that MAPK7 functions through activation of MEF2 under hemodynamic or diabetic stresses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kimura et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liu et al., 2017</xref>); however, the MEF2 family was not regulated by MAPK7 in hypoxia. CREB1, as another downstream effector of MAPK7, controls energy metabolism by adjusting key transcriptional regulators in various cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lin et al., 2005</xref>). Our current findings agreed with the observations that CREB1 is activated in response to short-term ischemic/hypoxic stress to execute an anti-apoptotic function in cardiomyocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Marais et al., 2008</xref>). As such, cardiac MAPK7 governs distinctive signaling cascades in face of distinct pathological stresses. Activated CREB1 acts on CRE-like binding elements found in CEBPβ proximal promoter to induce its expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zhang et al., 2004</xref>). This study illustrates that upon activation, MAPK7 promotes the association of CREB1 and CEBPβ. It has been shown that CREB1 and CEBPβ interaction can lead to transactivation and transcriptional regulation in macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ross et al., 2001</xref>). However; how downregulated CEBPβ expression coincided with declined MAPK7-CREB1 under hypoxic condition will be further investigated.</p><p>Interestingly, CEBPβ expression was not altered by MAPK7 disruption in normoxia; moreover, its overexpression did not affect heart function at basal level. These observations suggest that CEBPβ may be dispensable for IRS1-mediated pathways in unstressed situations. However, the functional evidence that deleterious effects in <italic>Mapk7</italic>-cko mice post-MI were salvaged by CEBPβ overexpression affirms that CEBPβ cascade is responsible for maintenance of cardiac insulin sensitivity under ischemic condition. Noticeably, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Huang et al. (2012)</xref> have delineated that CEBPβ mediates reactivation of embryonic epicardial gene program and that intra-pericardial injection of adenovirus expressing dysfunctional CEBPβ confers resistance to ischemia-reperfusion injury. Therefore, whether CEBPβ is a feasible target for treating heart disease needs further in-depth examination.</p><p>It is well established that ischemia provokes cardiac hypertrophy, including compensatory hypertrophy and transitioned hypertrophy to heart failure depending on duration and extent of stress. We demonstrate that smaller cardiomyocyte size was observed in the non-infarct area of <italic>Mapk7</italic>-cko hearts compared to <italic>Mapk7<sup>flox</sup></italic> hearts subject to LAD ligation for one week. Similarly, cardiac-specific <italic>Irs1/2</italic> double knockout mice elicit thinning of the cardiac muscle walls associated with more cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Qi et al., 2013</xref>), which is assumed to be a feature of failed compensatory hypertrophy. Hence, these observations expand the mechanistic explanation for <italic>Mapk7</italic>-deficient hearts displaying more vulnerability to HF progression in response to pathological stresses.</p><p>The myocardium has no ATP reserves, instead, exhibits a capability of storing fuel in the form of glycogen and triacylglycerol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ritterhoff and Tian, 2017</xref>). Human cardiomyopathy is partially attributable to an imbalance of glycogen synthesis and utilization upon exposure to pathological stresses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adeva-Andany et al., 2016</xref>). Glucose derived from glycogenolysis may provide energy supply for cardiac contraction in a low-flow condition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Schaefer and Ramasamy, 1997</xref>). RNA-seq detected decreased GYS1 and GSK3Β in ischemic myocardium after prolonged ischemia, which may imply an additional mechanism exacerbating ischemic injury. In addition, MAPK7 disruption led to a trend of lower glycogen content in myocardium post-MI. This effect is plausibly caused by over-usage of stored glycogen due to MAPK7 loss-induced defective glucose supply, as well as faulty insulin-mediated glycogen synthesis. However, whether MAPK7 is involved in the regulation of glycogen synthesis and utilization in the myocardium requires further investigation.</p><p>Foremost, based on the consistent results gained from mature human iPSC-CMs under hypoxia, the human-relevant evidence of MAPK7-mediated double negative signaling regulation on IRS1 provided new insights into the therapeutic options for cardiac insulin resistance. Interestingly, it has been well accepted that silencing miRNAs have therapeutic potential in clinical settings. Using a long-lasting cardiac tough decoy RNA, we demonstrate that inhibition of upregulated endogenous <italic>mir128-3p</italic> counteracted ischemic injuries. These observations are in line with a recent study that <italic>mir128</italic> inhibition attenuates cardiomyocytes death and is beneficial for cardiac repair after ischemia/reperfusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Huang et al., 2018</xref>). The evidence that <italic>mir128-3p</italic> directly degrades <italic>Irs1</italic> significantly advances our knowledge on molecular regulation of insulin signaling pathway in ischemic myocardium. Notably, IRS1 is dysregulated in hearts and other tissues in diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lavin et al., 2016</xref>). As such, this study hypothetically suggests that targeting <italic>mir128-3p</italic> has therapeutic potential for insulin resistance in or beyond the heart, as prevalently observed in diabetes mellitus.</p><p>In summary, we have uncovered a protective role of MAPK7-CEBPβ signaling cascade under ischemic insult by negative regulation of <italic>mir128-3p</italic> to maintain cardiac IRS1-dependent insulin sensitivity. Long-term ischemia-induced MAPK7 deficiency may account for defective CEBPβ repression on <italic>mir128-3p</italic>, consequently leading to <italic>Irs1</italic> degradation. Either preserving MAPK7-CEBPβ or directly impinging <italic>mir128-3p</italic> appears to be a potential approach to mitigate cardiac injury and could be an adjunctive treatment option in combination with surgical interventions for patients with ischemic heart disease.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>A list of key resources can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> – Key resources table.</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Study approval</title><p>All animal studies were performed in accordance with the United Kingdom Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 under the Home Office licence P3A97F3D1, and were approved by the University of Manchester Ethics Committee.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Animals models</title><p>All mice and rats were housed in a pathogen-free facility at the University of Manchester.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Milica Radisic as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Edward Morrisey as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Ruiping Xiao (Reviewer #2); Tingsen Benson Lim (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This is a comprehensive and a very thorough manuscript focusing on elucidating reasons that underlie insulin resistance post myocardial ischemia such as MI. The authors used post-MI mouse hearts, neonatal and adult rat cardiomyocytes as well as human iPSC derived cardiomyocytes to demonstrate the central role of Insulin Receptor Substrate 1 downregulation by a novel micro RNA, miR128-3p. They thoroughly investigated both upstream events and downstream consequences that result in lower availability of GLUT4 transporter on the cardiomyocyte surface that overall decreases glucose uptake after ischemia and fails to support mostly glycolytic metabolism in these cardiomyocytes</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Addressing the below comments will enable the authors to improve the manuscript further:</p><p>1) The authors should provide more evidence on the causal relationship between the upregulation of miR128-3p and downregulation of IRS-1 in response to ischemic injury. In Figure 1J, IRS-1 mRNA was decreased 6 h after hypoxia in cardiomyocytes. If the reduced IRS-1 was caused by miR128-3p, miR128-3p should increase before that. However, in Figure 2E, the authors only show miR128-3p was increased 6 h after hypoxia. An earlier time point should be investigated.</p><p>2) Although most of the data are very solid quite consistent. Some data in the manuscript showed internal inconsistence. In Figures 5B and 6B, the AAV-GFP group exhibited significant decreased cardiac function 1 wk after myocardial infarction. However, in Figure 4B, there was no change of the Flox group after the same period after infarction. Please explain.</p><p>3) The infarcted hearts are of great heterogeneity. Which part of the hearts was analyzed for insulin sensitivity and the related signaling, ischemic, adjacent or remote zone? Why? Please specify.</p><p>4) Immunofluorescence staining is not necessarily ideal quantitative measurement of CREB and CEBPβ in nuclei (Figure 3M and Figure 3—figure supplement 7). Fluorescence staining can be subjective and with a measurement of just 5 nuclei is clearly insufficient and inconclusive. Also, background noise can be observed for both CREB and CEBPβ staining. An immunoblot, which the authors have duly performed (Figure 3O), will suffice. However, an appropriate control with siScramble is missing with the experiments performed on Figure 3O.</p><p>5) Relative heart weight and CM size were significantly increased 1-w post MI (Figure 4—figure supplement 1B and C) but unchanged at the same condition in Figure 5—figure supplement 1. Can the authors explained this discrepancy?</p><p>6) The authors showed when Erk5-cko was rescued with AAV9-ERK5. However, the level of ERK5 was restored to a physiological level close to but not at a higher level to Erk-flox control. This piece of data is important because, physiologically, the Erk5-cko AAV9-ERK5 mice would be akin to a wildtype or Erk-flox control and would respond to MI as a wildtype status. However, the data in Figure 5 showed attenuation of MI in the Erk5-cko AAV9-ERK5 mice but made no comparison to the Erk5-flox control which may be important.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This is a comprehensive and a very thorough manuscript focusing on elucidating reasons that underlie insulin resistance post myocardial ischemia such as MI. The authors used post-MI mouse hearts, neonatal and adult rat cardiomyocytes as well as human iPSC derived cardiomyocytes to demonstrate the central role of Insulin Receptor Substrate 1 downregulation by a novel micro RNA, miR128-3p. They thoroughly investigated both upstream events and downstream consequences that result in lower availability of GLUT4 transporter on the cardiomyocyte surface that overall decreases glucose uptake after ischemia and fails to support mostly glycolytic metabolism in these cardiomyocytes.</p><p>Briefly, the authors elucidated the central role of ERK5 that leads to activation of CREB followed by activation of CEBPβ that then block activity of miR128-3p which enables IRS1 expression and sufficient glucose utilization. Under the conditions of prolonged hypoxia, ERK5 is lost leading to miR128-3p activation and ultimately IRS1 loss. This new knowledge could potentially lead to the development of new therapies, when applied in the right window post-MI, through e.g. application of AntimiR128 as the authors have shown here. However, ultimately re-establishment of healthy lipid metabolism in these CMs might be the most desired target.</p><p>Overall, in the spirit of <italic>eLife</italic> which is not to request un-necessary revisions, I think this is a pretty complete story which is suitable for publication.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In the current manuscript, Ruiz-Velasco et al. provided compelling evidence that have been generated with state-of-the-art techniques on the role of miR128-3p-mediated cardiac insulin resistance in myocardial ischemic injury. They show that ERK5/CEBPβ/ miR128-3p was enhanced in response to cardiac ischemic insult, which subsequently down-regulated IRS-1 and induced insulin resistance. The findings are novel, important, and of great clinical relevance.</p><p>I have the following concerns.</p><p>1) The authors should provide more evidence on the causal relationship between the upregulation of miR128-3p and downregulation of IRS-1 in response to ischemic injury.

Mechanistically, they demonstrated miR-128-3p targets and degrade Irs1 and that ERK5 mediated CEBPβ transcriptionally represses miR-128-3p under hypoxia. More importantly, they showed AAV9 delivery of ERK5 or CEBPβ or anti-miR-128-3p impeded cardiac injury post-MI in vivo, thereby, concluding that targeting miR-128-3p alleviates cardiac insulin resistance and may impedes the progression of heart failure post-ischemia. They also looked into the human-relevant for the ERK5-CEBPβ signaling pathway negative regulation of miR128-3p in response to hypoxia through iPSC-CMs and showed that the pathway preserves IRS1 expression through repression of miR128-3p suggesting beneficial effects on the insulin dependent pathway in human iPSC-CMs under hypoxic condition. Overall, the authors have done an impressive work on elucidating the ERK5-CEBPβ signaling cascade negative regulation of miR128-3p under ischemia/hypoxic condition. The manuscript is well designed and written with comprehensive data. The results are interesting and potentially important to our understanding on myocardial insulin resistance and ischemia-induced heart failure. However, I do have concerns listed below which I hope the authors are able to address.</p><p>1) I do not necessarily agree using immunofluorescence staining as a quantitative measurement of CREB and CEBPβ in nuclei (Figure 3M and Figure 3—figure supplement 7). Fluorescence staining can be subjective and with a measurement of just 5 nuclei is clearly insufficient and inconclusive. Also, background noise can be observed for both CREB and CEBPβ staining. I would suggest to deflect Figure 3M to supplementary or be removed. An immunoblot, which the authors have duly performed (Figure 3O), will suffice. However, an appropriate control with siScramble is missing with the experiments performed on Figure 3O.</p><p>2) Relative heart weight and CM size were significantly increased 1-w post MI (Figure 4—figure supplement 1B and C) but unchanged at the same condition in Figure 5—figure supplement 1. Can the authors explained this discrepancy?</p><p>3) The authors showed when Erk5-cko was rescued with AAV9-ERK5. However, the level of ERK5 was restored to a physiological level close to but not at a higher level to Erk-flox control. This piece of data is important because, physiologically, the Erk5-cko AAV9-ERK5 mice would be akin to a wildtype or Erk-flox control and would respond to MI as a wildtype status. However, the data in Figure 5 showed attenuation of MI in the Erk5-cko AAV9-ERK5 mice but made no comparison to the Erk5-flox control which I think is important.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.54298.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Addressing the below comments will enable the authors to improve the manuscript further:</p><p>1) The authors should provide more evidence on the causal relationship between the upregulation of miR128-3p and downregulation of IRS-1 in response to ischemic injury.

The authors used post-MI mouse hearts, neonatal and adult rat cardiomyocytes as well as human iPSC derived cardiomyocytes to demonstrate the central role of Insulin Receptor Substrate 1 downregulation by a novel micro RNA, miR128-3p. They thoroughly investigated both upstream events and downstream consequences that result in lower availability of GLUT4 transporter on the cardiomyocyte surface that overall decreases glucose uptake after ischemia and fails to support mostly glycolytic metabolism in these cardiomyocytes.</p><p>Briefly, the authors elucidated the central role of ERK5 that leads to activation of CREB followed by activation of CEBPβ that then block activity of miR128-3p which enables IRS1 expression and sufficient glucose utilization. Under the conditions of prolonged hypoxia, ERK5 is lost leading to miR128-3p activation and ultimately IRS1 loss. This new knowledge could potentially lead to the development of new therapies, when applied in the right window post-MI, through e.g. application of AntimiR128 as the authors have shown here. However, ultimately re-establishment of healthy lipid metabolism in these CMs might be the most desired target.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the scientific comments. As we know, fatty acid (70%) and glucose (30%) are the two main source of energy in the cardiomyocytes, both of which are essential for maintaining heart function in response to various physiological and pathological stresses. In the situation of hypoxia, glucose provides a small amount of ATP by glycolysis in the myocardium, which becomes a paramount compensatory energy source during short-term oxygen deprivation. We completely agree with the reviewer's comments that modulating fatty acid utilization will also be a pivotal way to preserve cardiac function. Actually, our RNA-Seq data also detected the abnormalities of genes participating in fatty acid metabolism. However, the current study is focusing on the investigation of importance of cardiac insulin sensitivity during short-term ischemic stress. We do not exclude the significance of fatty acid metabolism in such a condition, instead, we believe that keeping the balance of fatty acid and glucose metabolism in the fact of disease for various durations is vital for heart performance. The more comprehensive understanding of either fatty acid or glucose utilization will be explored in future studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Overall, in the spirit of eLife which is not to request un-necessary revisions, I think this is a pretty complete story which is suitable for publication.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[…] I have the following concerns.</p><p>1) The authors should provide more evidence on the causal relationship between the upregulation of miR128-3p and downregulation of IRS-1 in response to ischemic injury.
