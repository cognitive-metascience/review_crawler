We previously demonstrated that RSPOs 2 and 3 potentiate WNT/β-catenin signaling in cells lacking leucine-rich repeat-containing G-protein coupled receptors (LGRs) 4, 5 and 6 (Lebensohn and Rohatgi, 2018). We now show that heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) act as alternative co-receptors for RSPO3 using a combination of ligand mutagenesis and ligand engineering. Mutations in RSPO3 residues predicted to contact HSPGs impair its signaling capacity. Conversely, the HSPG-binding domains of RSPO3 can be entirely replaced with an antibody that recognizes heparan sulfate (HS) chains attached to multiple HSPGs without diminishing WNT-potentiating activity in cultured cells and intestinal organoids. A genome-wide screen for mediators of RSPO3 signaling in cells lacking LGRs 4, 5 and 6 failed to reveal other receptors. We conclude that HSPGs are RSPO co-receptors that potentiate WNT signaling in the presence and absence of LGRs.</p></abstract><kwd-group

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>R-spondins (RSPOs) are vertebrate-specific secreted proteins that amplify signaling through the WNT/β-catenin pathway, a cell-cell communication system that regulates tissue patterning during embryonic development and regenerative responses in adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">de Lau et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">de Lau et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nusse and Clevers, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Steinhart and Angers, 2018</xref>). Mutations that disrupt the RSPO signaling circuit cause structural birth defects, exemplified by limb truncations, lung hypoplasia, craniofacial malformations and cardiovascular defects seen in humans and mice carrying mutations in <italic>RSPO2</italic> and <italic>RSPO3</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aoki et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aoki et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bell et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nam et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Szenker-Ravi et al., 2018</xref>). In adults, RSPOs function as niche-derived signals required for the renewal of epithelial stem cells in multiple tissues, including the intestine, skin and bone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">de Lau et al., 2014</xref>). Elucidating the mechanisms that mediate the reception and transduction of RSPO signals will further our understanding of these fundamental developmental and homeostatic processes, and is essential to harnessing the considerable therapeutic potential of this pathway to enhance regenerative responses.</p><p>The prevailing paradigm of RSPO signaling holds that they amplify responses to WNT ligands by simultaneously binding to two types of receptors at the cell surface: one of three leucine-rich repeat-containing G-protein coupled receptors (LGRs), LGRs 4, 5 or 6 (hereafter referred to jointly as LGRs), and one of two transmembrane E3 ubiquitin ligases, ZNRF3 or RNF43 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carmon et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">de Lau et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Glinka et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gong et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Peng et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Peng et al., 2013b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ruffner et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zebisch et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zebisch and Jones, 2015</xref>). ZNRF3/RNF43 reduce cell-surface levels of WNT receptors, Frizzled (FZD) and LDL Receptor Related Protein (LRP) 5/6 proteins, by direct ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hao et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Koo et al., 2012</xref>). RSPOs amplify WNT signaling by inducing the endocytosis of ZNRF3/RNF43, which leads to an increase in the number of WNT receptors at the plasma membrane and consequently an increase in sensitivity to WNT ligands. RSPOs were thought to increase WNT receptor levels only in specific cell types that express LGRs, such as intestinal stem cells, thus allowing the strength of the response to WNT to be tightly controlled in time and space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">de Lau et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>We and others recently made the unexpected discovery that this paradigm is incomplete: RSPO2 and RSPO3 can potentiate WNT signaling in the absence of LGRs 4, 5 and 6, previously considered obligate high-affinity receptors for RSPOs. Our previous article in <italic>eLife</italic> demonstrated that RSPO2 and RSPO3 can still potentiate WNT signaling in LGR4/5/6<sup>KO</sup> human haploid cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lebensohn and Rohatgi, 2018</xref>). Similarly, RSPO2 and RSPO3 can amplify WNT-mediated signaling in <italic>Lgr4/5/6</italic> triple-knockout immortalized fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Szenker-Ravi et al., 2018</xref>) and RSPO2 can potentiate WNT signaling in 293T cells lacking LGR4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Park et al., 2018</xref>). This ‘LGR-independent’ mode of signaling is particularly relevant to RSPO-related birth defects because it appears to be the dominant mode of signaling during development of the limbs, lungs and cardiovascular system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Szenker-Ravi et al., 2018</xref>). Mice carrying loss-of-function mutations in LGRs 4, 5 and 6 (<italic>Lgr4/5/6</italic><sup>-/-</sup>) do not show either the limb truncations, lung hypoplasia or craniofacial abnormalities observed in humans and mouse embryos lacking <italic>Rspo2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aoki et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bell et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Szenker-Ravi et al., 2018</xref>), or the vascular and associated placental defects observed in mouse embryos lacking <italic>Rspo3</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aoki et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>These results raise a pressing question: are there alternative receptors that transduce RSPO signals in the absence of LGRs? RSPOs contain tandem furin-like domains, FU1 and FU2, that interact with ZNRF3/RNF43 and LGRs, respectively. They also contain a thrombospondin type 1 (TSP) domain and a basic region (BR) (we refer to them together as the TSP/BR domain) that interact with heparin and heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ayadi, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nam et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ohkawara et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ren et al., 2018</xref>).

This increase in potency may be related to the previous observation that some SDCs inhibit WNT/β-catenin signaling through regulation of LRP6 and RSPO3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Astudillo et al., 2014</xref>). Finally, disrupting EXTL3, predicted to globally block HS chain biosynthesis, impaired signaling by both proteins to the greatest extent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and C</xref>).</p><p>Overall, disrupting different HSPGs led to a qualitatively similar effect on signaling by WT RSPO3 and RSPO3 ΔTSP/BR HS20, with GPC3 disruption having no effect, GPC4 or PIGL disruption causing a modest reduction in signaling potency and EXTL3 disruption causing the greatest reduction in signaling potency. These results are most consistent with the model that RSPO3 ΔTSP/BR HS20, like WT RSPO3, can signal in a redundant manner via either GPCs, SDCs or another HSPG by engaging their HS chains rather than their protein cores.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>HSPGs potentiate RSPO3-supported small intestinal organoid growth</title><p>Given the substantial contribution made by the interaction between the TSP/BR domain or HS20 and HSPGs to LGR-dependent signaling in haploid cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2C</xref>), it was important to test whether this interaction also mediates RSPO signaling in a more physiological context.

The TSP/BR domain can bind to HS chains, but its role in amplifying WNT/β-catenin signaling has remained uncertain. Initial studies showed that this domain was dispensable, since a fragment of RSPOs that contains only the FU1 and FU2 domains can amplify WNT/β-catenin signaling in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Glinka et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kazanskaya et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kim et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zebisch et al., 2013</xref>). Our previous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lebensohn and Rohatgi, 2018</xref>) and current work provides a clear function for the TSP/BR domain of RSPO3 in WNT/β-catenin signaling in vitro and ex vivo: (1) it is essential for signaling in the absence of LGRs and (2) it enhances signaling potency in the presence of LGRs in both cultured cells and intestinal organoids. In this report we focused on RSPO3, but we previously demonstrated that RSPO2 (but not RSPO1 or RSPO4) can also amplify WNT/β-catenin signaling in the absence of LGRs. It will be interesting to determine whether the TSP/BR domains of RSPO1 and RSPO4 can also enhance ligand potency, especially in light of the observation that only RSPO2 and RSPO3, but not RSPO1 or RSPO4, bind to SDC1-4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ohkawara et al., 2011</xref>). Perhaps the divergent biological functions of different RSPOs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">de Lau et al., 2012</xref>) is dictated by their ability to signal though HSPGs, LGRs or both. Importantly, we do not know how the RSPO concentrations in tissues compare to those typically used in in vitro culture systems, which can be arbitrarily high. Thus, the TSP/BR domain may be critical for certain RSPOs to potentiate WNT signaling in vivo, especially under regimes of limiting ligand concentration in tissues.</p><p>Until this study, it has been challenging to disentangle the role of HSPGs in mediating signaling through the core WNT/β-catenin pathway from their contribution to the amplification of WNT signaling by RSPOs. HSPGs and HS chains were initially implicated in the distribution, stability and potency of WNT ligands in studies from <italic>Drosophila</italic>, which lacks an RSPO signaling module for WNT amplification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baeg et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Reichsman et al., 1996</xref>). In those studies, HSPGs promoted WNT/β-catenin signaling by directly binding to WNT ligands. However, depletion of HS chains by the genetic disruption of enzymes required for their synthesis has also been shown to impair WNT/β-catenin signaling and associated responses in the mouse intestine, the mouse mammary gland and in multiple myeloma cells, all contexts in which RSPOs play prominent roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alexander et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ren et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yamamoto et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, a reduction in RSPO-potentiated WNT signaling caused by depletion of HSPGs can be due to a defect in WNT reception, RSPO reception or both. In fact, we showed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lebensohn et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lebensohn and Rohatgi, 2018</xref>) that impaired WNT reception is the reason why genes encoding proteins required for the biogenesis of GPCs, and GPC4, the most abundant GPC in HAP1 cells, were prominent hits in both of our RSPO screens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary files 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">5</xref>). Our present RSPO mutagenesis and engineering experiments, which leave the HSPG repertoire of cells intact and their role in WNT reception undisturbed, cleanly demonstrate that interactions with HSPGs are also required for RSPO reception.</p><p>How do HSPGs function during reception of RSPO ligands? HSPGs have been implicated in the function of many ligands (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sarrazin et al., 2011</xref>), including chemokines and growth factors that activate receptor tyrosine kinases, such as fibroblast growth factor (FGF). In these cases, HSPGs can function as co-receptors by either templating a ligand-receptor interaction (such as the one between FGF and its receptor) or by inducing a conformational change in the ligand that increases its ability to interact with receptors (such as the one induced in anti-thrombin). In both of these cases, exogenously added heparin (untethered to the cell surface, in contrast to the HS chains of HSPGs) would be predicted to promote receptor-ligand interactions. Alternatively, HSPGs can function as endocytic receptors to mediate ligand uptake and degradation in the lysosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Belting, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sarrazin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Williams and Fuki, 1997</xref>). Our results are more consistent with HSPGs functioning as endocytic receptors in RSPO signaling. First, exogenously added heparin inhibits, rather than promotes, RSPO signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lebensohn and Rohatgi, 2018</xref>). Second, the TSP/BR domain can be replaced by a non-native, HS-binding scFv, making steric effects or conformational changes unlikely. Instead, the mere interaction between RSPOs and HSPGs seems to be sufficient for signaling. Our results directly demonstrate that both WT RSPO3 and RSPO3 ΔTSP/BR HS20 can cause internalization and degradation of RNF43-Flag in cells lacking LGRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Since ZNRF3 and RNF43 are E3 ubiquitin ligases that negatively regulate WNT receptors, their clearance from the cell surface induced by RSPO3-HSPG interactions would be sufficient to enhance WNT signaling.</p><p>Our work also sheds light on the relative roles of HSPGs and LGRs in mediating signaling by different RSPO family members. Previous studies have proposed that the simultaneous binding of RSPOs to LGRs through the FU2 domain and to ZNRF3/RNF43 through the FU1 domain triggers the ubiquitination, endocytosis and degradation of ZNRF3/RNF43 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hao et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Koo et al., 2012</xref>). The affinity of the FU2 domain for LGRs is high (in the nM range) for all RSPOs, while the affinity of the FU1 domain for ZNRF3/RNF43 is much higher for RSPO2 and RSPO3 compared to RSPO1 and RSPO4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zebisch et al., 2013</xref>). At least for RSPO3, our experiments suggest that the interaction with LGRs is not sufficient to drive the efficient endocytosis of RNF43. HSPG binding, provided by the native TSP/BR domain or by the non-native HS20 scFv, is also required even in the presence of LGRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). In the case of RSPO3 and also RSPO2, not only are LGRs insufficient to mediate RSPO signaling, but they are in fact dispensable. This is most likely due to the higher affinity of these RSPO ligands for ZNRF3/RNF43, since replacing the ZNRF3/RNF43-bindnig FU1 domain of RSPO1 with that of RSPO3 is sufficient to render RSPO1 capable of signaling without LGRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lebensohn and Rohatgi, 2018</xref>). However, even when LGRs are present, HSPGs can markedly enhance the potency of RSPO3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and B</xref>) and potentially other RSPOs. One possibility is that HSPGs trap RSPOs near the cell surface, increasing their local concentration and the extent of their binding to LGRs. This model is supported by the observation that either the genetic or enzymatic depletion of HS chains, or the removal of the TSP/BR domain, reduces binding of RSPOs to the surface of multiple myeloma cells, while the genetic depletion of LGR4 does not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ren et al., 2018</xref>). Alternatively, the simultaneous binding of RSPO3 to LGRs and HSPGs may be required to trigger efficient endocytosis.</p><p>Several questions remain. We did not identify a single HSPG that serves as the RSPO receptor in HAP1 cells, most likely because HSPGs are multiply redundant in these cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lebensohn and Rohatgi, 2018</xref>). Disruption of GPC3, GPC4, all GPI-anchored GPCs or all SDCs either had no effect or only partially reduced the signaling potency of WT RSPO3 and synthetic RSPO3 ΔTSP/BR HS20 ligands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and C</xref>). Only the disruption of all HS-containing HSPGs reduced signaling by these RSPOs substantially, confirming the functional redundancy of HSPGs. However, specific HSPGs may be important in different tissues, stages of development or pathological conditions. For instance, the interaction of SDC4 and RSPO3 was shown to regulate WNT/planar cell polarity (PCP) signaling during <italic>Xenopus</italic> gastrulation by a process that requires clathrin-mediated endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ohkawara et al., 2011</xref>), and SDC1 was shown to promote signaling in multiple myeloma by presenting WNTs and RSPOs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ren et al., 2018</xref>). It will be interesting to test whether specific HSPGs mediate RSPO signaling during development of tissues that do not require the function of LGRs, such as the limbs and lungs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Szenker-Ravi et al., 2018</xref>). We also cannot discount the possibility that there are other undiscovered co-receptors capable of mediating the potentiation of WNT signaling by RSPOs during development. Our haploid genetic screens may have failed to identify an alternative RSPO co-receptor if it was redundant, required for cell viability or growth, or simply not expressed in HAP1 cells. These are known caveats of loss-of-function genetic screens.</p><p>Notwithstanding these possibilities, our current and previous results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lebensohn and Rohatgi, 2018</xref>) strongly suggest that HSPGs such as GPCs or SDCs are the main co-receptors, in addition to ZNRF3 or RNF43, that transduce RSPO signals in the presence and absence of LGRs.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>The following materials and methods relevant to this manuscript have been described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lebensohn et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lebensohn and Rohatgi, 2018</xref>): cell lines and growth conditions, preparation of WNT3A CM, construction of the HAP1-7TGP WNT reporter haploid cell line, construction of mutant HAP1-7TGP cell lines by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing, production and immuno-affinity purification of tagged RSPO proteins by transient transfection of 293T cells, quantification of tagged RSPO proteins, reporter-based forward genetic screens and comparative analysis of significant hits across screens.

The ‘Cell Line Name’ column indicates the generic name used throughout the manuscript to describe the genotype and the ‘Clone #' column identifies the individual clone used. The figures in which each clone was used are also indicated. The ‘CRISPR guide’ column indicates the name of the guide or guides used, which is the same as that of the oligonucleotides encoding sgRNAs (see Materials and methods and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). The ‘Genomic Sequence’ column shows 80 nucleotides of genomic sequence (5’ relative to the gene is to the left) surrounding the target site; when two adjacent sites within the same gene were targeted, 80 nucleotides of genomic sequence surrounding each target site are shown and the number of intervening bp that are not shown between the two sites is indicated in parenthesis. Each cell line made using a different set of CRISPR guides is separated by a horizontal spacer, under which the reference (WT) genomic sequence (obtained from RefSeq) targeted by each CRISPR guide is indicated. Within this reference genomic sequence, the guide sequence is colored blue and the site of the double strand cut made by Cas9 is between the two underlined bases. Sequencing results for individual mutant clones are indicated below the reference sequence. Mutated, inserted or deleted nucleotides are colored red (dashes represent deleted nucleotides and ellipses are used to indicate that a deletion continues beyond the 80 nucleotides of sequence shown) and the nature of the mutation, the resulting genotype and any pertinent observations are also described. The CRISPR guide or guides used to target different genes, as well as the genomic sequence, mutation, genotype and observations pertaining to each of the targeted genes are designated ‘1’, ‘2’, ‘3’ and ‘4’ in the column headings and are shown under horizontal spacers of different colors.</p></caption><media mime-subtype="xlsx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-54469-supp3-v1.xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp4"><label>Supplementary file 4.</label><caption><title>Ranked lists of hits from screens.</title><p>Genes containing at least one inactivating GT insertion in the population of sorted cells from each of the two genetic screens described in this work are listed in separate spreadsheets (the screen name is indicated on the tab of each spreadsheet), and are ranked based on the significance of inactivating GT insertion enrichment (<italic>p</italic>-value) in the sorted vs. the unsorted (control) cells.

Thus, we chose HS20 because it was likely to bind to many different HSPGs (which have different core proteins but share HS chains of similar composition). In the revised manuscript, we thoroughly tested the HSPG specificity of HS20 using binding assays and a panel of cell lines carrying increasingly severe deficits in their HSPG composition. This new data are presented in Figure 4 (entirely new in the revision) and discussed in the new section of the Results entitled “HSPG specificity of RSPO3 signaling”. These data show that RSPO3 ΔTSP/BR HS20 does not bind to GPC3 specifically; instead, it can use multiple different HSPGs to potentiate WNT signaling, likely by binding to their HS chains (new Figures 4B and C). To directly address the specific GPC3 vs. GPC4 question raised above, we performed binding assays with purified proteins (new Figure 4A) to show that HS20 binds equally to GPC3 and GPC4, but not to mutant proteins lacking the HS chains.</p><p>We have now also included text describing expression levels of GPC3 and other HSPGs in both HAP1 cells and in mouse intestinal organoids, the two systems used in our study. HAP1 cells (as originally presented in Table 1 of our precursor <italic>eLife</italic> paper (Lebensohn and Rohatgi, 2018)), express both <italic>GPC3</italic> and <italic>GPC4</italic>, with <italic>GPC4</italic> mRNA being more abundant. In mouse intestinal organoids, a prior publication from a different group found that only <italic>GPC4</italic> (but not <italic>GPC3</italic>) is expressed, supporting the model that RSPO3 ΔTSP/BR HS20 is not specific for GPC3 (Lindeboom et al., 2018).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The fusion of the mutant RSPO3 with HS20 is innovative.

We knocked out GPC3 in LGR4/5/6<sup>KO</sup> cells (Figures 4B and C) and found no effect on signaling by RSPO3 ΔTSP/BR HS20. Also, GPC3 is not expressed in mouse intestinal organoids (Lindeboom et al., 2018), which are responsive to RSPO3 ΔTSP/BR HS20 (Figure 5). This is explained by the fact the HS20 engages HS chains and thus can bind multiple HSPGs. We directly show that HS20 can interact equally with both GPC3 and GPC4 in a purified binding assay and that this interaction requires HS chains (Figure 4A).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors speculate on an interesting point that the ability of the different R-spondins to signal is &quot;dictated by their ability to signal through HSPGs, LGRs, or both.&quot; Is there evidence that RSPO3 can interact with HSPGs and LGRs simultaneously? Perhaps examining whether the RSPO3-ΔTSP/BR-HS30 fusion protein can simultaneously interact with LGR4/5/6 and its known target GPC3 could help address this?</p></disp-quote><p>We have addressed this question by mutating the FU1 and FU2 domains of RSPO3 ΔTSP/BR HS20 individually to impair its interactions with ZNRF3/RNF43 and LGRs, respectively. As shown in two new figure panels (Figure 2G and H and associated discussion), mutating the LGR-interacting FU2 domain of RSPO3 ΔTSP/BR HS20 impairs its ability to potentiate WNT signaling in wild-type HAP1-7TGP cells, as does impairing the HSPG-interacting TSP/BR domain (Figure 1D). Notably, we had shown the same result for wild-type RSPO3 in our precursor <italic>eLife</italic> paper (Lebensohn and Rohatgi, 2018). These results demonstrate that LGRs and HSPGs enhance signaling by both RSPO3 ΔTSP/BR HS20 and wild-type RSPO3, consistent with the model that these ligands can engage LGRs and HSPGs simultaneously. However, as we note in the text, definitive evidence of a ternary complex will require additional biochemical and structural studies that are best suited for a dedicated future publication.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Given the inherent difficulties of interpreting negative results, the negative results Figure 4 may be minimized and presented as a figure supplement.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that negative results can be difficult to interpret and explicitly note in the Discussion that our screen in one cell line does not preclude the existence of other RSPO receptors. However, the high-quality screen we present in Figure 6 (previously Figure 4) is the first unbiased, comprehensive genetic interrogation of LGR-independent signaling in a system where all three LGRs have been knocked out. Thus, the results of the screen will be of general interest to investigators working in this area, beyond the more focused question of the identity of an alternative RSPO receptor. We have chosen to keep the screen as a main figure element, so that it remains maximally visible (and thus usable) to readers. However, in response to this comment, we have significantly shortened the discussion around the screen and moved many of the details to the Materials and methods section.</p></body></sub-article></article>
