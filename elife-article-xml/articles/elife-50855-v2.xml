recovery following cortical perturbation. However, it is still unclear how this plasticity is induced at a functional circuit level. Here, we investigated motor recovery and underlying neural plasticity upon optogenetic suppression of a cortical area for eye movement. Using a visually-guided eye movement task in mice, we suppressed a portion of the secondary motor cortex (MOs) that encodes contraversive eye movement. Optogenetic unilateral suppression severely impaired contraversive movement on the first day. However, on subsequent days the suppression became inefficient and capability for the movement was restored. Longitudinal two-photon calcium imaging revealed that the regained capability was accompanied by an increased number of neurons encoding for ipsiversive movement in the unsuppressed contralateral MOs. Additional suppression of the contralateral MOs impaired the recovered movement again, indicating a compensatory mechanism. Our findings demonstrate that repeated optogenetic suppression leads to functional recovery mediated by the contralateral hemisphere.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>motor cortex</kwd><kwd>eye movement</kwd><kwd>plasticity</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002241</institution-id><institution>Japan Science and Technology Agency</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PRESTO Grant Number JPMJPR1883</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sato</surname><given-names>Tatsuo K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002241</institution-id><institution>Japan Science and Technology Agency</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PRESTO (Development and Function of Neural Networks)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sato</surname><given-names>Takashi R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund9"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SA 2575/2-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sato</surname><given-names>Takashi R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund10"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SA 2575/3-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sato</surname><given-names>Takashi R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Optogenetically induced motor disruption can evoke plasticity in the mouse frontal cortex that compensates for the motor deficits, accompanying changes in inter-hemispheric motor representation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Neural plasticity in motor cortex is critical not only for motor learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Peters et al., 2017</xref>), but also for motor recovery following cortical damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Nudo, 2013</xref>). Motor plasticity has been traditionally investigated using motor cortex in higher animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Travis and Woolsey, 1956</xref>). However, recent technical advancements have rendered rodent cortex a fruitful model to study circuit mechanisms in motor learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Makino et al., 2016</xref>), motor deficits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ebbesen and Brecht, 2017</xref>) and motor recovery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Murphy and Corbett, 2009</xref>). For example, previous studies in rodents investigated the cellular and molecular mechanisms that underlie compensatory pathophysiological changes in the cortical network during stroke recovery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alia et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fawcett, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Li et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Schwab and Strittmatter, 2014</xref>). Such changes include modification of extracellular matrix structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fawcett, 2015</xref>) and increased neurotropic factors for angiogenesis, neurogenesis, and synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berretta et al., 2014</xref>). However, it is not clear whether these molecular processes are necessary to recover impaired movements or whether motor recovery can be mediated simply by mechanisms similar to motor learning inherent to the physiological circuits.</p><p>Recovery from motor deficits relies on the intact brain regions including a hemisphere contralateral to cortical lesions. Indeed, the contralateral hemisphere has been a target for motor rehabilitation in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Buetefisch, 2015</xref>). To investigate the role of the contralateral hemisphere in motor recovery, one of ideal models is neural circuits underlying eye movement. Eye movement, like binocularly coupled saccade, shows a simple but robust motor output, and its direction is represented mainly in the contralateral frontal cortex. Consistent with this representation, a unilateral lesion in primate frontal cortex disrupts saccades toward the contralateral side (i.e., contraversive saccades) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Crowne et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pierrot-Deseilligny et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">van der Steen et al., 1986</xref>). However, such deficits can ease over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Crowne et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">van der Steen et al., 1986</xref>), even after the removal of an entire cortical hemisphere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bruell and Volk, 1956</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Estañol et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Herter and Guitton, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Perenin and Jeannerod, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sharpe et al., 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Troost et al., 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tusa et al., 1986</xref>). The recovery of the contraversive saccade in primate implies compensatory neural plasticity, potentially involving the contralateral hemisphere.</p><p>To investigate the neural basis for motor recovery in eye movement, we optogenetically suppressed the unilateral mouse frontal cortex during a visually-guided eye movement task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Itokazu et al., 2018</xref>). Using this task, we previously demonstrated that a small portion of the secondary motor cortex (MOs) in the frontal cortex controls contraversive eye movements, optogenetic suppression of MOs impairs contraversive eye movements, and MOs neurons preferentially encode contraversive eye movements. Here, we found that the suppressed eye movement can be recovered over time due to plasticity of the contralateral MOs. We propose that the neural representation of motor output is highly plastic even without pathophysiological events. Such plasticity could represent the neural basis of motor recovery.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The MOs primarily encodes contraversive eye movement condition</title><p>To establish a circuit basis of the neural plasticity underlying motor recovery, we investigated the neural representation of eye movements during a visually-guided eye movement task that we previously developed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Itokazu et al., 2018</xref>). In this task, a head-fixed mouse first directs its left eye toward a central fixation light-emitting diode (LED), and then moves its left eye in the direction of a target LED that is illuminated on either the nasal or temporal side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, see Materials and methods). After the target LED illumination, the mice were required to perform eye movements. After several weeks of training, the mice became capable of performing eye shifts in the appropriate direction within 10 s to obtain reward with 84.7 ± 2.5% success (n = 10 mice, See Materials and methods). As we previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Itokazu et al., 2018</xref>), even though the task required only left eye movement, movements of both eyes were coupled (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Neural representation in the MOs during a visually-guided eye movement task.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Experimental design of a visually-guided eye movement task.

We monitored MOs neural activity in vivo by imaging the virally expressed genetically encoded calcium indicator GCaMP6m (see Materials and methods, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>). Among the imaged neurons, 47.0% showed a significant increase in activity just before eye movement onset (n = 463/985 neurons in ten mice). This activity – which we refer to as eye movement-related activity – is considered a mixture of motor command and visual activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Itokazu et al., 2018</xref>) due to the short separation between visual cue onset and motor onset. To evaluate the contraversive or ipsiversive preference of the eye movement-related activity, we computed the difference in ΔF/F increase (see Materials and methods). As expected based on our previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Itokazu et al., 2018</xref>), the distribution of selectivity was significantly skewed to the positive value (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E and F</xref>, Wilcoxon signed-rank test, p&lt;10<sup>−10</sup>), indicating the preference for the contraversive condition as a population. In addition, more individual neurons showed significantly higher activity in the contraversive eye movement condition (24.5% neurons, contraversive selective) than the ipsiversive one (7.5%, ipsiversive selective), confirming that the MOs mainly encodes contraversive eye movement condition.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Unilateral MOs suppression impairs contraversive eye movement only on the first day</title><p>Previous behavioral lesion studies in primates suggest that deficits in eye movement can be recovered. We reproduced this behavioral result for the first time in rodents by unilateral optogenetic suppression across several days. Previously, we demonstrated that optogenetic suppression of the MOs during the eye movement task impeded contraversive eye movement severely and had non-significant effects on ipsiversive movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Itokazu et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, in this study, except for the two control mice (n = 2 mice) that received both ipsiversive and contraversive suppression, we tracked the impact of unilateral suppression only on contraversive eye movement (n = 8 mice, Materials and methods). We achieved optogenetic suppression in randomly interleaved trials by locally activating parvalbumin (PV) interneurons that expressed channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) via viral transduction, and maintained the suppression for 1 s after target LED onset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Optogenetic suppression of unilateral MOs during the visually-guided eye movement task for multiple days.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The experimental design and example traces of eye position from one animal.

If this were the case, the MOs neurons in the unsuppressed contralateral hemisphere might change how they encode movements, perhaps by encoding a de novo preference for recovered eye movement the direction of which is ipsiversive. To investigate the directional preference of the MOs neurons in the unsuppressed hemisphere, we injected additional virus to express GCaMP6m for in vivo two-photon calcium imaging (e.g., suppressing the right hemisphere and imaging the left hemisphere in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). A few weeks later, following sufficient viral expression, we mapped the response patterns of individual neurons in the MOs while the mouse performed the task (‘before’ condition, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and D</xref>). Then, we performed optogenetic suppression for contraversive eye movement trials. The contraversive movement was severely impaired on the first day, consistent with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>. However, the movement was eventually recovered (6.8 ± 1.0 days, n = 6 mice; as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). At this point, we performed two-photon imaging again to examine the response patterns of individual neurons without optogenetic MOs suppression (‘after’ condition, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). We found neurons that showed a new preference for the ipsiversive movement and those that no longer preferred the contraversive movement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D and E</xref>). As a population, many neurons showed an increased preference for the ipsiversive direction or a reduced preference for the contraversive direction (data points below the scatter plot unity line, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>, n = 415 eye movement-related neurons in six mice), especially for neurons that showed direction-selectivity in the ‘before’ or ‘after’ conditions (n = 190 out of 415, black circles). Consistently, the distribution for the change in selectivity index (see Materials and methods) was biased toward the ipsiversive condition for direction-selective neurons (p&lt;10<sup>−8</sup>, Wilcoxon signed-rank test, n = 190, black bars, top-right inset in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>), and for all neurons that showed a significant movement-related activity (p&lt;10<sup>−6</sup>, n = 415, black plus white bars). These changes were not simply caused by the training over several days. In control mice that expressed only GFP and thereby received no optogenetic suppression, additional training did not cause an increased ipsiversive preference, but rather led to a tendency for an increased contraversive preference (p=0.13, n = 123 for all direction-selective neurons; p&lt;0.002, n = 282 for all neurons that showed significant motor-related activity, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Therefore, optogenetic suppression caused an increase in neurons selective for ipsiversive direction and a decrease in those selective for contraversive direction, accompanied by a learned capacity to make ipsiversive eye movements.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Repetitive suppression of unilateral MOs induces compensatory changes in neural encoding in the contralateral MOs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Experimental design.

As it is necessary to suppress the MOs in bilateral hemispheres, we used a transgenic line that expresses ChR2-eYFP in PV-positive interneurons (PV-Cre ×Ai32).

The significant impact of the bilateral suppression demonstrates that the contralateral MOs acquired an essential role in motor recovery after repetitive optogenetic suppression.

We showed that following unilateral MOs suppression, the contralateral MOs encoded the ipsiversive direction, and played a critical role to compensate for the impaired function of the suppressed hemisphere. To our knowledge, this is the first direct evidence showing dynamic directional encoding of eye movement across hemispheres.</p><p>Our finding unveiled a recovery process following unilateral optogenetic suppression. It shares similarity with recovery processes following a unilateral lesion in the motor cortex in human patients and in animal models (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alia et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Murphy and Corbett, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Nudo, 2007</xref>). Cortical lesions are usually induced by events such as cortical resection, aspiration, traumatic brain injuries, and experimental strokes, which severely damage neurons, glial cells, vessels, neighboring axons, and the extracellular matrix including perineuronal nets. This damage initiates highly complex pathophysiologic reactions like inflammation and reactive gliosis, which leads to the upregulation of neurotrophic factors and pro-inflammatory cytokines. All of these reactions could, in principle, be involved in plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alia et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">da Silva Meirelles et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fawcett, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Li et al., 2010</xref>). Therefore, it was not clear whether functional recovery could be achieved without complex pathophysiological events triggered by cortical lesions. Our findings demonstrate that a built-in plastic capability of normal cortical circuits alone could cause motor recovery of eye movement.</p><p>Our findings demonstrate that the motor cortex in the contralateral hemisphere underlies the flexibility in the neural representation of motor output. Studies in the forelimb/hindlimb motor cortex suggest that both the perilesional areas and the contralateral unaffected motor cortex play critical roles in motor recovery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alia et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Benowitz and Carmichael, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Murphy and Corbett, 2009</xref>). In particular, following a cortical lesion, neurons in the contralateral cortex show increased turnover of dendritic spines and an increased number of dendritic branches. Consistently, following a large unilateral infarct, pharmacological silencing of the contralateral hemisphere can deteriorate recovered forelimb movement, indicating a facilitatory role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Biernaskie et al., 2004</xref>). However, the role of the contralateral hemisphere still remains controversial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alia et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hosp and Luft, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Mohajerani et al., 2011</xref>), and indeed a study showed that silencing the undamaged contralateral hemisphere by continuous infusion of GABA-A agonist improves recovery performance, implying a suppressive role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Mansoori et al., 2014</xref>). A prevailing hypothesis that reconciles these findings is that the role of the contralateral hemisphere depends on the size of infarction, particularly on whether remaining intact cortical areas in the ipsi-lesional hemisphere can take over the original functions of the lesioned area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Buetefisch, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Di Pino et al., 2014</xref>). If they can, they will be interfered with by the contralateral hemisphere. If they cannot, the contralateral hemisphere instead can substitute for the functions of the lesioned area. Our findings suggest that neighboring areas in the hemisphere ipsilateral to the optogenetic suppression, despite potentially exhibiting some forms of plasticity, may not substitute for the role of MOs in our task.</p><p>Our findings indicate that the MOs has a latent capability to control ipsiversive eye movements and can learn to turn on these movements. This capability might depend on existing anatomical projections from the MOs to subcortical eye-movement related regions for ipsiversive movements. For instance, the MOs normally projects to the superior colliculus. However, in this case the MOs likely would need to project to the contralateral superior colliculus; these projections are rather sparse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Oh et al., 2014</xref>, for example, mouse #141603190). Another possibility is the relatively strong projections from the MOs to the contralateral striatum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Oh et al., 2014</xref>); the striatum has been linked to saccade output as an indirect pathway in primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Basso and Sommer, 2011</xref>). Further research is required to determine which anatomical wirings the MOs neurons learn to exploit to achieve motor recovery.</p><p>Optogenetic suppression has been a standard technique to investigate the specific functions of neural circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Guo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Li et al., 2016</xref>). Our data show that repeated suppression across multiple days can induce changes in the functions of the contralateral hemisphere, leading to the recovery from the initial motor deficits induced by optogenetic suppression. Therefore, our results indicate that the impact of optogenetic suppression needs to be interpreted with caution, and the suppression paradigms need to be carefully designed. Our study highlights the flexibility of cortical circuits that can overcome even short-term reversible manipulation of neural activity.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top"> Strain, strain background (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">PV-Cre, C57Bl/6</td><td valign="top">PMID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15836427">15836427</ext-link></td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:008069">IMSR_JAX:008069</ext-link></td><td valign="top">The Jackson Laboratory (#008069)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background <break/>(<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Ai32, <break/>C57Bl/6</td><td valign="top">PMID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22446880">22446880</ext-link></td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:012569">IMSR_JAX:012569</ext-link></td><td valign="top">The Jackson Laboratory (#012569)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td valign="top">AAV2/1-syn-GCaMP6m</td><td valign="top">PMID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23868258">23868258</ext-link></td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/Addgene_100841">Addgene_100841</ext-link></td><td valign="top">Upenn Vector Core</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td valign="top">AAV2/1-EF1α-DIO-hChR2(H134R)-EYFP</td><td valign="top"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.optogenetics.org">http://www.optogenetics.org</ext-link></td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/Addgene_20298">Addgene_ 20298</ext-link></td><td valign="top">Upenn Vector Core</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">Matlab</td><td valign="top"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html">https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html</ext-link></td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_001622">SCR_001622</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals and surgery</title><p>C57BL/6J, PV–Cre, which has the Cre recombinase gene targeted to the <italic>Pvalb</italic> locus (JAX stock #008069), and Ai32 (JAX stock #012569; Rosa-CAG-LSL-ChR2(H134R)-EYFP-WPRE) mouse lines were used in this study. In some experiments, PV–Cre mice were crossed with Ai32 mice, and the resulting mouse line was designated PV–ChR2. For all experiments, male mice of 8 weeks or older in age were used. The mice were group housed in a cage, and experiments were performed during the dark period of the 12 hr light/12 hr dark cycle. Sixteen mice were included in this study. For surgical procedures, mice were anesthetized with 0.1 mg/g ketamine and 0.008 mg/g xylazine (intraperitoneally), and isoflurane was supplemented to maintain the anesthesia. Lidocaine was applied subcutaneously at the incision site. Dexamethasone (2 mg/kg) was administered intraperitoneally after the onset of anesthesia to reduce swelling of the tissue. Lidocaine was applied to the wound margins for topical anesthesia. A custom-built headpost was glued to the skull and then cemented to the animal’s head using dental acrylic. A craniotomy (1–2 mm rectangle) was performed over the MOs of one hemisphere (centered 700 μm anterior and 700 μm lateral from the bregma). Then, virus (AAV2/1-syn-GCaMP6m or AAV2/1-EF1α-DIO-hChR2(H134R)-EYFP) was injected at multiple sites (10–20 nL/site; depth, 200–300 μm; 3–5 min/injection), which resulted in virus expression of ~400 μm. The laterality of the hemisphere was randomized across mice. For PV-ChR2 mice, no virus was injected, but two separate craniotomies were made over the MOs of both hemispheres. Following virus injection, an imaging window consisting of two or three layers of cover glass was implanted. The space between the imaging window and bone was sealed with 1.5% agarose and the window was cemented with dental acrylic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Komiyama et al., 2010</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Behavioral training</title><p>Mice were trained on a visually-guided eye movement task that we previously developed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Itokazu et al., 2018</xref>). In brief, mice were pre-trained to enter a tube to obtain a water reward for ~7 days. Then, the mice were acclimated to the imaging setup (head-fixed condition), and rapid eye movements were encouraged with water reward for 2 days. Following this, the mice were trained to perform a visually-guided eye movement task. In this behavioral paradigm, three blue LEDs (a fixation LED, a nasal target LED, and a temporal target LED; wavelength 470 nm, M470F1, Thorlabs) were used as visual stimuli. During the trial, the brightness of LEDs indicated where the left eye should be located (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The light of the fixation LED was first set at 260 μW for 3–4 s, and then increased to 470 μW at the start of the trial. When the left eye was directed to the fixation LED (within ±2.5°), the brightness was increased to 500 μW. The mouse was required to maintain the fixation for 750–1,000 ms. After successful fixation, one of the two target LEDs was turned on (450 μW). At the same time, the brightness of the fixation LED was decreased (260 μW). The mouse needed to shift its gaze in the direction of the target LED within 10 s. The 10 s window for the correct eye movements remains the same for all the trials including those with optogenetic suppression. If the mouse did not make the eye movements within 10 s, the trial was aborted and excluded from the reaction time analysis. Following successful eye movements, the target LED was turned off (70 ms later). After a short delay, a drop of water was provided. The eye shift needed to be a rapid movement (amplitude &gt;5°, speed &gt;0.1°/ms). If the gaze moved out from the fixation window without the correct eye movement, the trial was considered as an error. Incorrect eye movements included rapid eye movements toward the wrong direction, rapid movements with amplitudes smaller than 5°, and slow eye drifts. Each mouse generally performed this task ~50 times per day. The behavior was monitored using a program written in TEMPO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Itokazu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sato and Schall, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sato et al., 2003</xref>).

This system returns, without saving the original image, analog voltage output that corresponds to the position of the eye. These voltage outputs are fed into our behavior monitoring program. The light source for the camera was a 940 nm LED. To block the infrared light for the right eye, target LEDs, a two-photon laser, an 800 nm long-pass filter (#66–059, Edmund), and a 960 nm short-pass filter (HQ960SP, Chroma) were placed in front of the camera.</p><p>In some experiments, the image of the right eye was recorded at 200 Hz using a complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) camera (DCC1240M, Thorlabs).

The light source for this camera was a 780 nm LED (M780L2, Thorlabs). In front of the camera, a 960 nm short-pass filter (HQ960SP, Chroma) was placed.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Two-photon imaging</title><p>In vivo imaging was performed using a two-photon microscope based on a movable objective microscope system (Sutter) controlled by ScanImage software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pologruto et al., 2003</xref>), as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Itokazu et al., 2018</xref>). The light source was a pulsed Ti:sapphire laser (Chameleon, Coherent), and the laser wavelength was set at 980 nm, which provides a high fluorescent change in GCaMP signal (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.janelia.org/lab/harris-lab-apig/research/photophysics/two-photon-fluorescent-probes">https://www.janelia.org/lab/harris-lab-apig/research/photophysics/two-photon-fluorescent-probes</ext-link>) and less scattering in the tissue than shorter wavelengths. The objective lens was apochromatic (16×, 0.80 NA, Nikon). Signals were collected using photomultiplier tubes (Hamamatsu Photonics, H10770PA-40); frame scanning (frame rate ~6 Hz) was used. Images were collected at a depth of 150–300 μm from the dura surface for layer 2/3 neurons. For image analysis, movement artifacts were corrected in two steps: performing a cross correlation-based image alignment (Turboreg) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Thévenaz et al., 1998</xref>) followed by a line-by-line correction using an algorithm based on a hidden-Markov model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dombeck et al., 2007</xref>). Then, the regions of interest (ROIs) containing the neurons were drawn manually, and the pixel values within each ROI were summed to estimate the fluorescence of the individual neuron. ∆F/F signal was calculated as (F-F<sub>baseline</sub>)/F<sub>baseline</sub>, where F<sub>baseline</sub> is the baseline fluorescence signal (30<sup>th</sup> percentile) within each trial.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Optogenetic suppression</title><p>The design of optogenetic stimulation is the same as in our previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Itokazu et al., 2018</xref>). AAV2/1-EF1α-DIO-hChR2(H134R)-EYFP was injected into the MOs of PV–Cre mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lee et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Olsen et al., 2012</xref>) unilaterally, which resulted in virus expression of ~800 μm. In the control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), AAV2/1 CAG-FLEX-EGFP was injected. Bilateral suppression studies employed PV–ChR2 mice, which were produced by crossing PV–Cre to Ai32 (Rosa-CAG-LSL-ChR2(H134R)-EYFP-WPRE) mice. A blue laser (473 nm, CrystaLaser) was coupled to an optic fiber (M15L02, Thorlabs). The output power was manipulated by combining a half-wave plate with a polarizing beamsplitter cube. An optical chopper was used to convert the continuous wave into a 40 Hz pulse (pulse width, 2.5 ms; Edmund optics, 59–894) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cardin et al., 2009</xref>). The output of the optic fiber and surface of the cortex were placed on conjugate planes using two convex lenses. A dichroic mirror was placed in the infinity space, and the reflected light was focused onto the sensor of a CMOS camera (Thorlabs). This design enabled monitoring of the precise location of the stimulated site. The blue light was illuminated in 40–60% of the trials, where contralateral eye movement was required. Illumination was made only in trials with contralateral eye movements (n = 8 mice), as optogenetic suppression affects only those movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Itokazu et al., 2018</xref>). In two control mice, both contraversive and ipsiversive trials were suppressed, which resulted in impairment only in contraversive trials. The laterality of suppressed hemisphere for contraversive-trial suppression was randomized between mice, although in PV-Cre mice it was based on the virus injection site (which was randomized at the time of virus injection across mice). We illuminated ~30% of the trials on the first day and the day of bilateral suppression; if we used a higher proportion of optogenetic suppression, the mice often stopped the task engagement. The average power of the light at the surface of the cortex was 600–1,200 μW. Optogenetic suppression was applied for multiple days (5.2 ± 0.7 days). During these periods, the mice learned to perform eye movements under optogenetic suppression. In the following session after learning, two-photon imaging was performed without optogenetic suppression in six PV-Cre mice, and bilateral suppression was performed in four PV-ChR2 mice using two separate lasers and optic fibers.</p><p>Even for trials with optogenetic suppression, eye movements within 10 s were considered to be a success, and were thereby rewarded with a drop of water. The effect of optogenetic suppression was quantified by comparing the probability of eye movement within 1 s between trials with and without illumination. The probability was also compared between the first and the last day of unilateral optogenetic suppression, and between unilateral and bilateral suppression (Pearson’s chi-square test). The distributions of the reaction times were also compared using the Mann-Whitney U test.</p><p>This optogenetic stimulation caused no behavioral effects when blue light illumination was targeted to the primary motor cortex (1 mm lateral to the MOs), excluding non-specific effects of blue light illumination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Itokazu et al., 2018</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Image data analysis</title><p>For each neuron, movement-related activity was quantified as an increase in ∆<italic>F</italic>/<italic>F</italic> between the frame at baseline (600 ms before the movement onset) and the frame at the time of movement. The neurons were considered to contain significant movement activity if the activity was significant based on the Wilcoxon signed-rank test (p&lt;0.05) in either contraversive or ipsiversive movement conditions. For these neurons, the difference in movement activity between the contraversive or ipsiversive conditions was computed (difference in ΔF/F increase in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). The significance of the direction selectivity was determined by the Mann–Whitney U test with p&lt;0.05.</p><p>For the animals that were imaged before and after the training with optogenetic suppression, the neurons were considered to contain significant movement activity if the activity was significant (Wilcoxon signed-rank test, p&lt;0.05) either before or after the training (white dots/bars; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Similarly, the neurons were considered as direction selective if the difference in movement activity was significant (Mann-Whitney U test, p&lt;0.05) either before or after the training (black dots/bars; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Selectivity index for contraversive/ipsiversive directions was computed as (<italic>R</italic><sub>contra</sub> − <italic>R</italic><sub>ipsi</sub>) / |<italic>R</italic><sub>contra</sub> + <italic>R</italic><sub>ipsi</sub>|, where <italic>R</italic><sub>contra</sub> is the response in the contraversive condition and <italic>R</italic><sub>ipsi</sub> is in the ipsiversive. The index could be larger than one or smaller than −1 when either of <italic>R</italic><sub>contra</sub> and <italic>R</italic><sub>ipsi</sub> was negative. In addition, we used a common and the larger denominator between ‘before’ and ‘after’ conditions, to avoid a small denominator resulting from non-significant <italic>R</italic><sub>contra</sub> and <italic>R</italic><sub>ipsi</sub> (e.g., Neuron two in ‘after’ condition in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Experimental design and statistical analysis</title><p>Ten mice (PV-Cre and C57BL/6) were used to study the neural representation of eye movements in MOs, eight mice (PV-Cre) to examine the effects of unilateral optogenetic suppression of MOs, six mice (PV-Cre) to monitor the effects of repeated optogenetic suppression on neural representation in MOs, and four mice (PV-ChR2) for bilateral suppression of MOs.</p><p>All of the statistical tests were non-parametric, and are indicated in the relevant text or figure legend.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Naoshige Uchida as the Reviewing Editor and Richard Ivry as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this short report, Sato and colleagues studied the effects of optogenetic inactivation of secondary motor cortex (MOs) on eye movements using a visually-guided eye movement task in mice. The authors show that unilateral inactivation of MOs impaired contraversive eye movements on the first day of manipulation but this effect was greatly reduced after several days of repeated inactivation. This behavioral recovery was accompanied by changes in MOs activity: MOs neurons initially showed significant contraversive preference. However, after repeated unilateral inactivation, the contralateral MOs reduced contraversive preference. Inactivation of bilateral MOs eliminated the recovered movements.</p><p>The reviewers found this study to contain very important and impactful results. Optogenetics is very widely used under the assumption that brief stimulations do not cause significant long-lasting changes in the underlying brain mechanisms. The current study clearly refutes that assumption, at least in the context studied here. As such, this study will be of great interest to a wide neuroscience audience.</p><p>The reviewers also found the conclusions to be well supported by the data, the manuscript is well-written, and the results are interesting and thought-provoking. However, the reviewers raised some concerns to which we would like to see your response.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Can the authors exclude the possibility that the reported plasticity was caused by tissue damage made by the repetitive illumination of blue laser, but not by the reversible inactivation? One possible control experiment would be 2-photon imaging of the suppressed area after the repetitive suppression. The other possibility would be to test whether a repetitive illumination of MOs without the optogenetics will impair the eye movements or not.</p><p>Minor points:</p><p>1) Although the &quot;success rate&quot; of the animal's performance in the task is one of the key measures in this study, its definition is somewhat ambiguous. Please clarify the definition of a success rate. For example, in the Materials and methods section, &quot;the mouse needed to shift its gaze.… within 10 s.&quot; In the subsection “The MOs primarily encodes contraversive eye movement condition”, success rate based on this definition was &quot;84.5% success&quot;. On the other hand, in the subsection “Unilateral MOs suppression impairs contraversive eye movement only on the first day”, the success rate was measured as &quot;proportion of trials with a reaction time less than 1 sec&quot;. Therefore, the post-suppression% correct was &quot;7.1% &quot; and that of pre-suppression was &quot;40.4%&quot;. Is it possible to use the same definition throughout the manuscript for clarity?</p><p>2) Based on Figure 2B left, the mouse made correct saccades in the suppression trials after the light was turned off in some trials. This might suggest that mice were rewarded in many of the suppression trials. What was the rate of reward in the suppression trials? Or, what are the success rates in the experimental sessions if a correct saccade within 10 sec was defined as success? Please clarify the reward contingency and definition of &quot;success&quot; in these cases.</p><p>3) Please clarify whether the suppression was applied randomly or in a blocked design (i.e. successive trials).</p><p>4) Did the authors examine the neural activity in the surrounding region of the suppressed area or in the suppressed area after the repetitive suppression? If these areas did not change their activity, the conclusion of the manuscript can be strengthened.</p><p>5) Are there anatomical reports that support the compensation in the contralateral hemisphere?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.50855.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor points:</p><p>1) Although the &quot;success rate&quot; of the animal's performance in the task is one of the key measures in this study, its definition is somewhat ambiguous.

When we describe a success rate with a percentage, it indicates the proportion of trials in which the animals can make movements within 10 seconds (leading to a reward). By contrast, when we evaluate the impact of optogenetic suppression, we describe whether animals can make movements during the 1 second suppression period (the duration in which the laser is illuminated). We restricted the laser illumination to 1 second, so that the mouse can still perform the correct eye movements in the remaining 9 seconds, which helps maintain their motivation.</p><p>We have now made these definitions clear throughout the manuscript (subsection “The MOs primarily encodes contraversive eye movement condition”, first paragraph, subsection “Unilateral MOs suppression impairs contraversive eye movement only on the first day”, last paragraph, subsection “The MOs in the contralateral hemisphere is responsible for the recovery”, Materials and methods).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Based on Figure 2B left, the mouse made correct saccades in the suppression trials after the light was turned off in some trials.

Although we had intended to describe such information, we now realize that our description was not clear enough. Our definition of success, and thereby the condition in which animals can get a reward, is the same throughout this study; animals are required to make a correct eye movement within 10 seconds. On the other hand, we evaluate the impact of optogenetic suppression by comparing the number of trials within 1 second with and without laser illumination.</p><p>We have modified our descriptions throughout the manuscript to make this clearer (subsection “The MOs primarily encodes contraversive eye movement condition”, first paragraph, subsection “Unilateral MOs suppression impairs contraversive eye movement only on the first day”, last paragraph, subsection “The MOs in the contralateral hemisphere is responsible for the recovery”, Materials and methods).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Please clarify whether the suppression was applied randomly or in a blocked design (i.e. successive trials).</p></disp-quote><p>We have now clarified that the suppression was randomized (subsection “Unilateral MOs suppression impairs contraversive eye movement only on the first day”, first paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Did the authors examine the neural activity in the surrounding region of the suppressed area or in the suppressed area after the repetitive suppression?
