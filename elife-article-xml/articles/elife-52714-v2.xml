protein degradation pathway, the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS), and protein synthesis in rat and mouse neurons. When protein degradation was inhibited, we observed a coordinate dramatic reduction in nascent protein synthesis in neuronal cell bodies and dendrites. The mechanism for translation inhibition involved the phosphorylation of eIF2α, surprisingly mediated by eIF2α kinase 1, or heme-regulated kinase inhibitor (HRI). Under basal conditions, neuronal expression of HRI is barely detectable. Following proteasome inhibition, HRI protein levels increase owing to stabilization of HRI and enhanced translation, likely via the increased availability of tRNAs for its rare codons. Once expressed, HRI is constitutively active in neurons because endogenous heme levels are so low; HRI activity results in eIF2α phosphorylation and the resulting inhibition of translation. These data demonstrate a novel role for neuronal HRI that senses and responds to compromised function of the proteasome to restore proteostasis.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>proteostasis</kwd><kwd>protein synthesis</kwd><kwd>protein degradation</kwd><kwd>heme-regulated inhibitory kinase</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004189</institution-id><institution>Max Planck Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>tom Dieck</surname><given-names>Susanne</given-names></name><name><surname>Fusco</surname><given-names>Claudia M</given-names></name><name><surname>Donlin-Asp</surname><given-names>Paul</given-names></name><name><surname>Perez</surname><given-names>Julio D</given-names></name><name><surname>Schuman</surname><given-names>Erin M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schuman</surname><given-names>Erin M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000654</institution-id><institution>Marie Curie Cancer Care</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Intra-European Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Alvarez-Castelao</surname><given-names>Beatriz</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Peter and Traudl Engelhorn Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Donlin-Asp</surname><given-names>Paul</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005156</institution-id><institution>Alexander von Humboldt Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>USA-1198990-HFST-P</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Donlin-Asp</surname><given-names>Paul</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004189</institution-id><institution>Max Planck Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DFG CRC 1080</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schuman</surname><given-names>Erin M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Cellular Mechanisms of Neural Homeostasis</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DFG CRC 902</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schuman</surname><given-names>Erin M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100007601</institution-id><institution>Horizon 2020 -

While many studies have focused on proteostatic regulators that are associated with the proper synthesis, folding and elimination of protein aggregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Klaips et al., 2018</xref>), less attention has been paid to the coordination of protein synthesis and degradation within cells. The study of proteostasis is particularly important in neurons because alterations in protein synthesis and degradation, particularly via the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS), have emerged as network hubs in many disease states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ciechanover and Brundin, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Labbadia and Morimoto, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tai and Schuman, 2008</xref>).</p><p>As an additional challenge, neurons must dynamically regulate the synaptic proteome in response to plasticity elicited by neural activity. Many studies have demonstrated that de novo protein synthesis plays an important role in synaptic transmission and plasticity, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Holt et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sutton and Schuman, 2006</xref>). In addition, protein degradation, mediated by the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS), also plays an important role in regulating synaptic function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bingol and Schuman, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tai and Schuman, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ramachandran and Margolis, 2017</xref>). In neurons, proteome regulation occurs in the cell body as well as the dendrites and axons allowing the initiation of proteome remodeling at synapses, far from the cell body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Holt et al., 2019</xref>). While it is clear that changes in synaptic transmission involve extensive regulation of the synaptic proteome via the regulated synthesis and degradation of proteins, it is not well understood how these two processes are coordinately regulated to achieve the desired level of individual proteins at synapses.</p><p>To address this question, we studied the impact of proteasome inhibition on protein synthesis in mature neurons. We found that blocking proteasome function leads to a coordinate reduction in protein synthesis, indicating the existence of a global proteostatic pathway in neurons. The entry point for down-regulation of protein synthesis is the much-studied protein synthesis initiation factor, eIF2α (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Donnelly et al., 2013</xref>). The phosphorylation of eIF2α that leads to reduced neuronal translation is accomplished by one of the eIF2α kinases, heme-regulated inhibitory kinase (HRI), best known for its translational control in erythrocyte precursors. The activity and expression of neuronal HRI is regulated in a biologically clever manner, expression is kept low by a short- half-life and a translational control mechanism that is relieved by proteasome inhibition- augmenting HRI expression and leading to the coordinate regulation of protein synthesis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Neuronal proteasome inhibition leads to a coordinate reduction in neuronal protein synthesis, globally and locally in dendrites</title><p>To determine whether the processes of neuronal protein synthesis and degradation are coupled, we examined the effect of blocking proteasomal degradation on nascent protein synthesis in cultured hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Blocking proteasome activity with either of two chemically distinct inhibitors (MG-132, 10 μM; Lactacystin, 10 μM; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–F</xref>) for 2 hr led to a dramatic decrease in protein synthesis, measured with two different labeling methods: the non-canonical amino acid azidohomoalanine (AHA) and BONCAT (biorthogonal non-canonical amino acid tagging) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dieterich et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–C</xref>) or metabolic labeling with puromycin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>). The compensatory proteostatic decrease in protein synthesis did not require a complete block of proteasomal activity: dose-dependent reductions in proteasome activity led to coordinate reductions in protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>). These data suggest that cross-talk can occur between the protein degradation and synthesis pathways in response to relatively small fluctuations in proteasome activity.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Proteasome inhibition leads to a coordinate inhibition of protein synthesis in neurons.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Scheme indicating experimental protocol: cultured hippocampal neurons were exposed to a proteasome inhibitor (PI; MG132 or lactacystin- see supplementary figs) for 2 hr and then the non-canonical amino acid AHA was added for 10 min to label newly synthesized proteins (see Materials and methods).

To estimate the magnitude of this effect, we metabolically pulse-labeled cultured neurons with <sup>S35</sup>Methionine and immunoprecipitated HRI at different chase times under control and proteasome inhibition conditions. Surprisingly, we observed that HRI protein has an extremely short half-life under control conditions (~4.2 hr). In addition, the short-lived HRI protein was significantly stabilized by proteasome inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C,D</xref>). These data indicate that inhibition of the proteasome alone is sufficient to augment HRI protein levels and can account for at least part of the increase in HRI protein expression.</p><p>To explore the possibility that there is translational regulation of HRI, we placed both a fluorescent reporter (ZsGreen) and a HA-tagged HRI protein in a single doxycycline (DOX)-inducible bi-directional plasmid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Transfection of the plasmid into neurons or HeLa cells followed by DOX treatment led to robust expression of ZsGreen in a large population of cells whereas the expression of HRI was absent or barely detectable in the same population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F,G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A–C</xref>). This result was unexpected, given that the use of a bi-directional promoter typically results in roughly equal populations of expressed proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Vogl et al., 2018</xref>). We next considered the possibility that the mismatch of ZsGreen and HRI-HA expression could be due to the compromised translation of HRI-HA. To address how HRI translation behaves relative to global translation, we used polysome profiling, comparing control and proteasome inhibitor-treated hippocampal cultured neurons. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> and consistent with the relative inhibition of translation observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, we observed a leftward shift in the translational profile from polysomes to monosomes following proteasome inhibition.

Indeed, when we expressed an HA-tagged HRI with optimized codon usage (HRI<sub>opt</sub>-HA) we observed that the basal expression of HRI<sub>opt</sub>-HA was higher (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E,G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>) and HRI<sub>opt</sub>-HA exhibited a reduced rightward shift to the polysome fraction following treatment with a proteasome inhibitor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Taken together these data indicate that HRI protein expression is paradoxically enhanced under conditions in which global protein synthesis is reduced. Two complementary mechanisms act to enhance HRI levels; first, a stabilization of the protein via reduced degradation by the proteasome and, second, enhanced translation owing to the increased availability of rare codons.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Stabilized HRI is constitutively active in neurons</title><p>In erythrocyte precursors, HRI kinase is activated by multiple mechanisms, including an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) or nitric oxide (NO) or reductions in cellular heme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen and London, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Igarashi et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Uma et al., 2001</xref>). Increases in ROS have been reported following proteasome inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ding et al., 2006</xref>). We thus tested whether the HRI activation that follows proteasome inhibition is due to increases in either ROS or NO by quenching ROS or blocking NO synthesis during MG132 treatment. We found that neither ROS scavengers nor NO synthase inhibitors prevented the proteasome inhibitor-induced decreases in protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A–E</xref>). We then examined whether heme metabolism drives the activation of HRI. The major enzymatic path that promotes the breakdown of heme are the heme oxygenases (HO1 and 2). Treatment with two different heme oxygenase inhibitors, however, also failed to affect the protein synthesis reduction elicited by proteasome inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2F,G</xref>). These data suggest that enhanced heme breakdown, per se, is not responsible for HRI activation.</p><p>In erythryocytes, HRI is activated by reductions in cellular heme levels. We next considered the possibility that basal heme levels might be low in neurons, relative to erythrocytes, which could lead to constitutive kinase activity. We directly measured free heme in neurons and blood and found that while blood had predictably high levels of free heme, heme could not even be detected in cultured hippocampal neurons, and total hippocampal lysates exhibited heme levels orders of magnitude lower than blood (hippocampus; 36 ± 8 fmol/μg, blood; 126 ± 18 pmol/μg). We next tested if the measured amount of heme in blood could indeed inhibit HRI kinase activity in an in vitro assay using recombinant HRI and its substrate eIF2α, together with <sup>32</sup>P-ATP. We found that the addition of hemin (heme complexed with Fe<sup>3+</sup>) led to a significant reduction in eIF2α phosphorylation by HRI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Given the clear heme-induced inhibition of HRI, we directly tested whether the cytoplasmic regulatory context for HRI is different in neurons by adding recombinant HRI and its substrate eIF2α, together with <sup>32</sup>P-ATP to cellular lysates prepared from neurons or blood. We evaluated the phosphorylation of eIF2α and found that it was elevated in hippocampus when compared to blood, indicating that HRI is more active under basal conditions in the neuronal cytoplasmic context (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). If the elevated HRI protein is constitutively active due to low neuronal heme levels, then the inhibition of protein synthesis induced by proteasome blockade should be amenable to rescue by exogenous heme in neurons. Indeed, we found that addition of hemin to cultured neurons resulted in a rescue of the protein synthesis inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2H</xref>), and a reduction in the phosphorylation levels of eIF2α (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2I,J</xref>) caused by proteasome blockade.

This is consistent with the assumption that one molecule of HRI will lead to the phosphorylation of multiple molecules of substrate. Given this dependence, small increases in HRI expression will exert the greatest impact on protein synthesis within a low to intermediate range: when expression is not too low to impact eIF2α phosphorylation, but also not too high because then most protein synthesis is already shut off.

Furthermore, small increases in HRI expression can have a significant impact on protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). This indicates that, in neurons, the cytoplasmic environment is permissive for the constitutive activity of HRI upon expression. In addition, HRI’s potent effect on global translation provides an explanation for why its expression is usually maintained at low levels in neurons. These features of HRI, its basal very low expression, its short half-life and the boost in protein levels upon proteasome inhibition, thus make it both an optimal sensor and effector for proteostasis during situations of compromised proteasome activity.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Here we report that after brief period of proteasomal inhibition (via a pharmacological or genetic manipulation), neuronal protein synthesis is coordinately reduced via the actions of the eIF2α kinase 1, or heme-regulated inhibitor kinase. Taken together, our data indicate the following sequence of events unfolds to restore proteostasis: i) proteasome inhibition (PI) stabilizes the extremely short-lived neuronal HRI protein, ii) endogenous low levels of neuronal heme result in constitutive activation of HRI which increases the phosphorylation of eIF2α and reduces translation initiation, iii) the initial decrease in general translation may lead to an increase in the availability of charged rare tRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Saikia et al., 2016</xref>), further increasing the translation of HRI mRNA and ensuring ongoing phosphorylation of eIF2α and as a result, reduced global translation.</p><p>The above-described mechanism allows for the coordination of protein synthesis and degradation in neurons, so that global protein levels stay balanced. We found that the same feedback mechanism can be detected in isolated neuronal processes, including dendrites and potentially axons. Local synthesis and degradation of proteins occurs in dendrites and axons via localized mRNAs, ribosomes and components of the UPS (e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bingol and Schuman, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Campbell and Holt, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hafner et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Holt and Schuman, 2013</xref>]). It is not known, however, the spatial scale over which this proteostasis operates in axonal or dendritic compartments. In addition, a completely open question in all cells is the how proteostasis is accomplished at the level of individual proteins-of-interest.</p><p>Our data indicate that the above mechanisms cleverly cooperate to enhance the expression and activity of HRI in response to reduced proteasome activity. These mechanisms make HRI an optimized sensor and effector for sensing and responding to proteasome inhibition. In this regard, it is interesting to note that while the HRI transcript is detected at higher levels than the other 3 eIF2α kinases in hippocampal neurons, the HRI protein is expressed at very low levels under basal conditions, suggesting strong cellular pressure to keep HRI protein expression low. We observed, though, that HRI levels exhibit an increase upon proteasome inhibition, consistent with our observation that HRI can be degraded by the proteasome in vivo and in vitro. In addition, attempts to over-express HRI via transfection were largely thwarted. We evaluated the transcript for the presence of rare codons which can reduce translational efficiency (e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Frumkin et al., 2018</xref>]). Indeed, HRI mRNA possesses many rare and extremely rare codons; expression of a codon-optimized HRI resulted in higher levels of basal translation. In addition, in polysome profiling experiments, we found that HRI mRNA exhibited a paradoxical shift to the polysome fraction following proteasomal inhibition, while the bulk of cellular mRNAs exhibited a shift to the monosome fraction, consistent with their reduced global translation. Owing to the apparent absence of uORFs in the 5’UTR of HRI, we propose that rare codon availability could explain the atypical behavior of HRI mRNA following PI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Saikia et al., 2016</xref>), in support of this idea, the codon-optimized HRI failed to exhibit the shift to the polysome fraction upon PI.</p><p>In erythrocytes, HRI is activated by reduced heme levels to coordinately reduce the synthesis of α- and β-globin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Han et al., 2001</xref>); together α-globin, β-globin, and heme, assembled in a 2:2:4 ratio, make up hemoglobin. Getting the stoichiometry just right is important for red blood cells (RBCs) since an overabundance of any single component is cytotoxic to RBCs and their precursors. We found that heme levels are extremely low or undetectable in neurons, indicating that once expressed at appreciable levels, HRI will be constitutively active. Indeed, we observed significantly elevated HRI activity in a control hippocampal lysate when compared to a control blood lysate. Importantly and definitively, we observed that the PI-induced protein synthesis inhibition was rescued by the addition of hemin.</p><p>Taken together, multiple mechanisms act in concert to tightly control the dynamic range of HRI. Under control conditions HRI exhibits barely detectable levels of expression and activity due to its high turn-over and low translation rates. The inhibition of the proteasome is sensed by the stabilization of HRI and the low neuronal heme content means that HRI can respond immediately to the environment created by proteasome blockade. These data further suggest that physiological and pathophysiological conditions that give rise to proteasome dysfunction may favor HRI expression and activity leading to a decrease in protein synthesis.</p><p>The role of HRI as a primary mediator of the feedback between the degradation and protein synthesis machinery is surprising given the prominent role the other eIF2α kinases (GCN2, PERK and PKR) are known to play in neuronal translational regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cagnetta et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Costa-Mattioli et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hughes and Mallucci, 2019</xref>). Indeed, all four of the eIF2α kinases have been associated with the phosphorylation of eIF2α in response to proteasome inhibition. These studies were performed with cell lines of non-neuronal origin or mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jiang and Wek, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yerlikaya et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zhang et al., 2010</xref>). In addition, the activation of mTOR pathway following UPS inhibition has also been linked to a decrease in protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>). In our experiments, HRI is clearly the major kinase responsible for the proteasome inhibition-induced feedback regulation of neuronal protein synthesis; we think it is likely, however, that the other eIF2α kinases also play a role, potentially when HRI is absent or during periods of prolonged proteasome inhibition. Parsing the unique and complementary roles of these kinases will have to take into account the unique translation/degradation rates of each cell type together with the specific expression the eIF2α kinases, protein chaperones and heme content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Uma et al., 1999</xref>).</p><p>We note that HRI’s role in neuronal function is poorly explored, save for two reports of HRI influencing the translation of synaptic proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ramos-Fernández et al., 2016</xref>) and influencing learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">ILL-Raga et al., 2013</xref>). In addition, the regulation by heme highlights an important element to consider in the context of neuronal function, given emerging data that point to dysregulation of iron homeostasis in disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Salvador, 2010</xref>). Dysfunctional proteasome activity occupies a central position in many neurodegenerative diseases, and increased phosphorylation in eIF2α has been detected in postmortem brains of AD patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chang et al., 2002</xref>). Prion infection also inhibits proteasomal activity and increases polyubiquitin levels by 2–3 times (similar to the levels observed in our conditions of study- see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kang et al., 2004</xref>). Strikingly, reperfusion after ischemic stroke leads to a profound proteasome inhibition in brain tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hochrainer et al., 2012</xref>). In addition, in hemorrhagic strokes heme is liberated in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Babu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Prabhakaran and Naidech, 2012</xref>) and causes neuronal toxicity. The expression of HRI in neurons and its susceptibility to heme regulation should thus be considered in the realms of neurodegeneration and iron dyshomeostasis.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

After transfection, the transfection medium was replaced by conditioned medium. When the plasmid HRI-HA Tet-On minZsGreen was used (see constructs above), it was mixed in a 5:1 proportion with a plasmid containing only ZsGreen under the same bidirectional, inducible promoter to control for transfection efficiency (ten times excess of HRI-HA Tet-On minZsGreen). One week after transfection, Doxycycline (1 µg/1 µl, Invitrogen) was added to the cultures for 16 hr before puromycylation. HeLa cells (ATCC) were grown in Dulbecco's modified eagle's medium (DMEM, Invitrogen) with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) at 37°C in an atmosphere with 5% CO<sub>2</sub> and transfected with lipofectamine (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Contamination with mycoplasma was evaluated by PCR (eMyco kit, Intron Biotechnology).

HRI has a lower CAI value than the median for all genes (median for EIF2αk1 = 0.7637 vs. all genes = 0.7995 or kinases = 0.8005) in both cases CAI value for EIF2αk1 is in the lowest quartile of the observed CAI distributions. Compared to the distributions EIF2αk1 has the following percentile: 1.) all genes =&gt; 13.2238 (EIF2αk1 uses more rare codons than 86.78% of the genes expressed in the hippocampus) 2.) all kinases =&gt; 9.5456 (EIF2αk1 uses more rare codons than 90.46% of the kinases expressed in the hippocampus).

The RNA was converted to cDNA using SuperScript IV (ThermoFisher) with a mixture of Random primers and dT15V primers. 1 µl out of 10 µl of the resulting cDNA was used for ddPCR (Bio-rad) with Taqman probes (Integrated DNA Technologies; see key Resources table for the sequences) following the manufacturer’s instructions. The specificity of the primers for the HA-tagged versions of HRI was confirmed by ddPCRs in non-transfected neurons. The mRNA counts of each gene were normalized to the rRNA content of the corresponding fraction (ddPCR for rRNA was performed with cDNA diluted 1:10000). The normalized mRNA content of the fractions 7 to 11 (polysome) was related to the fractions 2–4 (monosome) with the following formula: (mRNA polysome)/(mRNA monosome + mRNA polysome) The disome was excluded from the calculations as its role in mRNA translation is not clear.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>In vitro degradation assay</title><p>200 ng of recombinant HRI (SignalChem) or 500 ng of recombinant eIF2α (abcam) were incubated with 2 µg of purified 20S proteasome (Enzo) in 20 mM Hepes pH 7.4/2 mM EDTA/1 mM EGTA for the indicated times at 37°C.

For single soma analyses all neuronal cell bodies in the image were manually outlined based on Map2 staining (to distinguish from glial cells) and areas saved as ROIs. Hela cell ROIs were outlined based on combined channels selecting a region around the nuclear stain. The image was split into single channel images in ImageJ and the mean grey value for each ROI was measured in the relevant channels. For visualization, maximum intensity projections of the Z-stacks were adjusted for brightness and contrast in ImageJ with the same settings for samples and controls and over the whole presented image.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editor, and the evaluation has been overseen by Eve Marder as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Alvarez-Castelao et al. present an interesting feedback mechanism to decrease protein synthesis during ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) inhibition in neurons. Proteosome inhibition leads to decreased mRNA translation in both neuronal soma and dendrites that was accompanied by eIF2α phosphorylation. Knockout of heme-regulated kinase inhibitor (HRI), but not the other 3 eIF2α kinases, resulted in reduced inhibition of protein synthesis and eIF2α phosphorylation during UPS inhibition. The authors show that basal levels of HRI are low, but increase after UPS inhibition. They propose that the endogenous level of HRI is very low due to degradation by the proteasome. They further suggest that there is also translational regulation of HRI which is due to rare codons in its CDS. Finally, they suggest that the kinase activity of HRI is constitutively high due to low heme levels in neurons.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) It's unexpected and interesting that HRI would be the eIF2α kinase mediating the ISR response in neurons on inhibition of the proteasome. However, it's difficult to accept that only a ~30-40% increase in HRI protein levels is enough to account for the inhibition of bulk protein synthesis by 60 to &gt;90% elicited by PI treatments in different experiments without some other mechanism for activating HRI kinase function, as there are low heme levels regardless of whether or not the proteasome is inhibited. Indeed, there are published results describing mechanisms for controlling HRI activity through dimerization and domain interactions. They should assay the level of phosphorylation of Threonine-485 in HRI, a known site of autophosphorylation in the activation loop and indicator of HRI kinase activity, to determine whether it increases substantially more on PI treatment than the modest 1.3-fold increase seen in HRI protein levels. Alternatively, they could try to show that only a &lt; 2-fold increase in HRI expression in untreated neurons would be sufficient to mimic the effects of PI on eIF2α phosphorylation and general translation, as their model predicts. They show in Figure 6D-E that HRI overexpression has this effect, but do not quantify the extent of overexpression above the native levels.</p><p>2) A major branch of the ISR entails the translational activation of transcription factors, notably ATF4, by a re-initiation mechanism involving uORFs, and it is surprising that they have generally ignored this aspect of the response in their experiments, with only one experiment in Figure 5—figure supplement 1A showing increased polysome association of ATF4 mRNA on PI treatment. Given that the quality of the Western blots used to quantify eIF2α phosphorylation is not very high, and the multiple WB quantifications of peIF2α and unphosphorylated eIF2α needed to determine ratios of peIF2α:total eIF2α, it would be very reassuring to show that polysome association of ATF4 mRNA, or expression of an ATF4 reporter, increases on PI treatment of WT but not of HRI KO cells. Alternatively, qRT-PCR for ATF4 targets could be performed under various conditions.</p><p>3) There are a number of experiments in which treatments are found not to affect the translational response to PI, but no controls are presented for these negative results to convince us that the treatments had the intended effects in their hands, on their cells. In other cases, controls are lacking to establish the specificities of phospho-specific antibodies, or to show that they achieved a clean separation of dendrites from cell bodies. These controls have to be included for the results to be interpretable. These include the following:</p><p>– Controls are required to document that the dendrite preparation in Figure 1H is not contaminated with cell bodies.</p><p>– The experiment in Figure 2—figure supplement 1 should be described explicitly in the text of Results, and controls are required to document that actinomycin treatment successfully blocked transcription.</p><p>– For Figure 2—figure supplement 1C, controls are required to document the specificity of the phospho-specific antibodies and the ability to observe changes in phosphorylation using them in response to, eg. rapamycin treatment of their cell lines.</p><p>– For Figure 3A, it is necessary to indicate the nature of the PKR inhibitor and to document that it was effective at inhibiting PKR activity in the neurons.</p><p>– Controls are lacking for the experiments in Figure 5—figure supplement 2 to assure us that the treatments used to quench ROS, block NO synthesis were effective in their cells/hands. The same goes for the heme oxygenase inhibitors; although in this case, the logic of the experiment also appears to be flawed, as inhibitors of heme breakdown should lead to higher, not lower, heme levels and thus prevent, not elicit, HRI activation.</p><p>4) The results in Figure 6B could be explained differently by proposing that the hippocampal lysate has lower levels of peIF2α phosphatase. This alternative explanation could be ruled out by incubating peIF2α in each lysate (without added HRI) and measuring rates of dephosphorylation over time. Alternatively, they could show that similar levels of peIF2α are produced in both lysates when Gcn2, PERK or PKR are added instead of HRI.</p><p>– What was the loading control used for Figure 4A and 4B quantifications? Also there are no loading controls for the representative western shown in Figure 4—figure supplement 1D.</p><p>5) The results in Figure 5—figure supplement 1C contradict the claim that codon optimization increases polysome association of HRI-HA mRNA claimed from the data in Figure 5—figure supplement 1B, as the wt and opt mRNAs show the same polysome association in control conditions in Figure 5—figure supplement 1C. This discrepancy needs to be addressed in the text.</p><p>6) Regarding Figure 6C, it should be verified that hemin does not stimulate protein synthesis when added to HRI KO cells treated with PI; and that hemin addition suppresses the increase in peIF2α elicited by PI.</p><p>7) The statement in the Discussion that the data indicate, among other findings, that &quot;iii) the initial decrease in general translation leads to an increase in the availability of rare codons (Saikia et al., 2016), further increasing the translation of HRI mRNA&quot; is a plausible scenario but in no way demonstrated by the data. Also, I'm not sure what they mean by availability of rare codons-probably they mean the cognate tRNAs for such codons.</p><p>8) Related to point 1, the statements in the Discussion &quot;Our data indicate that above multiple mechanisms cleverly cooperate to enhance the activity and expression of HRI in response to reduced proteasome activity. These mechanisms make HRI an optimized sensor and effector for sensing and responding to proteasome inhibition.&quot; seem premature, as they have identified no mechanism for enhancing HRI activity, although one might well exist that remains to be uncovered, and document only a small increase in HRI expression which may or may not be adequate to explain the observed translational responses.</p><p>9) The authors examined HRI-HA expression in Figure 4E-G and found it much lower than the ZsGreen reporter expressed by the DOX-inducible bi-directional promoter. Is it possible that the HA tag destabilized HRI? Figure 4F-G: It is not specified how long the Doxycycline treatment was – this should be added. The experiment could be repeated treating with Doxycycline for 1 h to test whether the short half-life of HRI contributes to the lack of detection. Is it possible that there is directionality of the promoter in this situation (i.e., were the cDNAs switched relative to the promoter to see if similar results were obtained?</p><p>10) Figure 4—figure supplement 1B: The loading control is missing and should be added. The figure legend states that the related analysis is in Figure 4D – do the authors mean Figure 4B? It would be clearer to move the representative image (Figure 4—figure supplement 1B) close by its related plot (Figure 4B?).</p><p>11) Figure 4—figure supplement 1E: The plot should show also the quantification of the condition &quot;+ PI&quot;.</p><p>12) Figure 5—figure supplement 2H: Statistical analyses between the PI and the PI+ hemin conditions are missing. Figure 5—figure supplement 2H does not seem to be referenced in the manuscript. It is unclear whether Figure 5—figure supplement 2H and Figure 6C are the same experiment? If redundant, it should be removed.</p><p>13) Related to point 1, the statements in the Discussion &quot;Our data indicate that above multiple mechanisms cleverly cooperate to enhance the activity and expression of HRI in response to reduced proteasome activity.

There are however some additional revisions to the text that should be made to improve the quality of the report, as described below:</p><p>Essential Revision point 1. Regarding the data provided in the rebuttal and described as &quot;Below we plot our imaging data (from Figure 4E-G of the original and revised manuscript) measuring the level of HRI expression (using a transfected construct) and the corresponding nascent protein signal (obtained using brief puromycin labeling) in the same neurons. As expected, [.…]. Consequently, it is possible that a 30% increase in HRI expression decreases protein synthesis by more than 50%.&quot; These new experimental data and analysis should be provided in a supplementary figure and summarized in the Results to bolster the key conclusion that only a 30% increase in HRI expression could potentially decrease protein synthesis by more than 50%.</p><p>Essential Revision point 3: the controls provided for the reviewer's benefit should be included as supplementary data, as they will be valuable for all readers of the paper. Note however that the control data provided to validate the antibodies against phosphorylated 4EBP are hard to evaluate. Should all of the phosphorylated isoforms be reduced equally by rapamycin? Also, an immunofluorescence assay was provided that was labeled incorrectly as an immunoblot and is difficult to evaluate without quantification and explanation. They should cite the literature justifying the use of the PKR inhibitor without confirming its efficacy in their hands/cells.</p><p>Essential Revision point 4: The legend to Figure 6B should be modified to reflect the use of heat inactivated extracts. Also, the conditions for the assays with purified components should be included in the Materials and methods, and the legend to Figure 6A should indicate the use and concentration of purified components. The legends to Figure 4A-B should be revised to indicate the method for normalization of the data (Figure 4A) and to indicate that co-immunoprecipited samples were quantified (Figure 4B).</p><p>Essential Revision point 7: The sentence in the Discussion was modified, but it would be even more accurate to say that the availability of charged tRNAs was being altered, to distinguish this from alterations in tRNA abundance which would be unexpected. Also, in the Abstract it'd be more correct to state &quot;Following proteasome inhibition, HRI protein levels increase owing to stabilization of HRI and enhanced translation presumably via the increased availability of charged tRNAs for its rare codons.&quot;</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.52714.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) It's unexpected and interesting that HRI would be the eIF2α kinase mediating the ISR response in neurons on inhibition of the proteasome.

In liver and blood, where HRI has been studied more extensively, the high HRI protein levels make it much easier to study and we can detect the hyperphosphorylated version in blood ourselves (see Figure 4—figure supplement 1B). The study of this modification by mass spectrometry is also not possible because we failed to identify HRI by MS. We must emphasize that a 1.3 fold increase in an active kinase cannot be qualified as modest, for example the specific activity of recombinant HRI is exponentially related to the amount of protein until it gets saturated (see for example the specific activity assay for the purified HRI from Sigma-Aldrich (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/catalog/product/sigma/srp5321?lang=es&amp;region=ES&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMIyITW2e6N6QIVR9HeCh1aXArbEAAYASAAEgLOdfD_BwE">https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/catalog/product/sigma/srp5321?lang=es&amp;region=ES&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMIyITW2e6N6QIVR9HeCh1aXArbEAAYASAAEgLOdfD_BwE</ext-link>).</p><p>Importantly, in cells eIF2B levels are limiting, for this reason partial eIF2α phosphorylation in vivo is able to fully repress eIF2B function and protein synthesis initiation (Adomavicius et al., 2019).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Alternatively, they could try to show that only a &lt; 2-fold increase in HRI expression in untreated neurons would be sufficient to mimic the effects of PI on eIF2α phosphorylation and general translation, as their model predicts.

We plot our imaging data (from figure 4E-G of the original and revised manuscript) measuring the level of HRI expression (using a transfected construct) and the corresponding nascent protein signal (obtained using brief puromycin labeling) in the same neurons. As expected, the correlation between the expression of HRI kinase and the inhibition in protein synthesis is not linear, the best fit corresponds to a power line. This is consistent with the assumption that one molecule of HRI will lead to the phosphorylation of multiple molecules of substrate. Resulting from this form of dependence, small increases in HRI expression will exert most impact on protein synthesis within a low to intermediate range: when expression is not too low to impact eIF2α phosphorylation, but also not too high because then already most protein synthesis is shut off. Consequently, it is possible that a 30% increase in HRI expression decreases protein synthesis by more than 50%.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) A major branch of the ISR entails the translational activation of transcription factors, notably ATF4, by a re-initiation mechanism involving uORFs, and it is surprising that they have generally ignored this aspect of the response in their experiments, with only one experiment in Figure 5—figure supplement 1A showing increased polysome association of ATF4 mRNA on PI treatment.

We don’t think that ATF4 is a good additional readout, because other pathways can activate its translation, for example mTOR (Park et al., 2017) and the ATF4 protein is itself degraded by the proteasome (Lassot et al., 2001). The ratio of eIF2α vs peIF2α is the most accurate way to measure peIF2α changes, whereas measuring ATF4 or its target genes is indirect and can lead to misleading conclusions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) There are a number of experiments in which treatments are found not to affect the translational response to PI, but no controls are presented for these negative results to convince us that the treatments had the intended effects in their hands, on their cells.

We used a concentration of 1µM for 4h. The inhibitor is so powerful that it even works in vivo by intraperitoneal administration reducing the phosphorylation of PKR and eIF2α in the brain (Ingrand et al., 2007). Similar administration in mice enhances long-term memory storage, including contextual and auditory long-term fear memories (Zhu et al., 2011). Given the profound effect of the HRI KO on protein synthesis levels after brief proteasome inhibition, it is clear that HRI is the primary kinase activated in response to brief proteasome inhibition in our experiments. Of course, we cannot rule out the idea that other kinases could also contribute to eIF2α phosphorylation during prolonged proteasome inhibition, for example. Indeed, we include mention of this possibility in our Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Controls are lacking for the experiments in Figure 5—figure supplement 2 to assure us that the treatments used to quench ROS, block NO synthesis were effective in their cells/hands. The same goes for the heme oxygenase inhibitors; although in this case, the logic of the experiment also appears to be flawed, as inhibitors of heme breakdown should lead to higher, not lower, heme levels and thus prevent, not elicit, HRI activation.</p></disp-quote><p>A useful and robust pharmacological strategy for testing whether a particular pathway is involved in a cellular process is the use of several different inhibitors. This is the approach we have taken. We used several (3 different ROS quenchers, 4 different NOS inhibitors and 3 different HO inhibitors) chemically distinct well-characterized inhibitors (used in hundreds of published studies) acting on the same pathway, and several dosages (data not shown) of each of these inhibitors. It is extremely unlikely that none of the drugs were working at any tested dosage. Additionally, we have measured ROS and NO species directly and we failed to detect any changes after proteasome inhibition (data not shown). We note that the direct measurement of Heme Oxygenase activity is extremely complicated and has low sensitivity and therefore especially challenging in primary cultured neurons. We don’t believe the logic of our Heme oxygenase inhibitor experiment is flawed. In fact, we were looking for an inhibition of HRI activity using the heme breakdown inhibitors. The rationale for the use of Heme oxygenase inhibitors was to test the possibility that proteasome inhibition could activate Heme breakdown, via activation of the Heme oxygenase. We thus used the HO inhibitors as a tool to block heme breakdown and block any resulting activation of HRI. We did not observe any rescue of protein synthesis inhibition when any of the HO inhibitors were added together with the proteasome inhibitor, thus we can conclude that heme breakdown mediated by heme oxygenase does not participate in the global downregulation of protein synthesis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The results in Figure 6B could be explained differently by proposing that the hippocampal lysate has lower levels of peIF2α phosphatase. This alternative explanation could be ruled out by incubating peIF2α in each lysate (without added HRI) and measuring rates of dephosphorylation over time. Alternatively, they could show that similar levels of peIF2α are produced in both lysates when Gcn2, PERK or PKR are added instead of HRI.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, we agree with the idea the reviewer presents. Indeed, to avoid artifacts due to other enzymatic activities than the one we were analyzing (HRI activity), all the enzymatic activities from the lysate were inactivated by denaturation (heating up the samples as indicated in the Materials and methods section). The cleared lysates thus contained only soluble material such as free Heme prior to adding the purified HRI and eIF2α to the lysates to perform the activity assay.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– What was the loading control used for Figure 4 a and 4B quantifications? Also there are no loading controls for the representative western shown in Figure 4—figure supplement 1D.</p></disp-quote><p>Figure 4A is a ddPCR experiment where levels of HRI were normalized to ribosomal RNA. The experiments represented in Figure 4B and Figure 3—figure supplement 1D are immunoprecipitation experiments. In these experiments, one specific antibody is used to isolate (pull-down) the protein of interest (POI). The POI remains bound to the antibody- the antibody is bound to a physical support such as magnetic beads. The beads+antibody are used as bait to isolate the POI from the rest of the proteins of the tissue. The beads+antibody+POI are loaded onto a gel with the aim of quantifying the amount of protein present in the lysate. The nature of the technique makes it not suitable for loading controls, as other proteins (different from the POI) that could serve as “loading controls” will be in the immunoprecipitates owing to non-specific binding to the beads or to the antibody, consequently its presence in the lysate is non-specific and potentially variable and hence cannot be used for quantification. The way to make IPs semi-quantitative is repeating them several times (and of course loading the same amount of total protein to each IP by measuring the protein used for the input by an accurate method- in our case QBIT). The data represented in the figure come from 4 independent experiments, each of them was performed with 6 separate dishes of neurons. Additionally, we present a negative control IP from the HRI knockout neurons. The IPs are done with an excess of the antibody (we calculated the amount of antibody necessary by titration experiments), to ensure the precipitation of the total amount of endogenous HRI and prevent saturation of the antibody.</p><p>We did this experiment by IP, because we cannot detect HRI in the intact lysates. In addition, the increased HRI expression demonstrated by the IP experiments is supported by the measurement of the translation rates of HRI by ddPCR and Polysome Profiling, and by the experiment demonstrating that HRI is degraded by the proteasome. Both processes contribute to the increase in expression of HRI shown by the IP experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The results in Figure 5—figure supplement 1C contradict the claim that codon optimization increases polysome association of HRI-HA mRNA claimed from the data in Figure 5—figure supplement 1B, as the wt and opt mRNAs show the same polysome association in control conditions in Figure 5—figure supplement 1C. This discrepancy needs to be addressed in the text.</p></disp-quote><p>There is no discrepancy. Please note that the normalization in the two graphs is different to emphasize different findings from the same experiment. In the Figure 5—figure supplement 1B we show the higher association to the polysomes of the optimized HRI mRNA in control conditions, and in the Figure 5—figure supplement 1C the change in the behavior of the optimized HRI mRNA in comparison to the nonoptimized HRI mRNA after proteasome inhibition, for this reason both control conditions have the value of 1. To make the figure easier to interpret we have now split Figure 5—figure supplement 1C in two graphs and added a description to the legend on how the normalization was conducted.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Regarding Figure 6C, it should be verified that hemin does not stimulate protein synthesis when added to HRI KO cells treated with PI; and that hemin addition suppresses the increase in peIF2α elicited by PI.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is concerned about potential off-target effects of hemin in the absence of HRI. To address this, we added hemin to HRI KO primary neurons. We did not observe significant changes in basal protein synthesis due to the addition of hemin (Figure 5—figure supplement 1 I-J). Furthermore, the addition of hemin+PI in wt neurons (expressing HRI that can actually respond to heme), showed a significant reduction of the phosphorylation of eIF2α (Figure 5—figure supplement 1 K-L), but not a complete blockade. This is consistent with the results shown in the HRI KO neurons for eIF2α phosphorylation (Figure 3F), and translation (Figure 3C).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The statement in the Discussion that the data indicate, among other findings, that &quot;iii) the initial decrease in general translation leads to an increase in the availability of rare codons (Saikia et al., 2016), further increasing the translation of HRI mRNA&quot; is a plausible scenario but in no way demonstrated by the data. Also, I'm not sure what they mean by availability of rare codons-probably they mean the cognate tRNAs for such codons.</p></disp-quote><p>We have changed this sentence.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Related to point 1, the statements in the Discussion &quot;Our data indicate that above multiple mechanisms cleverly cooperate to enhance the activity and expression of HRI in response to reduced proteasome activity.

We have identified a mechanism for enhancing the activity of HRI- by increasing its expression. We show that in neurons heme levels are very low, leading to a constitutive activation of the kinase. We have now changed this line to indicate “enhance the expression and activity”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) The authors examined HRI-HA expression in Figure 4E-G and found it much lower than the ZsGreen reporter expressed by the DOX-inducible bi-directional promoter. Is it possible that the HA tag destabilized HRI? Figure 4F-G: It is not specified how long the Doxycycline treatment was – this should be added. The experiment could be repeated treating with Doxycycline for 1 h to test whether the short half-life of HRI contributes to the lack of detection. Is it possible that there is directionality of the promoter in this situation (i.e., were the cDNAs switched relative to the promoter to see if similar results were obtained?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that sometimes adding a tag to a protein and the position of the tag can change its half-life. In our initial experiments we tried several different induction times with Doxycycline with the original construct carrying ZsGreen and HRI-HA on the same plasmid. We never saw measurable amounts of HRI-HA expression and we set out to investigate the reviewers’ question. Instead of switching the order relative to the promoter we 1) placed the cDNAs on two different plasmids (to lower the amount of ZsGreen and to carry out controls without ZsGreen expression), 2) compared the expression with the HA tag placed on the N-terminus vs attachment to the C-terminus and 3) compared codon-optimized versions of both N- and C-terminally tagged HRI with the wild-type non-optimized tagged HRI.</p><p>From these experiments we were able to draw the following conclusions:</p><p>With the codon-optimized tagged versions of HRI we obtained measurable expression with long (16-24 h) Dox induction (e.g. data shown in Figure 5E-G). The resulting protein from the codon-optimized version is identical to the protein from the wild-type non-optimized version therefore destabilization by the HA tag can’t be a major explanation for the difficulty to express HRI without the tag. Rather the codon-usage in the wild-type sequence plays a major role.</p><p>Furthermore, we investigated the influence of the degradational component on HRI expression by short time (2hr) induction of either C-terminally or N-terminally tagged HRI expression in absence or presence of MG132 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig4">Author response image 4</xref>). Proteasome inhibition increases (in accordance with our model that HRI is a proteasome substrate) the expression levels of both N- and C-terminally tagged HRI to a roughly equal extent (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig4">Author response image 4</xref>).</p><fig id="sa2fig4"><label>Author response image 4.</label><caption><title>Expression of transfected HRI in primary neurons -/+ proteasome inhibition, after short induction with Doxycycline (2h).</title><p>Left panel shows the expression of HRI tagged on the N- terminus, and the right panel shows the expression of HRI tagged on the C-terminus.

Note however that the control data provided to validate the antibodies against phosphorylated 4EBP are hard to evaluate. Should all of the phosphorylated isoforms be reduced equally by rapamycin? Also, an immunofluorescence assay was provided that was labeled incorrectly as an immunoblot and is difficult to evaluate without quantification and explanation. They should cite the literature justifying the use of the PKR inhibitor without confirming its efficacy in their hands/cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We added a panel with the controls for the antibodies in the Figure 2—figure supplement 1. The 4EBP1 antibody has more than 700 references on the Cell Signaling web page, supporting its specificity. The 4EBP1 phosphorylated isoforms that can be detected depend on the type of gels that each lab runs. The best way to detect “all” the phosphorylated isoforms is to use a bi-dimensional gel, otherwise one can only see a global reduction in the phosphorylated isoforms as we show here. Additionally, we used an antibody that is specific for the phosphorylation of a specific Threonine, the co-occurrence of the phosphorylation in these positions with other phosphorylation sites is not within the scope of this paper. This antibody was chosen because it labels the most common phosphorylation positions in 4eBP1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential Revision point 4: The legend to Figure 6B should be modified to reflect the use of heat inactivated extracts.
