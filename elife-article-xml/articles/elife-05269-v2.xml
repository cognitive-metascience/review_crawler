attachment during mitosis. Bub1 and BubR1, SAC components, originated from duplication of an ancestor gene. Subsequent sub-functionalization established subordination: Bub1, recruited first to kinetochores, promotes successive BubR1 recruitment. Because both Bub1 and BubR1 hetero-dimerize with Bub3, a targeting adaptor for phosphorylated kinetochores, the molecular basis for such sub-functionalization is unclear. We demonstrate that Bub1, but not BubR1, enhances binding of Bub3 to phosphorylated kinetochores. Grafting a short motif of Bub1 onto BubR1 promotes Bub1-independent kinetochore recruitment of BubR1. This gain-of-function BubR1 mutant cannot sustain a functional checkpoint. We demonstrate that kinetochore localization of BubR1 relies on direct hetero-dimerization with Bub1 at a pseudo-symmetric interface. This pseudo-symmetric interaction underpins a template–copy relationship crucial for kinetochore–microtubule attachment and SAC signaling. Our results illustrate how gene duplication and sub-functionalization shape the workings of an essential molecular network.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05269.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05269.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05269.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The genetic material within our cells is arranged in structures called chromosomes. Before a cell divides it makes an accurate copy of all of its DNA. The genetic material then needs to be equally split so that both daughter cells have a complete set of chromosomes.</p><p>As the cell prepares to divide, each chromosome—consisting of two identical sister chromatids—lines up on a structure known as the spindle, which is made of filaments called microtubules. Cells have a sophisticated safety mechanism known as the spindle assembly checkpoint to ensure that chromosomes have time to correctly line up on the spindle before the cell can divide. Once this checkpoint is satisfied, the microtubules pull the sister chromatids apart so that each daughter cell receives one chromatid from each pair.</p><p>The microtubules attach to the chromosomes through a large protein complex known as the kinetochore that assembles on each sister chromatid. The spindle assembly checkpoint monitors the attachment of the kinetochores to the microtubules; and two proteins, called Bub1 and BubR1, play an essential role in this process. These proteins bind to another protein called Bub3 that is also part of the spindle assembly checkpoint. Although Bub1 and BubR1 are very similar, they do not appear to perform the same roles, but the precise molecular details of their differences remain unclear.</p><p>In this study, Overlack, Primorac et al. studied Bub1 and BubR1 in human cells. The experiments show that Bub1 can be recruited to kinetochores in the absence of BubR1, but BubR1 will only move to kinetochores when Bub1 is present. Furthermore, BubR1 needs to bind to Bub1 directly to move to the kinetochores. Overlack, Primorac et al. also identified a region in Bub1 that binds to Bub3, and which is considerably different in BubR1. When this region of Bub1 was grafted into BubR1, the resulting protein was able to bind kinetochores even in the absence of Bub1.</p><p>The genes that encode the Bub1 and BubR1 proteins originate from a single ancestor gene that was duplicated during evolution. Therefore, the findings of Overlack, Primorac et al. show how the duplication of a gene can be beneficial for cells by creating products that have different roles in cells.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05269.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05269.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>cell division</kwd><kwd>centromere</kwd><kwd>kinetochore</kwd><kwd>spindle assembly checkpoint</kwd><kwd>cell cycle</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000780</institution-id><institution>European Commission</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Integrated Project MitoSys</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Musacchio</surname><given-names>Andrea</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Advanced Investigator Grant KINCON</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Musacchio</surname><given-names>Andrea</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The mechanism behind the recruitment of the spindle assembly checkpoint protein BubR1 to the kinetochore illustrates how gene duplication and sub-functionalization can influence the functional complexity of a protein network.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Bub1 and BubR1 are paralogous proteins involved in the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC), a safety device that monitors the attachment of kinetochores to spindle microtubules and halts mitotic progression until completion of chromosome bi-orientation on the mitotic spindle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lara-Gonzalez et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Foley and Kapoor, 2013</xref>). Bub1 and BubR1 originated from a gene that was already present in the hypothetical last eukaryotic common ancestor (LECA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Suijkerbuijk et al., 2012a</xref>). After speciation, up to nine distinct duplication events might have occurred, which invariably led to sub-functionalization of the resulting gene products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Suijkerbuijk et al., 2012a</xref>).</p><p>Human Bub1 and BubR1 are strongly conserved at the sequence and domain level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) but play complementary roles in the SAC. Bub1 becomes recruited to kinetochores in prometaphase to provide a platform for additional SAC proteins, including Mad1, Mad2, the BubR1/Bub3 complex, and Cdc20. Bub1 promotes the assembly of a subset of these proteins, Mad2, BubR1/Bub3, and Cdc20, into the SAC effector, the mitotic checkpoint complex (MCC), which targets the anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) to inhibit its ability to promote mitotic exit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lara-Gonzalez et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Foley and Kapoor, 2013</xref>). Bub1, not in itself a MCC subunit, likely catalyzes MCC assembly by aligning MCC subunits for a profitable interaction (discussed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Overlack et al., 2014</xref>). Bub1 kinase activity is not required for the SAC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sharp-Baker and Chen, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fernius and Hardwick, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Perera et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Klebig et al., 2009</xref>) but contributes to stable kinetochore–microtubule attachments through phosphorylation of histone H2A on Thr120 and subsequent localization of Sgo1 to centromeres and kinetochores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kawashima et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Caldas et al., 2013</xref>).

Bub1 interacts stably with unattached kinetochores, in agreement with its function as a SAC recruitment platform, while BubR1 turns over rapidly (t<sub>1/2</sub> = 3–20 s), likely reflecting its cycle of incorporation into MCC and its release into the cytosol as a soluble APC/C inhibitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Howell et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Shah et al., 2004</xref>). Besides different dynamics, another important difference is that kinetochore recruitment of Bub1 is independent of BubR1, while recruitment of BubR1 is strictly subordinate to Bub1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Millband and Hardwick, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gillett et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Johnson et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Perera et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Logarinho et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Klebig et al., 2009</xref>). The molecular basis for these differences is unclear, because both Bub1 and BubR1 bind a kinetochore-targeting adaptor named Bub3. Bub3 is a 7-WD40 β-propeller that targets kinetochores by binding to phosphorylated Met-Glu-Leu-Thr<sup>P</sup> (MELT<sup>P</sup>, where T<sup>P</sup> indicates phosphothreonine) repeats of the outer kinetochore subunit Knl1 (a.k.a. Casc5, Spc105, Spc7, AF15q14, and Blinkin) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kiyomitsu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Krenn et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">London et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Shepperd et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yamagishi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Primorac et al., 2013</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Bub3 binds tightly to Bub1 and BubR1 via conserved segments known as Bub3-binding domain (B3BD) or GLEBS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Taylor et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Larsen et al., 2007</xref>). By recognizing MELT<sup>P</sup>, Bub3 co-recruits Bub1 to kinetochores in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Primorac et al., 2013</xref>). In human cells, Bub3 is required for kinetochore recruitment of Bub1 and BubR1, and consistently the B3BDs of Bub1 and BubR1 are necessary, and in the case of Bub1 also sufficient, for kinetochore targeting of Bub1 and BubR1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Taylor et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Logarinho et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Malureanu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Elowe et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lara-Gonzalez et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Krenn et al., 2012</xref>). The subordination of BubR1 kinetochore recruitment to the presence of Bub1 suggests that Bub3 may operate differently when bound to Bub1 or BubR1. In this study, we set out to investigate the molecular basis of this phenomenon and its implications for spindle checkpoint signaling and kinetochore–microtubule attachment.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Mps1 and Bub1 are required for kinetochore localization of BubR1</title><p>The SAC kinase Mps1 has been shown to phosphorylate MELT repeats of Knl1 to promote kinetochore recruitment of Bub1 and BubR1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Heinrich et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">London et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Shepperd et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yamagishi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Primorac et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Vleugel et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Krenn et al., 2014</xref>).

Bub1<sup>209–270</sup> targeted kinetochores very efficiently even after the depletion of endogenous Bub1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>). We asked if an equivalent GFP reporter construct encompassing the B3BD of BubR1, BubR1<sup>362–431</sup>, was also recruited to kinetochores. BubR1<sup>362–431</sup> was not recruited to kinetochores even in the presence of Bub1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>.

Thus, even if Bub1 and BubR1 share a related B3BD to interact with the same kinetochore-targeting subunit (Bub3) and interact in a phosphorylation-dependent manner with Knl1, the mechanisms of their kinetochore recruitment are different. This raises two crucial questions: (1) why is the B3BD region of Bub1 sufficient for kinetochore recruitment, while the equivalent region of BubR1 is not? And (2) if binding to Bub3 is not sufficient for robust kinetochore recruitment of BubR1, how is BubR1 recruited to kinetochores?

Additionally, mutations in the B3BD of BubR1 (E409K + E413K) known to impair Bub3 binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Taylor et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Larsen et al., 2007</xref>) prevented kinetochore localization of full-length BubR1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E–F</xref>) and of BubR1<sup>362–571</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>, panels B–C). Thus, Bub3 binding is necessary for efficient kinetochore localization of BubR1 even if it may appear to be dispensable for the interaction in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>). We note that in those SEC binding experiments in vitro in which we used isolated BubR1 rather than BubR1/Bub3, Bub3 might have exchanged from the Bub1/Bub3 complex to reconstitute BubR1/Bub3. Alternatively, the relatively high protein concentrations in the SEC experiments (5–15 µM) may effectively compensate for reduced binding affinity when BubR1 is devoid of Bub3.</p><p>Regardless of the precise explanation, BubR1 clearly requires Bub3 for efficient kinetochore localization. This requirement may reflect a direct contribution to the interaction with Bub1 or alternatively a residual ability of BubR1/Bub3 to bind phosphorylated motifs on Knl1 or other kinetochore proteins. To try distinguishing between these possibilities, we targeted a Lac repressor (LacI) fusion of Bub1 to an ectopic Lac operator (LacO) site on the chromosome distinct from centromeres. LacI-Bub1 recruited BubR1 to the ectopic site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G–H</xref>, quantified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1D</xref>), thus suggesting that kinetochores are not required for the Bub1/BubR1 interaction, in agreement with a previous study in <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rischitor et al., 2006</xref>). This result suggests that Bub1/Bub3 is sufficient for recruitment of BubR1/Bub3, and that the role of Bub3 in recruitment of BubR1 might be direct and not through Knl1. Mutation of the Bub3-binding site of the LacI-Bub1 fusion (Bub1<sup>E252K</sup>) prevented BubR1 recruitment, suggesting that Bub3 is required for a robust interaction between Bub1 and BubR1 on both sides of the complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G–H</xref>).</p><p>BubR1 is important for the SAC and for establishing bi-orientation. We therefore asked if perturbing its kinetochore localization impaired these processes. HeLa cells depleted of endogenous BubR1 failed to arrest in mitosis in the presence of nocodazole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). SAC proficiency was re-established upon expression of GFP-BubR1 but not GFP-BubR1<sup>E409K+E413K</sup>. GFP-BubR1<sup>Δ432–484</sup>, on the other hand, restored a robust SAC response. IP experiments indicated that both GFP-BubR1<sup>E409K+E413K</sup> and GFP-BubR1<sup>Δ432–484</sup> were unable to interact with Bub1 or Knl1, as expected based on their localization behavior. However, GFP-BubR1<sup>E409K+E413K</sup> was also significantly impaired in its ability to interact with two additional MCC subunits (Mad2 and Cdc20) and was even more dramatically impaired in its ability to interact with the APC/C. Conversely, GFP-BubR1<sup>Δ432–484</sup> interacted with the MCC subunits (including Bub3, as expected) and with the APC/C at levels that were comparable to those of the wild-type GFP-BubR1 control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Thus, two distinct mutants of BubR1 both impaired in kinetochore localization have uncorrelated behaviors with regard to SAC proficiency. On the other hand, because GFP-BubR1<sup>E409K+E413K</sup> does not bind Bub3, while GFP-BubR1<sup>Δ432–484</sup> does (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>, quantified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>), it appears that at least in human cells BubR1 needs to bind Bub3 to become incorporated into the MCC.<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05269.016</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Functional characterization of BubR1 mutants.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Mean duration of mitosis of Flp-In T-REx stable cell lines expressing GFP-BubR1 wt or the indicated mutants in the absence of endogenous BubR1 and in the presence of 50 nM nocodazole.

After duplication, the paralogs (i.e., the genes generated by the duplication event) may diverge and sub-functionalize, thus allowing specialization in a subset of the functions originally provided by the singleton (the single ancestor gene before duplication) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Conant and Wolfe, 2008</xref>). The resolution of adaptive conflicts between different functions of the singleton has been identified as a beneficial consequence of gene duplication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hittinger and Carroll, 2007</xref>). Detailed molecular illustrations of this process, however, are rare.</p><p>Our analysis of the mechanism of recruitment of Bub1 and BubR1 illustrates how the duplication of an ancestor gene and subsequent divergence was exploited during evolution to create two gene products with highly diversified and efficient functions, including monitoring checkpoint status through stable recruitment to unattached kinetochores (Bub1), effecting APC/C inhibition through incorporation into the MCC (BubR1), stabilization of microtubule attachment (Bub1 and BubR1, possibly through different mechanisms), and SAC silencing (BubR1). The occurrence of nine distinct duplications of the Bub1 and BubR1 ancestor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Suijkerbuijk et al., 2012a</xref>) likely reflects an extreme evolutionary pressure to separate functions that were originally condensed in a single gene. Investigating to what extent sub-functionalization after each of the nine distinct duplication events of the Bub1 and BubR1 ancestor followed similar or divergent paths will be an interesting direction for future studies.</p><p>Previously, the loss of kinase activity specifically in BubR1 but not Bub1 was identified as a manifestation of the divergence of these proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Vleugel et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Suijkerbuijk et al., 2012b</xref>). Here, we have considerably extended our understanding of this divergence by showing that the loop motifs in the B3BDs of Bub1 and BubR1 modulate the interaction of Bub3 with MELT<sup>P</sup>. A suboptimal loop region for MELT<sup>P</sup> binding in BubR1 makes it depend on an alternative mechanism for kinetochore localization. This alternative is the direct interaction with Bub1, extensively characterized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4 fig5 fig6">Figures 4–6</xref>. By swapping loop motifs, we created a gain-of-function mutant of BubR1 that can bind kinetochores in the absence of Bub1, and a loss-of-function mutant of Bub1 severely impaired in autonomous kinetochore binding. The failure of the BubR1 gain-of-function mutant to complement the depletion of wild-type BubR1 strongly suggests that the evolutionary divergence of Bub1 and BubR1, with its specific effects on kinetochore recruitment, is functionally relevant.</p><p>The mechanism of BubR1 localization depends on a direct, pseudo-symmetric hetero-dimerization interaction with Bub1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). It involves equivalent segments of Bub1 and BubR1 comprising their B3BD/GLEBS motif and a CTE whose first part is predicted to be helical. The interaction of Bub1 and BubR1 requires that each has a bound Bub3. Thus, Bub3 has at least three distinct functions: (1) it recruits Bub1 to MELT<sup>P</sup> motifs of Knl1; (2) it contributes to the dimerization of Bub1 with BubR1 required for kinetochore recruitment of the latter; and (3) in complex with BubR1, it has an additional hitherto unknown function in the SAC. This function was exposed by the behavior of the BubR1<sup>E409K+E413K</sup> mutant. The SAC defect observed with this mutant is unlikely to be a consequence of impaired kinetochore localization, because another kinetochore-localization impaired mutant, BubR1<sup>Δ432–484</sup>, was checkpoint proficient. We surmise that BubR1-bound Bub3 is involved in an unknown aspect of the SAC mechanism downstream of kinetochores, possibly having to do with MCC formation or APC/C binding, as recently proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Han et al., 2014</xref>). In analogy with the role of the Bub1 loop motif in modulating the function of Bub3 as a MELT<sup>P</sup> receptor, we speculate that the BubR1 loop motif influences the specificity of BubR1-bound Bub3 for additional SAC-relevant targets. The fact that the ‘loop swap’ BubR1 mutant is unable to sustain the SAC provides evidence for this hypothesis. The properties of the loop region in the recently discovered protein BuGZ, which contains a B3BD/GLEBS motif that interacts with Bub3, are also of interest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jiang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Toledo et al., 2014</xref>).<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05269.017</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Extension of the template model.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Model of the Bub1–BubR1 interaction. The upper part shows the described KT recruitment mechanism of BubR1/Bub3, which in turn recruits the phosphatase PP2A, to a Bub1/Bub3 complex on Knl1. The lower part depicts a close-up of the identified pseudo-symmetric Bub1–BubR1 interaction, which involves equivalent segments of Bub1 and BubR1 comprising the Bub3 binding domain and a C-terminal extension whose first part is predicted to have a helical fold in both proteins. The presence of Bub3 on both proteins seems to be essential for this interaction, although due to different reasons (for more explanations see text). The TPR regions of human Bub1 and BubR1 bind to non-conserved short motifs of Knl1 named KI1 and KI2, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kiyomitsu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Krenn et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">2014</xref>). (<bold>B</bold>) Extension of the template model. Mad1/C-Mad2 at KTs is known to act as a template for the establishment of the Cdc20/C–Mad2 interaction. This seems similar to the BubR1 recruitment mechanism, wherein Bub1/Bub3 recruits BubR1/Bub3 through a pseudo-symmetric interaction. Ultimately, the entire MCC (BubR1/Bub3 and Cdc20/C-Mad2) may represent the copy of a KT template consisting of Bub1/Bub3 and Mad1/C-Mad2.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05269.017">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05269.017</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-05269-fig8-v2.tif"/></fig></p><p>Recruitment of PP2A<sup>B56</sup> by BubR1 has been recently implicated in SAC silencing through a mechanism ultimately impinging on dephosphorylation of the MELT<sup>P</sup> motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Espert et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nijenhuis et al., 2014</xref>). The apparent checkpoint proficiency of BubR1<sup>Δ432–484</sup> may indicate that BubR1 localization to kinetochores is not essential for checkpoint function, as it implies that substantial amounts of MCC can be generated even when BubR1/Bub3 cannot be recruited to kinetochores. However, we note that this mutant interacts only weakly with PP2A<sup>B56</sup> and might therefore carry an additional checkpoint-silencing defect obscuring an underlying SAC defect. Furthermore, we cannot exclude that residues in the deleted segments (432–484) of BubR1 are normally involved in an intra-molecular control mechanism that couples the activation of wild-type BubR1 to kinetochore recruitment.</p><p>Whether or not BubR1 kinetochore recruitment is important for SAC function, it is clearly essential for kinetochore–microtubule attachment and bi-orientation. Previously, it has been shown that BubR1 promotes bi-orientation through recruitment of PP2A<sup>B56</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Suijkerbuijk et al., 2012b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kruse et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Xu et al., 2013</xref>), which counteracts Aurora B activity and thus stabilizes kinetochore–microtubule attachments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lampson and Kapoor, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Foley et al., 2011</xref>). Our results demonstrate that BubR1<sup>Δ432–484</sup>, which cannot interact with Bub1 and localize to kinetochores, has a strong defect in kinetochore–microtubule attachment that correlates with a defective interaction with PP2A<sup>B56</sup>.</p><p>Dissecting the requirement for kinetochore recruitment of the SAC subunits is instrumental for distinguishing their roles in the SAC from their roles in chromosome bi-orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Brady and Hardwick, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">De Antoni et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">London et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Shepperd et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yamagishi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nijenhuis et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">London and Biggins, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Moyle et al., 2014</xref>). By describing the mechanism of BubR1 recruitment and the role of the loop motif of Bub1 and BubR1 in modulating the affinity for kinetochores, this study fills an important gap. We and others have previously shown that two conformers of Mad2, O-Mad2 and C-Mad2, form an asymmetric conformational dimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Luo et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">De Antoni et al., 2005</xref>). In this reaction, Mad1 acts as a stable placeholder for C-Mad2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">De Antoni et al., 2005</xref>). Once at kinetochores, the Mad1/C-Mad2 complex recruits a high-turnover cytosolic form of O-Mad2 and converts it into the active C-Mad2 form, which targets Cdc20, thus overcoming a rate-limiting step towards the formation of MCC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">De Antoni et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mapelli et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Simonetta et al., 2009</xref>). This scheme, summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>, identifies Mad1/Mad2 as a ‘template’ for the establishment of the Cdc20/C-Mad2 complex, a structural ‘copy’ of the Mad1/Mad2 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">De Antoni et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Musacchio and Salmon, 2007</xref>).</p><p>Even if directed primarily towards a different function (SAC signaling rather than chromosome bi-orientation), we note that this pattern is remarkably similar to that emerging from the mechanism of BubR1 recruitment by Bub1, in which a stable Bub1/Bub3 complex at kinetochores recruits a rapidly cycling BubR1/Bub3 complex. The MCC, made of Cdc20/C-Mad2 and BubR1/Bub3, can be interpreted as a ‘copy’ of kinetochore-bound ‘templates’ made of Mad1/C-Mad2 and Bub1/Bub3 complexes. Whether such templates engage in a complex at kinetochores is unclear but plausible. Even if we did not identify Mad1 in our mass spectrometry analysis of Bub1, we recently identified both Mad1 and Bub1 in precipitates of the N-terminal segment of Knl1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Krenn et al., 2014</xref>).

Cells were synchronized in mitosis by a 24-hr thymidine block, followed by a 14-hr treatment with nocodazole. After harvesting the mitotic population, cells were split in the presence of either 500 nM Reversine for 30 min or with DMSO as a control. LAP-BUB1 or LAP-KNL1 expression was induced for 24 hr using doxycycline and cells were harvested and mixed, followed by immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry. Cells were lysed at 4°C in hypertonic lysis buffer (500 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris–HCl [pH 7.6], 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mM DTT) including phosphatase inhibitors (1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 5 mM sodium fluoride, 1 mM β-glycerophosphate), sonicated, and LAP-tagged proteins were coupled to GFP-trap (ChromoTek) for 1 hr at 4°C. Purifications were washed three times with high-salt (2 M NaCl, 50 mM Tris–HCl (pH 7.6), 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mM DTT) and low-salt wash buffers (50 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris–HCl (pH 7.6), 1 mM DTT) and subsequently eluted in 2 M Urea, 50 mM Tris-HCL (pH 7.6), 5 mM IAA. Samples were loaded on a C18 reverse phase column and ran on a nano-LC system coupled to a mass spectrometer (LTQ-Orbitrap Velos; Thermo Fisher Scientific) via a nanoscale LC interface (Proxeon Biosystems, now Thermo Fisher Scientific), as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Suijkerbuijk et al.

Cells were transfected with the indicated constructs for 48 hr using Fugene HD according to the manufacturer's protocol. Asynchronously growing cells were arrested in prometaphase by the addition of nocodazole (830 nM) for 2–3 hr. Cells plated on 12-mm coverslips were fixed (with 3.7% paraformaldehyde, 0.1% Triton X-100, 100 mM Pipes, pH 6.8, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, and 5 mM EGTA) for 5–10 min. Coverslips were washed with PBS and blocked with 3% BSA in PBS for 1 hr, incubated with primary antibodies (GFP-booster [Chromotek], rabbit-anti-BUBR1 [Bethyl] and CREST/anti-centromere antibodies [Cortex Biochem, Inc.]) for 16 hr at 4°C, washed with PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100, and incubated with secondary antibodies (goat-anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 568 and goat anti-human Alexa Fluor 647) for an additional hour at room temperature. Coverslips were then washed, incubated with DAPI for 2 min, and mounted using antifade (ProLong; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Randy Schekman (Senior editor) and 3 reviewers, one of whom, Stephen Harrison, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Overlack and co-workers report a detailed and systematic analysis of how Bub1 and BubR1 localize to kinetochores and how these proteins regulate cell division and cell cycle progression in human cells. Previous efforts to distinguish the functions of Bub1 and BubR1, two closely related proteins, have yielded confusing results. Overlack and co-workers have carried out a series of well-designed experiments that lead to a plausible model for the function of these proteins in dividing cells. In this model, Bub1 binds Bub3 to form a complex that recruits the BubR1/Bub3 complex. By examining dissecting kinetochore recruitment of BubR1, the authors propose that its kinetochore recruitment may not be critical for its checkpoint function but rather for establishing proper chromosome-microtubule attachments.</p><p>All three reviewers are positive and support publication. One made the following detailed comments and requests, enumerated by figure.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>: How good is the Bub1 (and BubR1) RNAi in these studies?

Presumably not, or the array of repeats on KNL1 would not be so complicated in so many organisms. The issue here is that these KNL1 pull downs are only done with one of the MELT motifs (KNL1 138-168). How representative is this one? Can BubR1-Bub3 bind much more tightly to other MELT repeats or when multiple repeats are present?</p><p>There are many options possible here; the authors should at least address this point.

For example the 1-284 fragment gives very bright GFP-Bub1 staining at kinetochores. Is that due to expression levels, or because the TPR region significantly enhances kinetochore binding? This distinction is important, as the manuscript (e.g. in the Results section) is rather dismissive about the role of the Bub1-TPR in kinetochore targeting. It does seem clear that the TPRs have little role in the Bub1-BubR1 interaction.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>: The tethering experiments are not very convincing as presented and should be improved.

Apparently it is fine for experts (the other two reviewers had less trouble), but even a semi-expert got badly lost. The main problem is unnecessarily turgid and overwrought prose. Keep in mind the following outline: 1) The goal is to understand the differential roles of paralogs Bub1 and BubR1. (Therefore eliminate the first paragraph, or at least move it to the Discussion. This is a nice paper about Bub1 and BubR1, not a disquisition on strategies of evolution.)</p><p>2) Ectopically expressed Bub3 binding segment (also known as GLEBS) of BubR1 does not associate with kinetochores, even though the paralogous segment of Bub1 does. (Is this result completely new, or are there published experiments that come to the same conclusion?)</p><p>3) “Loop swap” experiments show that the loop between β1 and β2 of the Bub3 binding segment accounts for at least some of the differential properties of the two paralogs. The Bub1 loop promotes interaction of Bub1:Bub3 with a phosphorylated MELT-repeat segment from Knl1 (in vitro); the BubR1 loop does not. (These are “pull-down” experiments, which tend to have an exaggeratedly all-or-none character, but the results seem OK to the unpracticed eye. But see the comment on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, above. Interaction properties of multiple repeats are not the sum of their individual properties, as Rosen and others have emphasized.)</p><p>4) Kinetochore localization experiments in HeLa cells give results consistent with the conclusion in #3.</p><p>5) BubR1 with a Bub1 loop does not associate with MCC or APC. These are IP experiments and seem OK.</p><p>6) Bub1 and BubR1 interact with each other. The “pseudo-symmetric” (paralogous pairing need not be pseudo-symmetric—is there evidence for a genuinely pseudo-symmetric contact?) interaction requires the Bub3-binding motif and a putatively helical bit C-terminal to it. The experiments that establish this point are described with such an elaborate layering of deletions that the Reviewing editor found the logic very hard to follow. Please try to condense the text from the subsection “A minimal BubR1-binding region of Bub1” until “Functional relevance to kinetochore recruitment of BubR1” in the Results section, perhaps to half the current length. Would it help to make <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref> both more prominent and more elegant?</p><p>7) The two expert reviewers believe that the section on functional relevance is important, but it reads to the less expert reader a bit like a set of flailing attempts, no one of which established an unambiguous conclusion. Again, try to condense and get to the point.</p><p>In summary, the reviewers will welcome a revised version that responds to each of the seven points above and ideally one that is a bit less florid and therefore more readable. The one experimental request concerns <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> (see above). The other points are either clarifications or requests for explicit mention of data the authors are likely already to have (e.g., information on the extent of knockdown in the experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05269.019</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1</italic></xref><italic>: How good is the Bub1 (and BubR1) RNAi in these studies?

For reasons that are unclear to us and to the rest of the community, it proved very difficult to “lock” Mad1 in a stable complex with kinetochores in human cells, despite FRAP data showing that Mad1 interacts quite stably with kinetochores in prometaphase. We speculate that such behavior reflects a cooperative binding mechanism that is strongly weakened upon cell lysis and solubilization of kinetochores, possibly as a consequence of dephosphorylation of the relevant receptor. Indeed, we did not identify Mad1 in the IPs. However, an interaction of Mad1 with Bub1 was reported for <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>C. elegans</italic>, and in addition we recently reported that Mad1 can be identified in IPs of the first MELT region of Knl1, and that Bub1 is also present in such IPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Krenn et al. 2014</xref>). For all these reasons, we contend that the model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> is quite likely to be accurate. We now discuss these facts explicitly at the end of the manuscript.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2</italic></xref><italic>: There is an important point here: are all MELT repeats created equal?

In a study that is now in press in Molecular Cell, Vleugel and colleagues (laboratory of G. Kops, co-authors on this manuscript) analyzed this question systematically. Their main conclusion is that MELT 1 is among the three best MELT repeats, as far as SAC signaling and the interaction with Bub1 and BubR1 are concerned. Because we show that full length BubR1 carrying the loop swap mutation is recruited to kinetochores in a Bub1-independent manner in the presence of endogenous Knl1, and that full length Bub1 carrying the loop swap mutation cannot be recruited to Knl1 any longer, our experiments with MELT1 in vitro clearly support a general behavior, not one that is limited to MELT1.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><italic>Figure 4</italic></xref><italic>: The expression levels for all the different GFP-Bub1 fusions should be demonstrated by anti-GFP western.

(In those papers, we had already included expression controls for our constructs.) We have added a short reference to our previous work and to the role of KI motifs in the revised version of the manuscript. We include here for the reviewers’ view a western blot documenting the expression levels of the different constructs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Author response image 1</xref>).

As it would take a relatively long time to train a new person to carry out these experiments, we hope that the reviewers will accept our request not to perform them.

It is important to clarify that in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> we don’t want to imply that MCC can only be formed through a template at the kinetochore. The figure only tries to convey the fact that there are two structures, one at kinetochores and one in the cytosol, whose relation appears to be one of template and copy.

The “pseudo-symmetric” (paralogous pairing need not be pseudo-symmetric—is there evidence for a genuinely pseudo-symmetric contact?) interaction requires the Bub3-binding motif and a putatively helical bit C-terminal to it. The experiments that establish this point are described with such an elaborate layering of deletions that the Reviewing editor found the logic very hard to follow. Please try to condense the text from the subsection “A minimal BubR1-binding region of Bub1” until “Functional relevance to kinetochore recruitment of BubR1” in the Results section, perhaps to half the current length.

The style we have used to depict constructs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref> is the same we have used throughout the manuscript, and therefore opted not to change it, but we have harmonized the two parts of the table and corrected some small problems with numbering and length of the constructs. We now discuss the summary table before (i.e. as panel B of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) the description of the experiments with the BubR1<sup>Δ432-484</sup> deletion mutant (now panels C-D, formerly, B-C).

It was important to discuss the behavior of this mutant, as well as its possible interpretations. We have tried to improve the discussion of this mutant, which, we realize, is complex, as it entails the interaction with PP2A, the possibility that the deletion removes an important regulatory intramolecular interaction, etc. With this word of caution, the work carries a whole lot of new, surprising, and very relevant functional data, the most relevant of which is that it allows for the first time to understand how Bub1 and BubR1 are recruited to kinetochores. We also demonstrate that the “loop” regions of Bub1 and BubR1 impart very different behaviors to Bub3, and that they cannot be replaced without fundamentally altering the functions of these proteins, a quite striking manifestation of sub-functionalization. We show that Bub1 and BubR1 interact directly. And we demonstrate that kinetochore-microtubule attachment is crucially dependent on kinetochore localization of BubR1. The latter is not a novel conclusion, but it is obtained here with a “separation of function” mutant of BubR1 that is checkpoint proficient. For all these reasons, we think that this paper will be greatly influential.</p></body></sub-article></article>
