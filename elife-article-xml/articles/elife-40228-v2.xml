We used herpes simplex virus with bioorthogonally labeled genomes to detect host factors recruited to viral DNA shortly after its nuclear entry and found that the cellular IFI16, PML, and ATRX proteins colocalized with viral DNA by 15 min post infection. HSV-1 infection of ATRX-depleted fibroblasts resulted in elevated viral mRNA and accelerated viral DNA accumulation. Despite the early association of ATRX with vDNA, we found that initial viral heterochromatin formation is ATRX-independent. However, viral heterochromatin stability required ATRX from 4 to 8 hr post infection. Inhibition of transcription blocked viral chromatin loss in ATRX-knockout cells; thus, ATRX is uniquely required for heterochromatin maintenance during chromatin stress. These results argue that the initial formation and the subsequent maintenance of viral heterochromatin are separable mechanisms, a concept that likely extrapolates to host cell chromatin and viral latency.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.40228.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cells carefully package their DNA, tightly wrapping the long, stringy molecule around spool-like groups of proteins called histones. However, the genes that are draped around histones are effectively silenced, because they are ‘hidden’ from the molecular actors that read the genetic information to create proteins. A cell can control which of its genes are active by using proteins to move histones on or off specific portions of DNA. For example, a protein known as ATRX associates with a partner to load histones onto precise DNA regions and switch them off.</p><p>Wrapping DNA around histones can also be a defense mechanism against viruses, which are tiny cellular parasites that hijack the molecular machinery of a cell to create more of themselves. For instance, the herpes simplex virus, which causes cold sores and genital herpes, injects its DNA into a cell where it is used as a template to create new viral particles. By packaging the DNA of the virus around histones, the cell ensures that this foreign genetic information cannot be used to make more invaders. However, the details of this process remain unknown. In particular, it is still unclear what happens immediately after the virus penetrates the nucleus, the compartment that shelters the DNA of the cell.</p><p>Here, Cabral et al. explored this question by dissecting the role of ATRX in silencing the genetic information of the herpes simplex virus. The viral DNA was labeled while inside the virus itself, and then tracked using microscopy imaging techniques as it made its way into the cell and inside the nucleus. This revealed that, almost immediately after the viral DNA had entered the nucleus, ATRX came in contact with the foreign molecule. One possibility was that ATRX would be responsible for loading certain forms of histones onto the viral DNA. However, after Cabral et al. deleted ATRX from the cell, histones were still present on the genetic information of the virus, but this association was less stable. This indicated that ATRX was only required to keep histones latched onto the viral DNA, but not to load the proteins in the first place.</p><p>Overall, these results show that using histones to silence viral DNA in done in several steps: first, the foreign genetic material needs to be recognized, then histones have to be attached, and finally molecular actors should be recruited to keep histones onto the DNA.</p><p>Knowing how cells ward off the herpes simplex virus could help us find ways to ‘boost’ this defense mechanism. Armed with this knowledge, we could also begin to understand why certain people are more likely to be infected by this virus.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>herpes simplex virus</kwd><kwd>ATRX</kwd><kwd>epigenetics</kwd><kwd>viral restriction</kwd><kwd>heterochromatin</kwd><kwd>IFI16</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AI106934</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Knipe</surname><given-names>David M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Epigenetic restriction of herpes simplex virus occurs in a biphasic manner, in which ATRX maintains viral heterochromatin after an initial phase of chromatin deposition.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Recognition and restriction of foreign DNA is ubiquitous to all cells. It is imperative that cells prevent foreign DNA from expressing its genes or integrating into the cellular genome lest foreign gene products disrupt normal cellular function. Bacteria possess restriction endonucleases and CRISPR-Cas9 mechanisms to recognize and cleave foreign DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barrangou et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tock and Dryden, 2005</xref>). Eukaryotic cells, however, recognize foreign DNA and redirect existing chromatin machinery to epigenetically silence the DNA by modifying it with repressive heterochromatin. Epigenetic modification of chromatin, such as DNA methylation and covalent modification of histone tails, is critical for regulating gene expression to ensure proper cellular function and expression of regulated genes at only the appropriate times (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kanherkar et al., 2014</xref>). Likewise, epigenetic modifications also allow for the effective silencing of foreign DNA that is often associated with invading pathogens, for example DNA viruses. DNA virus genomes are recognized by nuclear DNA sensors, such as interferon-inducible protein 16 (IFI16), and are subject to epigenetic regulation by host cell factors during both lytic and latent infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Knipe, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Knipe et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Orzalli and Knipe, 2014</xref>). Nuclear unintegrated retroviral DNAs are also associated with nucleosomes and silencing histone modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wang et al., 2016</xref>). Indeed, retroviral genomes are epigenetically silenced even after integration into the host genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Yao et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>Both boon and bane for DNA viruses, viral chromatin enables DNA viruses to establish and maintain persistent latent infections in which the virus is poised for reactivation, but it also impedes productive viral transcription and replication during lytic infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Knipe et al., 2013</xref>). Viruses must overcome host-cell silencing mechanisms for reactivation from latency or for lytic infections to proceed. The double-stranded DNA genome of herpes simplex virus (HSV) is not associated with histones within the virion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Pignatti and Cassai, 1980</xref>). However, during lytic infection, nucleosomes are rapidly assembled on the viral DNA upon its entry to nuclei of epithelial or fibroblast cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cliffe and Knipe, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lee et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Oh and Fraser, 2008</xref>). Newly formed viral chromatin is immediately associated with silencing histone tail modifications, specifically H3 lysine 9 trimethylation (H3K9me3) and histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3), that peak in density within 1–2 hr post infection (hpi) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lee et al., 2016</xref>). The resulting viral heterochromatin acts as an epigenetic barrier to viral gene expression and replication. Consequently, viral gene expression occurs in the regulated cascade of immediate-early (IE), early (E), and late (L) viral gene products that drive viral transcription, viral DNA synthesis, and virion assembly, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Knipe and Cliffe, 2008</xref>). HSV proteins VP16 and ICP0, a viral E3 ubiquitin ligase, promote viral gene expression, and removal of viral heterochromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cliffe and Knipe, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lee et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Herrera and Triezenberg, 2004</xref>). However, the cellular machinery that drives formation of viral heterochromatin and epigenetic silencing of viral gene expression during the early stages of DNA virus infections are still not well described.</p><p>The SWI/SNF chromatin remodeler protein, α-thalassemia X-linked intellectual disability (ATRX), has recently gained attention as a crucial epigenetic regulator of eukaryotic gene expression and steward of silenced heterochromatin. ATRX is also known to play a role in restriction of DNA viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lukashchuk and Everett, 2010</xref>). ATRX and death domain-associated protein (DAXX) together form a histone chaperone complex specific for non-canonical histone variant 3.3 (H3.3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Drané et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lewis et al., 2010</xref>). This complex is critical for maintaining repressive heterochromatin at many repeat-rich regions, including telomeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lovejoy et al., 2012</xref>), pericentric repeats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Elsässer et al., 2015</xref>), and endogenous retroviruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Elsässer et al., 2015</xref>), and mutations in the ATRX gene are linked to a developmental disorder and several cancer types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lovejoy et al., 2012</xref>). ATRX and DAXX are also two of the core components of promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) nuclear bodies (PML-NBs), nuclear punctate structures that have been implicated in a range of cellular activities including the DNA-damage response, transcriptional regulation, and restriction of viral infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chang et al., 2018</xref>). In this context, ATRX and DAXX have been shown to restrict gene expression from DNA viruses and integrated retrovirus DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lukashchuk and Everett, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Schreiner et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Shalginskikh et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Tsai et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Woodhall et al., 2006</xref>). The ATRX/DAXX complex also appears to be important for maintaining DNA virus latency as depletion of either ATRX or DAXX was reported to induce EBV reactivation from latently infected cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Tsai et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>In response, DNA viruses have evolved a number of strategies for alleviating the effects of host restriction factors and epigenetic silencing. The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) BNFR1 protein interacts with DAXX to displace ATRX from the complex, effectively reprogramming DAXX and resulting in the activation of early gene transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Tsai et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Tsai et al., 2014</xref>), while degradation of DAXX is promoted by pp71 and E1B-55K during human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), and adenovirus (AdV) infections, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Schreiner et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Saffert and Kalejta, 2006</xref>). During HSV infection, proteasome-dependent degradation of PML, ATRX, and IFI16 is promoted by ICP0 (27–31). Though ATRX and DAXX have proven to be important host restriction factors, the mechanism of their antiviral activity is less clear.</p><p>While ATRX and DAXX have been shown to possess nucleosome deposition and remodeling activity in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Drané et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lewis et al., 2010</xref>), in vivo studies have largely investigated the effects of ATRX or DAXX depletion at integrated reporter elements or viral genomes during late stage infection, after chromatin had already formed. For instance, DAXX has been reported to promote H3.3 incorporation on HCMV, AdV, and EBV genomes at 18, 24, and 72 hpi, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Schreiner et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Tsai et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Albright and Kalejta, 2016</xref>). While the histone chaperones HIRA and ASF1A have been implicated in the initial loading of histones onto HSV DNA during the first few hours of infection, these reports also demonstrated that HIRA and ASF1A actually promote productive viral infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Oh et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Placek et al., 2009</xref>). Thus, the mechanisms underpinning de novo formation of restrictive heterochromatin on viral DNA remain unclear. Lytic HSV infection provides a temporal reference point that can be used to determine the sequential order of events and dissect the function of cellular chromatin remodelers with greater resolution. Therefore, we used HSV to investigate de novo viral heterochromatin formation and maintenance in the presence or absence of chromatin remodeler and host restriction factor ATRX.</p><p>Here we report on the mechanisms of viral gene restriction mediated by ATRX during the first 8 hours of infection. We used HSV with bioorthogonally-tagged genomes to quantitatively track viral entry and host restriction factor recruitment as a function of time. Along with nuclear DNA sensor IFI16, we detected ATRX and PML recruitment to viral DNA by 15 min post infection (mpi), almost immediately upon nuclear entry. Although ATRX restricted the expression of viral mRNA, ATRX had no effect on the initial formation of viral heterochromatin assembly at 2 and 4 hpi. However, ATRX was required for the maintenance of viral heterochromatin between 4–8 hpi during challenges to chromatin stability. Our findings argue for a biphasic model of epigenetic regulation in which de novo assembly of heterochromatin on viral genomes is ATRX-independent but that ATRX is required for viral heterochromatin stability during chromatin stress, such as replication and transcription.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>HSV genomes colocalize with host restriction factors IFI16, ATRX, and PML upon entry into the nucleus</title><p>To investigate early interactions of HSV genomes with host proteins that could potentially initiate chromatinization of viral DNA, we generated nucleoside analog-labeled HSV-1 preparations that could be used for the detection of input viral DNA in infected cells. First, we prepared labeled HSV (HSV-EdC) stocks by infecting confluent human foreskin fibroblasts (HFF) with HSV-1 in the presence of the nucleoside analog 5-ethynyl-2′-deoxycytidine (EdC, 0.5 µM). HSV-EdC DNA could be detected by fluorescence microscopy after a copper-catalyzed bioorthogonal cycloaddition (click chemistry) of biotin to EdC incorporated into viral DNA followed by incubation with a streptavidin-fluorophore probe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref> ). HSV-EdC genomes were detected as punctate nuclear foci that colocalized with the HSV immediate-early protein ICP4, considered a marker for viral DNA, at 2 hr post infection (hpi) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). We also observed that HSV-EdC viral DNA (vDNA) colocalized with early replication compartments, as defined by immunofluorescence (IF) staining for the viral early protein ICP8 at 4 hpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>). As recently reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sekine et al., 2017</xref>), HSV-EdC genomes that colocalized with ICP8 underwent a morphological decompaction that could be prevented by treatment with viral DNA synthesis inhibitor phosphonoacetic acid (PAA, 400 µg/ml) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>). HSV-EdC demonstrated only a slight decrease in ICP8 protein levels at 4hpi but no differences in either ICP4 or ICP8 levels by 8hpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>). Intracellular HSV-EdC foci were prevented by treatment with heparin (50 µg/mL), which blocks viral attachment and entry to cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bender et al., 2005</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D</xref>). Labeling of host cell chromatin during infection with EdC-labeled viral preparations was not observed. In total, these results validated the use of EdC labeling of HSV to detect input HSV DNA and showed that the course of infection with HSV-EdC virus was normal.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.40228.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>HSV genomes colocalize with host restriction factors upon nuclear entry.</title><p>HFFs were infected with HSV-EdC at an MOI of 5 and fixed at times post infection as indicated.

To measure colocalization of viral DNA and restriction factor foci in host cell nuclei, we first defined nuclear fluorescent foci using a software bot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cicconet et al., 2017</xref>) and then used additional customized features of the software to define foci as colocalizing when the centers were within a distance threshold of 5 pixels,~350 nm (see Materials and methods for detailed description of software). Using this method, we observed click chemistry labeled viral genomes in the nuclei of HFFs as early as 15 mpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The percentage of infected cells increased steadily over the first 30 min of infection. A stable 2–3 genomes per infected nucleus were maintained from 50 mpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3C</xref>). ATRX colocalization with HSV DNA peaked between 40–100 mpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), with 80% of viral DNA colocalizing with ATRX. We observed IFI16 and ATRX colocalizing with viral DNA at similar frequencies by 15 mpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).

Little to no IFI16-vDNA colocalization was observed from 60 mpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). These results indicated that, under our conditions, IFI16 and ATRX localize with HSV genomes almost immediately upon nuclear entry, and while the majority of IFI16 colocalization with input viral DNA occurs between 15 and 30 mpi, ATRX colocalization is stable between 15 and 100 mpi.</p><media id="video1" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-40228-video1.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.40228.007</object-id><label>Video 1.</label><caption><title>3D rendering of HSV-EdC colocalization with ATRX and IFI16 at 30 min post infection.</title><p>3D rendering from confocal imaging data captured from HFFs infected with HSV-EdC at 30 min post infection.

By 90 min post infection, ICP0 was observed to localize to ATRX foci that also colocalized with HSV genomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3E</xref>). Though the percentage of infected cells positive for ICP0 did not change between 90 and 120 min, the percentage of infected cells positive for ATRX foci decreased by more than half (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3D</xref>). This may reflect a period of time in which ICP0 drives the dissolution of PML-NBs; however, the ICP0 antibody exhibited a high background signal that rendered it difficult to perform precise colocalization studies that would be needed to further define the spatiotemporal relationship between ICP0 and ATRX.</p><p>To test whether the colocalization of vDNA with ATRX or IFI16 was due to random events, we compared the distances of vDNA to restriction factors with the distances of random intranuclear points to vDNA. Frequency distribution analysis of pixel distances from HSV-EdC genomes to nearest-neighbor (nn) ATRX foci revealed a non-parametric distribution of distances that had a median distance of 2.83 pixels (~200 nm), within the optical resolution of the system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Similarly, vDNA-to-nnIFI16 foci had a mean median distance of 2.24 pixels (~150 nm) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). We used a custom software script to generate foci at randomly positioned x,y coordinates in numbers equal to the ATRX (or IFI16) foci that fell within a given nucleus (see Materials and methods for detailed description of software). We then compared the frequency distribution of vDNA-to-nnATRX foci (or vDNA-to-nnIFI16 foci) distances with the distribution of distances of vDNA to randomly generated x,y coordinates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

Likewise, depletion of ATRX via siRNA (siATRX) did not change the colocalization frequency of IFI16 with labeled HSV genomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,E</xref>). Interestingly, treatment with siRNAs reduced the frequency of IFI16 foci formation in both siNon-Targeting (siNT) and siATRX treated HFFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), perhaps due to an innate immune response to transfected siRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Whitehead et al., 2011</xref>).

In parallel with the above experiment, we tested the impact of viral DNA replication on ICP0-null HSV gene expression in HFFs depleted of ATRX. To accomplish this, we treated cells with a viral DNA polymerase inhibitor, PAA (400 µg/ml), from 1 hr prior to infection and maintained PAA throughout the experiment.

ATRX and IFI16 are both recruited to incoming viral DNA, but they do so independently and then restrict viral infection through independent pathways. Although ATRX has been reported to be important for H3.3 occupation on both cellular and viral genomes, direct examination of the role ATRX plays in de novo heterochromatin formation in vivo has yet to be described. Despite possessing H3.3-specific chaperone activity when in complex with DAXX, here we report that ATRX is dispensable for the initial deposition of histones and repressive histone modifications on naked viral DNA. But ATRX is required to maintain the stability of viral heterochromatin in the face of chromatin stress. This observation reveals new insights into the specificity of histone chaperone activity and may prove to be important in understanding the complex roles ATRX plays in regulating gene expression, heterochromatin maintenance and telomere homeostasis on host cell chromatin.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Multiple restriction pathways detect incoming viral DNA</title><p>Our results revealed that incoming viral DNA is detected and epigenetically silenced by multiple host-cell restriction pathways. We detected IFI16, PML, and ATRX colocalizing with viral DNA by 15 mpi, the earliest time point at which we were able to detect viral DNA in the nuclei of HFFs. This observation argued that these host restriction factors detect HSV almost immediately upon nuclear entry. IFI16 has been observed to form transient foci at the nuclear periphery during early HSV infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Diner et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Everett, 2016</xref>), but there was no definite way to connect the IFI16 foci to incoming viral DNA without labeling of the viral DNA as presented here. IFI16 colocalization with viral DNA was temporally limited, suggesting an initial detection of viral DNA followed by a displacement by additional factors or modifications, perhaps by nucleosomes which are known to impede IFI16 oligomerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Stratmann et al., 2015</xref>). In contrast, we observed ATRX stably colocalizing with viral genomes until PML-NBs were disbursed by ICP0 around two hpi. We previously showed that depletion of IFI16 does not affect recruitment of PML to ICP4, a marker for viral DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Orzalli et al., 2013</xref>). Furthermore, during the preparation of this manuscript, it was reported that IFI16 does not influence PML recruitment to labeled HSV DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alandijany et al., 2018</xref>). The latter report supports our own observations that ATRX and IFI16 are independently recruited to incoming viral DNA. Providing additional support for this argument, we showed the restrictive effects of ATRX and IFI16 on ICP0-null HSV replication are additive. These results echo our recent findings regarding the additive restrictive effects of DAXX and IFI16 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Merkl et al., 2018</xref>). Together, these results argue that IFI16 and PML-NB components represent distinct nuclear DNA sensing pathways that act in parallel to detect and restrict invading viral DNA almost immediately upon nuclear entry.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Formation of viral chromatin does not require the ATRX/DAXX complex</title><p>Our results revealed that ATRX is not required for H3/H3.3 deposition on viral DNA for the first 4 hpi; however, we cannot rule out the possibility that other histone chaperones or assembly complexes may compensate for the loss of ATRX/DAXX histone chaperone activity, as HIRA does for depletion of CAF-1 (52). In fact, CAF-1 has been reported to compensate for loss of Daxx in murine cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Drané et al., 2010</xref>), and NAP1 can assemble H3.3-containing nucleosomes in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lewis et al., 2010</xref>). However, it is important to note that ATRX and DAXX have roles in promoting heterochromatin that do not require histone chaperone activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sadic et al., 2015</xref>). Because ATRX can also act as a H3K9me3 reader (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Eustermann et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Iwase et al., 2011</xref>), restrictive effects of ATRX and DAXX on HSV infection may not require the H3.3 chaperone activity of the ATRX/DAXX complex during lytic infection. Individual and combinatorial depletion of other histone loaders and nucleosome formation complexes will be required to identify the cellular factors needed for the initial loading of heterochromatin on the HSV genome.</p><p>We also cannot rule out the possibility that the observed effects are due to an indirect effect as a consequence of depleting ATRX. Depleting cells of a histone chaperone will likely result in changes to cellular chromatin and altered gene expression. However, changes in viral chromatin density in ATRX-KO cells are not observable until after 4 hr post infection, so we do not believe the observed to be effects to be the consequence of enhanced global histone mobility. Additionally, we observed the association of ATRX with viral gene promoters by 4 hr post infection. This finding is consistent a direct role for ATRX in viral chromatin regulation. Furthermore, as both siRNA and CRISPR depletions of ATRX have very similar effects on viral yield and viral gene expression, we believe we can rule out off-target effects.</p><p>Our results suggest that DAXX may have ATRX-independent functions during viral infection. Here we report that siRNA depletion of DAXX in ATRX-KO cells significantly decreased the expression of <italic>gB</italic> transcripts during productive ICP0-null HSV infection. Similar dual anti-viral and pro-viral effects have recently been reported for PML (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Newhart et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Xu et al., 2016</xref>), and the H3.3-specific chaperone, HIRA, has been shown to both enhance and restrict viral infection depending on context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Placek et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Rai et al., 2017</xref>). It is possible that DAXX is restrictive while in complex with ATRX but at a later stage of infection, after dispersion of PML-NBs and degradation of ATRX, DAXX may promote HSV gene expression or replication. Our results contribute to a growing body of literature that is revealing ATRX-independent functions of DAXX that may have important implications for viral restriction, cancer biology, and epigenetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">He et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hoelper et al., 2017</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>ATRX mediates HSV heterochromatin stability during chromatin stress</title><p>We hypothesize that ATRX restricts viral infection by maintaining viral heterochromatin stability, resulting in DNA that is less accessible to transcription and viral replication factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Though de novo formation of HSV-associated heterochromatin was unaffected by the absence of ATRX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>), decreased histone retention or histone reloading in the absence of ATRX/DAXX could conceivably explain the observed loss of H3 and H3K9me3 on HSV genomes, elevated levels of viral transcription, and the enhanced accumulation of nascent viral DNA that we observed by 8 hpi in ATRX-KO cells. Decreased histone retention may lead to increased histone dynamics, reduced nucleosome density, and transiently expose transcription factor binding sites, resulting in elevated transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Huang and Zhu, 2014</xref>) and increased accessibility for viral replication factors. Similarly, if nucleosomes are lost from viral DNA during transcription or DNA synthesis, new nucleosomes will need to be rapidly formed and modified with repressive histone tail modifications to maintain epigenetic silencing. These ideas are consistent with our findings that ATRX promotes the maintenance and continued accumulation of viral heterochromatin, both histones and histone modifications, during times associated with viral transcription and DNA synthesis. When viral DNA synthesis was blocked with PAA, HSV DNA in Control cells continued to accumulate H3 and H3K9me3 from 4 to 8 hpi. In contrast, HSV DNA-associated H3 and H3K9me3 did not accumulate significantly in ATRX-KO cells from 4-8hpi, suggesting that in the absence of ATRX, histone exchange rates had reached an equilibrium by 4 hpi. While there may be more than one way to explain these observations, we think the model that best fits these observations is one in which ATRX promotes heterochromatin accumulation by mediating modified histone retention.</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.40228.023</object-id><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Model – ATRX promotes heterochromatin maintenance during challenges to chromatin stability.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Incoming HSV genomes are rapidly sensed by IFI16, PML, and ATRX upon nuclear entry.

It can also be recruited by direct interaction with heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Eustermann et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bérubé et al., 2000</xref>), a chromatin remodeling factor which has been reported to localize to HSV gene promoters during infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ferenczy and DeLuca, 2009</xref>). ATRX may act to recruit DAXX to viral DNA through its interaction with H3K9me3 or HP1 and promote rapid replacement of histones that dissociate from viral DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>). These histones could then be rapidly modified with H3K9me3 by histone lysine methyltransferases SUV39H1 or SETDB1 that are known to be recruited by HP1, thus maintaining heterochromatin composition and density on the HSV DNA.</p><p>Our model is also likely relevant to the maintenance of DNA virus latency. The EBV protein BNRF1 has been shown to bind to DAXX and separate it from the ATRX/DAXX complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Tsai et al., 2011</xref>). That study also showed that depletion of DAXX or ATRX led to EBV reactivation in lymphoblastoid cells. Through its interaction with DAXX, BNRF1 was shown to promote increased mobilization and turnover of H3.3 during FRAP experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Tsai et al., 2014</xref>). The observed increase in H3.3 turnover has been proposed to facilitate expression of viral latent genes and the establishment of latent EBV infection. ATRX and DAXX have also been detected localizing to viral genomes in neurons of mice latently infected with HSV-1 (63). These reports are consistent with our model that ATRX/DAXX promotes heterochromatin integrity to enhance epigenetic silencing of viral genes and proposes that this mechanism may be important for both lytic and latent DNA virus infections. Further studies are needed to define how ATRX reduces the loss of chromatin during times of increased viral transcription and replication.</p><p>This model may also be relevant to cellular heterochromatic loci that are maintained by ATRX. Transcription by RNA Pol II evicts histones which are then quickly replaced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Schwabish and Struhl, 2004</xref>) by the FACT complex, which has been implicated in both the disassembly and reassembly of histone components during transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Belotserkovskaya et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mason and Struhl, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Xin et al., 2009</xref>). The result is a dynamic equilibrium of nucleosome formation, retention, and eviction. Based on our observations of viral chromatin and viral gene expression in the absence of ATRX, we expect that as the level of transcription increases in the absence of ATRX, the equilibrium between eviction and deposition could shift in favor of eviction and result in an apparent reduction in H3.3 and H3K9me3. Supporting this idea, ATRX has been shown to be required to silence transcription of an eGFP-retrotransposon reporter in response to continuous dox-induced transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sadic et al., 2015</xref>). In that study, ATRX depletion had minor effects on the initial establishment of H3K9me3 at the reporter element, but it was required for the efficient re-establishment of H3K9me3 after transcriptional challenge was ended. Similarly, ATRX protected against expression of minor satellite sequences in mouse embryonic stem cell derived neurons upon neuronal stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Noh et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Like ATRX, PML was not strictly required for the initial deposition of histone H3 or H3K9me3 on viral DNA but required for maintenance of heterochromatin from 4 to 8 hpi. PML was recently reported to influence ATRX/DAXX complex activity and loss of PML may increase H3.3 turnover at PML-associated domains (PADS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Delbarre et al., 2017</xref>). Because ATRX is required for heterochromatin maintenance at both pericentric heterochromatin and telomeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lewis et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Goldberg et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">McDowell et al., 1999</xref>), it is not surprising that pericentric heterochromatin and telomeres have both been shown to exhibit high levels of chromatin stability with very low histone turnover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kraushaar et al., 2013</xref>). Consequently, we suggest that a major function of ATRX in heterochromatin maintenance is in stabilizing chromatin density and promoting histone retention. However, increased histone retention is not the only possible mechanism of action. ATRX could also be promoting the re-establishment of heterochromatin in the wake of RNA Pol II mediated transcription, perhaps in a fashion similar to the FACT-complex. Likewise, ATRX could be stabilizing chromatin by inhibiting transcription or replication through a DNA damage pathway. Further mechanistic studies will be required to define the precise mechanism through which ATRX exerts its influence on viral chromatin.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Epigenetic regulation of viral DNA occurs in two stages</title><p>Our finding that ATRX restricts HSV gene expression by promoting the maintenance of viral heterochromatin raises the idea that there are at least two stages of epigenetic regulation involved in restriction of viral gene expression: 1. Initial loading of heterochromatin; 2. Maintenance of heterochromatin during chromatin stress, such as transcription and replication. Although viral chromatin structure is known to be dynamic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gibeault et al., 2016</xref>), before this report, the formation of viral chromatin and the maintenance of viral chromatin were not understood to be separate mechanisms. Importantly, DNA viruses have evolved specific mechanisms for dismantling or disabling the ATRX/DAXX pathway rather than blocking the initial formation of heterochromatin. This argues there may be some role for the early formation of chromatin in the viral life cycle. This is supported by reports that HIRA and ASF1A promote histone occupation on HSV DNA during the first few hours of infection but do not appear to be restrictive during this same period of time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Oh et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Placek et al., 2009</xref>). Conversely, the heterochromatin maintenance mechanism mediated by ATRX appears to act as a critical restrictive hurdle to productive infection.</p><p>The multiple stages of epigenetic restriction of viral genomes uncovered here involve cellular chromatin factors. Therefore, their roles in epigenetically silencing viral DNA may reflect their functions in cellular chromatin assembly and maintenance. Cellular chromatin structure must be maintained during transcription, DNA synthesis, and mitosis. Thus, it is likely that multiple mechanisms exist to deal with each of these chromatin stressors. The stages of viral epigenetic regulation by the host cell as defined here will serve to identify host epigenetic factors that may function in similar host cell pathways, and this knowledge could provide insights critical to the development of epigenetic therapies for both viral and host diseases.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and

Cells were infected with viruses at the indicated MOI in PBS containing 1% (w/v) glucose and 1% (v/v) bovine calf serum (BCS). Infections were carried out at 37°C with constant agitation with 1 hr adsorption time unless otherwise indicated. After 1 hr, the inoculum was removed and replaced with DMEM supplemented with 1% BCS (DMEV) and then incubated at 37°C until times indicated. ICP0-null viral yields were determined by infecting U2OS cells with serial dilutions of viral lysates collected at indicated times. For experiments testing the effects of viral DNA synthesis, PAA (Sigma-Aldrich; St. Louis, MO) was added to the media (400 µg/ml) with 10 mM HEPES at the time of infection and maintained until time of harvest. Actinomycin-D (5 µg/ml; Sigma) and flavopiridol (1 µM; Selleck Chemicals, Houston, TX) were added to cells 4 hpi and 1 hr prior to infection, respectively, and maintained until time of harvest. Cells were pre-treated with α-amanitin (2 µg/ml; Sigma) for 16 hr prior to infection and maintained until time of harvest. To block viral attachment and entry to cells, heparin was added to the viral inoculum (50 µg/ml), and heparin was maintained for the duration of the infection.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout of ATRX</title><p>DNA oligos coding encoding sgRNAs specific for ATRX were designed using the Optimized CRISPR Design tool (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://crispr.mit.edu/">http://crispr.mit.edu/</ext-link>; Zhang Lab, MIT) and cloned into the lentiCRISPR v2 vector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Busskamp et al., 2014</xref>).

In brief, unaltered images were analyzed by the software to detect signal intensity over a set threshold to define foci above background. The software then uses DAPI staining to generate a mask that defines nuclear areas in the image. Only foci above the fluorescence threshold and within the nuclear masks were scored. The software determines colocalization based on the distance between the centers of nuclear foci in a reference channel (vDNA) to foci in other channels of the image. The centers of compared foci must be ≤ 5 pixels (~350 nm at approximately 70 nm per pixel) in distance to be considered colocalized (user definable). An additional MATLAB script uses nuclear masks and foci center x,y coordinate data from each channel to determine distances of nearest neighbor foci in a second channel from foci in the reference channel and generate distance frequency data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cicconet, 2018</xref>). The script then generated the same number of random x,y points within the nuclear mask as were detected in the second channel. The distances from the centers of reference channel foci to nearest neighbor random points was then calculated and reported to within a user defined radius (60 pixel radius for data in this paper) of each reference focus. The resulting frequency distributions of reference-to-test channel distances and reference-to-random points were compared by the non-parametric Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. If the test rejects the null hypothesis at 5% significance, the test returns a value of 1, and 0 if the null hypothesis is not rejected. The test also returns an asymptotic p-value and a list of distances in pixel values which can then be plotted and further analyzed using GraphPad Prism (as it was here) or other data analysis packages.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Jessica Tyler as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Luis Schang (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors are investigating the recruitment and functional roles of host factors that localize with HSV DNA early after infection. Using click chemistry, they are able to defect HSV DNA in the nucleus, and thereby follow the earliest recruitment host factors. The focus of the work is to understand the mechanisms by which host factors recognize, and epigenetically restrict viral DNAs. The authors find that the DNA sensor IFI16, PML, and the histone chaperone ATRX are recruited to viral DNA within 15 minutes post infection. The authors investigated possible sequential recruitment among these three factors, and then focused on ATRX. The HSV genome encodes a protein (ICP0) that disables ATRX, suggesting that ATRX is an antiviral factor. To test this directly, the authors used ATRX knockout cells, and an HSV mutant lacking ICP0. They find that viral transcripts increased in response to ATRX knockout even when viral DNA amplification was blocked. Although ATRX was reported to be a histone chaperone capable of loading histone H3.3 on viral DNA, the authors could not detect early differences in viral chromatin formation. However, several hours later, reduced levels of generic and repressive chromatin were observed in the absence of ATRX. These results pointed to a role of ATRX in maintaining, rather than initiating repressive chromatin. Additional experiments indicate that ATRX is important in stabilization of viral chromatin and heterochromatin in the face of chromatin stress events that occur during viral replication, namely viral DNA replication and RNA transcription.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>We include here the key points raised by the three reviewers. We judge that their major points can be addressed by some limited experimental work and some rewriting.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>The experiments are generally well designed and readouts are appropriately quantitative. The overall findings are limited largely to ATRX, while the overall manuscript is expansive and covers many other details.</p><p>One experimental design concern relates to the host cell status. In measuring early events through such short timescales, it is surprising that there is no consideration of cell cycle, which might be expected to impact a variety of host-virus interactions. The events being monitored are presumably occurring prior to viral gene expression and manipulation of the cell cycle by HSV. It would seem that host cell cycle status could be important for interpreting the findings. For example, ATRX is known to be cell cycle regulated.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>This paper presents interesting new data about the epigenetic restriction of herpes viral DNAs in the early times after their nuclear entry. The data show that ATRX is needed to maximally repress viral DNA expression and replication. ATRX KO cells support more robust virus expression and replication. siRNA KD of DAXX did not further relieve repression of ATRX KO cells, suggesting that they work together.</p><p>The key new information is that viral DNA forms heterochromatin even without ATRX, at early times; but the heterochromatin is unstable without ATRX at later times. Thus, there are two phases to the story. Inhibiting transcription/replication rescues the chromatin loss (really heterochromatin loss?) – the simplest interpretation is that chromatin loss (really heterochromatin loss?) is mediated by transcription- or replication-induced stress. (Other interpretations are possible).</p><p>The basic idea of two phases seems clear and important. I think we do not quite know what is going on when the histone marks are lost vs. maintained, and this is not explained adequately.</p><p>Specific comments:</p><p>Often in the paper a particular factor is described as &quot;required for the maintenance of viral chromatin&quot;. I think this is unclear: one reading of this is that chromatin per se is not maintained – that nucleosomes are removed. Maybe what is meant is that histone marks are lost – and that the factor is &quot;required for the maintenance of viral heterochromatin&quot;, or maybe for the &quot;state of the chromatin&quot;, or maybe for &quot;histone isoforms and histone marks&quot;. If what is meant is histone loss per se, this needs to be clarified. At very late times (8 h post infection) is the idea that there are no histones on the viral DNA? Are viral DNAs associating with other proteins that will coat the DNA in the virion?</p><p>The experiments for this, in any case, are ChIP readouts of H3, H3.3, H3K9me3, and H3K27me3. So could not these data address this issue of order of events? Are we seeing loss of all H3, or H3.3, or just loss of marked H3? Can we extract information from the kinetics (Figure 5)? Maybe one cannot say too much. There is some discussion of the ideas of histone loss and replacement and remarking during transcription and replication (subsection “ATRX mediates HSV heterochromatin stability during chromatin stress”) but it is not clear what the authors really think is going on.</p><p>Comment on factors on DNA:</p><p>The data for the colocalization by IF of viral DNA with ATRX and IFI16, are fine, though the proximity needed for scoring here is probably not necessarily intimate. (The fact that they both become associated with similar kinetics probably does not warrant the claim &quot;that ATRX localizes to viral DNA through PML-NBs and its interaction with DAXX&quot;. Not safe; not needed.) I do find the IF assay rather weak.</p><p>Would ChIP-seq work to study the association? Probably not, if there are no specific binding sites. But this should be discussed, if not tried.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>The manuscript presents mostly through analyses of the roles of the proteins tested, using state of the art and more established approaches. It helps clarifying our current understanding of the silencing of the infecting genomes and explores mechanisms of action. The experiments are appropriate to test the proposed models, and the results are mostly properly presented. The interpretation of some of the results does not appear to be supported by appropriate statistical analyses, and the presentation of some of the results could be improved. The general description of the results through the paper does not come across as in a dynamic context for the viral chromatin (dynamics of cellular chromatin are, in contrast, explicitly discussed). The main points are discussed below.</p><p>The authors state, in the second paragraph of the subsection “HSV genomes colocalize with host restriction factors IFI16, ATRX, and PML upon entry into the nucleus”, that IFI16 and ATRX are among the first cellular proteins to respond to nuclear entry of viral DNA. This conclusion is not really supported. Only one other protein is really evaluated, PML, and it localizes with the viral genomes with the same kinetics as ATRX. In the same page, the authors state that the expression of ICP0 was inversely correlated to the presence of ATRX foci, which is correct but only in the most general terms. There is little change in ATRX foci between 60 and 90 minutes when the cells expressing ICP0 increase from less than 20 to around 60%, and there is a decrease from almost 100% to around 40% of cells showing ATRX foci between 90 and 120 minutes, when the percentage of cells expressing ICP0 does not change much. The text should be edited to better discuss these results.</p><p>The comparison in Figure 4B-C between the effects of knocking down DAXX or IFI16 in combination with ATRX knockout is not well supported. Different MOIs were used in each analysis (3 for DAAX in combination with ATRX and 0.1 for the combination of IFI16 and ATRX). These experiments should be repeated at the same MOI.</p><p>The final model presented in Figure 9, and the text in general, suggests that the authors consider the viral chromatin to be dynamic. However, the word dynamic is used only three times, to discuss either chromatin in general or the cellular chromatin in particular. If the authors indeed think that the viral chromatin is dynamic (as it appears to be), then they may want to clarify it through the text.

The overall findings are limited largely to ATRX, while the overall manuscript is expansive and covers many other details.</p><p>One experimental design concern relates to the host cell status. In measuring early events through such short timescales, it is surprising that there is no consideration of cell cycle, which might be expected to impact a variety of host-virus interactions. The events being monitored are presumably occurring prior to viral gene expression and manipulation of the cell cycle by HSV. It would seem that host cell cycle status could be important for interpreting the findings. For example, ATRX is known to be cell cycle regulated.</p></disp-quote><p>ATRX shows changes during mitosis only, and mitosis is the only stage of the cell cycle where HSV shows any reductions in infection (Drayman et al., 2017). In fact, HSV also blocks the cell cycle in G1 or G2, so there are not many infected cells in M that would be scoring in our analysis and therefore not likely to be affecting our results. We feel that discussing this would likely add too much complexity to the manuscript for a likely small effect.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>This paper presents interesting new data about the epigenetic restriction of herpes viral DNAs in the early times after their nuclear entry. The data show that ATRX is needed to maximally repress viral DNA expression and replication. ATRX KO cells support more robust virus expression and replication. siRNA KD of DAXX did not further relieve repression of ATRX KO cells, suggesting that they work together.</p><p>The key new information is that viral DNA forms heterochromatin even without ATRX, at early times; but the heterochromatin is unstable without ATRX at later times. Thus, there are two phases to the story. Inhibiting transcription/replication rescues the chromatin loss (really heterochromatin loss?) – the simplest interpretation is that chromatin loss (really heterochromatin loss?) is mediated by transcription- or replication-induced stress. (Other interpretations are possible).</p><p>The basic idea of two phases seems clear and important. I think we do not quite know what is going on when the histone marks are lost vs. maintained, and this is not explained adequately.</p><p>As described below, we have clarified the wording on the chromatin.</p><p>Specific comments:</p><p>Often in the paper a particular factor is described as &quot;required for the maintenance of viral chromatin&quot;. I think this is unclear: one reading of this is that chromatin per se is not maintained – that nucleosomes are removed. Maybe what is meant is that histone marks are lost – and that the factor is &quot;required for the maintenance of viral heterochromatin&quot;, or maybe for the &quot;state of the chromatin&quot;, or maybe for &quot;histone isoforms and histone marks&quot;. If what is meant is histone loss per se, this needs to be clarified. At very late times (8 h post infection) is the idea that there are no histones on the viral DNA? Are viral DNAs associating with other proteins that will coat the DNA in the virion?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that we were imprecise in our wording in certain places, and we have revised the text to clearly state that ATRX plays a role in maintaining heterochromatin in the form of both nucleosomes and heterochromatin marks, but a greater removal of H3K9me3 modification.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The experiments for this, in any case, are ChIP readouts of H3, H3.3, H3K9me3, and H3K27me3. So could not these data address this issue of order of events? Are we seeing loss of all H3, or H3.3, or just loss of marked H3? Can we extract information from the kinetics (Figure 5)? Maybe one cannot say too much. There is some discussion of the ideas of histone loss and replacement and remarking during transcription and replication (subsection “ATRX mediates HSV heterochromatin stability during chromatin stress”) but it is not clear what the authors really think is going on.</p></disp-quote><p>We have not been able to distinguish the kinetics of the loss of nucleosomes from heterochromatin marks. We have clarified the language of our model as described above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment on factors on DNA:</p><p>The data for the colocalization by IF of viral DNA with ATRX and IFI16, are fine, though the proximity needed for scoring here is probably not necessarily intimate. (The fact that they both become associated with similar kinetics probably does not warrant the claim &quot;that ATRX localizes to viral DNA through PML-NBs and its interaction with DAXX&quot;. Not safe; not needed.) I do find the IF assay rather weak.</p><p>Would ChIP-seq work to study the association? Probably not, if there are no specific binding sites. But this should be discussed, if not tried.</p><p>To address the concern regarding interaction with the viral DNA, we have added experiments (Figure 3A) in which we use an ATRX antibody to perform a ChIP assay that detected ATRX at viral gene promoters by 4hours post infection in HFFs.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>The manuscript presents mostly through analyses of the roles of the proteins tested, using state of the art and more established approaches. It helps clarifying our current understanding of the silencing of the infecting genomes and explores mechanisms of action. The experiments are appropriate to test the proposed models, and the results are mostly properly presented. The interpretation of some of the results does not appear to be supported by appropriate statistical analyses, and the presentation of some of the results could be improved. The general description of the results through the paper does not come across as in a dynamic context for the viral chromatin (dynamics of cellular chromatin are, in contrast, explicitly discussed). The main points are discussed below.</p><p>The authors state, in the second paragraph of the subsection “HSV genomes colocalize with host restriction factors IFI16, ATRX, and PML upon entry into the nucleus”, that IFI16 and ATRX are among the first cellular proteins to respond to nuclear entry of viral DNA. This conclusion is not really supported. Only one other protein is really evaluated, PML, and it localizes with the viral genomes with the same kinetics as ATRX.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and have modified the text to merely state that these proteins co-localize with viral DNA soon after nuclear entry of the DNA.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In the same page, the authors state that the expression of ICP0 was inversely correlated to the presence of ATRX foci, which is correct but only in the most general terms. There is little change in ATRX foci between 60 and 90 minutes when the cells expressing ICP0 increase from less than 20 to around 60%, and there is a decrease from almost 100% to around 40% of cells showing ATRX foci between 90 and 120 minutes, when the percentage of cells expressing ICP0 does not change much. The text should be edited to better discuss these results.</p></disp-quote><p>We have edited the text to further discuss these observations in more detail. While the high background from ICP0 antibody staining made it technically difficult to perform precise colocalization studies, in general, the period between 60-90 minutes post infection saw a dramatic rise in ICP0 and ATRX colocalization. The period of time between 90-120 minutes may reflect an increase in ICP0 accumulation at PML-NBs followed by the disruption of these bodies. Between 120-150 minutes post infection, ICP0 and ATRX do appear more closely inversely correlated.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The comparison in Figure 4B-C between the effects of knocking down DAXX or IFI16 in combination with ATRX knockout is not well supported. Different MOIs were used in each analysis (3 for DAAX in combination with ATRX and 0.1 for the combination of IFI16 and ATRX). These experiments should be repeated at the same MOI.</p></disp-quote><p>We have repeated the experiment in Figure 4B at MOI 0.1 to match the experimental conditions in Figure 4C. The previous Figure 4B panel has been moved to the supplement. The observations remained the same, and the text was modified to reflect the additional conditions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The final model presented in Figure 9, and the text in general, suggests that the authors consider the viral chromatin to be dynamic. However, the word dynamic is used only three times, to discuss either chromatin in general or the cellular chromatin in particular. If the authors indeed think that the viral chromatin is dynamic (as it appears to be), then they may want to clarify it through the text. For example, the last paragraph of the subsection “ATRX mediates HSV heterochromatin stability during chromatin stress”, mentions a function in stabilizing chromatin density and promoting histone retention, which appears to indicate decreasing viral chromatin dynamics. The authors also state, &quot;before this report epigenetic silencing of incoming viral genomes was thought to be largely the result of the initial formation of viral heterochromatin.&quot; However, several published papers refer to the dynamics of the viral chromatin as important in regulating HSV-1 gene expression.</p></disp-quote><p>We do believe that HSV chromatin, like cellular chromatin, is dynamic. While we did not explicitly use the word dynamic to describe the state of HSV chromatin, we do discuss the ramifications of decreased chromatin stability and the likely increase in histone turnover. The Discussion has been modified to cite a paper by Schang et al. on chromatin dynamics during infection and to reflect this position.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Knocking out, or even knocking down, histone chaperones would be expected to also affect cellular chromatin, which would be predicted to affect the dynamics of the histones (and all other chaperones) and may very well affect cellular gene expression. The paper would benefit from some discussion of this unavoidable and likely effect of the use of knockouts or knockdowns.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with this assessment and have added a brief discussion to the text to address these unavoidable concerns. We have also added Figure 3A showing association of ATRX with viral DNA, adding evidence for a direct effect.</p></body></sub-article></article>
