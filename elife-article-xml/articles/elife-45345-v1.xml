active packaging of the dsDNA genome into a precursor procapsid, followed by expansion and stabilization of the capsid. These viruses have evolved diverse strategies to fortify their capsids, such as non-covalent binding of auxiliary ‘decoration’ (Dec) proteins. The Dec protein from the P22-like phage L has a highly unusual binding strategy that distinguishes between nearly identical three-fold and quasi-three-fold sites of the icosahedral capsid. Cryo-electron microscopy and three-dimensional image reconstruction were employed to determine the structure of native phage L particles. NMR was used to determine the structure/dynamics of Dec in solution. The NMR structure and the cryo-EM density envelope were combined to build a model of the capsid-bound Dec trimer. Key regions that modulate the binding interface were verified by site-directed mutagenesis.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>bacteriophage</kwd><kwd>nanotechnology</kwd><kwd>cementing protein</kwd><kwd>capsid stability</kwd><kwd>homology modeling</kwd><kwd>beta-helix</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM084953</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Feig</surname><given-names>Michael</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM126948</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Feig</surname><given-names>Michael</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 GM076661</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Teschke</surname><given-names>Carolyn M</given-names></name><name><surname>Alexandrescu</surname><given-names>Andrei T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007710</institution-id><institution>University of Connecticut</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>UConn Research Excellence Program</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Teschke</surname><given-names>Carolyn M</given-names></name><name><surname>Alexandrescu</surname><given-names>Andrei T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000958</institution-id><institution>American Association for the Advancement of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Marion Milligan Mason Award for Women in the Chemical Sciences</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Parent</surname><given-names>Kristin N</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM110185</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Parent</surname><given-names>Kristin N</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The structure of phage L's Dec demonstrates a new fold within this family of proteins, and shows modulation of capsid binding occurs through two sites, with site 1 being preferred.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Viral icosahedral capsids are formed from multiple copies of a single or a few types of highly structurally-conserved coat proteins that encapsidate the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bamford et al., 2005</xref>). The minimum number of subunits needed to build an icosahedral capsid is 60 coat proteins, and the result is a T = 1 icosahedral geometry. There is a direct correlation between genome size and T-number for dsDNA containing phages. Building a bigger capsid necessitates the use of more coat protein subunits, and requires that chemically identical proteins assemble into capsid sites with different ‘quasi-equivalent’ conformations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Caspar and Klug, 1962</xref>). For example, in many of the well-studied double stranded DNA (dsDNA) containing phages of the order <italic>Caudovirales</italic>, the capsids use a T = 7 geometry (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). These use 11 vertices formed by coat protein pentons and an additional 60 hexons to create the capsid. The 12<sup>th</sup> vertex breaks the icosahedral symmetry and is occupied by a portal complex to which a tail that specifies host binding is attached. Estimates predict that 10<sup>31</sup> viruses are in Earth’s biosphere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bergh et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Wommack and Colwell, 2000</xref>), with dsDNA containing bacteriophages being the most abundant. These phages have an immense diversity in terms of size and complexity. The ubiquitous HK97-like fold is the building block for virtually all dsDNA containing phages and allows for enormous versatility in icosahedral geometry, that can lead to differences in biophysical properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hua et al., 2017</xref>). To withstand environmental stresses and the internal pressure that amasses as a result of dsDNA genome packaging, some dsDNA phages encode additional ‘decoration’ proteins that bind to the exterior of their capsids and stabilize the virions. How various decoration proteins recognize and bind to specific sites on capsids with different icosahedral geometries is, however, still poorly understood.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.45345.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Cryo-EM imaging and icosahedral image reconstruction of the mature phage L capsid.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of a T = 7 icosahedral capsid overlaid with a black icosahedral cage.

Phages have evolved diverse strategies to strengthen their capsids against the internal pressures resulting from genome packaging. In the well-studied phage HK97, the coat proteins form covalent crosslinks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Popa et al., 1991</xref>) with neighboring subunits, thereby creating a unique ‘chain mail’ lattice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Wikoff et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Duda, 1998</xref>). By contrast in some other phages, a separately expressed auxilliary ‘decoration’ protein (sometimes called ‘cementing’ protein) functions as a molecular staple to stabilize the mature capsids. The essential phage λ decoration protein gpD stabilizes its capsid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Sternberg and Weisberg, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Imber et al., 1980</xref>) and binds at all possible binding sites between capsomers, including positions at both icosahedral and local three-fold symmetry axes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dokland and Murialdo, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lander et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Yang et al., 2008</xref>). Other related phages do not utilize covalent crosslinks for stability, or auxillary decoration proteins. Instead, these capsids rely entirely on stabilizing interactions between protein subunits. For example, a portion of the coat protein called the ‘P-loop’ can create stabilizing interactions with neighboring capsid subunits around three-fold symmetry axes in the absense of auxiliary decoration proteins for many diverse phages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Parent et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Spilman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Parent et al., 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Parent et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Bacteriophages P22 and L are members of the short-tailed phages (family <italic>Podoviridae),</italic> in the sub-group of P22-like phages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Casjens and Thuman-Commike, 2011</xref>). Phage P22 is a particularly well-studied model for understanding the biophysical mechanisms of capsid assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Parent et al., 2006</xref>) and capsid protein structures at near-atomic level detail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Teschke and Parent, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Parent et al., 2018</xref>). The coat proteins of the P22-like phages, like all known tailed phages and herpesviruses, share a canonical HK97-like coat protein fold, one of the most ubiquitous protein folds in nature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hendrix, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baker et al., 2005</xref>). The coat proteins of phage L and phage P22 share 99.6% identity with only four amino acids differing out of 430, but only phage L encodes the small auxillary decoration protein, Dec (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gilcrease et al., 2005</xref>). Phage L and P22 encapsidate similar length genomes and have similar capsid diameters. Therefore, the internal pressures within both capsids are likely to be similar. Dec binds to P22 capsids in vitro with nanomolar affinity at the same sites as on phage L virions, and increases the stability of P22 capsids at elevated temperatures when treated with a Mg<sup>++</sup> chelator in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gilcrease et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Tang et al., 2006</xref>). Thus, the role(s) of Dec in the life cycle of phage L compared to P22 is not immediately obvious, and, unlike gpD in phage λ, Dec is not essential to withstand genomic packaging forces in phage L virions (E. Gilcrease and S. Casjens, unpublished). The reasons why some phages require stabilization mechanisms such as decoration proteins, and others do not, despite using highly similar functional capsid building blocks remain poorly understood.</p><p>Like phage λ’s cementing protein gpD, phage L’s Dec binds as a homotrimer only to mature particles, and not precursor procapsids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gilcrease et al., 2005</xref>). This indicates that the proteins are not involved in capsid assembly but recognize specific surface topology features of mature capsids. During maturation, dsDNA-containing phage and herpesvirus capsids undergo expansion and massive conformational changes, stabilizing the particles and exposing new residues to the surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Teschke and Parent, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Veesler and Johnson, 2012</xref>). The T = 7 organization of P22 and phage L capsids results in different protein environments between neighboring capsomers due to the previously described ‘quasi-equivalence’ constraints (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). At the center of each of the capsid’s 20 icosahedral facets, there is a symmetric trimeric interaction formed by the three surrounding hexons (called the ‘icosahedral three-fold’ axis; black triangle in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Between other hexons there are ‘quasi-three-fold’ symmetry axes (magenta circles in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), which have a sublty different arrangement than the icosahedral three-fold symmetry axes. These quasi-three-fold sites are less symmetric and have bent contacts between capsomers when compared with an icosahedral-three-fold symmetry site. Lastly, there is a second type of quasi-three-fold symmetry site that occurs between hexons and the pentons (green circles in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Tight binding (~nM affinity) of Dec occurs at only quasi-three-fold axes between hexons (magenta circles). In contrast to other types of cementing proteins, binding of Dec to the 20 ‘true’ icosahedral three-fold symmetry axes (black triangles in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) occurs only weakly. The binding affinity for the true three-folds is at least an order of magnitude lower than for the quasi-three-folds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Parent et al., 2012b</xref>), so that the former sites are very sparsely occupied by Dec on the native phage L particles. No binding has been detected at the quasi-three-fold sites surrounding the pentons (green circles) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Tang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Parent et al., 2012b</xref>). Dec’s ability to bind discriminately is in sharp contrast with the decoration proteins of other phages that fully saturate all symmetry-related sites in mature virions.</p><p>Defining the mechanisms by which different decoration proteins, such as gpD and Dec, bind viral particle surfaces is not only important for understanding the underlying biology, but is also critical for (1) the potential exploitation of phages in nanomedicine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Tao et al., 2018b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Tao et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Vernhes et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Asija and Teschke, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Serwer and Wright, 2018</xref>), (2) structure-guided design of virus-inspired nanomaterials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Sharma et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Parent et al., 2012b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Douglas and Young, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Schwarz et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">McCoy et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Catalano, 2018</xref>), and (3) shedding light on capsid assembly and stabilization processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Teschke and Parent, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Suhanovsky and Teschke, 2015</xref>). We report the structure of phage L Dec protein, which has a novel fold for a decoration protein and propose an explanation for how Dec may be able to bind to subtly different capsid binding sites. We used a combination of structural approaches to understand how Dec interacts with phage capsids including (1) cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and three-dimensional image reconstructions (3DR) of native phage L particles, (2) Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) structure and dynamics of Dec in solution, and (3) computational modeling of the Dec trimer. Dec displays significant asymmetry and flexibility when bound to capsids. The N-terminal globular domain of the protein that contacts the capsid has an <underline>O</underline>ligonucleotide/oligosaccharide-<underline>B</underline>inding structure (OB-fold; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Murzin, 1993</xref>), and the C-terminal portion of Dec is comprised of a putative three-stranded β-helix domain. Several key residues within both the phage L coat protein lattice and the Dec trimer are predicted from our structural model to modulate the affinity of Dec binding. The contributions of these residues toward Dec binding were probed by site-directed mutagenesis. Our findings reveal that Dec uses a binding mechanism that is not shared by other known phages and viruses, uncovering new insights into phage biology and stabilization mechanisms. The combination of these results provides a highly tunable and novel platform for future uses in virus-inspired nanodesign.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Cryo-EM structure of phage L at near-atomic resolution</title><p>As a first step toward understanding the mechanism by which Dec binds to phage L, we determined the structure of native phage L capsids using cryo-EM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Local resolution analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cardone et al., 2013</xref>) shows that some areas of the map are better resolved than others, including the capsid proteins and the base of the Dec trimer, whereas the distal end of Dec is at much lower resolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Both the overall protein structure, as well as the specific contact points for attachment of Dec trimers to the coat protein subunits are clearly discernable near quasi-three-fold symmetry axes between hexons. As anticipated from previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Tang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Parent et al., 2012b</xref>), Dec very sparsely occupied icosahedral three-fold symmetry sites in phage L virions (data not shown), with only a hint of very weak density observed at these positions and no Dec occupancy at the alternative quasi-three-fold sites between hexons and pentons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

Upon initial docking, we found small discrepancies between the phage L capsid cryo-EM density and the P22 coat protein asymmetric unit structure. Therefore, to optimally fit the cryo-EM density we refined the phage L asymmetric unit where each capsid protein was allowed to move independently in the cryo-EM density envelope using the program Phenix (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).

The five-stranded OB-fold β-barrel is closed by an antiparallel pairing between strand β1 and β4, and a short parallel pairing between stands β3 and β5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Murzin, 1993</xref>). In the Dec structure the anti-parallel pairing of stands β1 and β4 is conserved, but strands β3 and β5 are too distant (~13 Å) for any H-bond contacts. Thus, the Dec β-sheet is distorted to a more open structure compared with the classical five-stranded OB-fold β-barrel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). In general, the cores of OB-fold β-barrels are consolidated by three layers of hydrophobic residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Murzin, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alexandrescu et al., 1995</xref>). This arrangement is also present in the Dec structure (not shown). The canonical role of the helix αOB is to provide a ‘hydrophobic plug’ for the bottom hydrophobic layer of the β-barrel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Murzin, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alexandrescu et al., 1995</xref>).

As we previously observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Parent et al., 2012b</xref>), the N-terminal domain forms the legs of the Dec ‘tripod’ that are bound to the capsid, and the C-terminal region forms its protruding central stalk. The ordered N-terminal domain was not sufficient to fill the entire density within the cryo-EM map. Moreover, fitting the structured N-terminal OB-fold region of the protein into the density showed little or no inter-subunit trimer contacts from the first 77 residues of Dec. Thus, the C-terminus of Dec, evident as a spike in cryo-EM maps of capsid-bound Dec (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Parent et al., 2012b</xref>), becomes ordered either upon Dec trimerization or capsid binding.</p><p>We used a combination of the NMR structure and homology modeling to build a model of the capsid-bound Dec trimer using the cryo-EM density map as a guide. We initially docked the NMR-derived OB-fold portion of the Dec structure (residues 10–77) into the segmented cryo-EM density, independently fitting three copies of the OB-fold. Using Phenix, each copy was refined by flexible fitting to accommodate the slight differences in the asymmetric trimer density. We then built a complete trimer by using a combination of homology modeling and flexible fitting to refine the C-terminal portion of Dec separately from that of the OB-fold. Sequence homology of the C-terminus most closely matched a fragment from the bacteriophage T4 trimeric proximal long tail fiber protein gp34 (PDB ID: 4UXE; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Granell et al., 2017</xref>) (see Materials and methods for details), and was fit to the segmented cryo-EM density. In brief, the C-terminal domain (residues 78–134) was modeled as a three-stranded β-helix domain based on the remote homology model, consistent with predicted secondary structures of the tail fiber protein gp34, and to fit the cylindrical shape of the cryo-EM density for the C-terminal domain. The C-terminus of the final trimeric Dec structure was then further refined using partially flexible fitting preserving the β-helix domain as a rigid unit within the cryo-EM density envelope (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). These residues are predicted with a lower confidence owing to the flexibility and lower resolution within that portion of the structure and were refined using the Cα backbone only in this region.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.45345.013</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Fitting the NMR OB-fold into the cryo-EM map and model of the trimer.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Side B) top-down, and C) bottom-up views of the Dec trimer model fit into the cryo-EM density map with individual chains colored magenta, cyan, and green.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-45345-fig4-v1.tif"/></fig></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Mutagenesis of P22 coat protein and Dec reveals key residues that modulate binding</title><p>The OB-fold of Dec, as determined by NMR, fits the cryo-EM map of the ‘tripod’ legs in the native phage L virion very well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). This allowed us to fit models of several coat protein subunits and Dec to analyze the Dec-coat protein binding interface. The resolution of the coat protein in the cryo-EM map in this region was sufficient to fit some bulky side chains. Furthermore, the NMR structure allowed us to make predictions regarding the side chain orientation of Dec residues that potentially bind to coat protein. Analysis of the binding interface revealed several residues in close contact between the phage L coat protein and Dec that appear to be important for binding. Therefore, we tested our models using site-directed mutagenesis of phage P22 coat protein. P22 is a very well-established model system with a variety of molecular tools readily available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Teschke and Parent, 2010</xref>). Previous work has shown that P22 and phage L behave similarly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gilcrease et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Tang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Parent et al., 2012b</xref>) and all the amino acid substitutions found in phage L have even been identified occasionally in P22 stocks as phenotypically silent mutations (Teschke lab, unpublished data). Lastly, as Dec bound to P22 is a widely used system for a variety of nanomaterials applications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Sharma et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Schwarz et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">McCoy et al., 2018</xref>), identifying key residues that contribute to Dec interactions with P22 is highly useful for practical applications. Therefore, we felt it reasonable to use the established genetics of P22 as a model for the native phage L for our mutagenesis studies.</p><p>Previous work suggested that Dec binding to P22 capsids is driven primarily through electrostatic interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Schwarz et al., 2015</xref>), and our data also suggest a charged binding interface. To assess the role of specific coat protein surface residues in modulating Dec binding, the following five coat protein residues in potential close contact with Dec were chosen for single amino acid substitution by site-directed mutagenesis: E81R, P82S, R299E, P322S, and E323R (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">Video 3</xref>).

Cells carrying the plasmid were infected with phages having a nonsense mutation in gene <italic>5</italic> (encodes coat protein), so that any phages produced are the result of complementation by the coat gene expressed from the plasmid.

For example, residues E81, P82, and R299 from the coat protein subunits that form the quasi-three-fold symmetry axes (grey subunits in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) contact Dec from one subunit, whereas residues P322 and E323 contact Dec from adjacent and overlapping coat protein subunits (black subunits in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). To assess the role that specific Dec residues play in capsid binding, we also made five single amino acid substitutions in recombinant Dec protein: K30D, Y31A, Y49E, Y71A, and E73R (see Materials and methods). Modified Dec proteins were added to mature WT phage particles, complexes were purified using CsCl gradients, and relative amount of each Dec protein bound to virions was quantitated. The global secondary structure of all Dec variants was indistinguishable from the WT protein by circular dichroism. Furthermore, native gel experiments performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Newcomer et al., 2018</xref>) showed that all Dec variants assemble as trimers in solution. Therefore, any changes in Dec occupancy in the variants are likely due to a disruption of the binding interface, rather than protein folding defects.</p><p>Among the five coat protein changes, coat amino acid substitutions E81R and E323R attenuated but did not completely abolish Dec-binding ability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B,C</xref>). We created a variant containing both amino acid substitutions, E81R:E323R, which displayed less Dec binding (&lt;20%) than each of the individual substitutions. Since the E81R:E323 double mutant affects both Dec-binding sites, our data indicate that the binding interface involves more than these two residues. It is also possible that given the inherent asymmetry in the capsid quasi three-fold binding sites for Dec because they are formed by coat proteins in two distinct quasi-equivalent conformations, not all chains of the Dec trimer have equal effects form the amino acid substitutions. Dec with amino acid substitutions K30D and Y49E displayed lower binding than the WT protein, consistent with the prediction of an electrostatic binding interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">Video 3</xref>).</p><p>The close contact region between Dec and coat protein can be thought of as including two binding sites. One site includes coat residues E81 and P82 that interact with Dec residues K30, Y31 and Y49 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, ‘site 1’). Dec residue Y49 is directed toward the side chain of coat residue E81. The other site includes Dec residues Y71 and E73 and coat residues P322, E323 and R299 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, ‘site 2’). Overall, variations in site 1 had the largest effect on binding. In Dec, site 1 residues K30 and Y49 had the largest effect on binding saturation, and in coat protein site 1 residue E81R had the largest effect relative to the other substitutions. Although site 1 clearly plays a strong role in modulating Dec binding, coat residue E323R that occupies site 2 had a modest but reproducible effect. We conclude that the site 1 plays a larger role in mediating Dec binding to coat protein, and is largely due to electrostatic interactions.</p><p>We also tested our hypothesis by making substitutions in coat protein residues that contact Dec near, but not within sites 1 and 2. As expected, these did not reduce binding (namely coat residues P82S, R299E and P322S; we intentionally made conservative substitutions for prolines as coat protein is highly aggregation prone; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Teschke and Parent, 2010</xref>). Similarly changes in Dec near, but not within sites 1 and 2, also did not reduce binding, including Y31A, Y71A, and E73R. These observations are consistent in light of the 3D capsid structure, and indicates that sites 1 and 2 are the true binding sites.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Decoration proteins employ a variety of binding schemes to adhere to phage capsids</title><p>For dsDNA tailed phages and related viruses, decoration proteins can occupy the capsid lattice in several different positions. Some decoration proteins bind capsids at the center of hexamers including those of phages T4, T5, RB49, and Sf13 through Sf19, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Vernhes et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Doore et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sathaliyawala et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Fokine et al., 2011</xref>). Other decoration proteins bind the edges of hexamers as exemplified by gp17 in phage N4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Choi et al., 2008</xref>). Finally, there are decoration proteins that bind the capsid in areas between capsomers such as gpD in λ, gp56 in phage TW1, Soc in phage T4, gp87 in phage P74-26, and Dec in phage L (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lander et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Tang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Wang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Qin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Stone et al., 2018</xref>). In all the aforementioned cases, the decoration proteins are added after capsid assembly. Conversely, the herpesvirus heterotrimeric triplex protein decorates the outside of the capsid and is also essential during capsid assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Zhou et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Heming et al., 2017</xref>). For the majority of these examples, all possible quasi-equivalent binding sites on the lattice are occupied by the decoration proteins. By contrast, in phage L, Dec uniquely binds at one type of symmetry axis with high affinity: the quasi-three-fold sites between hexamers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><p>To function in a stabilizing capacity, decoration proteins must bind capsids with high enough affinity to remain associated even under harsh environmental conditions. As described above, there are many potential binding sites on capsids, so the requirement for Dec binding affinity must be balanced against binding specificity, to allow discrimination between binding sites. Indeed, there is a wide range of reported K<sub>D</sub>s for various decoration proteins. Phage L’s Dec and T4’s Hoc bind their respective capsids with nM affinity, whereas pb10 binds phage T5 with pM affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Parent et al., 2012b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Vernhes et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Shivachandra et al., 2006</xref>). Taken together, variations in binding affinities and saturating versus discriminating binding behavior suggests that decoration proteins are capable of recognizing subtle differences in capsid lattices. The reason some decoration proteins evolved to discriminate between similar quasi-equivalent sites is unknown, but at some positions on the capsid lattice coat-coat interactions may be stronger than at other quasi-equivalent positions; therefore, some positions may not require stabilization from a decoration protein. Yet, other positions may be more vulnerable to environmental assaults than others, and benefit from additional stabilization.</p><p>How might Dec discriminate between the different three-fold sites on phage L? <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> shows a comparison of the coat protein subunits surrounding two types of quasi three-fold axes. Coat residues that interact with Dec, in particular E81 (see above), shows a substantial difference in position at these different capsid locations. At the quasi three-fold site between hexons, coat protein residue E81 clearly interacts with Dec binding site 1 at all three subunits in Dec. However, at the quasi three-fold site between hexons and pentons, the environments surrounding E81 are spread further away from the Dec-binding site: if one coat monomer were aligned to a Dec monomer, E81 would be 7.3 and 10.4 Å away in the other two coat protein chains, respectively, which is too great a distance to allow binding. By contrast, at the icosahedral three-fold binding interface, the E81 residue is within 4 Å of the Dec binding site 1 for two out of three monomers. Only E81 in the third subunit is significantly distant from the Dec binding site 1 (8.8Å away). These coat protein topology differences are likely responsible for the failure of Dec to bind to the type of quasi three-fold site surrounding pentamers and the different Dec-binding affinity from the icosahedral three-fold site as measured in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Parent et al., 2012b</xref>). The coat protein subunits surrounding the quasi three-fold symmetry axes between pentamers and hexamers (green circles in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) that do not bind Dec have the greatest surface curvature with highly bent contacts between capsomers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). These interfaces are a weak point in many capsids as perturbations such as chemical or thermal treatments can cause entire pentamers to be released from the capsid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Parent et al., 2012b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Teschke et al., 2003</xref>). The quasi three-fold coat protein subunits between hexamers that do bind Dec also have some curvature, but it is less extreme than the quasi three-folds between pentamers and hexamers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), likely why Dec can bind here, albeit at orders of magnitude lower affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Parent et al., 2012b</xref>). By contrast, the icosahedral three-folds sites are the flattest, and although some capsids use decoration proteins to stabilize this interface, Dec is not used this way in native phage L particles, indicating a potential difference in the role of Dec compared to other decoration proteins. Biophysical measurements have shown that Dec plays a much larger role in stabilizing dsDNA-containing heads compared to empty capsids, and atomic force microscopy experiments showed Dec indeed binds capsids at positions most prone to mechanical damage (i.e. quasi three-fold sites between hexons) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Llauró et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, Dec binds specifically at the quasi three-fold axes between hexamers via specific residues within the key binding site (Dec site 1), and displacement of the corresponding binding partner residues within the capsid lattice decreases binding affinity at other capsid locations. Although Dec has been shown to stabilize capsids, perhaps this is not its only function (see further discussion below).</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.45345.016</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Comparison of Dec-binding residues at various three-fold symmetry sites on the phage L capsid.</title><p>The topology of six coat protein subunits surrounding the different three-fold positions were compared using the Match tool in Chimera.

A second, more common type of decoration protein, exemplified by phage lambda’s gpD, P74-26’s gp87, phage 21’s SHP, and TW1 gp56, have similar polypeptide folds and form a symmetric trimer with an N-terminal β-tulip domain and an α/β subdomain that binds and stabilizes capsids through hydrophobic interfaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Stone et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lambert et al., 2017</xref>). Additionally, some decoration proteins are known to bind the center of hexamers, as exemplified by protein Psu in phage P4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Isaksen et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dokland et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Banerjee et al., 2012</xref>). Our work shows that Dec represents a fourth type of decoration protein fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), the OB-fold, as well as a different capsid-binding mechanism that discriminates between quasi three-fold capsid-binding sites between pentamers and hexamers, and the icosahedral three-fold sites. To our knowledge, Dec represents the first occurrence of an OB-fold structure in a virus decoration/cementing protein. Dec may have additional functions besides capsid stabilization. For example, Dec could play a role in cell adhesion. Preliminary evidence suggests that Dec might bind to target cells, presumably through carbohydrate moieties emanating from the target cell surfaces (Teschke lab, unpublished data). From a structural point of view, both the OB-fold part of Dec and the C-terminal beta-helix could be carbohydrate-binding motifs. However, future work will be needed to fully explore and validate this hypothesis. If Dec plays a role in cell surface binding, 60 Dec trimers rather than the saturating 140 must be sufficient for this function.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Dec binds phage L capsids with an unusual strategy</title><p>Crystal structures for gpD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Yang et al., 2000</xref>), gp87 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Stone et al., 2018</xref>), and SHP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Forrer et al., 2004</xref>) lack resolution for several N-terminal residues, indicating that these regions are flexible when these decoration proteins are not associated with capsids. Cryo-EM maps of gpD in native phage λ show that the N-terminus becomes highly ordered when gpD is in a bound conformation, and that the N-terminus is the major part of the capsid-binding mechanism as the N-terminus forms a stabilizing β-sheet with strands supplied from the capsid protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lander et al., 2008</xref>). Like gpD, the N-terminus of the Dec monomer is disordered in solution as shown here by NMR. However, unlike gpD, our data indicates that the Dec N-terminus remains rather flexible in the capsid-bound form since there is (1) no cryo-EM density that is attributable to the first 10 residues, (2) our previous cryo-EM data show the N-terminus of Dec can be labeled with large cargo such as nanogold beads that are rather flexibly bound to the capsid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Parent et al., 2012b</xref>), and (3) deletion of the first 11 residues of Dec does not affect capsid binding affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Schwarz et al., 2015</xref>). When we compare the phage L Dec binding motif to the capsid stabilization mechanism in HK97, we see that the residues that control Dec binding occupy similar spatial positions as the HK97 crosslinking residues that crosslink to form the lattice ‘chainmail’, suggesting that stabilization at this type of interface is crucial to capsid stability.</p><p>Furthermore, comparison of Dec to the β-tulip family of decoration proteins highlights some interesting implications about binding affinity and selectivity of binding locations in terms of symmetry of the auxiliary proteins involved. Perfect trimeric symmetry in a bound decoration protein may allow a broader binding specificity. For example, gpD and gp87 are highly symmetric trimers and these decoration proteins occupy all quasi-equivalent binding sites including icosahedral three fold symmetry axes and also both types of quasi-three-fold sites. By contrast, the asymmetry in the bound Dec trimer evinced by cryo-EM is an unusual property among decoration proteins and correlates with its binding selectivity to only the quasi three-fold sites between hexamers. Dec appears to represent a separate evolutionary lineage of decoration proteins that is distinctly different than those in the β-tulip family and whose capsid binding is similarly driven mainly by interactions in site 1, with a smaller contribution towards binding in site 2.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource"

Using the symmetry operations in the PDB structure, 1/8<sup>th</sup> of the capsid was constructed to cover the entire cryo-EM density map for phage L.

The EM density lacks sufficient resolution for reliably modeling the C-terminal part of Dec in terms of side chain orientations but indicates a barrel-shaped structure consistent with a β-helix seen in many bacteriophage tail structures. The modeled β-helix is also consistent with the β-sheet secondary structure predicted for the C-terminus of Dec from its sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Tang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Parent et al., 2012b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Newcomer et al., 2018</xref>). The selection of this structure as a template was based on the dimension of the β-helix that was narrower than most β-helices found in other tail structures, and in better agreement with the EM density. The complete model of the Dec trimer was then optimized against the EM density via flexible fitting using the MDFF protocol within NAMD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Trabuco et al., 2008</xref>). During the flexible fit, residues 1–77 were restrained at Cα and Cβ positions and the helices in each subunit spanning from 79 to 86 as well as the trimeric β-helix involving residues above 104 were internally restrained Cα positions. This allowed the C-terminal part of the trimer to move separately from the N-terminus to find the best fit to the EM density while preserving the secondary structure motifs. We note, that while the model for the N-terminal part of Dec is supported by NMR data and a good fit to the relatively high-resolution EM density, the model for the C-terminus is speculative due to a lack of high-resolution experimental data, therefore we only show the Cα backbone.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.45345.017</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Comparison of decoration proteins.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Side and B) top-down views of decoration proteins gpD (PDB ID 1C5E), gp87 (PDB ID 6BL5) and Dec (PDB ID 6D2D).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>All reviewers felt that it is of interest to understand discrimination of QE locations in capsids. One reason might be to understand immune recognition. Another might be to be able to direct assembly toward different T numbers. Unfortunately, the reviewers were not convinced that the paper gave insights into the structural basis for this in phage L, and whether this might be generalized to other viruses. Given that <italic>eLife</italic> does not make major revision decisions where substantial new work would be required, the only option was to reject the current submission. However, this does not preclude the future resubmission of a revised manuscript that fully addresses the concerns raised in this review.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>This manuscript presents structural studies of phage L capsid and capsid decoration proteins, using NMR, Cryo-EM and other biochemical approaches. Icosahedral virus capsid shells often have decoration proteins that help stabilize the virion structure against environmental insults. Among dsDNA tailed phages, those decoration proteins are known to have two common protein folds: one is the Ig domain fold such as pb10 in phage T5, and the other is a trimer with a β-tulip and α/β subdomain such as gpD in lambda phage. Now, in this manuscript, Newcomer et al. report a capsid protein Dec in Phage L that has an OB-fold, which is now the third fold of the dsDNA virus decoration proteins. In this paper, the Dec protein structure was obtained from NMR combined with homology modeling and then docked into the cryo-EM map. Interestingly, from the cryo-EM reconstruction the authors showed that the Dec proteins only selectively bind to the &quot;quasi-three-fold&quot; between hexons, but not to the &quot;true three-fold&quot; or the &quot;quasi-three-fold&quot; between hexons and a penton. The authors also try to explain the mechanism of Dec binding specificity through some mutagenesis studies and MD-based structural analysis. Overall the NMR part appears to be well designed and executed. On the other hand, the cryo-EM part was poorly presented, and there are several major issues that must be addressed.</p><p>1) The stated resolution of the cryo-EM map is ambiguous and misleading. The authors report a 4.2 Å overall resolution of the icosahedral reconstruction (I assume this means no mask was applied for this estimation, and the authors need to clarify this in the paper). But from Figure 1C, one can clearly tell the map resolution for the Dec protein part is probably around 8~15 Å, much worse than 4.2 Å. Also, the half-map FSC is measuring self-agreement between two maps rather than actual resolution. Therefore the authors need to measure the Model:Map FSC for the capsid proteins and Dec separately, and include those numbers in the paper.</p><p>2) The features in this cryo-EM map do not look like a typical 4.2 Å map. For example, one usually sees side chain densities on a helix and β-strand separation at this resolution. But these were not seen in the map provided by the authors. Therefore, it is either the authors over-estimated the cryo-EM resolution, or the map has not been properly sharpened. With the map quality as seen, it is hard to believe the detailed amino acid site analysis presented in Figure 5. This also suggests that some of the mutagenesis results can simply be explained by an inaccurate atomic model.</p><p>3) Both the capsid protein and Dec models sent from the authors have poor protein geometries, meaning they were poorly refined. Both models even have cis-peptides in the structure, which is unacceptable. The authors need to put a table in the main text listing protein geometries (bonds RMSD, Ramachandran statistics, etc.) of the deposited cryo-EM models and maps, and those statistics need to reach the common standard of the field.</p><p>4) One of the most interesting points in the paper involves the Dec selectivity on the Phage L capsid. But why were the mutagenesis experiments done using Phage P22, which doesn't have Dec?</p><p>5) The structural basis for the selective binding of Dec to capsids was poorly discussed. The MD-based simulations are not helpful in elucidating the mechanism. First, the authors need to understand that the hexons in the capsid do not necessarily have C6 symmetry. This is true from the model sent by the authors, and this means the &quot;quasi-three-fold&quot; and &quot;true three-fold&quot; may have different surface interfaces to Dec, which is the simplest explanation for Dec selectivity. With a 4.2 Å map, the author should be able to compare the surface using real cryo-EM map/models, rather than some MD simulations.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>The manuscript &quot;How phage L capsid decoration protein distinguishes between nearly identical binding sites on an icosahedral virion&quot; by Newcomer et al. looks at the binding of Dec on the capsid exterior surface in its host phage L, which varies according to position on the capsid surface. In addition, Dec binds to phage P22 due to 99.6% identity in coat protein sequence with that of phage L, although P22 doesn't encode its own Dec homolog. Capsid structures determined by high-resolution cryo-electron microscopy are combined with an NMR solution structure of monomeric Dec, MD simulations, and mutations across the P22 core and Dec interface to reveal the selectivity of Dec binding. Although this is a rather specific example from one of many similar phages, it nonetheless reflects a more general question of the fidelity of protein-protein binding that can also be found in other cellular contexts and for regulating function. Thus, it's a useful illustration of a general process that is readily studied in the tractable context of high-symmetry phage particles that are easily expressed and purified. However, while identifying several residues across multiple copies of the coat protein and in Dec that are important for binding, as well as the structural key to the binding selectivity, its not entirely clear what general principles have been discovered. Why does phage L have a Dec protein, but P22 has none? Why is Dec binding selective at all – ie, what difference is there between Dec binding nowhere, everywhere, and in the specific location identified? Nonetheless, as a model system the structural and binding results make an interesting story that is well supported by the data and offers a foundation for continuing to pursue important questions.</p><p>The manuscript could be greatly improved by correcting numerous errors, better wording, and a more concise presentation – including the Introduction, and NMR section in Results that descends into Discussion. Some examples are listed below, but others abound. A thorough read by all authors might really tighten this up.</p><p>1) Be careful to specify the scope of statement – e.g., the Abstract starts &quot;The major coat proteins of most dsDNA tailed phages and viruses form capsids by a mechanism that includes active packaging of the dsDNA genome into a precursor procapsid, and subsequent expansion/stabilization of the capsid.&quot; By &quot;most&quot; the implication is that some dsDNA tailed phages and viruses do <italic>not</italic> package the genome into a preformed capsid etc. And yet there is a well-defined group in which this is, as far as I know, true – dsDNA tailed phages and herpesviruses. Why not say that? (The second sentence about atmospheres of pressure is pretty meaningless – why not talk more relevantly of concentration?) The third sentence then says &quot;Phages and viruses have evolved diverse strategies to strengthen their capsids, such as non-covalent binding of auxiliary &quot;decoration&quot; proteins.&quot; This appears to be true of the dsDNA tailed phages and herpesviruses, but not necessarily for capsids that must disassemble to deliver their genomes, such as the dsDNA polyoma/papillomaviruses (but may be true for adenoviruses, on the other hand). The point being to word these statements precisely so as to avoid inadvertently generalizing in ways that are simply not correct.</p><p>2) Another example of a poorly chosen term &quot;…such that some coat proteins are in hexameric conformations and some are in pentameric conformations&quot; where strictly they are in hexavalent locations (usually but not always organized as hexamers – adenovirus trimers and polyomavirus pentamers, for example – or in fact more tightly organized as dimers as in hepatitis B virus) and pentavalent location, although those are organized as pentamers. As above, if you properly specify the subset of &quot;Viral icosahedral capsids&quot; as pentamer-hexamer dsDNA tailed phages and herpesviruses, then your statements following aren't wrong.</p><p>Similarly, in the first paragraph of the Introduction, environmental stress (plus that from internal dsDNA).</p><p>&quot;At least 10<sup>31</sup> viruses are found in the biosphere&quot; neglects the indirect argument involved – 10<sup>30</sup> bacteria were estimated from water samples, with 10 phage for each bacterium leading to the 10<sup>31</sup> figure. Since phage are expected to dominate eukaryotic viruses numerically, the statement should read &quot;10<sup>31</sup> viruses are estimated in the biosphere&quot;. And the 2005 citation to support this [Bamford, Grimes and Stuart, 2005] is well-preceded by Hendrix's 1999 &quot;All the world's a phage” paper in PNAS – see the start of the Discussion.</p><p>3) The tight packaging of DNA &quot;…facilitates delivery of the majority of the viral genome into the host&quot; is supported by what evidence?

Secondly the citations are to recent structural papers that do not demonstrate that binding gpD stabilizes the capsid – that would be much earlier, Sternberg and Weisberg, 1977 or Imber et al., 1980, both in JMB. Structural data were also available much earlier, from the first lambda capsid map by Dokland and Murialdo, 1995, to the gpD crystal structure and improved capsid map by Yang et al., 2000.</p><p>6) &quot;P-loops&quot; are not defined here, or anywhere.

Marking the N- and C-termini, and including the fold (one subunit) may help with this figure. The main text (subsection “Structures of the phageL coat lattice and capsid-bound Dectrimers”, third paragraph) suggests that cyan is the N-terminal region (OB-fold) and the purple is the C-terminal region (3-stranded β-helix and protruding central stalk). Please clarify in the legend.</p><p>10) Subsection “NMR structure of the Dec monomer has an OB-fold domain and an unfolded C terminus”, first and last paragraphs and legend to Supplementary Figure 4: Supplementary figure 5 should be Supplementary Figure 6.

It is not observed in the NMR data since that is of monomeric Dec. What then is the basis for saying that this asymmetry is inherent in the Dec trimer when is it rather more certainly inherent in the capsid at the positions Dec binds to? The strongest evidence might be that Dec doesn't bind at the icosahedral (strict) 3-fold site, but then it also doesn't bind at the local 3-fold adjacent to the pentamers (and this isn't explained – see #13 above).</p><p>17) The authors might consider mentioning earlier in the Introduction that gpD and Dec bind the capsids as homotrimers.</p><p>18) Some figures are not easily understood, including Figure 1 where the capsomers and the T=7 organization are hard to see (even Supplementary Figure 2 isn't entirely clear, but it is better).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>In this manuscript Newcomer et al. bring three approaches to bear on the question of how phage L Dec protein discriminates between true and quasi three-fold symmetry sites.

In this reviewer's opinion the NMR studies of a partially refolded Dec monomer are something of a distraction from the focus of the manuscript.</p><p>Curiously, the mutagenesis experiments were performed using bacteriophage P22 coat protein rather than phage L. This reviewer appreciates the similarity between the two phage, and also the availability of systems for genetic manipulation and production of P22 phage. While it seems likely (based on the 2006 publication by Tang et al.) that binding is the same, constructing a P22 coat protein mutant containing the 4 phage L sequence alterations would seem to be straightforward and more compelling.</p><p>The major reservation this reviewer has is despite the effort and high-resolution structures obtained the end result is that discriminatory binding is &quot;largely due to the surface area of contact with the capsid protein&quot;, a vague statement which could have been made even prior to this study.</p><p>There are no doubt valuable and intriguing findings in this manuscript. However, perhaps reflective of the interests of the multiple groups involved the focus drifts from discriminatory binding, to the novelty of the structure of the Dec protein itself, to unanswered questions about why some phage have decoration/stabilization proteins and some don't.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what now follows is the decision letter after the authors submitted for further consideration.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;The phage L capsid decoration protein has a novel OB-fold and an unusual capsid binding strategy&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed favorably by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by John Kuriyan as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This is a revised version of the manuscript by Newcomer et al. in which they describe the structure of phage L, a P22-like dsDNA phage that, unlike P22, is stabilized by decoration proteins that bind to quasi-threefold, but not icosahedral threefold positions in the capsid. Furthermore, they determine the NMR solution structure of Dec, which has an OB fold, different from e.g. the gpD decoration protein of phage lambda. Additionally, mutational analysis was used to identify the residues involved in the CP-Dec binding interaction.</p><p>The authors have generally responded well to the previous reviewers' comments. Most importantly, they provide an improved map and more well refined model.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Discussion: &quot;…decoration proteins for which atomic-resolution structures are known…&quot; This fails to consider the Psu decoration protein of phage P4, which, like Dec, serves to stabilize the capsids and can be added to capsids extraneously, but, unlike Dec, binds across the center of hexamers (Isaksen et al., 1993, Dokland et al., 1993). The crystal structure of Psu has been determined (Banerjee et al., 2012) and has an α-helical fold, completely different from those of T4, T5, L or lambda. Presumably Psu belongs to an even more distinct lineage of decoration proteins.</p><p>2) Figure 1C is somewhat misleading, in that the color scheme suggests that the six subunits are organized around an icosahedral threefold axis. It would be more useful to color the subunits according to the quasi-symmetric location (A-G) and provide a key to understand which is which (e.g. by indicating on Figure 1A). Positions of symmetry axes (twofold?) should also be indicated.</p><p>3) Figure 6: I get that the two quasi-threefold and the icosahedral threefold position differ in the angle between subunits and that this probably determines whether Dec binds or not. However, the figure is rather messy and it is difficult to see where Dec would bind to the CP. Is there a better way to represent this so that the CP-Dec interaction can be seen in the side view? Maybe a thinner slice through the structure, depth cueing or something like that?</p><p>4) Furthermore, the table in Figure 6, which lists differences in distance between residue E81, does not convey the point made in the text (subsection “Decoration proteins employ a variety of binding schemes to adhere to phage capsids”, last paragraph) that the icosahedral threefold is the flattest, the Dec binding quasi-threefold is intermediate, and the pentamer-proximal position is the most angled. One might have presumed that the most angled positions that represent a &quot;weak point in many capsids&quot; would be the one where Dec binds. There does not seem to be much discussion of this interesting point, which may point to Dec's function – perhaps not to stabilize capsids after all?</p><p>5) Also, in Figure 6, the arc with the denotation 54.2Å is confusing. What is this the distance between? It seems to indicate an angle rather than a distance. Was it meant to be 54.2°? It might be helpful to list these angles differences between all three types of trimers.</p><p>6) I find it a really missed opportunity to demonstrate the claimed quality of the maps by not showing some region with excellent side-chain density with the fold model fit into it – not in the manuscript, supplementary figures or videos.</p><p>7) This rebuttal statement &quot;We have de-emphasized the notion of discriminatory binding in our title and throughout the text&quot; does not seem to be accurate. The Abstract states: &quot;The Dec protein from the P22-like phage L has a highly unusual binding strategy that precisely distinguishes between nearly identical three-fold and quasi-three-fold sites of the icosahedral capsid.&quot; and &quot;Here, we investigate how Dec is able to distinguish subtly different capsid binding sites with high specificity.&quot; This aspect has rather more prominence than claimed.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.45345.025</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the first round of peer review follow.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>All reviewers felt that it is of interest to understand discrimination of QE locations in capsids. One reason might be to understand immune recognition. Another might be to be able to direct assembly toward different T numbers. Unfortunately, the reviewers were not convinced that the paper gave insights into the structural basis for this in phage L, and whether this might be generalized to other viruses. Given that eLife does not make major revision decisions where substantial new work would be required, the only option was to reject the current submission. However, this does not preclude the future resubmission of a revised manuscript that fully addresses the concerns raised in this review.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the suggestions and for the opportunity to make the text more generalizable to a broad audience. We have addressed these points in the Introduction and Discussion sections to include how this is generalizable to other viruses, nanomedicine, general assembly and stability mechanisms and also of great utility in nanomaterials design. We also emphasized the point that an OB-fold is a novel domain for decoration proteins and this is a fundamentally important finding within this work. We have indicated that the decoration proteins discussed specifically in our manuscript bind only after maturation, so they cannot affect T number.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>[…]</p><p>1) The stated resolution of the cryo-EM map is ambiguous and misleading. The authors report a 4.2 Å overall resolution of the icosahedral reconstruction (I assume this means no mask was applied for this estimation, and the authors need to clarify this in the paper). But from Figure 1C, one can clearly tell the map resolution for the Dec protein part is probably around 8~15 Å, much worse than 4.2 Å. Also, the half-map FSC is measuring self-agreement between two maps rather than actual resolution. Therefore the authors need to measure the Model:Map FSC for the capsid proteins and Dec separately, and include those numbers in the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>We have run map validation procedures using Phenix and have listed this information in the Materials and Methods section. By applying the autosharpening routine, the display of the map is much improved, and the new figures accurately reflect the high resolution. Indeed, this capsid reconstruction has varying resolution at different radii. We have tried to further emphasize this point where we talk about the local resolution assessment (originally Supplementary Figure 3, now moved to Figure 1—figure supplement 1). Selected statistics from the validation report are now shown in Table 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The features in this cryo-EM map do not look like a typical 4.2 Å map. For example, one usually sees side chain densities on a helix and β-strand separation at this resolution. But these were not seen in the map provided by the authors. Therefore, it is either the authors over-estimated the cryo-EM resolution, or the map has not been properly sharpened. With the map quality as seen, it is hard to believe the detailed amino acid site analysis presented in Figure 5. This also suggests that some of the mutagenesis results can simply be explained by an inaccurate atomic model.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the point made by the reviewer and we acknowledge we were in error in supplying the raw data for review. We have now supplied a sharpened map, where the highresolution quality is easier to visualize.</p><p>After using the autosharpening routine within Phenix, the display of the map is much improved, and the new figures accurately reflect the high resolution. The detailed side chain information that guided the mutagenesis experimentation is well supported by three independent points:</p><p>1) The phage L coat protein density is of sufficient quality to determine a complete model de novo(see above and local resolution refinement Figure 1—figure supplement 1).</p><p>2) Phage L coat protein has 99.6% identity to P22 coat protein. The majority of our phage L model is within 1-1.5 Å RMSD from the high-resolution models derived from P22 data (3.3 Å resolution in Hryc et al., 2017 PNAS – <underline>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28270620</underline>).</p><p>3) Our NMR data is derived independently. The NMR data accurately describes the N-terminal portion of Dec protein (residues 1-77), and docks in very well with the cryo-EM derived models. While we agree that the C-terminal β-helix is much lower resolution in our cryo-EM map, only the N-terminal OB fold of the Dec protein as docked into the trimer is necessary for designing/interpreting site-directed mutagenesis studies.</p><p>Therefore, a hypothesis regarding detailed side chain information where the coat protein contacts Dec is a perfectly reasonable one to make and to test. The experimental evidence from the mutagenesis data aligns with our predictions and gives additional strength to the atomic models of coat and Dec. In fact, ours is one of very few papers that experimentally tests decoration protein binding to capsids via mutagenesis, and we believe this significantly adds to the current understanding within the field. We have made it a point to more clearly state the value of this experiment throughout the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Both the capsid protein and Dec models sent from the authors have poor protein geometries, meaning they were poorly refined. Both models even have cis-peptides in the structure, which is unacceptable. The authors need to put a table in the main text listing protein geometries (bonds RMSD, Ramachandran statistics, etc.) of the deposited cryo-EM models and maps, and those statistics need to reach the common standard of the field.</p></disp-quote><p>We have used Phenix to perform real-space refinement within the sharpened density and have improved models. Furthermore, we have deposited the validation reports along with our models to the EMDB. Selected statistics from the validation report are now shown in Table 1. The full validation reports for the capsid protein are available to anyone who wants access under the accession number EMD-9392. The NMR structure has been deposited to the PDB and validation reports on that structure are also publically available under the accession number 6E3C.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) One of the most interesting points in the paper involves the Dec selectivity on the Phage L capsid. But why were the mutagenesis experiments done using Phage P22, which doesn't have Dec?</p></disp-quote><p>This is a result of two considerations:</p><p>1) Using P22 drastically increased efficiency and reduced the cost of the experiments. Since P22 is a well-established model system, we had access to clear plaque mutants, amber mutants, non-sense tRNA suppressors, cloned plasmids, a variety of host strains etc. We would need to establish a complete genetic system in phage L in order to do these experiments. Since previous work showed that P22 and phage L capsids are virtually identical (Gilcrease et al., 2005, Tang et al., 2006, and Parent et al., 2010), we decided there was no justification to spend the time and money on the creation of an entirely new Phage L genetic system.</p><p>2) P22 is a well-established model system that is used by many laboratories for molecular display and nano-materials design. Dec is often used in these experiments with P22. Therefore, it is very useful to have the mutant binding data using P22 particles. See a large body of work by Trevor Douglas’ group (&gt;30 publications) as well as nanomaterials work from other groups.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The structural basis for the selective binding of Dec to capsids was poorly discussed. The MD-based simulations are not helpful in elucidating the mechanism. First, the authors need to understand that the hexons in the capsid do not necessarily have C6 symmetry. This is true from the model sent by the authors, and this means the &quot;quasi-three-fold&quot; and &quot;true three-fold&quot; may have different surface interfaces to Dec, which is the simplest explanation for Dec selectivity. With a 4.2 Å map, the author should be able to compare the surface using real cryo-EM map/models, rather than some MD simulations.</p></disp-quote><p>Unfortunately, MD was the only way to answer this question, as there was no significant cryo-EM density of Dec at the true icosahedral three-fold site. Therefore, the only way we could possible examine how Dec might interact with the surface was computationally. We couldn’t use “real” cryo-EM map/models without evidence of real density.</p><p>In light of this reviewer’s concern over the use of computational methodology, we have removed this result from the current work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>The manuscript &quot;How phage L capsid decoration protein distinguishes between nearly identical binding sites on an icosahedral virion&quot; by Newcomer et al. looks at the binding of Dec on the capsid exterior surface in its host phage L, which varies according to position on the capsid surface. In addition, Dec binds to phage P22 due to 99.6% identity in coat protein sequence with that of phage L, although P22 doesn't encode its own Dec homolog. Capsid structures determined by high-resolution cryo-electron microscopy are combined with an NMR solution structure of monomeric Dec, MD simulations, and mutations across the P22 core and Dec interface to reveal the selectivity of Dec binding. Although this is a rather specific example from one of many similar phages, it nonetheless reflects a more general question of the fidelity of protein-protein binding that can also be found in other cellular contexts and for regulating function. Thus, it's a useful illustration of a general process that is readily studied in the tractable context of high-symmetry phage particles that are easily expressed and purified. However, while identifying several residues across multiple copies of the coat protein and in Dec that are important for binding, as well as the structural key to the binding selectivity, its not entirely clear what general principles have been discovered. Why does phage L have a Dec protein, but P22 has none? Why is Dec binding selective at all – ie, what difference is there between Dec binding nowhere, everywhere, and in the specific location identified? Nonetheless, as a model system the structural and binding results make an interesting story that is well supported by the data and offers a foundation for continuing to pursue important questions.</p><p>The manuscript could be greatly improved by correcting numerous errors, better wording, and a more concise presentation – including the Introduction, and NMR section in Results that descends into Discussion. Some examples are listed below, but others abound. A thorough read by all authors might really tighten this up.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for finding value in the story and the data. We have significantly improved the Introduction and Discussion and have removed extraneous detail in the NMR section. We hope this makes the manuscript easier to read. We also think it’s interesting that phage L encodes a Dec protein while phage P22 does not. Given that the phage P22 capsid is very stable and its coat protein has only 4 of 430 a.a. different from phage L, it is puzzling that the latter phage would make an extra stabilizing protein given the pressures on viruses to minimize their genomes for efficient packaging. One possible solution to this paradox is if Dec had a second function besides capsid stabilization such as cell recognition. We have evidence that Dec might bind to target cells, presumably through carbohydrate moieties emanating from the target cell surfaces. From a structural point of view, both the OB-fold part of Dec and the C-terminal β-helix could be carbohydrate binding motifs. Because our data at this point is preliminary and pertains to a different scope – capsid-binding of Dec, we did not include it in the present manuscript. If Dec indeed turns out to have a second targetcell binding function, the selectivity of Dec binding could serve a structural role – namely different surface patterning on the icosahedral lattice, that could be used for target-cell binding selectively.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) Be careful to specify the scope of statement – eg, the Abstract starts &quot;The major coat proteins of most dsDNA tailed phages and viruses form capsids by a mechanism that includes active packaging of the dsDNA genome into a precursor procapsid, and subsequent expansion/stabilization of the capsid.&quot; By &quot;most&quot; the implication is that some dsDNA tailed phages and viruses do not package the genome into a preformed capsid etc. And yet there is a well-defined group in which this is, as far as I know, true – dsDNA tailed phages and herpesviruses. Why not say that? (The second sentence about atmospheres of pressure is pretty meaningless – why not talk more relevantly of concentration?) The third sentence then says &quot;Phages and viruses have evolved diverse strategies to strengthen their capsids, such as non-covalent binding of auxiliary &quot;decoration&quot; proteins.&quot; This appears to be true of the dsDNA tailed phages and herpesviruses, but not necessarily for capsids that must disassemble to deliver their genomes, such as the dsDNA polyoma/papillomaviruses (but may be true for adenoviruses, on the other hand).

It is not observed in the NMR data since that is of monomeric Dec. What then is the basis for saying that this asymmetry is inherent in the Dec trimer when is it rather more certainly inherent in the capsid at the positions Dec binds to? The strongest evidence might be that Dec doesn't bind at the icosahedral (strict) 3-fold site, but then it also doesn't bind at the local 3-fold adjacent to the pentamers (and this isn't explained – see #13 above).</p></disp-quote><p>We have removed this statement.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>17) The authors might consider mentioning earlier in the Introduction that gpD and Dec bind the capsids as homotrimers.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added this detail to the Introduction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>18) Some figures are not easily understood, including Figure 1 where the capsomers and the T=7 organization are hard to see (even Supplementary Figure 2 isn't entirely clear, but its better).</p></disp-quote><p>We have replaced Figure 1A with a cartoon schematic that better shows T = 7 organization.

The structure of phage L coat lattice and capsid bound Dec trimers is obtained by cryo-EM, an NMR structure of a partially refolded Dec monomer is obtained, and site directed mutagenesis is performed on P22 coat protein to assess the effect on Dec binding.</p><p>The techniques brought to bear are all high-resolution techniques and the cryo-EM and NMR experiments seem to be technically solid. In this reviewer's opinion the NMR studies of a partially refolded Dec monomer are something of a distraction from the focus of the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We reworked the text surrounding the NMR data to highlight the important parts, but to decrease on the extraneous details. We have recent unpublished data that freshly purified Dec trimer slowly dissociates to monomers over a period of about a week in solution. Thus the Dec trimer seems to be a metastable kinetically trapped state in solution. Whether the capsids or other intracellular factors stabilize the Dec trimer is an open question, but our results suggest that the monomeric form of Dec is a mechanistically important species. We are currently investigating the mechanism of Dec trimer formation and dissociation. Lastly, the NMR data for the OB-fold was the basis for building the trimer into the cryo-EM density map as well as guiding site-directed mutagenesis, and thus us critical to the work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Curiously, the mutagenesis experiments were performed using bacteriophage P22 coat protein rather than phage L. This reviewer appreciates the similarity between the two phage, and also the availability of systems for genetic manipulation and production of P22 phage. While it seems likely (based on the 2006 publication by Tang et al.) that binding is the same, constructing a P22 coat protein mutant containing the 4 phage L sequence alterations would seem to be straightforward and more compelling.</p></disp-quote><p>We chose not to make these substitutions as none of them are involved in Dec binding, or near the binding sites. If any were involved in this binding interface we would have expected the binding properties of Dec (e.g. the saturation, affinity, and the binding patterns) to be affected when comparing binding to P22 or L. Additionally, each of the amino acids that are changed in L are found in some P22 stocks as phenotypically silent mutations (Teschke lab, unpublished), suggesting that these minor differences play no role in the way the phage capsids assemble or function. We have added this description to the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The major reservation this reviewer has is despite the effort and high-resolution structures obtained the end result is that discriminatory binding is &quot;largely due to the surface area of contact with the capsid protein&quot;, a vague statement which could have been made even prior to this study.</p><p>There are no doubt valuable and intriguing findings in this manuscript. However, perhaps reflective of the interests of the multiple groups involved the focus drifts from discriminatory binding, to the novelty of the structure of the Dec protein itself, to unanswered questions about why some phage have decoration/stabilization proteins and some don't.</p></disp-quote><p>We have emphasized the novelty of the Dec OB-fold, as well as the discovery of which residues contribute to capsid binding. These observations would not have been possible without the high-resolution work contained here.</p><p>We have de-emphasized the discussion regarding selectivity of binding in some places, although we have added a new figure (new Figure 6) that shows how the coat protein structures change at the different sites to make this more obvious.</p><p>[Editors' note: the author responses to the re-review follow.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Discussion: &quot;…decoration proteins for which atomic-resolution structures are known…&quot; This fails to consider the Psu decoration protein of phage P4, which, like Dec, serves to stabilize the capsids and can be added to capsids extraneously, but, unlike Dec, binds across the center of hexamers (Isaksen et al., 1993, Dokland et al., 1993). The crystal structure of Psu has been determined (Banerjee et al., 2012) and has an α-helical fold, completely different from those of T4, T5, L or lambda. Presumably Psu belongs to an even more distinct lineage of decoration proteins.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this addition. We have added these references to the Discussion (Isaksen, Dokland and Lindqvist, 1993; Dokland et al., 1993; Banerjee et al., 2012) and included a mention that Psu is from another category of decoration proteins.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Figure 1C is somewhat misleading, in that the color scheme suggests that the six subunits are organized around an icosahedral threefold axis. It would be more useful to color the subunits according to the quasi-symmetric location (A-G) and provide a key to understand which is which (e.g. by indicating on Figure 1A). Positions of symmetry axes (twofold?) should also be indicated.</p></disp-quote><p>We have adjusted the figure according to the color scheme recommended by the reviewers and added an enlarged area to show the fit of the map and the high resolution allowing us to view side chains. The figure legend has been edited accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Figure 6: I get that the two quasi-threefold and the icosahedral threefold position differ in the angle between subunits and that this probably determines whether Dec binds or not. However, the figure is rather messy and it is difficult to see where Dec would bind to the CP. Is there a better way to represent this so that the CP-Dec interaction can be seen in the side view? Maybe a thinner slice through the structure, depth cueing or something like that?</p></disp-quote><p>We have updated the figure to show additional views including an overlay, as well as two individual views of the quasi three-fold between hexamers (light blue) as well as the quasi three-fold site between hexamers and pentamers (dark blue). We also included the Dec density (lavender) in this new figure to emphasize the differences between these two quasi equivalent environments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Furthermore, the table in Figure 6, which lists differences in distance between residue E81, does not convey the point made in the text (subsection “Decoration proteins employ a variety of binding schemes to adhere to phage capsids”, last paragraph) that the icosahedral threefold is the flattest, the Dec binding quasi-threefold is intermediate, and the pentamer-proximal position is the most angled.</p></disp-quote><p>We have expanded the Discussion in a few places to address the point regarding E81 positioning at the various quasi-equivalent locations more clearly (see subsection “Decoration proteins employ a variety of binding schemes to adhere to phage capsids”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>One might have presumed that the most angled positions that represent a &quot;weak point in many capsids&quot; would be the one where Dec binds. There does not seem to be much discussion of this interesting point, which may point to Dec's function – perhaps not to stabilize capsids after all?</p></disp-quote><p>We have revised this statement to more clearly explain that Dec does bind to the capsids where they suffer from AFM damage and are thus a weak point:</p><p>“Biophysical measurements have shown that Dec plays a much larger role in stabilizing dsDNAcontaining heads compared to empty capsids, and atomic force microscopy experiments showed Dec indeed binds capsids at positions most prone to mechanical damage (i.e. quasi three-fold sites between hexons) [Llauro et al., 2016]”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Also, in Figure 6, the arc with the denotation 54.2Å is confusing. What is this the distance between? It seems to indicate an angle rather than a distance. Was it meant to be 54.2°? It might be helpful to list these angles differences between all three types of trimers.</p></disp-quote><p>The intention of the distance measurement was to emphasize the large difference in curvature. However, we appreciate that this was confusing and have since removed this label in the new figure. We hope that the new figure is clearer and that the presence of the Dec density sufficiently emphasizes the distance without the need for listing additional direct measurements. We have also updated the figure legend accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) I find it a really missed opportunity to demonstrate the claimed quality of the maps by not showing some region with excellent side-chain density with the fold model fit into it – not in the manuscript, supplementary figures or videos.</p></disp-quote><p>We added an enlarged area view to Figure 1 showing the fit of side chains into the cryo-EM density map of the capsid protein spine helix.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) This rebuttal statement &quot;We have de-emphasized the notion of discriminatory binding in our title and throughout the text&quot; does not seem to be accurate. The Abstract states: &quot;The Dec protein from the P22-like phage L has a highly unusual binding strategy that precisely distinguishes between nearly identical three-fold and quasi-three-fold sites of the icosahedral capsid.&quot; and &quot;Here, we investigate how Dec is able to distinguish subtly different capsid binding sites with high specificity.&quot; This aspect has rather more prominence than claimed.</p></disp-quote><p>We have deleted the word “precisely” in the Abstract. We also deleted the statement “Here, we investigate how Dec is able to distinguish subtly different capsid binding sites with high specificity.”</p><p>Additionally, we have revised the next sentence to read: “We report the structure of phage L Dec protein, which has a novel fold for a decoration protein and propose an explanation for how Dec may be able to bind to subtly different capsid binding sites.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
