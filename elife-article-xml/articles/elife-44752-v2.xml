In many cases, such localized transcripts mediate spatial control of gene expression by being translationally silent while in transit and locally activated at their destination. Here, we investigate the translation of RNAs localized at dynamic cellular protrusions of human and mouse, migrating, mesenchymal cells. In contrast to the model described above, we find that protrusion-localized RNAs are not locally activated solely at protrusions, but can be translated with similar efficiency in both internal and peripheral locations. Interestingly, protrusion-localized RNAs are translated at extending protrusions, they become translationally silenced in retracting protrusions and this silencing is accompanied by coalescence of single RNAs into larger heterogeneous RNA clusters. This work describes a distinct mode of translational regulation of localized RNAs, which we propose is used to regulate protein activities during dynamic cellular responses.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>RNA transport</kwd><kwd>local translation</kwd><kwd>RNA granule</kwd><kwd>cell migration</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Intramural Research Program of the Center for Cancer Research</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mili</surname><given-names>Stavroula</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>RNAs enriched at cell protrusions are translated regardless of their location in the cytoplasm but are dynamically repressed in retracting protrusions and incorporated into heterogeneous RNA clusters.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Targeting of RNA molecules to distinct subcellular destinations has emerged as a widely-used mechanism that controls the cytoplasmic distribution of a large proportion of expressed transcripts in a range of organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Buxbaum et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Medioni et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Meignin and Davis, 2010</xref>). Such RNA localization events are functionally important during development, cell-fate decisions, or physiologic responses of somatic cells, including synaptic plasticity and cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Condeelis and Singer, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Holt and Bullock, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Holt and Schuman, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yasuda and Mili, 2016</xref>). Localized RNAs are thought to mediate these functional outcomes by directing and restricting protein production in specific subcellular compartments, thus contributing to the molecular compartmentalization of polarized cells. To achieve spatially-controlled protein production, translation of localized RNAs is thought to be suppressed during transport and activated at their final destination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Besse and Ephrussi, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Buxbaum et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jung et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>This model is supported by several lines of evidence. Localized RNAs are associated during transport with RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) that function as translational repressors, which block the initiation or elongation steps of translation. For example, the RBPs Khd1 and Puf6 repress the translation of the yeast ASH1 mRNA until it reaches the tip of the emerging yeast bud. Puf6 inhibits translation by binding to the initiation factor eIF5B, thus preventing ribosome subunit binding to the mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Deng et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gu et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Paquin et al., 2007</xref>). Supporting the coordinate regulation of RNA transport and translation, certain RBPs perform multiple functions and can operate to both repress translation and support RNA trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abaza and Gebauer, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Besse and Ephrussi, 2008</xref>). Such multifunctional RBPs include FMRP, a known translational repressor, which can also link its target RNAs to the kinesin motor-based transport machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Davidovic et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dictenberg et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Richter et al., 2015</xref>). Additionally, IMP-1/ZBP-1 is required both for transport as well as for translational repression of the beta-actin mRNA, by blocking recruitment of the 60S ribosomal subunit and initiation of translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Condeelis and Singer, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hüttelmaier et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>Once the RNA reaches its final destination, spatial control of gene expression is achieved by local de-repression of translation. Exemplifying this notion, at the yeast bud tip, the Puf6 and Kdh1 RBPs are phosphorylated by the Yck1 kinase, leading to release of eIF5B and translation activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Deng et al., 2008</xref>). Similarly, phosphorylation of ZBP1 by the Src kinase disrupts ZBP1-RNA binding leading to translation of beta-actin RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hüttelmaier et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>Various other mechanisms maintain localized RNAs in a silenced state, and are relieved in a spatial manner. The Drosophila <italic>nanos</italic> mRNA is deadenylated and translationally repressed in the bulk cytoplasm of Drosophila embryos through the action of the RBP Smaug and the CCR4/NOT deadenylase. At the posterior pole, the Oskar protein relieves this inhibition and leads to de-repression of <italic>nanos</italic> translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jeske et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zaessinger et al., 2006</xref>). In neuronal dendrites, translation of RNAs can be suppressed by miRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Schratt et al., 2006</xref>), and degradation of components of the RISC complex controls synaptic protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ashraf et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Transported RNAs can also be maintained in a translationally-repressed state through oligomerization or multiplexing into higher-order RNP particles or granules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chekulaeva et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">De Graeve and Besse, 2018</xref>). These particles (also referred to, in the case of neurons, as neuronal transport granules) share protein components as well as liquid-droplet properties with other phase-separated RNA granules, such as P-bodies and stress granules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">De Graeve and Besse, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gopal et al., 2017</xref>). Containment within such granules is thought to retain RNAs in a repressed state, inaccessible to the translation machinery. Local signals can release such ‘masked’ RNAs and allow their translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Buxbaum et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kotani et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>We have been investigating a group of RNAs that are localized at protrusions of migrating cells. We refer to these RNAs as ‘APC-dependent’ because their localization requires the tumor-suppressor protein APC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mili et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wang et al., 2017</xref>). Localization of APC-dependent RNAs at protrusions requires a particular subset of modified microtubules, namely detyrosinated microtubules, and is mechanically regulated in response to the stiffness of the extracellular environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yasuda et al., 2017</xref>). Specifically, increased actomyosin contractility on stiff substrates, through activation of a signaling pathway involving the RhoA GTPase and its effector formin mDia, leads to formation of a detyrosinated microtubule network, which in turn supports RNA localization at protrusions. Localization of APC-dependent RNAs at protrusions is important for efficient cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wang et al., 2017</xref>). We hypothesize that the positive effect of APC-dependent RNAs on cell migration is mediated through local RNA translation at protrusions.</p><p>Here, we use polysome association, single-molecule translation imaging reporters, and in situ imaging of endogenous nascent proteins to determine whether APC-dependent RNAs are translated at protrusions and whether their translation is affected by their location in the cytoplasm. We find that indeed, localized RNAs are translated at protrusions, but interestingly they are also translated with similar efficiency regardless of their location within the cell. Intriguingly, we observe that continuous transport to the periphery leads to coalescence of single RNAs into larger clusters that are translationally silenced. We further show that such silencing and clustering occurs at retracting protrusions. Therefore, in contrast to the model described above, APC-dependent RNAs are not locally activated solely at protrusions. Instead, after transport to the periphery, and upon protrusion retraction, they become translationally silent and segregate into multimeric RNA granules. We propose that this mechanism is used to regulate protein activities during dynamic cellular responses.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Disrupting the localization of APC-dependent RNAs at protrusions does not affect their translation</title><p>As a first step towards assessing whether localization of APC-dependent RNAs at protrusions is coupled to their translation status, we disrupted RNA localization at protrusions and determined whether that affected the efficiency of their translation. To measure translation efficiency, we fractionated cell extracts on sucrose gradients to resolve RNAs according to the number of bound ribosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). To facilitate a larger scale analysis, we divided each gradient into four fractions based on UV absorbance traces. Fraction one includes free RNPs and the 40S and 60S ribosomal subunits, fraction 2 includes 80S monosomes, and fractions 3 and 4 include light and heavy polysomes, respectively. mRNAs in fractions 1 and 2 largely correspond to non-translated mRNAs, whereas mRNAs in fractions 3 and 4 are actively translated. To correct for variations introduced by sample manipulation during RNA purification, an equal amount of in vitro transcribed spike RNA was added to each fraction. The recovered RNA from each fraction was then used to simultaneously detect the levels of multiple RNA species along the four fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). For detection, we used nanostring analysis which allows for direct RNA counting and thus avoids biases introduced by reverse transcription and amplification. We designed probes to detect 20 protrusion-enriched RNAs, that we have previously defined as APC-dependent, 6 RNAs encoding ribosomal proteins or ribosome biogenesis factors, which we have previously shown are also enriched at protrusions but in an APC-independent manner, and eight control RNAs which based on our prior analysis are not enriched at protrusions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wang et al., 2017</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.44752.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Disrupting localization of APC-dependent RNAs, through competition, does not alter their translation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Outline of experimental procedure.

Indeed, puromycin treatment led to an increase in monosomes and ribosomal subunits and a decrease in heavy polysomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). (Note that NIH/3T3 cells used in these experiments have a reduced baseline amount of ribosomes engaged in translation (i.e. in light and heavy polysomes) compared to HEK293 cells shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Nanostring analysis of recovered RNA revealed that under control conditions a higher proportion of most RNAs exists in fractions 3 and 4, while treatment with puromycin significantly shifted the distribution of RNAs, in all three groups examined, towards fractions 1 and 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). These results therefore indicate that indeed mRNAs present in fractions 3 and 4 correspond to actively translated transcripts, and furthermore, that our nanostring-based methodology can quantitatively detect changes in translation efficiency.</p><p>To disrupt the localization of APC-dependent RNAs at protrusions, we employed two different methodologies. One is a competition-based method that relies on overexpression of an exogenous construct carrying the 3’UTR of the APC-dependent RNA, Pkp4. Our prior characterization showed that inducible expression of such competitive-UTR (cUTR) constructs leads to a preferential mislocalization of APC-dependent RNAs from protrusions (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wang et al., 2017</xref> for a detailed characterization of the stable cell lines used). A second method relies on the requirement for detyrosinated microtubules for localization of APC-dependent RNAs at protrusions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yasuda et al., 2017</xref>). Brief treatment with the chemical compound parthenolide disrupts detyrosinated microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yasuda et al., 2017</xref>) and significantly reduces RNA localization at protrusions, measured through the degree of RNA enrichment in isolated protrusion samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.44752.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Disrupting localization of APC-dependent RNAs, through perturbation of detyrosinated microtubules, does not alter their translation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic on the left indicates experimental procedure used for isolation of protrusions.

In both cases, cUTR overexpression or parthenolide treatment did not affect the overall gradient profile, suggesting that no overt changes in translation resulted from either treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2B</xref>). Furthermore, both approaches did not result in significant changes in the translation state of the control RNAs, the APC-independent RNAs or the mislocalized APC-dependent RNAs analyzed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>). Therefore, disrupting the peripheral localization of APC-dependent RNAs does not affect their translational efficiency, suggesting a lack of coupling between RNA transport and translational control.</p><p>We note that both cUTR overexpression and parthenolide treatment resulted in a small apparent reduction in the amount of APC-dependent RNAs sedimenting in the heavy polysome fraction (fraction 4) and an apparently corresponding increase of RNA amounts in polysome fraction 3. These changes are small, they are not statistically significant and do not alter the conclusion that APC-dependent RNAs remain translationally active. Nevertheless, we make a note of this observation because it is manifested quite consistently by APC-dependent RNAs under conditions that disrupt their peripheral localization. In light of data presented below, we believe that this might reflect a real change in the organization of a small fraction of these RNPs (see discussion).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Single-molecule translation reporters of protrusion-localized RNAs</title><p>While the above results suggest that transport and translation of APC-dependent RNAs are not coordinated, they also raise the possibility that assessing the translation status in a whole-cell extract derived from heterogeneous cell populations might not offer the required sensitivity to detect local changes occurring on a single-cell level. To address this, we took advantage of the recently developed SunTag-based reporters that allow imaging of translation of single RNA molecules in live cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Morisaki et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yan et al., 2016</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). These reporters carry a coding sequence which includes, at the 5’ end, a series of SunTag peptide epitopes, which are recognized by a single chain antibody fragment fused to superfolder-GFP (scFv-GFP). The concentration of GFP-fused antibodies on a series of nascent peptides generated during translation allows the observation of translation sites as bright GFP spots, which can be distinguished from free antibody molecules or mature proteins released after translation. A second element incorporated in these reporter constructs is a series of binding sites for the PP7 bacteriophage coat protein introduced after the end of the coding sequence. These hairpin elements bind to a PP7 coat protein fused to 3 copies of mCherry fluorescent protein (3x-mCherry-PCP), thus allowing visualization of RNA molecules as bright red spots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yan et al., 2016</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). To use this system, we have generated mouse NIH/3T3 fibroblast cell lines that stably express the GFP-fused antibody and the 3x-mCherry-PCP, and additionally can be induced to express reporter RNAs after addition of doxycycline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref> and see below). For our studies, we have been using a control reporter RNA which carries, after the PP7 repeats, a UTR sequence that doesn’t direct transport to protrusions, and two localized reporter RNAs in which the PP7 repeats are followed by the 3’UTR of either the mouse Rab13 or Pkp4 RNAs, which as we have previously shown are sufficient to target reporter RNAs to protrusions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mili et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wang et al., 2017</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.44752.006</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Validation of single-molecule translation reporter assay.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of translation reporter constructs for labeling of RNA and nascent protein chains.

To assess the specificity of the detected RNA spots, we compared the signal observed upon expression of the control PP7-containing reporter RNA to that of a similar reporter carrying a deletion of the PP7-binding sites (−PP7) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). mCherry intensity overlapping with translation sites (GFP spots) was measured and normalized to the intensity observed in nearby cytoplasmic regions with diffuse signal. The −PP7 construct exhibited a normalized mCherry intensity around 1, indicating that signal intensity overlapping with translation spots was similar to that of the surrounding cytoplasm. By contrast, the +PP7 containing reporter exhibited a significantly higher intensity, indicating that the mCherry signal overlapping translation sites was due to specific recognition of RNA molecules by the fused PP7 coat protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). To assess whether GFP spots are indeed reflecting translation sites, images were acquired before and after treatment with puromycin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). RNA spots were identified in the images, and mCherry and GFP intensity in the corresponding regions was recorded. The normalized GFP intensity was calculated as a measure of the translational efficiency of each RNA spot. Puromycin treatment significantly reduced the GFP intensity of RNA spots, confirming that it reflects the presence of nascent protein chains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). To further determine whether this concentration of nascent chains reflects active translation, and not stalled ribosomes, we acquired images of localized translation reporters before and after treatment with harringtonine or lactimidomycin, which block initiating ribosomes but allow elongating ribosomes to run off (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ingolia et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lee et al., 2012</xref>). As an additional control we treated cells with cycloheximide, which stalls elongating ribosomes and prevents release of nascent chains. Indeed, brief 15 min treatment with harringtonine or lactimidomycin, but not cycloheximide, significantly reduced the observed translation signal indicating that it reflects the presence of actively translating ribosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>RNAs targeted to protrusions are similarly translated in both internal and peripheral locations</title><p>We further imaged cells expressing either control or localized reporters (carrying the Rab13 or Pkp4 UTRs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Videos 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="video" rid="video4">4</xref>). Imaging was performed ca. 2 hr after doxycycline induction to ensure that reporter RNAs do not accumulate to high levels and do not deplete the cytoplasmic pools of scFv-GFP antibody and 3x-mCherry-PCP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Consistent with the ability of the Rab13 and Pkp4 UTRs to target RNAs to protrusions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mili et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wang et al., 2017</xref>), a higher proportion of localized reporter RNAs (containing the Rab13 or Pkp4 UTRs) were observed closer to the periphery compared to the control reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Around 50% of observed localized reporter molecules were found within 3–7 μm of the cell edge, compared to 15 μm for the control reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). For all reporters, the majority of RNA particles exhibit mCherry intensities centered around a single peak indicating that they largely exist as single molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>) (but see also below). The number of particles detected by live-cell imaging is lower than the number detected in fixed cells by FISH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). The additional RNAs detected by FISH likely correspond to fast-moving molecules that cannot be discerned during live imaging with our current acquisition speed. Observing RNAs during short time-lapse imaging (~20–30 s) reveals that the majority of RNAs are static or exhibit an oscillatory type of motion (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Videos 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="video" rid="video4">4</xref>). A small subset exhibits short directed movements that might be indicative of active transport (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video5">Videos 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video6">6</xref>; and see below). These observations are consistent with the motion characteristics described for other localized transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dynes and Steward, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gopal et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Park et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yoon et al., 2016</xref>). Given the limitations in imaging and discerning fast-moving molecules, we have not attempted to analyze the transport kinetics of our reporter RNAs. We have rather focused our analysis here on the less mobile molecules that we can confidently identify and analyze (see Materials and methods for details on image acquisition and analysis). Despite the lack of kinetic information, this analysis reflects the behavior of a substantial fraction of the existing RNA population and can provide a valuable characterization of the translation properties of individual RNA molecules in a spatial manner.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.44752.009</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>RNAs targeted to protrusions are similarly translated in both internal and peripheral locations.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Live imaging snapshots of cells expressing the indicated translation reporters.

Consistent with the stochastic translation bursts reported in other systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pichon et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yan et al., 2016</xref>), for all three reporters, single RNAs exhibit a range of translation efficiencies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Interestingly, however, plotting the translation efficiency of individual RNAs in relation to their position from the cell edge revealed that translation efficiency is not affected by the distance from the periphery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Pearson’s correlation coefficients in all cases are close to 0 (-0.07 (Rab13), −0.06 (Pkp4), −0.01 (Control)). This result is in agreement with the observations reported above showing that mislocalization of endogenous RNAs does not impact on their translation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>). Therefore, RNAs trafficked to the periphery through the pathway supported by the Rab13 and Pkp4 UTRs can be translated with similar efficiency in both peripheral and internal locations.</p><p>We point out that our analysis is focused on less mobile molecules. We cannot currently assess if translation persists, or not, during periods of active movement. In this regard, we have observed single RNAs that undergo short-range directed movements while being translationally active (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video5">Videos 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video6">6</xref>). This suggests that these RNAs can be translated while in transit, an observation also noted in other systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wu et al., 2016</xref>). However, due to current limitations on the speed and duration of our imaging, observation of such events is too sporadic to allow conclusions about their frequency.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>APC-dependent RNAs associate with heterogeneous clusters at the tips of protrusions</title><p>The data mentioned above have focused on single RNA molecules. However, in the course of our studies we have observed that endogenous APC-dependent RNAs exist in two states: they are found either as single molecules or as clusters made up of multiple RNAs in close spatial proximity. We have observed these clusters for virtually all APC-dependent RNAs we have detected by in situ hybridization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). These RNA clusters are found at the very tips of cellular protrusions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–E</xref>). A small fraction of each individual RNA segregates into such clusters, in a 2μm-wide peripheral region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F–H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>), and only a subset of protrusions exhibits such structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>; also see Figure 10 and below for further quantifications). When they form, these clusters are made up of multiple RNA molecules, as assessed by quantitation of FISH signal intensities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>) and can contain different RNA species. Indeed, two distinct RNAs can be observed in the same RNA cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Furthermore, most peripheral clusters of individual RNA species overlap with areas of accumulation of polyadenylated RNA, detected through oligo-dT hybridization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E,I</xref>). Given that the individual detected RNAs (such as the Pkp4 RNA shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>) exist in relatively few copies per cell (around, or less than, a hundred copies per cell, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>), this suggests that the visible accumulation of polyA RNA likely reflects the existence of additional RNA species at that location.

Reporters carrying 3’UTRs of APC-dependent RNAs form clusters at protrusions whereas a reporter with a control 3’UTR does not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mili et al., 2008</xref>). With improved imaging systems we have now used these reporters for higher resolution visualization. MS2-tagged reporter constructs that carry the Rab13 or Net1 3’UTRs, are localized at protrusions, where they can be observed either as individual RNA particles or as clusters of particles at the tips of protrusions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>). Furthermore, time lapse imaging of MS2-labeled localized reporters reveals that smaller RNA particles are being trafficked towards and become incorporated into the larger peripheral clusters, further supporting the conclusion that these clusters are made up of multiple RNAs (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video7">Videos 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video8">8</xref>). Therefore overall, transport of APC-dependent RNAs to the periphery can be followed by clustering at the tips of protrusions and this behavior is mediated by signals within the 3’UTRs.</p><media id="video7" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-44752-video7.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.44752.022</object-id><label>Video 7.</label><caption><title>NIH/3T3 cell expressing tdMCP-GFP (green) and a MS2-reporter RNA carrying the Rab13 UTR.</title><p>Images of the GFP channel were acquired sequentially and with no time delay, for the duration of the movie (29 s).

Consistent with the data described above, translation reporters carrying the Rab13 or Pkp4 UTRs could be found at the tips of protrusions in clusters containing multiple RNA molecules, as indicated by the increased mCherry intensity compared to the intensity exhibited by the single molecules in more internal regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,B</xref>). Translation reporter clusters were not as pronounced as those observed for endogenous RNAs, likely because of the brief induction time. Nevertheless, strikingly, measuring the translational efficiency of localized reporter RNAs found in clusters revealed that for both reporters, carrying either the Rab13 or Pkp4 UTR, peripherally clustered RNAs are translationally silent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,B</xref>). Taken together all the above data suggest that, while APC-dependent RNAs are enriched in the periphery, they are translated with similar efficiency in both internal and peripheral locations. At the same time, a subset of them at the tips of protrusions coalesces into clusters which are translationally silent.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.44752.024</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>RNA clusters at the tips of protrusions are translationally silent.</title><p>(<bold>A, B</bold>) Imaging of cells expressing localized translation reporters carrying either the Pkp4 (<bold>A</bold>) or Rab13 (<bold>B</bold>) UTRs.

While the above data show that this indeed happens, the additional observation of silencing at the periphery was rather counterintuitive. We thus first sought to validate that the above findings indeed reflect the regulation of endogenous localized transcripts. For this, we focused on Rab13 and employed the puro-PLA assay (puromycylation followed by proximity ligation amplification) to detect nascent Rab13 protein molecules in situ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">tom Dieck et al., 2015</xref>). Puro-PLA relies on a brief (5 min) pulse of puromycin to label protein molecules that are being synthesized on ribosomes during the pulse period. Nascent Rab13 can then be visualized by PLA detection of the proximity between an anti-puromycin and an anti-Rab13 antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Since puromycin causes chain termination and eventual release of nascent chains, even with a short pulse, it is conceivable that some of the detected signal might reflect released protein that has diffused away from the translation sites. This can be minimized by pretreatment with cycloheximide (CHX) which stalls the nascent proteins on the ribosomes without affecting puromycylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">David et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">tom Dieck et al., 2015</xref>), thus promoting detection of in situ translation sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). The specificity of the signal is validated in cells knocked down for the detected protein as well as in cells pretreated with the translation inhibitors anisomycin or harringtonine, which prevent puromycylation by interfering with the peptidyl-transferase activity or through ribosome run-off respectively. We note that we could not perform these experiments in NIH/3T3 mouse fibroblast cells, because even though the Rab13-puro PLA signal was dependent on translation (i.e. was reduced upon anisomycin treatment), it was not significantly reduced upon Rab13 knockdown, indicating that it mostly originated from non-specific binding of the Rab13 antibody in mouse cells (not shown). We thus used primary human dermal fibroblasts, in which Rab13 protein can be readily detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). Indeed, Rab13-puro PLA particles in these cells were significantly reduced upon both translation inhibition (with anisomycin or harringtonine) as well as Rab13 knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). (Note that the majority of the remaining non-specific signal is concentrated around the nucleus). Furthermore, comparison of the Rab13-puro PLA signal between control and CHX-pretreated cells showed a small but consistent increase in control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). We interpret this increased number of particles in control cells to reflect the additional detection of a small amount of nascent Rab13 that is released and diffused away from translation sites. Inferring from these measurements, there are ca. 40 Rab13 translation sites per cell. This number is in good agreement with the ca. 40–50 Rab13 RNA molecules detected by FISH in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). We conclude that we can specifically detect nascent Rab13 protein in human fibroblasts and that a large fraction of Rab13 RNAs are being actively translated at any moment.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.44752.025</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Endogenous Rab13 RNA is translated in both internal and peripheral locations, and is silenced at the periphery.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic depicting nascent Rab13 protein detection through puro-PLA.

Visual inspection of Rab13 translation sites (Rab13-puro PLA signal) indicated that Rab13 translation occurs in both peripheral and perinuclear locations, consistent with the conclusions reached above. Since we cannot concomitantly detect Rab13 RNAs and Rab13 translation, we measured a peripheral distribution index (PDI) to describe the overall distribution in multiple cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Stueland et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wang et al., 2017</xref>). Intriguingly, this revealed that Rab13 translation signal was less peripheral compared to the Rab13 RNA signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D,E</xref>). While the perinuclear non-specific puro-PLA noise, mentioned above, might exaggerate this difference, it cannot fully account for it. Furthermore, we noticed that upon increased time of spreading on fibronectin-coated coverslips, even though the Rab13 RNA remained peripheral to the same extent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>), Rab13 translation signal became even less peripheral (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). The bias towards internal sites is not due to release and trafficking of newly-synthesized Rab13 away from translation sites, because we see the same values when puromycylation is performed after CHX pre-treatment to block nascent protein release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>).

A frequency distribution histogram revealed that, in lamellipodia, the majority of Rab13 RNA particles exhibit intensities centered around a single peak indicating that they largely exist as single molecules. By contrast, in retracting protrusions a significant number of particles were larger and exhibited increased intensities indicating that they correspond to clusters of multiple Rab13 RNA molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B,C</xref>). Therefore, corroborating our previous observations, translationally silent Rab13 RNA is found in multimeric clusters. Furthermore, since retracting protrusions exhibit a large fraction of single Rab13 RNAs, these results additionally indicate that containment within clusters is not required for silencing but might be a consequence of it.</p><p>To determine whether RNA clusters in retracting MDA-MB-231 protrusions were composed of heterogeneous RNA species, we tested for the co-localization of Rab13 with polyA RNA.

We find that the cytoplasmic position of APC-dependent RNAs does not affect their translation, since they can be translated similarly in both internal and peripheral locations. Rather, translation of APC-dependent RNAs is coordinated with specific peripheral cellular processes, being activated at extending protrusions/lamellipodia and suppressed upon protrusion retraction. Silencing is coupled to a change in the physical state of the RNAs manifested as single RNAs clustering into heterogenous granules at the tips of protrusions.</p><p>This mode of regulation is distinct from the one proposed for several other localized transcripts, whereby RNAs are transported in a silenced state and are translationally activated only upon reaching the final destination or upon receipt of specific signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Besse and Ephrussi, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Buxbaum et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jung et al., 2014</xref>). A reason for this latter type of regulation has been proposed to be the need to prevent protein appearance at sites, or times, where it might be deleterious. Indeed, premature appearance of the transcriptional repressor Ash1p in the mother cell during budding suppresses transcriptional programs in both mother and daughter cells and prevents mating-type switching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Long et al., 1997</xref>). Similarly, disrupting the timing of translational activation within neuronal axons or dendrites can lead to aberrant axonal pathfinding or synaptic responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Colak et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Holt and Schuman, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jung et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Our observation of translation regardless of cytoplasmic location suggests that the proteins encoded by APC-dependent RNAs can be produced in internal regions without deleterious effects. We propose that this mode of regulation could additionally have functional implications for the encoded proteins. Specifically, translation in local environments can attribute proteins with different properties. This could result from differential protein modifications or through proximity to protein partners, which during co-translational assembly could affect the type or efficiency of multimeric complex formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Basu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jung et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Shiber et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Shieh et al., 2015</xref>). In light of these ideas, we suggest that a single mRNA, as it is being continuously translated at various stages during its transport to the periphery, could give rise to protein copies which have different properties, and therefore functional potential, depending on the local micro-environment they are translated into.</p><p>We additionally show that translation of APC-dependent RNAs is specifically suppressed in retracting protrusions and this silencing is associated with the formation of multimeric heterogeneous clusters. Formation of these clusters is reduced by treatments that prevent RNA transport to the periphery and is increased upon global translational inhibition, suggesting that silencing is a limiting step in their formation. Nevertheless, silencing can occur outside of clusters, since a large proportion of RNAs are observed as single particles in retracting, translationally-silent protrusions. The appearance of these heterogenous RNA clusters at the tips of protrusions, and their relation to translation, are reminiscent of other types of RNA granules formed by liquid-liquid phase separation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Courchaine et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Weber and Brangwynne, 2012</xref>). For example, stress granules (SGs) and processing bodies (PBs) are sites of dynamic concentration of RNA molecules, but in both cases translational silencing or decay can occur regardless of RNA localization within granules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Halstead et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Panas et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Perez-Pepe et al., 2018</xref>). SGs and PBs form throughout the cytoplasm under normal conditions or in response to stress. An interesting distinction of the clusters described here is that their formation is induced in particular subcellular regions associated with protrusion retraction, suggesting that their assembly/disassembly is controlled by spatial signals.</p><p>The silencing of Rab13, and likely of other APC-dependent RNAs, at retracting protrusions is contrasted by their translational activation in extending lamellipodia. Given that localization of APC-dependent RNAs to the periphery is important for cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wang et al., 2017</xref>) these data could point to a functional role for spatially segregating translation such that local protein production occurs in actively extending regions, while being suppressed in retracting areas. This would imply the existence of a dynamic regulatory mechanism that coordinates APC-dependent RNA translation with the continuous protrusion and retraction cycles that characterize cellular migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ji et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tkachenko et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>A potential underlying mechanism for local silencing and granule formation could rely on spatially restricted phosphorylation/dephosphorylation events, which have been shown to affect the propensity of RNA-binding proteins to form phase-separated granules or to bind to RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Monahan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Murray et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Thapar, 2015</xref>). In this regard, it is interesting that proteins associating with APC-dependent RNAs include the translational regulator FMRP and the RNA-binding protein FUS, one of the paradigm proteins used in understanding phase transitions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mili et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yasuda et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yasuda et al., 2013</xref>). Local modifications of FMRP or FUS could underlie the observed regulation. Additional local events, including local maturation of miRNAs, could be envisioned (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sambandan et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>With regards to the assembly/disassembly dynamics of peripheral clusters and the fate of the sequestered RNAs, limitations in the duration of live-imaging we can accomplish do not permit concrete conclusions. However, our current data indicate that the extent of cluster formation might be influenced by the rate of retraction. Specifically, in NIH/3T3 cells, the majority of peripheral clusters are characterized by a visible accumulation of polyA signal, indicative of a high concentration of heterogeneous RNA species. By contrast, a substantial fraction of retracting MDA-MB-231 protrusions do not exhibit obvious polyA accumulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). A prominent difference between the two cell types is the speed with which protrusions retract. Contractile protrusions of NIH/3T3 cells can persist for a long time, while MDA-MB-231 protrusions quickly retract within a few minutes (compare <xref ref-type="video" rid="video11">Videos 11</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video12">12</xref> to <xref ref-type="video" rid="video13">Video 13</xref>). While we cannot rule out other interpretations, such as the existence of deadenylated transcripts, we favor the idea that slowly retracting protrusions allow for the build-up of large heterogenous granules, while in faster retracting protrusions peripheral granules are transient, and rapidly disassemble either through RNA degradation or release into the cytosol.</p><p>The existence of translationally silent multimeric RNA clusters also offers a potential explanation for the slight decrease of APC-dependent RNAs found in the heavy RNP fraction under conditions that disrupt transport to the periphery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2B</xref>). Translationally silent, higher-order RNP complexes can sediment at sucrose density gradient fractions heavier than their translated counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chekulaeva et al., 2006</xref>). By analogy, the peripheral clusters of APC-dependent RNAs likely account for some of the RNA found at heavier fractions of the gradient. Reduction of their formation upon parthenolide treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>) could likely account for the apparent shift of APC-dependent RNAs towards the lighter polysome fraction of the gradient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2B</xref>).</p><p>We had previously reported that APC-dependent RNAs can also be found in internal cytoplasmic granules induced by expression of FUS mutants carrying ALS-associated mutations. Intriguingly, in these FUS-granules APC-dependent RNAs are translationally active (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yasuda et al., 2013</xref>). Taken together, these observations raise the possibility that, at least for APC-dependent RNAs, their physical partitioning into granules is not the sole determinant, but acts in combination with the particular local environment to determine the eventual impact on their translation status. It would be interesting to further investigate how the composition of peripheral polyA granules differs from other internal cytoplasmic RNA granules with regards to both RNA and protein constituents.</p><p>We note that the above study describes the regulation of APC-dependent RNAs in migrating mesenchymal cells. It would be interesting to explore how translation and transport of this RNA group is carried out in larger and more stably polarized cells such as neurons.</p><p>Overall, we describe here a distinct mode of translational regulation of localized RNAs. These findings provide a different perspective towards understanding how local translation can influence protein activities and how these regulatory mechanisms could be integrated with dynamic cellular behaviors.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td>MDA-MB-231</td><td>ATCC</td><td>ATCC Cat# HTB-26, RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_0062">CVCL_0062</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Cell line (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td>NIH/3T3</td><td>ATCC</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_0594">CVCL_0594</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td>Primary dermal fibroblasts</td><td>provided by Dr. Ramiro Iglesias-Bartolome (NCI, NIH)</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Cell line (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td>NIH/3T3-PCFvGdelta1-PP7 (control translation reporter)</td><td>This study</td><td/><td>NIH/3T3 cells expressing SunTag-based control translation reporter.</td></tr><tr><td>Cell line (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td>NIH/3T3-PCFvGdelta1-deltaPP7 (control translation reporter)</td><td>This study</td><td/><td>NIH/3T3 cells expressing SunTag-based control translation reporter with deletion of the PP7 repeats.</td></tr><tr><td>Cell line (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td>NIH/3T3-PCFvGdelta1-Rab13U (translation reporter/Rab13 UTR)</td><td>This study</td><td/><td>NIH/3T3 cells expressing SunTag-based translation reporter with the mouse Rab13 UTR.</td></tr><tr><td>Cell line (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td>NIH/3T3-PCFvGdelta1-Pkp4U (translation reporter/Pkp4 UTR)</td><td>This study</td><td/><td>NIH/3T3 cells expressing SunTag-based translation reporter with the mouse Pkp4 UTR.</td></tr><tr><td>Cell line (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td>NIH/3T3-tdMCP-GFP_pIND20-b24bs/Net1 (MS2 reporter/Net1 UTR)</td><td>This study</td><td/><td>NIH/3T3 cells expressing MS2 reporter with the mouse Net1 UTR.</td></tr><tr><td>Cell line (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td>NIH/3T3-tdMCP-GFP_pIND20-b24bs/Rab13 (MS2 reporter/Rab13 UTR)</td><td>This study</td><td/><td>NIH/3T3 cells expressing MS2 reporter with the mouse Rab13 UTR.</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>anti-Rab13 rabbit polyclonal</td><td>Novus Biologicals</td><td>NBP1-85799</td><td>(1:1,000 WB; 1:200 PLA)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>anti-GAPDH (14C10) rabbit monoclonal</td><td>Cell Signaling</td><td>2118</td><td>(1:2,000 WB)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>anti-puromycin (3RH11) mouse monoclonal</td><td>Kerafast</td><td>EQ0001</td><td>(1:2,000 PLA)</td></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td>pHR-tdPP7-3x-mCherry</td><td>Addgene</td><td>74926</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td>pcDNA4TO-24xGCN4_v4-kif18b-24xPP7</td><td>Addgene</td><td>74928</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td>pcDNA4TO-24xGCN4_v4-kif18b</td><td>Addgene</td><td>74934</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td>pHR-scFv-GCN4-sfGFP-GB1-NLS-dWPRE</td><td>Addgene</td><td>60906</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td>pHR-scFv-GCN4-sfGFP-GB1-deltaNLS-dWPRE</td><td>This study</td><td/><td>Plasmid expressing scFv against GCN4 peptide of the SunTag system, fused to sfGFP, without NLS.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and James Manley as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The key to the work is the use of the SunTag system to identify localized mRNAs that have been or are being translated. The authors find that mRNAs appear to be translated as they are transported through the cytoplasm on their way to being localized, but then cluster and become translationally silenced. This goes against a prevailing view that mRNAs bound to the periphery are translationally repressed until they are localized. The reviewers find the work interesting but raise several concerns.</p><p>The following significant concerns must be addressed in a revised manuscript, should you wish to resubmit:</p><p>The reviewers agreed that the authors make generalizations that are not supported by the data. For instance, that they see mRNAs being translated while moving, these appear to be rare cases, and do not apply to all the mRNAs without necessary statistical analysis. The non-moving mRNAs may be more likely to translate, but there is a lack of quantification to evaluate this possibility. (They should cite the Wu et al. Science paper which also noted translating mRNAs in neurons-in fact all four of the single mRNA translation papers should be cited, not just Yan et al). Second, they do not consider alternative interpretations, for example that the translation is stalled until the mRNAs reach their destination, and the proteins are released there. More quantitation is needed before conclusions can be drawn as to polysome loading, for instance using qPCR. There is a noticeable lack of free protein, this seems to be a conundrum, along with the observation that translation is silenced exactly where it is needed. Discussion of the significance of this counter-intuitive observation is lacking. Finally, no consideration is given to the nature of the cells analyzed, and whether these results are an artifact of the cells or reporter chosen, The cells used, 3T3, are not good examples of cells with protrusive activity, or of polarized cells in general where localization is essential for motility (and it is known that immortalized cells localize mRNA poorly), and the reporter is not an endogenous gene with an endogenous promoter. They should test their system on primary cells to see if their observations hold there. So while the observations are potentially interesting they must be tempered by these specific constraints. The Discussion either needs to be softened, or the authors must provide additional data to address the generality of their observations. Finally, what conclusions the authors do want to draw on their specific system needs to be backed up by quantitation.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>This manuscript by Yasuda et al. have employed single molecule imaging of mRNA reporters to uncover a novel and very interesting mechanism for translation regulation of protrusion-localized mRNAs in cultured fibroblasts. In contrast to other reports that indicate transported mRNAs are translationally repressed during transport and unsilenced at the destination, here the data show that translational repression occurs after transport and involves the clustering of multiple mRNAs into heterogenous granules. The present experiments using fluorescent reporters is complemented by a biochemical approach to perturb mRNA localization which does not seem to alter translation. The strength of this paper is the use of SunTag reporters for live cell imaging of mRNA localization and translation, which does support a model for the formation of translationally repressed mRNPs within protrusions. While this finding does advance the state of knowledge for the field, there are concerns with some of data and resulting interpretations that suggest lack of translational repression during active mRNA transport. It does seem that new experiments could provide stronger evidence of mRNA silencing during active transport.</p><p>Specific comments:</p><p>Figure 1 shows that disruption of endogenous APC-dependent mRNA localization to protrusions using a competitive Pkp4 3'UTR reporter does not result in a shift of mRNA levels from polysome to mRNP fractions on sucrose gradients, in contrast to what was observed with puromycin treatment. The data need to be quantitated by real time PCR for several localized mRNAs. Specifically, the authors should report the actual values for% mRNA in each of the four fractions for several examples of localized mRNAs. While puromycin treatment resulted in marked mRNA shifts from heavy to light fractions, the competitive 3'UTR does appear to accumulate mRNA in an intermediate fraction #3. Another interpretation is that these are stalled ribosomes. This possibility has not been considered or discussed.</p><p>Figure 2 – the same comment as stated above also relates to use of pharmacologic perturbation of detyrosinated microtubules.</p><p>Figure 4 shows data obtained with the Sun-Tag reporter implying that the majority of single mRNAs have comparable translation efficiencies regardless of localization. The authors conclude that &quot;RNAs targeted to protrusions are not silenced during transport.&quot; One major concern with this strong interpretation is that the quantitative analysis was not done on &quot;directed&quot; particles but rather on the majority of particles that were stationary or oscillatory. A qualitative example shown does suggest translation can occur during transport. Can an experiment be done to stimulate mRNA transport and increase the% of directed RNAs, for example, serum starvations followed by stimulation as done by Singer and colleagues for b-actin? Quantitative analysis of SunTag reporter dynamics can also be done following depolymerization of detyrosinated MTs. Without evidence on quantitation of mRNAs that are actively being transported, the authors will need to soften their conclusions. Such RNAs that are not moving and not localized may be translated, but this does not imply a similar fate for those that are actively being transported to the cell protrusion.</p><p>In the Discussion, the authors should not generalize their findings in fibroblasts to all polarized cells, but rather restrict their interpretation to cells that localize mRNAs as single mRNPs. In neurons, for example, some types of mRNA granules contain multiple mRNAs which do appear to be silenced during transport. These different models should be compared.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>Many localized mRNAs are translationally silenced during transport and become activated only upon reaching their cellular destination. In their manuscript, Yasuda et al. present evidence that a specific set of mRNAs, previously characterized as APC-dependent and associated with detyrosinated microtubules, is translationally active both during transport and at the cellular periphery. However, once at the periphery, a subset of APC-dependent RNAs coalesce into translationally inactive clusters which the authors speculate are needed for dynamic regulation during cell migration. The authors use translation reporters containing the SunTag peptide array and PP7 hairpins coupled with live cell imaging to reach the conclusion that the 3′ UTRs of several APC-dependent RNAs confer translation during transport and silencing in large clusters near the periphery. The clustering effect is also seen by FISH against endogenous APC-dependent RNAs. This paper provides an interesting example that runs counter to the dominant paradigm of translationally silent mRNA transport. However, some figures seem incomplete, for example lacking comparison to the control reporter. The discussion could also be made much stronger by further explaining the authors' hypothesis about the function of the peripheral RNA clusters. Are the clusters an intermediate in an RNA degradation pathway or are they RNA storage granules with translationally-competent RNAs that can be dispersed in a regulated fashion? These points are discussed in more detail below.</p><p>Major points:</p><p>1) Figure 5 presents one of the most interesting findings of the paper – that APC-dependent RNAs form clusters at protrusions. However, the presentation does not come across as rigorous and should be improved by: 1) quantification of cluster sizes and statement of number of cells analyzed and 2) comparison to the control reporter in the same figure. It seems that Figure S4 makes this argument in a more rigorous way. Perhaps part of Figure S4 could be moved to Figure 5 and part of Figure 5 could be moved to S4 (the polyA and the MS2-reporter panel could be moved to supplemental). It is additionally confusing that Figure S4 suggests that most RNAs are not in clusters but Figure 5 shows examples where almost no non-clustered RNAs can be seen. It seems like the images in Figure 5 must be the more exceptional examples. Therefore, some statement or quantification of the frequency of clusters from the live cell imaging is needed.</p><p>2) Similar to the previous point, Figure 6 should state how many cells were analyzed and include the control reporter as a comparison.</p><p>3) It would be interesting to see more analysis of polyA RNA clusters vs. APC-dependent RNA clusters. It is shown in one example for Pkp4 RNA in Figure 5E, but not quantified and not shown for other RNAs. I believe the authors' hypothesis is that the RNA clusters are translationally repressed, but still translationally competent (i.e. not degradation products). If the authors could show that most APC-dependent RNA clusters are polyA+, this finding would support that hypothesis.</p><p>4) Similar to point 4, the discussion does not explain the authors' hypothesis about the function of the RNA clusters clearly and why they are translationally silenced. There is only one sentence suggesting that they reflect 'a local regulatory mechanism used to silence APC-dependent RNAs'. It would be good to elaborate on this point and maybe offer a brief comparison to other types of translationally silent RNA granules.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.44752.039</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The following significant concerns must be addressed in a revised manuscript, should you wish to resubmit:</p><p>The reviewers agreed that the authors make generalizations that are not supported by the data.

Our intent was not to conclude that RNAs are being translated <italic>while</italic> engaged in active transport, but rather that they can be translated similarly in both internal and peripheral locations. We have changed the text throughout the manuscript to clarify this. We have also specifically pointed out that the translation reporter imaging assay does not allow us to make accurate conclusions about the behavior of fast-moving molecules (subsection “RNAs targeted to protrusions are similarly translated in both internal and peripheral locations”) and have referenced the papers mentioned above. Furthermore, we have now used puro-PLA to detect in situ nascent Rab13 protein distribution (new Figures 7 and 8) (subsections “Endogenous Rab13 RNA is translated in both internal and peripheral locations” and “Peripheral Rab13 RNA is silenced at retracting protrusions”). This approach, apart from looking at the translation of an endogenous RNA, also circumvents the problem of fast-moving molecules by allowing us to look at translation in situ, in fixed samples. The results are fully consistent and support the conclusion that protrusion-localized RNAs can be translated in both peripheral and internal locations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Second, they do not consider alternative interpretations, for example that the translation is stalled until the mRNAs reach their destination, and the proteins are released there.</p></disp-quote><p>To address this possibility, we have performed run-off experiments, by brief treatment (15min) with harringtonine or lactimidomycin, and now show that the detected translation signals largely reflect active translation. Specifically, the new Figure 3—figure supplement 1 (described in subsection “Single-molecule translation reporters of protrusion-localized RNAs”) shows that the signal detected by the translation imaging reporters is reduced almost to background levels upon harringtonine (or lactimidomycin), but not upon cycloheximide treatment, showing that it reflects active translation. Additionally, detection of Rab13-puro PLA signal is reduced to background level upon harringtonine treatment (compare harringtonine with anisomycin treatment) (Figure 7B and Figure 8C) showing that endogenous Rab13 is also mostly translated by actively scanning ribosomes (new Figures 7 and 8) (subsections “Endogenous Rab13 RNA is translated in both internal and peripheral locations” and “Peripheral Rab13 RNA is silenced at retracting protrusions”). We have also seen that RNAs fractionating in polysomal fractions of sucrose gradients are shifted towards the non-translating fractions of the gradient upon harringtonine treatment. We have seen this result for a few RNAs we have detected by RT-PCR in human breast cancer cells (as detailed below we see very similar mechanisms in all cell types tested). These results are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>.</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>MDA-MB-231 cells were treated, or not, with harringtonine for 15min.</title><p>Fractions of polysome gradients were isolated and analyzed by RT-ddPCR to detect two localized, APC-dependent RNAs (Rab13 and Net1) and a non-localized control RNA (GAPDH).</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-44752-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Unfortunately, due to technical issues we have been unable to perform this experiment in mouse fibroblasts with the full panel of RNAs analyzed in Figures 1 and 2. However, given the effect of harringtonine seen in all other assays, we believe that even without this experiment we provide strong support for the conclusion that stalled ribosomes are not a significant part of the described mechanism.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>More quantitation is needed before conclusions can be drawn as to polysome loading, for instance using qPCR.</p></disp-quote><p>We believe that we might have not clearly conveyed that the heatmaps shown in Figures 1 and 2 are indeed averages of independent experiments. The associated p-values were meant to reflect whether the underlying distributions were different or not. We have now supplied, as source data, files with the exact values of all replicates used for the generation of the heatmaps and statistics in those figures.</p><p>With regards to the use of qPCR, we have opted to quantify RNA abundance using nanoString analysis instead of RT-qPCR because it allows for direct RNA counting and thus avoids biases introduced by reverse transcription and amplification. This is now stated in subsection “Disrupting the localization of APC-dependent RNAs at protrusions does not affect their translation”. Indeed, when we detect the spike RNA (which is added in equal amounts in the collected sucrose gradient fractions) we find that it is much more consistently and uniformly detected by nanoString analysis. RT-PCR detection shows much larger variations in the detected spike (even though the same amount was added). This underscores the variability and biases that can result from reverse transcription and amplification, which we think are exaggerated in samples with very different RNA complexities, such as those isolated from sucrose gradients.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There is a noticeable lack of free protein, this seems to be a conundrum, along with the observation that translation is silenced exactly where it is needed. Discussion of the significance of this counter-intuitive observation is lacking.</p></disp-quote><p>With regards to the lack of free protein, with think that this is probably a perception caused by the contrast of some images, which makes the free protein not so evident. However, this is not a real issue with the assay. Even though we specifically induce the expression of the reporters for only a short period of time (2-4hrs), precisely to avoid accumulation of both the RNA and protein to high levels, we nevertheless always detect a significant amount of free protein, seen as fast-moving GFP particles that are brighter compared to the diffuse background of the single chain GFP-labeled antibody. We think this is evident, for example, in Figures 3, figure 3—figure supplement 1 and Figure 4.</p><p>With regards to the conundrum of silencing translation at the periphery, we had tried to argue before that this reflects regulation of translation during dynamic processes, however we fully understand that more and better evidence was needed. Therefore, we have now provided substantial new evidence that we believe convincingly shows that silencing occurs at retracting protrusions. Thus, the resolution of the conundrum that we propose is that RNAs are translated in extending protrusions/lamellipodia and are silenced in retracting protrusions. These data are based on the use of puro-PLA to detect nascent Rab13 protein in situ and are detailed in the new Figures 7 and 8 (subsections “Endogenous Rab13 RNA is translated in both internal and peripheral locations” and “Peripheral Rab13 RNA is silenced at retracting protrusions”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally, no consideration is given to the nature of the cells analyzed, and whether these results are an artifact of the cells or reporter chosen, The cells used, 3T3, are not good examples of cells with protrusive activity, or of polarized cells in general where localization is essential for motility (and it is known that immortalized cells localize mRNA poorly)…</p></disp-quote><p>We have now provided data in primary human dermal fibroblasts as well as in breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231). We note that for the group of APC-dependent RNAs we are studying, we see robust localization in all cell types we have tested (primary, immortalized or transformed). We specifically show that in all cell types tested we see very similar behaviors in terms of the localization of the studied RNAs at protrusions; their translation in both internal and peripheral regions; their silencing at the periphery; and their coalescence in heterogeneous granules (new Figures 7-9 and subsections “Endogenous Rab13 RNA is translated in both internal and peripheral locations”; “Peripheral Rab13 RNA is silenced at retracting protrusions” and “Silenced Rab13 RNA at retracting protrusions can be found in heterogeneous clusters”). We therefore believe that we provide strong evidence that the reported mechanism is not an artifact of the cell line used but is generally exhibited by mesenchymal migrating cells.</p><p>3T3s are indeed different than the other two cell types used, in that they tend to form more contractile stable protrusions whose dynamics are much slower (we have provided videos to illustrate that point; compare Videos 11 and 12 to Video 13). As we briefly discuss (Discussion paragraph seven), we believe these slower dynamics might be the reason for the more pronounced formation of peripheral granules in 3T3 cells compared to the granules formed in the much more dynamic MDA-MB-231s. We believe that all cell types can provide valid information and that each one, through accentuating certain behaviors, can offer a valuable model to facilitate the study of different aspects of these structures.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>… and the reporter is not an endogenous gene with an endogenous promoter.</p></disp-quote><p>The point of how much any reporter reflects endogenous regulation is of course very valid. Even if a reporter recapitulates certain behaviors of endogenous RNAs (like we see for our reporters in terms of their peripheral localization and clustering), there is no guarantee that other aspects are also accurately reflecting the endogenous regulation. We find however, that it would be very difficult to ever provide unequivocal evidence that an exogenous reporter accurately reflects endogenous regulation, unless the regulation of the endogenous RNAs is first known. Therefore, instead of testing the effect of adding further elements (5’UTR, promoter, introns etc.) to our translation reporters, or of engineering aptamers into the endogenous genes, we rather chose to directly assess in situ the translation of an endogenous APC-dependent RNA. For this we used the puro-PLA method (puromycylation followed by proximity ligation amplification), which allows visualization of nascent proteins and translation sites of specific endogenous transcripts. In the new Figures 7-8 we provide controls for the validation of the assay in different cell types and use it to corroborate the findings obtained with the translation imaging reporters, as well as to extend them, showing that silencing occurs at retracting protrusions.</p><p>We are aware that some of the conclusions we have reached with these experiments could be further extended by live imaging of translation reporters in the more dynamic MDA-MB-231 cells. While these are certainly very interesting experiments that we intend to pursue in the future, we hope that you appreciate that generation of such stable lines, appropriate for high quality imaging, are a lengthy endeavor. We believe that the current data fully support the conclusions of the manuscript and hope you will find that the information contained in it is warranting publication at this stage.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>They should test their system on primary cells to see if their observations hold there.</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned above we have provided data in both primary cells and transformed cancer cells that are fully consistent with our previous conclusions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>So while the observations are potentially interesting they must be tempered by these specific constraints.

While this finding does advance the state of knowledge for the field, there are concerns with some of data and resulting interpretations that suggest lack of translational repression during active mRNA transport. It does seem that new experiments could provide stronger evidence of mRNA silencing during active transport.</p><p>Specific comments:</p><p>Figure 1 shows that disruption of endogenous APC-dependent mRNA localization to protrusions using a competitive Pkp4 3'UTR reporter does not result in a shift of mRNA levels from polysome to mRNP fractions on sucrose gradients, in contrast to what was observed with puromycin treatment. The data need to be quantitated by real time PCR for several localized mRNAs. Specifically, the authors should report the actual values for% mRNA in each of the four fractions for several examples of localized mRNAs. While puromycin treatment resulted in marked mRNA shifts from heavy to light fractions, the competitive 3'UTR does appear to accumulate mRNA in an intermediate fraction #3. Another interpretation is that these are stalled ribosomes. This possibility has not been considered or discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>We believe that we might have not clearly conveyed that the heatmaps shown in Figures 1 and 2 are indeed averages of independent experiments expressing the% mRNA in each fraction. The associated p-values were meant to reflect whether the underlying distributions were different or not. We have now supplied, as source data, files with the exact values of all replicates used for the generation of the heatmaps in those figures.</p><p>We have detailed in point 3 our rationale for using nanoString instead of RT-qPCR for quantitation of RNA levels.</p><p>We have performed ribosome run-off experiments with harringtonine to show that stalled ribosomes are not a significant part of the described mechanism. Please see response to point 2 for details.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 2 – the same comment as stated above also relates to use of pharmacologic perturbation of detyrosinated microtubules.</p></disp-quote><p>The heatmaps in this figure are also showing the averages of independent experiments expressing the% mRNA in each fraction. We have now supplied the source data with the exact values of all replicates used for the generation of the heatmaps in this figure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 4 shows data obtained with the Sun-Tag reporter implying that the majority of single mRNAs have comparable translation efficiencies regardless of localization. The authors conclude that &quot;RNAs targeted to protrusions are not silenced during transport.&quot; One major concern with this strong interpretation is that the quantitative analysis was not done on &quot;directed&quot; particles but rather on the majority of particles that were stationary or oscillatory. A qualitative example shown does suggest translation can occur during transport. Can an experiment be done to stimulate mRNA transport and increase the% of directed RNAs, for example, serum starvations followed by stimulation as done by Singer and colleagues for b-actin? Quantitative analysis of SunTag reporter dynamics can also be done following depolymerization of detyrosinated MTs. Without evidence on quantitation of mRNAs that are actively being transported, the authors will need to soften their conclusions. Such RNAs that are not moving and not localized may be translated, but this does not imply a similar fate for those that are actively being transported to the cell protrusion.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with this point and acknowledge that our conclusions were awkwardly stated. Please see response to point 1 for details.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In the Discussion, the authors should not generalize their findings in fibroblasts to all polarized cells, but rather restrict their interpretation to cells that localize mRNAs as single mRNPs. In neurons, for example, some types of mRNA granules contain multiple mRNAs which do appear to be silenced during transport. These different models should be compared.</p></disp-quote><p>It would indeed be interesting to explore how these RNAs are regulated in neuronal cells. We have added in the Discussion a specific mention to that effect and a statement emphasizing that our findings are describing behaviors of mesenchymal migrating cells (Discussion penultimate paragraph).</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[…] The clustering effect is also seen by FISH against endogenous APC-dependent RNAs. This paper provides an interesting example that runs counter to the dominant paradigm of translationally silent mRNA transport. However, some figures seem incomplete, for example lacking comparison to the control reporter. The discussion could also be made much stronger by further explaining the authors' hypothesis about the function of the peripheral RNA clusters. Are the clusters an intermediate in an RNA degradation pathway or are they RNA storage granules with translationally-competent RNAs that can be dispersed in a regulated fashion? These points are discussed in more detail below.</p><p>Major points:</p><p>1) Figure 5 presents one of the most interesting findings of the paper – that APC-dependent RNAs form clusters at protrusions. However, the presentation does not come across as rigorous and should be improved by: 1) quantification of cluster sizes and statement of number of cells analyzed and 2) comparison to the control reporter in the same figure. It seems that Figure S4 makes this argument in a more rigorous way. Perhaps part of Figure S4 could be moved to Figure 5 and part of Figure 5 could be moved to S4 (the polyA and the MS2-reporter panel could be moved to supplemental). It is additionally confusing that Figure S4 suggests that most RNAs are not in clusters but Figure 5 shows examples where almost no non-clustered RNAs can be seen. It seems like the images in Figure 5 must be the more exceptional examples. Therefore, some statement or quantification of the frequency of clusters from the live cell imaging is needed.</p></disp-quote><p>The confusion about the prevalence of clusters probably stems from the fact that Figure 5 showed enlargements of protrusive regions only, while Figure S4 showed whole-cell images and the associated quantifications. We have now noted this more obviously in both the text, figure legends and the figures themselves</p><p>We have also reorganized the data of Figure 5 and Figure S4 (now named Figure 5—figure supplement 1) and added new panels in order to present quantitations and statistical comparisons in the main figure (Figure 5H, I) (subsection “APC-dependent RNAs associate with heterogeneous clusters at the tips of protrusions”). We have tried throughout to mention sample sizes used for analyses.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Similar to the previous point, Figure 6 should state how many cells were analyzed and include the control reporter as a comparison.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included in the legend the number of cells imaged. We had not included the control reporter because we don’t see any clusters. In any case, the point of this figure is not to provide a quantitative assessment of cluster formation between control and localized reporters, but to compare the translation status of RNAs within clusters to single RNAs within the same protrusions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) It would be interesting to see more analysis of polyA RNA clusters vs. APC-dependent RNA clusters. It is shown in one example for Pkp4 RNA in Figure 5E, but not quantified and not shown for other RNAs. I believe the authors' hypothesis is that the RNA clusters are translationally repressed, but still translationally competent (i.e. not degradation products). If the authors could show that most APC-dependent RNA clusters are polyA+, this finding would support that hypothesis.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added further quantitation regarding the coincidence of polyA signal with APC-dependent RNA clusters (Figure 5I) to support the use of polyA staining as an identifier of peripheral clusters in 3T3 cells. Indeed, the majority of APC-dependent RNA clusters are polyA+, and polyA staining can even reveal clusters that don’t contain the particular APC-dependent RNA being imaged.</p><p>While it is of interest, we cannot currently make any assessment regarding the fate of RNA within granules. As mentioned in point 6, we are aware that information relevant to these questions could be provided by live imaging of translation reporters in the more dynamic MDA-MB-231 cells. While these are certainly very interesting experiments that we intend to pursue in the future, we hope that you appreciate that they are too involved to pursue in the context of the current manuscript. For now, we have added a mention to these issues in the Discussion (paragraph seven).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Similar to point 4, the discussion does not explain the authors' hypothesis about the function of the RNA clusters clearly and why they are translationally silenced. There is only one sentence suggesting that they reflect 'a local regulatory mechanism used to silence APC-dependent RNAs'. It would be good to elaborate on this point and maybe offer a brief comparison to other types of translationally silent RNA granules.</p></disp-quote><p>This point is now addressed more deeply with the addition of new data showing that silencing occurs at retracting protrusions (new Figures 7-9, subsections “Endogenous Rab13 RNA is translated in both internal and peripheral locations” and “Peripheral Rab13 RNA is silenced at retracting protrusions”).</p></body></sub-article></article>
