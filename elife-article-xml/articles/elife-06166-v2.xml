This functional partition depends upon the balance between proliferation and differentiation mostly accomplished in the hematopoietic organs. In <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, the lymph gland produces plasmatocytes and crystal cells that are not released until pupariation. Yet, throughout larval development, both hemocyte types increase in numbers. Mature plasmatocytes can proliferate but it is not known if crystal cell numbers increase by self-renewal or by de novo differentiation. We show that new crystal cells in third instar larvae originate through a Notch-dependent process of plasmatocyte transdifferentiation. This process occurs in the sessile clusters and is contingent upon the integrity of these structures. The existence of this hematopoietic tissue, relying on structure-dependent signaling events to promote blood homeostasis, creates a new paradigm for addressing outstanding questions in <italic>Drosophila</italic> hematopoiesis and establishing further parallels with vertebrate systems.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06166.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06166.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06166.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Insects have several different types of blood cell, many of which are unable to divide to form new cells once they have matured.

Similarly to what happens in vertebrates, the different functions performed by insect hemocytes are, to some degree, compartmentalized into different cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Honti et al., 2014</xref>). Some mature blood cells retain the ability to divide when in circulation, but the majority of blood cell proliferation and differentiation occurs in the hematopoietic organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Grigorian and Hartenstein, 2013</xref>). These organs provide the correct cellular and molecular environment for the control of cell proliferation and differentiation, namely in the so-called stem cell niches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Koch and Radtke, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Martinez-Agosto et al., 2007</xref>). Thus, the study of hematopoietic organs structure and function is essential to understand how different mature blood cells arise and how their absolute and relative numbers are controlled.</p><p>In <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, embryonic hematopoiesis produces two different types of mature hemocytes: plasmatocytes and crystal cells. Plasmatocytes are phagocytic cells often functionally compared to vertebrate macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Evans et al., 2003</xref>). Crystal cells are non-phagocytic cells known to produce prophenoloxidase, an essential component of the melanization cascade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Binggeli et al., 2014</xref>). Both plasmatocytes and crystal cells generated during embryogenesis persist into larval stages. Hemocytes in the larva can be found in circulation but the majority of them are attached to the cuticular epidermis as sessile cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lanot et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kurucz et al., 2007b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Makhijani et al., 2011</xref>). Hemocytes attached to the epidermis are not randomly dispersed but form stereotypical clusters of cells in every segment of the larva (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zettervall et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Makhijani et al., 2011</xref>) indicating that some signal must direct hemocytes to these locations. In fact, it has been recently shown that peripheral nervous system (PNS) neurons attract hemocytes and provide unknown trophic molecules for their survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Makhijani et al., 2011</xref>). The larva also possesses a hematopoietic organ, the lymph gland, where plasmatocytes and crystal cells differentiate from prohemocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Crozatier and Meister, 2007</xref>). Prohemocytes residing in the medullary zone of the lymph gland are instructed by cells from the posterior signaling center (PSC) to maintain their quiescent state or to differentiate into mature plasmatocytes or crystal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Crozatier et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mandal et al., 2007</xref>). During the differentiation process, it has been suggested that cells migrate and occupy the most cortical zone of the lymph gland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jung et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Krzemien et al., 2010b</xref>). An essential aspect of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> larval hematopoiesis is that hemocytes produced in the lymph gland do not disperse from the organ until pupariation or upon injury such as parasitoid wasp egg infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Holz et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Honti et al., 2010</xref>). Hence, in homeostatic conditions, differentiated hemocytes in the lymph gland do not contribute to the circulating and sessile hemocyte population. Nonetheless, the hemocyte population found in circulation and in sessile patches expands throughout larval development. Plasmatocytes are mitotically active cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rizki, 1957</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lanot et al., 2001</xref>) expanding during larval development by self renewal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Makhijani et al., 2011</xref>). On the other hand, all reports thus far concur in that mature crystal cells do not divide during larval stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Krzemien et al., 2010b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lanot et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rizki, 1957</xref>), although they have been shown to proliferate during embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lebestky et al., 2000</xref>). Further characterization of a yet unknown source and undetermined mechanism of crystal cell differentiation is required to understand how its number increases during larval development.</p><p>Although little is known on how crystal cells are formed outside the lymph gland, it has been shown that Notch signaling is necessary to form these cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Duvic et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lebestky et al., 2003</xref>). In the lymph gland, the role of Notch signaling in crystal cell formation is cell autonomous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mukherjee et al., 2011</xref>). Notch activation is sufficient in hemocytes to induce the expression of <italic>lozenge</italic>, the first known transcription factor in crystal cell development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lebestky et al., 2000</xref>). One particularity of Notch signaling is that it requires cell contact since the two known <italic>Drosophila</italic> Notch ligands, Serrate and Delta, are membrane bound proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fiúza and Arias, 2007</xref>). In the lymph gland, Serrate-positive hemocytes induce neighboring cells to adopt crystal cell fates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lebestky et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mukherjee et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ferguson &amp; Martinez-agosto 2014</xref>). Outside the lymph gland, only in sessile clusters may we observe hemocytes establishing stable cell–cell contacts between them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lanot et al., 2001</xref>). In fact, hemocytes in clusters are densely packed and linked through interdigitations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lanot et al., 2001</xref>), particularly in the last two abdominal larval segments, the putative posterior hematopoietic tissue (PHT) (Kurucz et al., 2007).</p><p>Indeed, in recent years, the idea that hematopoietic properties must reside outside of the lymph gland has been put forward explicitly by the Andó laboratory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Márkus et al., 2009</xref>). Firstly, in a descriptive endeavor by Kurucz et al. (2007) where an operational posterior hematopoietic tissue (PHT) consisting of the sessile hemocyte clusters in the last two abdominal segments is postulated; and later in a set of experiments showing that hemocytes taken from these clusters have the ability to differentiate into lamellocytes upon transfer to a different larva (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Márkus et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Honti et al., 2010</xref>). Importantly, sessile hemocytes in clusters constitute the biggest compartment of hemocytes in the larva (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lanot et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Makhijani et al., 2011</xref>), contained within epidermal and muscle tissue in a structure that has been called hematopoietic pockets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Makhijani et al., 2011</xref>). Moreover, the sessile plasmatocytes in such clusters have a higher division rate than those in circulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Makhijani et al., 2011</xref>). However, to consider the hemocyte clusters as a <italic>bona fide</italic> hematopoietic tissue, evidence is needed that their structure is necessary to control cell proliferation and/or cell fate decisions.</p><p>In this study, we directly test the hypothesis that the hemocyte clusters constitute a hematopoietic tissue by addressing systematically the following questions: (i) are crystal cells differentiating in these clusters? (ii) is the structure/architecture of these clusters necessary for this function? and (iii) what is the role of the Notch pathway in this hematopoietic role?</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Crystal cell numbers increase during larval development through de novo differentiation</title><p>In homeostatic conditions, the embryonic-derived hemocyte population consists of plasmatocytes and crystal cells. It is possible to distinguish these two cell types with several combinations of cell markers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lebestky et al., 2000</xref>) such as the two live genetic drivers: HemolectinΔ-nuclearDsRed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Clark et al., 2011</xref>) and Lozenge-GAL4 in combination with UAS-EGFP/mCD8GFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lebestky et al., 2000</xref>). With this combination of markers we can distinguish across the larval cuticle, Hml<sup>+</sup>Lz<sup>−</sup> from Hml<sup>+</sup>Lz<sup>+</sup> sessile hemocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,A′</xref>). Lozenge is the first marker known in the genetic cascade that leads to crystal cell differentiation and its expression is maintained as the cell matures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lebestky et al., 2000</xref>). Hemolectin promoter has been used in different <italic>Drosophila</italic> transgenic lines to mark the majority of hemocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sinenko and Mathey-Prevot, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Clark et al., 2011</xref>). Hence, Hml<sup>+</sup>Lz<sup>+</sup> cells are fully mature crystal cells or differentiating crystal cells while Hml<sup>+</sup>Lz<sup>−</sup> cells are plasmatocytes. During maturation, crystal cells loose HmlΔ-GAL4 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mukherjee et al., 2011</xref>). The same is observed with HmlΔ-nuclearDsRed but only in rare cells. This difference may be explained by the different degradation times of nuclearDsRed and cytoplasmatic GFP. In fact, it is possible to detect a higher proportion of Hml<sup>−</sup>Lz<sup>+</sup> cells with HmlΔ-cytoplasmaticDsRed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Another characteristic that distinguishes plasmatocytes from crystal cells is that the former tend to increase in size as they mature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Terriente-Felix et al., 2013</xref>). Measuring hemocytes cell areas in the three different populations of cells, we can observe a clear difference in size distributions between Hml<sup>+</sup>Lz<sup>−</sup>, Hml<sup>+</sup>Lz<sup>+</sup>, and Hml<sup>−</sup>Lz<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06166.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Hml<sup>+</sup>Lz<sup>+</sup> cells increase during larval development by de novo differentiation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Dorsal view of a third instar larva with hemocyte nuclei marked using HmlΔ-nuclearDsRed.

Here, we focus on third instar larvae because this is the developmental window in which the majority of larval hemocytes are originated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lanot et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Makhijani et al., 2011</xref>). Moreover, at this stage we could develop reliable in vivo imaging procedures that render our analysis and interpretations more pertinent (see below). It has been suggested repeatedly that during larval stages mature crystal cells are post-mitotic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rizki, 1957</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lanot et al., 2001</xref>) making it reasonable to assume that new crystal cells differentiate as development proceeds. This can be achieved by inducing new crystal cell precursors, proliferation of crystal cell precursors or simply by maturation of precursor cells already present in the larval body cavity. The earliest known marker predictive of crystal cell differentiation is Lozenge and it has been reported that during embryogenesis Lz<sup>+</sup> cells can proliferate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lebestky et al., 2000</xref>). We checked whether Lz<sup>+</sup> cells increase in number throughout third instar larval development or if their number is fixed and crystal cells mature from these precursors. We counted the total number of sessile hemocytes in the HmlΔ-nuclearDsRed LzGAL4&gt;GFP/mCD8GFP larvae (see ‘Materials and methods’). We could confirm that Hml<sup>+</sup> cells increase as third instar larval development proceeds, both in males and females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The number of Lz<sup>+</sup> cells also increases in the same time period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). In females there is no difference in the number of Lz<sup>+</sup> in the last 16 hr of development. With this, late third stage larva females have less crystal cells than males which is not common in the majority of fly stocks where females tend to have a higher number of crystal cells than males (see ‘Results’ below). Nevertheless, the results clearly show that committed crystal cells (Hml<sup>+</sup>Lz<sup>+</sup>) are increasing in number during third instar larval development, in parallel with an expansion of the plasmatocyte (Hml<sup>+</sup>Lz<sup>−</sup>) population.</p><p>Next, we wanted to distinguish if Lz<sup>+</sup> cells expand by cell proliferation or by de novo differentiation from Hml<sup>+</sup>Lz<sup>−</sup> cells. A way to achieve this is to directly visualize hemocyte clusters with live time-lapse imaging and calculate the proliferation and differentiation rates for each cell type. To that purpose, we developed a method for imaging epidermal hemocyte clusters in live larvae for periods of 3 hr. HmlΔ-nuclearDsRed; Lz-GAL4&gt;EGFP/mCD8GFP early L3 male larvae (&lt;12 hr after L3 ecdysis) were selected and prepared for imaging (see ‘Materials and methods’). As expected, it was possible to see the division of Hml<sup>+</sup>Lz<sup>−</sup> cell nuclei (Arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Throughout this 3-hr period, we estimate that ∼7% of Hml<sup>+</sup>Lz<sup>−</sup> cells divide (n = 13 videos with mean 50 Hml<sup>+</sup>Lz<sup>−</sup> and 6 Hml<sup>+</sup>Lz<sup>+</sup> cells per video). No case of Hml<sup>+</sup>Lz<sup>+</sup> cell division was seen in any video. Since the number of Lz<sup>+</sup> cells per video is small, we analyzed an extra set of videos to check only for Lz<sup>+</sup> cell divisions (7 videos, 118 Lz<sup>+</sup> cells analyzed through a 3-hr period). Still, no Lz<sup>+</sup> cell division was observed. This suggests that Hml<sup>+</sup>Lz<sup>+</sup> sessile cells in dorsal clusters divide at an extremely low frequency or are post mitotic cells. In contrast, we confirm that plasmatocytes (Hml<sup>+</sup>Lz<sup>−</sup>) proliferate within sessile clusters as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Honti et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Makhijani et al., 2011</xref>). Notably, it was possible to see induction of GFP in GFP<sup>−</sup> cells, demonstrating that an Hml<sup>+</sup>Lz<sup>−</sup> cell is turning into an Hml<sup>+</sup>Lz<sup>+</sup> cell (Arrowhead in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) (see <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>). During our analysis cells that start with low expression tend to increase it with time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). When we bleed larvae and analyze Hml<sup>+</sup>Lz<sup>+</sup> cells, we also see a tendency for larger cells to have more GFP, measured by mean grey value of the picture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). If larger cells had the same GFP signal they would have a lower mean grey value because the signal would be diluted. In conjugation, these results indicate that <italic>lozenge</italic> expression starts in Hml<sup>+</sup>Lz<sup>−</sup> cells morphologically indistinct from plasmatocytes and increases together with cell size as crystal cell maturation progresses.<media content-type="glencoe play-in-place height-250 width-310" id="media1" mime-subtype="avi" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-06166-media1.avi"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06166.008</object-id><label>Video 1.</label><caption><title>Induction of lozenge expression in hemocyte clusters.</title><p>HmlΔ-nuclearDsRed; Lz&gt;EGFP hemocytes in a dorsal cluster.

Since we do not observe Lz<sup>+</sup> cell divisions, it is important to check if the Hml<sup>+</sup>Lz<sup>−</sup> to Hml<sup>+</sup>Lz<sup>+</sup> differentiation measured ratio is sufficient to explain this increase during development. The proportion of Hml<sup>+</sup>Lz<sup>+</sup>-induced cells in our videos is ∼3.5% in 3 hr. Knowing the differentiation rate of Hml<sup>+</sup>Lz<sup>−</sup> into Hml<sup>+</sup>Lz<sup>+</sup>, we can extrapolate the number of Hml<sup>+</sup>Lz<sup>+</sup> cells differentiated from Hml<sup>+</sup>Lz<sup>−</sup> cells at given time (see ‘Materials and methods’). The differentiation rate calculated in our video analysis is sufficient to explain the increase in Hml<sup>+</sup>Lz<sup>+</sup> cell number observed in the first 24 hr of third instar larval development. The mean increase of Lz<sup>+</sup> cells measured during development is 256.4 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) and the extrapolation gives an increase of 447 Lz<sup>+</sup> cells. On the whole, the analysis of these videos shows that Hml<sup>+</sup>Lz<sup>+</sup> cells differentiate from Hml<sup>+</sup>Lz<sup>−</sup> cells in hemocyte clusters at a rate that is sufficient to explain the increase in this cell type observed in the first 24 hr of L3 development.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Plasmatocytes transdifferentiate into crystal cells</title><p>Only a small proportion of Hml<sup>+</sup>Lz<sup>−</sup> cells become Hml<sup>+</sup>Lz<sup>+</sup> in the course of third instar larval development. An important element to clarify is whether all Hml<sup>+</sup>Lz<sup>−</sup> cells have the capacity to become Hml<sup>+</sup>Lz<sup>+</sup> cells or whether this property is exclusive of a subpopulation of Hml<sup>+</sup>Lz<sup>−</sup> cells. In the time window of interest, hemocytes can be divided into two sub-populations, NimrodC1<sup>+</sup> and NimrodC1<sup>−</sup> (Kurucz et al., 2007; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Csordás et al., 2014</xref>). During lymph gland development, Nimrod is only detectable in mature plasmatocytes and it is not expressed in Lz<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Terriente-Felix et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ferguson &amp; Martinez-agosto 2014</xref>). Thus, in the lymph gland Lz<sup>+</sup> cells differentiate from Hml<sup>+</sup>Nimrod<sup>−</sup> cells. To test if Nimrod<sup>−</sup> hemocytes in sessile clusters are the precursors of Lz<sup>+</sup> cells, we checked for Nimrod protein (P1 antibody, see details in ‘Materials and methods’) in Lz<sup>+</sup> sessile cells. It is worth noticing that, because crystal cells burst after bleeding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bidla et al., 2007</xref>), there is a bias in immunofluorescence stainings in favor of more immature crystal cells. Contrarily to the lymph gland, the majority of Lz<sup>+</sup> cells are also Nimrod<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–A″</xref>).

In this case, cells that are phagocytically active become non-phagocytic and start to express lamellocyte markers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Honti et al., 2010</xref>). Given this, we proceeded to test if the observed transition between Lz<sup>−</sup> and Lz<sup>+</sup> corresponds to a change of fate from plasmatocyte (phagocytic) to crystal cell (non-phagocytic). From our results, it is evident that phagocytosis index is higher in Lz<sup>−</sup> hemocytes but it is still non-negligible in Lz<sup>+</sup> hemocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). When we characterize cell area and GFP intensity in Lz<sup>+</sup> cells, it is possible to observe that the smaller and GFP<sup>low</sup> expressing cells are able to phagocyte bacteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B′</xref>). Large cells that have GFP<sup>high</sup> expression are virtually non-phagocytic cells. This indicates that induced Lz<sup>+</sup> cells are plasmatocytes with phagocytic activity, which is lost as they mature into crystal cells. Altogether, these results support the transdifferentiation of mature phagocytically active plasmatocytes into non-phagocytic crystal cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Serrate expression in plasmatocytes is essential for crystal cell differentiation</title><p>As mentioned above, crystal cell numbers are reduced in larvae raised at a restrictive temperature in a thermo sensitive <italic>Notch</italic> allele background (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Duvic et al., 2002</xref>).

A misexpression screen identified some genes that when overexpressed in hemocytes can disrupt hemocyte clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Stofanko et al., 2008</xref>). However, we did not use these lines to test for crystal cell/plasmatocyte ratio alterations because it would be difficult to discern between the effect of not having the clusters and the effect of gene up-regulation in hemocytes. We opted to disrupt the hemocyte clusters by manipulating physically the larvae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Makhijani et al., 2011</xref>). By rolling groups of larvae between two cover slides, it is possible to force the hemocytes to detach from the epidermis and enter hemolymph circulation. After cluster disruption, hemocytes start to aggregate again, gradually (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Makhijani et al., 2011</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). To maintain hemocytes in circulation for a period of 10 hr, we disrupted hemocyte clusters in larvae every 1 hr 30 min (see ‘Materials and methods’). Using flow cytometry, we measured the proportion of Hml<sup>+</sup>Lz<sup>+</sup>/Hml<sup>+</sup>Lz<sup>−</sup> cells at the end of this treatment. The relative number of Hml<sup>+</sup>Lz<sup>+</sup> cells decreases in the treatment group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), indicating that clusters are necessary for crystal cell differentiation.</p><p>However, the cluster disruption treatment could also disrupt the lymph gland and/or change the rate of apoptosis differentially between Hml<sup>+</sup>Lz<sup>+</sup> and Hml<sup>+</sup>Lz<sup>−</sup> cells. We tested both possibilities. Firstly, using a PI exclusion assay, we determined if the rate of apoptosis changes upon cluster disruption. There is no significant difference between control and treatment groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). Secondly, to check if cluster disruption affects the lymph gland, we made use of DotGAL4, a driver expressed in lymph gland hemocytes but not in circulating and sessile hemocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Honti et al., 2010</xref>). Through lineage tracing analysis with Dot-GAL4 driver, we can check cells that are derived from the lymph gland. Indeed, using flow cytometry, we can observe lymph gland-derived hemocytes in the circulating pool of wasp-infected larvae and pupae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). When the same technique is used in cluster-disrupted larvae, there is no detectable lymph gland-derived hemocytes in circulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). Thus, the integrity of the cluster is necessary for crystal cell differentiation. Strikingly, in agreement with our observations, recent work shows that in <italic>Eater</italic> mutants that do not form hemocyte clusters, sessile crystal cells are absent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bretscher et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Altogether these results support that <italic>Notch</italic> signaling is necessary for crystal cell differentiation and depends on cluster structure. It is important to note, though, that hemocytes form clusters of different sizes and at different locations along the larval body (Kurucz et al., 2007; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Makhijani et al., 2011</xref>). Our cluster disruption procedure affects sessile hemocytes indiscriminately such that we cannot determine the relative importance of these cluster features on crystal cell differentiation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our motivation to carry out this work was to explain the increase of circulating and sessile crystal cell numbers during <italic>Drosophila</italic> larval development. This phenomenon is lined with an apparent paradox: no mature crystal cell has been seen dividing during larval stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rizki, 1957</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lanot et al., 2001</xref>; Krzemien et al., 2010) and crystal cells in the lymph gland do not enter circulation in homeostatic conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Holz et al., 2003</xref>). Crystal cell number increase may rely upon a population of pro-crystal cells that proliferates in the larva before cell maturation or that that exists in sufficient numbers at the beginning of development to mature into crystal cells throughout development. The first known upregulated gene diagnostic of crystal cell development is the transcription factor <italic>lozenge</italic> (Lz) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lebestky et al., 2000</xref>). That is, a cell will be Lz<sup>+</sup> before it matures into crystal cell and maintains this expression upon differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lebestky et al., 2000</xref>). We have shown that throughout third instar development, the number of Lz<sup>+</sup> cells in the sessile population increases. This observation excludes the possibility that a population of Lz<sup>+</sup> cells exists in fixed number and matures into crystal cell. Lz<sup>+</sup> cells have been reported to proliferate during embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lebestky et al., 2000</xref>). Surprisingly, we do not see Lz<sup>+</sup> cell division in our video analysis. Although, with our results, we cannot exclude that a small proportion of Lz<sup>+</sup> cells proliferate during larval stages, we can show that <italic>lozenge</italic> induction in Hml<sup>+</sup>Lz<sup>−</sup> is sufficient to explain the increase in Hml<sup>+</sup> Lz<sup>+</sup> cells during third instar larva.</p><p>The activation of <italic>lozenge</italic> in hemocytes is Notch-dependent with Serrate acting as the ligand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Duvic et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lebestky et al., 2003</xref>). When we ablate <italic>serrate</italic> expression only in hemocytes using the HmlΔ-GAL4 driver coupled to a UAS-Ser<sup>RNAi</sup>, the number of differentiated crystal cells is severely reduced within the sessile population. This indicates that hemocytes are the cells responsible for crystal cell induction in sessile clusters. Moreover, the hemocytes inducing crystal cell development are themselves Lz<sup>−</sup> because <italic>Serrate</italic><sup>RNAi</sup> driven by Lz-GAL4 driver does not decrease the number of crystal cells. For Notch to be activated it requires that a <italic>Serrate</italic> expressing cell is in contact for a certain period of time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Guruharsha et al., 2012</xref>). We show that this contact is a property of the clusters where Hml<sup>+</sup>Lz<sup>+</sup> cells are induced from Hml<sup>+</sup>Lz<sup>−</sup> cells. This observation establishes an important parallel between sessile and lymph gland crystal cell development. In both cases, the precursor to a crystal cell is an Hml<sup>+</sup>Lz<sup>−</sup> hemocyte (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mukherjee et al., 2011</xref>). However, there is a fundamental difference between these two hematopoietic events regarding the cells where <italic>lozenge</italic> is first expressed. Although hemocytes only activate <italic>lozenge</italic> expression in the cortical zone of the lymph gland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lebestky et al., 2000</xref>), the work of Krzemien et al. suggest that in the medullary zone of the lymph gland cells are already committed to become crystal cells at late second instar (Krzemien et al., 2010). This suggests that medullary zone cells migrating to the cortical zone can be considered pro-crystal cells. In line with this observation, in the lymph gland, no co-localization between plasmatocyte marker P1 and crystal cell marker Lz is ever observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Terriente-Felix et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ferguson &amp; Martinez-agosto 2014</xref>). In contrast, our analyses in hemocyte clusters suggest that <italic>lozenge</italic> induction occurs in mature plasmatocytes. Firstly, they derive from P1 cells. Secondly, Lz<sup>+</sup>GFP<sup>low</sup> cells can phagocyte as opposed to Lz<sup>+</sup>GFP<sup>high</sup> cells, which loose this capacity. Lz<sup>+</sup>GFP<sup>low</sup> cells are, according to our video analysis, the initial stages of crystal cell differentiation as virtually all Lz<sup>+</sup>GFP<sup>low</sup> become Lz<sup>+</sup>GFP<sup>high</sup>. Throughout time cells increase their GFP expression and become larger. Altogether our results suggest that mature plasmatocytes can differentiate into crystal cells.</p><p>This conclusion may help explaining some disparate results in the literature. Firstly, circulating crystal cells in the larva derive from cells that express the plasmatocyte-specific marker <italic>croquemort</italic> during the embryonic stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Franc et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Honti et al., 2010</xref>). Secondly, Lebestky et al. consider that a small fraction of the Lz-GAL4 positive cells gives rise to plasmatocytes defined by morphology and <italic>croquemort</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lebestky et al., 2000</xref>). In light of our results, we propose that the plasmatocyte-like cells expressing <italic>lozenge</italic> are plasmatocytes in route to become crystal cells. To our knowledge, the hypothesis that plasmatocytes give rise to crystal cells was put forward by Rizky in 1957, with the purpose of explaining how crystal cells increase in number without proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rizki, 1957</xref>). Our work provides the first body of evidence that puts this idea to test and validates this hypothesis.</p><p>It is possible that, contrary to the lymph gland, hemocyte clusters are not regionalized structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Honti et al., 2014</xref>). Yet, with the results shown here, we propose that hemocyte clusters work as a true hematopoietic tissue. Their presence and integrity are necessary for the proper establishment of Hml<sup>+</sup>Lz<sup>+</sup>/Hml<sup>+</sup>Lz<sup>−</sup> numbers during larva development. Interestingly, the hemocytes in clusters are in dynamic relation with circulating hemocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Babcock et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Welman et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Makhijani et al., 2011</xref>). This is confirmed in our videos where cells can be observed entering circulation from the patches and leaving circulation to become sessile. This dynamics opens the possibility of a more complex number and cell type regulation mechanism operating at the whole-organism level. Secondly, another interesting property of sessile plasmatocytes consists of their higher division rate with respect to their circulating counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Makhijani et al., 2011</xref>). This could happen because there is a different molecular ‘environment’ in hemocyte clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Makhijani et al., 2011</xref>) and/or because a sessile cell has an increased probability of entering cell division. We argue that the existence of these two characteristics, cell proliferation control and cell differentiation, is sufficient to consider the hemocyte clusters as hematopoietic tissues. In brief, hemocyte clusters enhance hemocyte proliferation and provide structure as to guarantee the necessary cell contacts that engage the signaling events behind cell fate decisions. Noticeably, hemocytes in clusters can be mobilized to circulation upon immune challenge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zettervall et al., 2004</xref>), a process that is in part dependent on the small GTPase <italic>Rac1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Xavier and Williams, 2011</xref>). The role of hemocyte clusters is most likely restricted to larval stages because, once pupariation starts, a peak of ecdysone promotes the dispersion of hemocytes throughout the epidermis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Regan et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>The differentiation of crystal cells from plasmatocytes within sessile clusters creates, in our view, an interesting parallel with macrophage development in vertebrates. Macrophages are the most plastic cells in the vertebrate's hematopoietic tissue and their specialization in vivo depends on the local microenvironment provided by the tissue they colonize (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ostuni and Natoli, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wynm et al., 2013</xref>). Similarly, here we show that in <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae the microenvironment provided by hemocyte clusters is necessary to induce crystal cell differentiation from plasmatocytes, namely through a cell-contact mechanism involving Notch-Serrate.</p><p>A putative important difference between hemocyte clusters and the lymph gland concerns the mechanisms in control of cell proliferation and differentiation. In support of this notion, misexpression of some genes in hemocytes can disrupt hemocyte clusters without affecting lymph gland morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Stofanko et al., 2008</xref>). Tightly linked to this question is one other fundamental aspect that remains unaddressed: the control of proportions between different cell types. Throughout homeostatic development, it is commonly observed, both in vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Almeida et al., 2005</xref>) and invertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rizki, 1957</xref>), that blood cell types respect fixed relative numbers. Also, it is now evident that plasmatocytes are very plastic cells and may represent a rare case of functionally mature cells transdifferentiating into other cell types: lamellocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Honti et al., 2010</xref>) and crystal cells. Transdifferentiation, the process where a cell changes its cell fate without passing through a less differentiated state, is used recurrently in cell culture assays but rarely seen in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jopling et al., 2011</xref>). How recurrent this mechanism may be in animal development presents itself as one important question for the future. We consider that acknowledging this novel hematopoietic organ, dynamically attached to the circulating hemocyte population and relying on structure-dependent signaling events to promote blood homeostasis, brings us a step closer to addressing these outstanding fundamental questions of <italic>Drosophila</italic> hematopoiesis.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Fly stocks and parasitoid maintenance</title><p>All fly stocks were maintained in standard fly food at room temperature.

A second cover slip is placed on top of the larva (dorsal side) so that the larva is stuck between two cover slips. The larva does not move but stays alive for at least 12 hr in a humid chamber. The pressure from the cover slip affects the A7 dorsal cluster, most probably because of the disruption of normal hemolymph circulation. Hence, we imaged more anterior epidermal clusters that were not so affected. The larva was mounted in an inverted confocal spinning microscope (Andor Revolution xD). The temperature of the slide chamber was maintained at 25°C and 95% relative humidity. A Z-stack of pictures ranging 28 μm was taken every 1 min 30 s for the GFP and RFP channel throughout a period of 3 hr.

We have addressed them in the text by changing a few sentences and including some precisions along the manuscript. Small adjustments were introduced in the Abstract and the following sentences were altered or included:</p><p>Introduction section, paragraph two: “On the other hand, all reports thus far concur in that mature crystal cells do not to divide during larval stages (Krzemien, Oyallon, et al. 2010; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lanot et al. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rizki 1957</xref>) although they have been shown to proliferate during embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lebestky et al. 2000</xref>). Further characterization of a yet unknown source and undetermined mechanism of crystal cell differentiation is required to understand how do its number increases during larval development.”</p><p>Results section, paragraph two: “It has been suggested repeatedly that during larval stages mature crystal cells are post-mitotic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lanot et al. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rizki 1957</xref>) making it reasonable to assume that new crystal cells differentiate as development proceeds.”</p><p>Results section, paragraph four: “This suggests that Hml<sup>+</sup>Lz<sup>+</sup> sessile cells in dorsal clusters divide at an extremely low frequency or are post mitotic cells.”</p><p>Discussion section, paragraph one: “This phenomenon is lined with an apparent paradox: no mature crystal cell has been seen dividing during larval stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rizki 1957</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lanot et al. 2001</xref>; Krzemien, Crozatier, et al. 2010) and crystal cells in the lymph gland do not enter circulation in homeostatic conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Holz et al. 2003</xref>).”</p><p>Results section, final paragraph: “It is important to note, though, that hemocytes form clusters of different sizes and at different locations along the larval body (Kurucz, Váczi, et al. 2007; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Makhijani et al. 2011</xref>). Our cluster disruption procedure affects sessile hemocytes indiscriminately such that we cannot determine the relative importance of these cluster features on crystal cell differentiation.”</p><p><italic>2) No data are presented for earlier instars of development. The authors should provide these data or explain in the manuscript why they decided to look only at the third instar</italic>.</p><p>We have no data for earlier larval stages and our analysis is indeed restricted to 3rd instar. This focus has both biological (the majority of hemocyte proliferation occurs in 3rd instar) and technical (the in vivo imaging at the heart of our work would not be feasible at earlier larval stages) justifications. To clarify this option and the concomitant limits of our observations and conclusions, we have modified the manuscript to clarify this point in the abstract and by adding:</p><p>Results section: “Here we focus on third instar larvae because this is the developmental window in which the majority of larval hemocytes are originated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lanot et al. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Makhijani et al. 2011</xref>). Moreover, at this stage we could develop reliable in vivo imaging procedures that render our analysis and interpretations more pertinent (see below).”</p></body></sub-article></article>
