hippocampus is thought to underlie memory consolidation. However, whether learning-induced increases in ripple-spindle coupling are necessary for successful memory consolidation has not been tested directly. In order to decouple ripple-spindle oscillations, here we chemogenetically inhibited parvalbumin-positive (PV<sup>+</sup>) interneurons, since their activity is important for regulating the timing of spiking activity during oscillations. We found that contextual fear conditioning increased ripple-spindle coupling in mice. However, inhibition of PV<sup>+</sup> cells in either CA1 or mPFC eliminated this learning-induced increase in ripple-spindle coupling without affecting ripple or spindle incidence. Consistent with the hypothesized importance of ripple-spindle coupling in memory consolidation, post-training inhibition of PV<sup>+</sup> cells disrupted contextual fear memory consolidation. These results indicate that successful memory consolidation requires coherent hippocampal-neocortical communication mediated by PV<sup>+</sup> cells.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27868.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Sleep contributes to the strengthening of memories. During non-dreaming sleep, neurons in regions of the brain that form and store memories – such as the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex – fire in rhythmic waves. The neurons in the hippocampus tend to fire during a wave that repeats up to 250 times per second, called sharp-wave ripples. Meanwhile, in the prefrontal cortex, the neurons tend to fire during a lower frequency wave that repeats 12 to 15 times per second, called spindles.</p><p>During sleep and quiet wakefulness, hippocampal ripples often synchronize with prefrontal spindles; that is, both waves tend to occur at approximately the same time. Many neuroscientists think this allows the brain regions to better communicate with one another, which in turn should help the brain to strengthen memories. Consistent with this possibility, rodents that learn a new task show more synchrony between ripples and spindles afterwards. But no one had actually tested whether this increase in ripple-spindle synchrony does strengthen the rodent’s memory of the task. It was also unclear how the brain achieves such an increase.</p><p>Xia et al. suspected that this process involved a group of inhibitory brain cells called parvalbumin-positive interneurons. These cells act like timekeepers, and help to synchronize the firing of groups of neurons. Xia et al. now show that training mice to associate an environment with a mild electric shock made it more likely that the animals would show ripple-spindle synchrony. Yet, inhibiting the activity of parvalbumin-positive interneurons in either the hippocampus or prefrontal cortex blocked this effect. It also prevented sleep from strengthening the animals’ memory of the link between the environment and the shock.</p><p>Patients with Alzheimer’s disease have fewer parvalbumin-positive interneurons. By showing that these neurons help strengthen new memories, these findings may explain why losing them can impair memory. Restoring or replacing interneuron activity could be a promising therapeutic avenue to explore.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>memory</kwd><kwd>consolidation</kwd><kwd>hippocampus</kwd><kwd>anterior cingulate cortex</kwd><kwd>ripple</kwd><kwd>spindle</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FDN143227</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Frankland</surname><given-names>Paul W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MOP74650</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Josselyn</surname><given-names>Sheena A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038</institution-id><institution>Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RGPIN-2015-05458</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Takehara-Nishiuchi</surname><given-names>Kaori</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038</institution-id><institution>Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RGPIN-2014-04947</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Richards</surname><given-names>Blake A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038</institution-id><institution>Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xia</surname><given-names>Frances</given-names></name><name><surname>Tran</surname><given-names>Matthew M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Electrophysiological and behavioural experiments reveal that parvalbumin interneuron-mediated increases in neocortical-hippocampal interactions are necessary for successful memory consolidation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Rhythmic oscillations that occur during sleep and periods of quiet wakefulness are thought to be important for memory consolidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Diekelmann and Born, 2010</xref>). Specifically, during periods of rest, hippocampal sharp-wave ripples, a form of high frequency network oscillation (100–250 Hz), are observed in temporal proximity to prefrontal cortical oscillations called spindles (12–15 Hz) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Siapas and Wilson, 1998</xref>). This temporal correlation, referred to as ripple-spindle coupling, is thought to support communication between the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex required for memory consolidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Buzsáki, 1989</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Clemens et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dudai et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Frankland and Bontempi, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Girardeau and Zugaro, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Igarashi, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Peyrache et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Schwindel and McNaughton, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Siapas and Wilson, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sirota et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Staresina et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wierzynski et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wilson and McNaughton, 1994</xref>). Consistent with this hypothesis, cortical electrical stimulation both enhances ripple-spindle coupling and improves performance on an object-location task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Maingret et al., 2016</xref>). However, whether increased ripple-spindle coupling following learning is necessary for memory consolidation is unknown. Furthermore, the specific cell types that underlie this phenomenon have not yet been identified.</p><p>In the hippocampus, parvalbumin-positive (PV<sup>+</sup>) interneurons play a key role in regulating temporal correlations in activity. More specifically, in the CA1 region of the hippocampus, PV<sup>+</sup> cells are not required for the generation of ripple oscillations, but appear to be important for the timing of ripples and the synchronization of spiking during ripples. PV<sup>+</sup> cells exhibit phase-locked firing with ripples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Klausberger et al., 2003</xref>), and optogenetic inhibition of CA1 PV<sup>+</sup> cells disrupts this phase-locking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gan et al., 2017</xref>) and the coherence of spiking during ripples in CA1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Stark et al., 2014</xref>), without impacting the probability of ripple occurrence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gan et al., 2017</xref>). Less is known about the role of PV<sup>+</sup> cells in regulating temporal correlations during oscillations in the mPFC. But, as with ripples in CA1, PV<sup>+</sup> cell activity is phase-locked to spindles in the mPFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Averkin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hartwich et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Peyrache et al., 2011</xref>), suggesting a similar role of PV<sup>+</sup> cells in promoting coherent cortical population activity. The promotion of temporal coherence by PV<sup>+</sup> cells during ripples and spindles matches previous findings showing that PV<sup>+</sup> basket cells can act as a ‘clocking mechanism’ in circuits to ensure specific cell populations fire at appropriate times (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Freund and Katona, 2007</xref>). Given the importance of spike-synchrony for communication between circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wang et al., 2010</xref>), such mechanisms may be critical for inter-regional communication events such as increased ripple-spindle coupling following learning. This raises the possibility that increased ripple-spindle coupling depends on the activity of PV<sup>+</sup> cells. If so, then inhibition of PV<sup>+</sup> cell activity in either CA1 or mPFC should perturb inter-regional communication by altering ripple and spindle coherence.</p><p>To test the hypotheses that (1) PV<sup>+</sup> cells mediate increases in ripple-spindle coupling following learning, and (2) that this increase in coupling is necessary for memory consolidation, we trained mice using contextual fear conditioning. This form of learning engages plastic processes in the hippocampus, including CA1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Johansen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Maren et al., 2013</xref>), and the mPFC, including the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Vetere et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zhao et al., 2005</xref>). We used PV<sup>+</sup> cell-specific Cre driver mice to express chemogenetic constructs allowing us to selectively inhibit PV<sup>+</sup> cells in the ACC or CA1 following training. To investigate the role of PV<sup>+</sup> cells in promoting increased ripple-spindle coupling, we performed in vivo electrophysiological recordings in mice post-training. As expected, we observed an increase in the probability of ripple-spindle coupling following contextual fear conditioning. Notably, post-training inhibition of PV<sup>+</sup> cell activity in the ACC or CA1 did not alter ripple or spindle incidence, but eliminated the learning-induced increase in ripple-spindle coupling. Consistent with this finding, inhibition of PV<sup>+</sup> cell activity in either ACC or CA1 also impaired contextual fear memory consolidation. These data indicate that PV<sup>+</sup> cells play an important role in enhancing hippocampal-neocortical dialogue following learning, and that this communication is important for memory consolidation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Chemogenetic inhibition of PV<sup>+</sup> cells</title><p>To target PV<sup>+</sup> interneurons in the ACC or CA1, we micro-infused an adeno-associated virus (AAV) that expresses the inhibitory Designer Receptor Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADD) hM4Di with a fluorescent reporter (mCherry) in a Cre-recombinase-dependent manner (AAV-DIO-hM4Di-mCherry) in mice expressing Cre-recombinase only in PV<sup>+</sup> cells (PV-Cre mice) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Armbruster et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hippenmeyer et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sohal et al., 2009</xref>).

To further control for any off-target effects of CNO, or any effects caused by the metabolic conversion of CNO to clozapine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gomez et al., 2017</xref>), we also performed the same experiments using the control vector, AAV-DIO-mCherry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>; hM4Di-mCherry<sup>+</sup> <italic>n</italic> = 12, hM4Di-mCherry<sup>-</sup><italic>n</italic>=10, mCherry<sup>+</sup> <italic>n</italic> = 13, mixed-model permutation test, 1000 permutations, [hM4Di-mCherry<sup>+</sup> versus hM4Di-mCherry<sup>-</sup> versus mCherry<sup>+</sup>]: p=0.001). mCherry<sup>+</sup> cells from both hM4Di- and control vector-infused mice exhibited much higher spiking rates than mCherry<sup>−</sup> cells across all current levels tested prior to CNO application, verifying that infection was limited to fast-spiking PV<sup>+</sup> interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Klausberger et al., 2003</xref>).

Furthermore, promoting ripple-spindle coupling enhances consolidation of an object-location memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Maingret et al., 2016</xref>). However, previous studies did not directly test whether this form of hippocampal-neocortical communication is necessary for successful memory consolidation, nor identify the cellular bases for mediating learning-dependent changes in ripple-spindle coupling. Here we found that contextual fear learning increased ripple-spindle coupling, and, furthermore, that chemogenetic inhibition of PV<sup>+</sup> cells in the ACC or CA1 both eliminated this learning-induced increase in ripple-spindle coupling and impaired memory consolidation.</p><p>Both mono- and multi-synaptic pathways between ACC and CA1 can support bidirectional communication between these two regions via ripple-spindle coupling. We observed an average lag between ripple and spindle peak amplitude of ~70 ms, consistent with ranges previously reported (40–244 ms; e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Peyrache et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Phillips et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Siapas and Wilson, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wang and Ikemoto, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wierzynski et al., 2009</xref>]). This suggests that these two events are more likely coordinated via multiple synapses. Although the exact mechanism is unclear, there are several possibilities for bidirectional modulations. For example, ACC can modulate dorsal CA1 activity via thalamic regions, including nucleus reuniens (e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Varela et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Xu and Südhof, 2013</xref>]). Interestingly, mPFC neurons that project to the nucleus reuniens preferentially synapse onto hippocampus-projecting reuniens cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Vertes et al., 2007</xref>). In addition, a subset of neurons in the nucleus reuniens project to inhibitory interneurons in CA1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dolleman-Van der Weel and Witter, 2000</xref>). Furthermore, a group of nucleus reuniens cells also has collaterals in both CA1 and mPFC, potentially coordinating activities between the two regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Varela et al., 2014</xref>). CA1 can, in turn, modulate ACC via subiculum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Varela et al., 2014</xref>), ventral hippocampus, retrosplenial cortex (e.g.,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cenquizca and Swanson, 2007</xref>]), infralimbic cortex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Swanson, 1981</xref>], and/or prelimbic cortex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Thierry et al., 2000</xref>]).</p><p>PV<sup>+</sup> cells likely coordinate ripple-spindle coupling by facilitating synchronized spiking during ripples and spindles. In CA1 and mPFC, PV<sup>+</sup> cell activity is phase-locked to ripples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Klausberger et al., 2003</xref>) and spindles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Averkin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hartwich et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Peyrache et al., 2011</xref>), respectively. In CA1, inhibition of PV<sup>+</sup> cells disrupts phase-locked firing of PV<sup>+</sup> cells to ripples, and ripple coherence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Stark et al., 2014</xref>). This is consistent with the proposed role of PV<sup>+</sup> cells acting as a ‘clocking mechanism’ in circuits, ensuring that specific cell populations fire at appropriate times (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Freund and Katona, 2007</xref>).</p><p>Inhibition of PV<sup>+</sup> cells in the ACC or CA1 did not affect baseline probability of ripple-spindle coupling, but prevented learning-induced increases in ripple-spindle coupling. In the absence of learning, PV<sup>+</sup> cells show moderate levels of activation. However, following learning we observed strong activation of PV<sup>+</sup> cells in both regions, as well as a corresponding increase in the probability of ripple-spindle coupling. Importantly, CNO-mediated inhibition did not eliminate PV<sup>+</sup> cell activity, but reduced it to pre-learning or home cage levels (as shown in our ex vivo and in vivo experiments). Therefore, we would expect that chemogenetic inhibition of PV<sup>+</sup> cells following learning should not eliminate ripple-spindle coupling altogether, but instead, reduce it to the levels that occur in the absence of training, which is what we observed. Consistent with this idea, fear conditioning increases hippocampal network stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Donato et al., 2013</xref>), and chemogenetic inhibition of PV<sup>+</sup> cells in CA1 blocks this learning-induced increase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ognjanovski et al., 2017</xref>). Notably, when PV<sup>+</sup> activity levels are driven below baseline levels via other techniques, there is an associated reduction in the probability of ripple-spindle coupling, even in the absence of learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Phillips et al., 2012</xref>). This suggests that the overall levels of PV<sup>+</sup> cell activity regulate the probability of ripple-spindle coupling. Accordingly, strong activation of PV<sup>+</sup> cells during learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Donato et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Restivo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ruediger et al., 2011</xref>) may increase coherence both within and across brain regions. Synchronous activity, such as ripple-spindle coupling, is particularly effective at driving inter-regional communication and plasticity required for consolidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fell and Axmacher, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Igarashi, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wang et al., 2010</xref>). Therefore, inhibition of PV<sup>+</sup> cell activity in either the CA1 or the mPFC likely prevented this learning-induced increase in coupling, by perturbing intra-regional synchrony of action potentials during ripples and spindles, and consequently, the coordination of inter-regional communication.</p><p>In contrast, inhibition of PV<sup>+</sup> cells in either ACC or CA1 immediately prior to testing did not affect recall (at 1 or 28 days post-training). Since overall activity in ACC and CA1 are known to be important for retrieval of contextual fear memories, these observations suggest that the activity of non-PV<sup>+</sup> cells was not affected by our PV manipulations. Consistent with this, the c-Fos levels in mCherry<sup>-</sup> cells in these regions following CNO treatment were not altered.</p><p>Ripples are associated with simultaneous memory trace reactivation in the hippocampus and neocortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Peyrache et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Peyrache et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Schwindel and McNaughton, 2011</xref>). Therefore, impaired ripple coherence following CA1 inhibition of PV<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Stark et al., 2014</xref>) likely reduced coordinated hippocampal output to the neocortex, and consequently decreased the probability of simultaneous memory trace reactivation in the neocortex. In the mPFC, memory trace reactivation is often followed by occurrence of spindles, and increased activation of local PV<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Peyrache et al., 2011</xref>). This is thought to favor the consolidation of recently modified synapses during memory reactivation, while suppressing interfering inputs to the neocortex. Since ACC inhibition of PV<sup>+</sup> cells was sufficient to disrupt ripple-spindle coupling (without changing the overall incidence of spindles or ripples), this suggests that our manipulation interfered with the timely occurrence of spindles following ripples/memory reactivation. Therefore, inhibition of ACC PV<sup>+</sup> cells likely prevented the strengthening of synapses in the neocortex that is necessary for memory consolidation.</p><p>Our findings provide support for the idea that PV<sup>+</sup> cells are necessary for learning-associated increases in ripple-spindle coupling probability, and consequently, successful memory consolidation. Ripple-spindle coupling is also increased following odor-reward learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mölle et al., 2009</xref>), and therefore it seems plausible that the role of PV<sup>+</sup> interneurons is similar during consolidation of appetitively-motivated (as well as aversively-motivated) tasks. There are, however, alternative possibilities for why our PV manipulation resulted in consolidation deficit. For example, it is possible that the effects of inhibition of PV<sup>+</sup> cells outside of the sleep period (i.e., the ripple-spindle coupling window) could contribute to the consolidation deficits that we observed.</p><p>Moreover, inhibition of PV<sup>+</sup> cells may have increased lateral disinhibition and disrupted local circuit activity, in addition to disrupting global communication (i.e., ripple-spindle coupling). While we cannot definitively exclude this possibility, three pieces of evidence suggest that the observed consolidation deficits are mediated primarily by disruption of global communication. First, we found that inhibition of PV<sup>+</sup> cells in either ACC or CA1 immediately following training impaired memory tested 24 hr later. Activity in CA1, but not ACC, is critical for expression of contextual fear memory at this time point (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Frankland and Bontempi, 2005</xref>). Therefore, if our manipulation of PV<sup>+</sup> cells activity only affected local activity, we would not predict the memory deficits following inhibition of ACC PV<sup>+</sup> cells. Second, inhibition of PV<sup>+</sup> cells had no effect on retrieval of contextual fear memories, tested either 24 hr or 28 days post-training, suggesting again that the overall local activity is relatively undisturbed. This reinforces the idea that our PV manipulation is distinct from other manipulations that more profoundly impact pyramidal cell activity in these regions. Third, consistent with this, we did not observe increased activation in mCherry<sup>-</sup> cells in targeted regions following inhibition of PV<sup>+</sup> interneurons. Therefore, the more plausible explanation is that the observed deficits are caused by disrupted global synchrony (i.e., ripple-spindle coupling).</p><p>We used a chemogenetic approach to manipulate PV<sup>+</sup> cell activity in ACC and CA1. One advantage of this approach is that chemogenetic-induced inhibition does not completely eliminate the activity of infected cells (e.g., compared to some forms of optogenetic silencing), and therefore is less likely to produce large-scale changes in overall circuit activity. Consistent with this, we did not observe a detectable increase in activation of mCherry<sup>-</sup> cells in either in vivo or ex vivo experiments. This may also explain why our PV manipulation did not produce broad changes in local field potential at theta (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Amilhon et al., 2015</xref>) or gamma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sohal et al., 2009</xref>) frequencies, as previously observed using optogenetic silencing of PV<sup>+</sup> cells. The absence of changes in the activity of non-infected neurons may also be related to the fact that PV<sup>+</sup> cells represent only a subpopulation of GABAergic interneurons in both ACC and CA1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bezaire and Soltesz, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rudy et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tremblay et al., 2016</xref>), and therefore it is plausible that non-infected cells in the circuit can still maintain homeostasis of spiking activity when the activity of PV<sup>+</sup> cells is suppressed. Moreover, reducing PV-mediated inhibition could lead to disinhibition of other inhibitory cell types (e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lovett-Barron et al., 2012</xref>]), thereby producing little overall change in excitation or inhibition.</p><p>In conclusion, here we showed that contextual fear learning increased the probability of ripple-spindle coupling. Inhibition of PV<sup>+</sup> cells in either ACC or CA1 eliminated this learning-induced enhancement and impaired fear memory consolidation. These data indicate that temporally correlated activities across brain regions are necessary for contextual fear memory consolidation, and our study provides evidence for an integral role for PV<sup>+</sup> cells in this process.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p>All procedures were approved by the Canadian Council for Animal Care (CCAC) and the Animal Care Committees at the Hospital for Sick Children and the University of Toronto.

After perfusion, the brain was quickly removed and cut coronally (350 μm thickness) with a vibratome (Leica, VT1200S) in chilled cutting solution in order to obtain live, healthy slices containing the ACC. Slices were transferred to a recovery chamber comprising of a 50:50 mix of warm (34°C) cutting solution and aCSF (containing, in mM: 125 NaCl, 25 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 1.25 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 2.5 KCl, 1.3 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 20 D-glucose, 3 Na-pyruvate, 1 ascorbic acid). Following 40–60 min of incubation, slices were transferred into a different incubation chamber with room temperature aCSF. Within the recording chamber, aCSF was heated to 32°C using an in-line heater (Warner Instruments, SF-28). Whole-cell current clamp recordings were made using glass pipettes filled with internal solution (comprising, in m): 126 K D-Gluconate, 5 KCl, 10 HEPES, 4 MgATP, 0.3 NaGTP, 10 Na-phosphocreatine). Glass capillary pipettes were pulled with a flaming brown pipette puller (Sutter, P-97) to tip resistances between 3–8 MΩ. We determined the effects of acute CNO application by patching individual mCherry<sup>+</sup> or mCherry<sup>−</sup> cells and injecting square 500 ms current pulses into the cell (in 40 pA steps, ranging from −80 pA to 400 pA), both before and after CNO application (washing aCSF containing 10 μM CNO onto the slice for 10 min). We calculated the difference in firing rate (using the positive current injections) and input resistance (using the negative current injections) pre- and post-CNO application.</p><p>For the chronic group, 4 weeks following viral micro-infusion, mice were given either CNO or vehicle in their drinking water for 28 days. On the 29th day, mice received clean drinking water for 24 hr, to flush out the CNO in their system and allow testing in drug-free conditions. Extraction and incubation procedures followed those above. In addition to the current clamp recordings, voltage clamp recordings were obtained by clamping the voltage for 500 ms in 20 mV steps from −90 mV to +30 mV. To estimate the strength of the active, non-inactivating K<sup>+</sup> currents (which may have been altered by chronic CNO exposure) we measured the steady state current in the final 400 ms of the voltage step.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>In vivo electrophysiology</title><p>Four weeks after micro-infusion of hM4Di-mCherry or mCherry virus in the ACC or CA1 in PV-Cre mice, custom-made local field potential (LFP) electrodes were implanted in the ACC (+0.8 mm AP,±0.3 mm ML, −1.8 mm DV) and CA1 (−1.9 mm AP, ±1.3 mm ML,1 −1.7 mm DV). Similar to described above, mice were first anesthetized with 2% isoflurane and placed on a stereotaxic frame. Holes were drilled in the skull at the targeted coordinates, and virus was delivered as described above. Four weeks following viral vector micro-infusion, mice were implanted with LFP electrodes. Mice were anesthetized with 2% isoflurane and mounted onto a stereotaxic frame. Miniature stainless steel screw was placed in the cerebellum for ground, and a stripped stainless steel wire was inserted into the neck muscle for recording electromyogram (EMG) activity. Holes were drilled at the targeted coordinates, and custom made Teflon-coated stainless steel LFP electrodes (A-M Systems, Carlsborg, WA) bundled in 23–25G stainless steel cannulas were slowly lowered to the ACC (bipolar electrode with 0.3 mm distance between electrodes) and CA1 (tripolar electrode with 0.3 mm distance between electrodes), at the rate of 0.1 mm/s. LFP signals are referenced locally within the ACC or CA1. All wires were soldered to gold pins and inserted into to a plastic cap (PlasticsOne). The electrodes and cap were secured on the skull using dental cement. Mice were given ketoprofen (5 mg/kg, subcutaneous) and 1 ml 0.9% saline (subcutaneous) for 2 days following surgery. Mice were single-housed following surgery, to prevent potential fighting that could damage the cap.</p><p>Three days after surgery, mice were habituated to the recording chamber for two days (2 hr/day). The sound-attenuated chamber was dimly lit, and contained a tall Plexiglass cylinder, inside which mice were placed and allowed to sleep for the duration of the recording. All recording session were carried out during ZT 2–6, and LFP activities were recorded using the RZ-5 recording system (Tucker-Davis Technologies). Signal was amplified 1000 times, filtered between 1 and 400 Hz, and digitized at 2 kHz. On the second day of habituation, baseline (pre-training; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>) LFP activity was obtained. On the following day, mice were fear conditioned, similar to as described above. Immediately afterward, mice were given CNO (5 mg/kg) or vehicle i.p., and within 5–10 min, placed into the recording chamber to record the post-conditioning LFP activity (post-training, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref> and 2 hr). We chose this specific delay (5–10 min), because data from many other groups show that neural activity in chemogenetic-infected cells is altered within 10–60 min following CNO injection (e.g., (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alexander et al., 2009</xref>) [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>]; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ryan et al., 2015</xref>) [Figure S12]). For PV<sup>+</sup> cells specifically, a previous study used an identical chemogenetic-based approach to inhibit PV<sup>+</sup> cells (AAV-DIO-hM4Di in PV-Cre mice, same dose of CNO) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kuhlman et al., 2013</xref>). They measured calcium transients following CNO injection, and observed a decrease in PV<sup>+</sup> cell activity, beginning 30–60 min following CNO injection. The delay we chose therefore allows us to capture the earliest onset of CNO-mediated effects on LFP activity.</p><p>Following the post-training recording session, mice were returned to the home cage, and given CNO or vehicle in drinking water for the next 7 days. The first consolidation recording session took place 7 days after fear conditioning (Con. 1, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1g–h</xref> and 2 hr).

This method was found to be sensitive and robust in detecting the directionality and lag between LFP signals in different brain regions and is independent of amplitude changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adhikari et al., 2010</xref>). Briefly, for ripple-spindle coupling, ripple amplitude was cross-correlated with spindle amplitude in the ±4 s time window from spindle centre, with sliding window at 0.01 s increments. The correlation time window was restricted to NREM sleep periods only. Correlation coefficient was obtained for each spindle-ripple pair, and averaged across all spindle windows for each mouse in a recording session, and averaged across mice in the same group. To assess whether the correlation levels measured were significantly above chance, we computed correlation at chance level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adhikari et al., 2010</xref>). Specifically, the ripple amplitude time windows were pseudo-randomly shuffled 4–10 s with respect to spindle amplitude time windows for 100 times. The shifted amplitude windows were then cross-correlated. The process was performed for each mouse within each condition to generate the distribution of correlations at chance. The original correlation was considered significant if the peak value was higher than 99th percentile of the randomly generated cross-correlation peaks.

For ripple-delta coupling, ripple amplitude was cross-correlated with delta amplitude in the ±0.5 s time window from delta onset, with 0.01 s lag. Correlation coefficient was obtained for each delta-ripple pair, and averaged across all delta windows for each mouse in a recording session, and averaged across mice.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Andrew King (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Thomas J. McHugh (Reviewer #2); Matt Jones (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this study, Xi et al. expressed DREADS in PV cells of PV-Cre mice and show that reduced activity of PV interneurons results in a diminished cross-correlation between ripple activity recorded in CA1 and spindle oscillations obtained from the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) after mice have been trained to contextual fear conditioning. The percentage of freezing also declined. Similar results were not observed in naïve, untrained mice. Moreover, PV interneuron silencing one week after training was effective in reducing learning (freezing) but not 3-4 weeks after training, indicating that PV interneurons are needed for the consolidation of memory. The work was reviewed by three reviewers and all three very much impressed by the quality of the work. Several concerns, particularly regarding the interpretation of the data, have been formulated by the reviewers which will need to be authors addressed.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>First, the authors show in the initial figures that PV interneuron inhibition causes a reduced cross-correlation between spindle and ripple activity. Later, however, they swap to the observation of freezing behavior only and do not show examples of the underlying reduced cross-correlation in oscillatory activities between PFC and CA1. Please provide these data either in the main figures of the study or in the supplementary material.</p><p>Second, reviewer #2 was concerned with the interpretation of some of the data and therefore formulated a proposal for an additional behavioral experiment, as set out below.</p><p>Third, determine the spread of the viruses.</p><p>Fourth, please comment on the question of whether ripples during quiet wake and ripples during non-REM are functionally equivalent in terms of their contributions to memory consolidation.</p><p>Finally, be aware that a recent publication 'Ognjanovski N, Schaeffer S, Wu J, Mofakham S, Maruyama D, Zochowski M, Aton SJ. Parvalbumin-expressing interneurons coordinate hippocampal network dynamics required for memory consolidation. Nat Commun. 2017 Apr 6;8:15039. doi:10.1038/ncomms15039', which addresses related questions. This paper should be discussed in the manuscript.</p><p>Major reviewer comments:</p><p>1) It is unclear why an aversive-motivated task has been chosen for the study and not a task which does not require the involvement of fear, as, for example, an odor-reward task (Molle et al., 2009). The authors show at a later stage of the manuscript that PV interneuron silencing in weaker conditioning protocols also resulted in similar reduced freezing, but again this behavior includes freezing conditions. The question is, does inhibition of PV interneurons reduce freezing only after aversive-motivated tasks followed by consolidation of the fear memory, or can this finding be more generalized to also other behavioral (non-fear-related) conditions?</p><p>2) The authors show that PV interneuron inhibition causes a reduced cross-correlation between spindle and ripple activity. Later they swap to the observation of freezing behavior only and do not show examples of the underlying reduced cross-correlation in oscillatory activities between PFC and CA1. These data should be shown because they are the proposed underlying circuit mechanism.</p><p>3) Although the authors showed by using whole-cell recordings in vitro that bath application of CNO reduces the activity of PV interneurons expressing DREADDs, in vivo single unit recordings of fast-spiking interneurons, putative PV cells, would be the better proof of concept.</p><p>4) One question emerging from the study is 'how is the here proposed coupling between ripple CA1 and spindle PFC realized with a delay of ~70 ms?' As the authors mention, it must be a polysynaptic pathway and they provide some examples of possible morphological connections, such as the interfacing nucleus reunions. LFP recordings from all three brain areas would be one way of addressing this question.</p><p>5) The authors report that PV<sup>+</sup> inhibition in the PFC or CA1 prevents the post-training increase in ripple-spindle coupling and impairs memory consolidation. The interpretation they prefer is one of the necessity of coupling to drive strengthening of cortical synapses which in turn underlies the consolidation of a 28d memory. The post-training physiology data is used to suggest that the local impact of inhibition is minimal with the primary deficit being the decreased coupling of the events. However, if the local interventions in the PFC and/or CA1 impacted the quality or stability of the recently encoded memory then in essence there would be nothing to consolidate, which is a deficit distinct from a loss of coupled reactivation events. While this may seem trivial or semantic, it is key to their primary conclusion. More importantly, there are experimental approaches to clarify these scenarios. Unfortunately just reporting that ripples and/or spindles are present and unchanged in frequency following CNO tells us nothing about their information content in terms of temporally precise spiking (replay). I realize these types of analyses would be impossible due to the manner in which the current data set was recorded. However there is a behavioral experiment that would strengthen their interpretation. Their model predicts that if the memory were to be tested when it was still 'hippocampal dependent' [in most system consolidation models ~1 week post-training] it should be intact even in animals receiving CNO. The authors do provide some limited 14d testing data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> from recording mice that demonstrates deficits at this point, however this is a difficult time point to interpret. Ideally a behavioral experiment modeled on the experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> should be included that tested context fear at the 7d time point in mice that receive 1 week of post-training CNO treatment. If the impact of PV manipulations is specific to ripple-spindle coupling and the impairment of systems consolidation then memory should be intact at this time. If impairments are seen in either CNO treated group then perhaps an alternative and/or additional explanation is warranted. If a 7d deficit is observed then local inhibition of the PV circuit in the PFC and/or CA1 may impair hippocampal consolidation perhaps through changing ripple participation/timing/replay immediately post-training and the 28d deficit may not necessarily be related to the decrease in event coupling.</p><p>6) It was fortunate that a 5mg/kg dose of CNO provided a 'goldilocks' level of inhibition such that no off-target effects (seizure/change in ripple occurrence or frequency/baseline c-Fos expression) were observed nor was baseline coupling reduced (as seen in the Phillips et al. paper), yet increased coupling of spindles and ripples following learning was abolished. Although the authors address this in the Discussion, I still wonder if they think this implies that baseline coupling is unrelated to memory consolidation and/or is simply reflective of chance events? This can be estimated by asking if the frequency of baseline events exceed what is expected by chance based on rate of occurrence of each type of event. Further, given that the authors also report that the learning included c-Fos expression in PV<sup>+</sup> neurons is lost in the CNO treated mice, does this imply plasticity in the PV network similar to what has been suggested by Caroni and colleagues underlies the appearance of the 'new' coupled events? This should be addressed in greater detail in the Discussion.</p><p>7) How large is the extent of the spread of the viral manipulation? A rather large volume of virus was used at each injection site, however from the data and text presented it is impossible to infer the extent of the manipulation. This is important as the phenotypes on both the behavioral and physiological levels are system-wide. Even a rough estimate of the average dorsal/ventral and medial/lateral spread of the infected neurons would be useful.</p><p>8) The authors demonstrate that fear memory recall induces a significant increase in the fraction of PV<sup>+</sup> neurons expressing c-Fos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B, C</xref>). However CNO administered before testing did not impair recall (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), suggesting that the activity driving c-Fos induction during recall is unrelated to behavior. While admittedly a minor point, these data seem at odds which each other and should be mentioned in the Discussion.</p><p>9) An additional analysis that would offer insights into an important issue in the field is whether ripples during quiet wake and ripples during non-REM are functionally equivalent in terms of their contributions to memory consolidation?

In one set of experiments, LFP recordings and behavioral analyses were conducted in the same mice, and these data are presented in Figures. 2, 3, and 5C. Importantly, these experiments show that a) fear conditioning increases the probability of ripple-spindle coupling, b) inhibition of PV<sup>+</sup> interneurons eliminates this learning-induced increase in coupling, and c) elimination of this learning-induced increase in coupling impairs fear memory consolidation. This pattern of results was observed following inhibition of PV<sup>+</sup> interneurons in either the ACC or CA1 region of the hippocampus.</p><p>In this set of experiments, inhibition of PV<sup>+</sup> interneurons began immediately following fear conditioning and continued for 7 days. Fear memory was then assessed 14 days after training. These combined recording/behavioral experiments then served as a foundation for a series of behavioral experiments in which we more fully explored the time window in which PV<sup>+</sup> interneuron inhibition impairs fear memory consolidation (e.g., length of inhibition [1 d vs. 1 week vs. 1 month] and timing of inhibition [during the 1<sup>st</sup> vs. 4<sup>th</sup> post-training week]). Given the large numbers of mice involved in these experiments, we did not perform additional LFP recordings in these mice. Moreover, we were interested in memory expression at remote time-points (i.e., 28 days post-training). We could not consistently maintain viable electrodes for that length of time, and therefore it was not possible to conduct parallel recordings in these extended experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Second, reviewer #2 was concerned with the interpretation of some of the data and therefore formulated a proposal for an additional behavioral experiment, as set out below.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this excellent suggestion, and have conducted the additional behavioral experiments as suggested. Specifically, we trained mice in contextual fear conditioning, and then inhibited PV<sup>+</sup> interneurons immediately following training. Mice were then tested 24 hours later. Inhibition of PV<sup>+</sup> interneurons in either the ACC or CA1 impaired subsequent memory consolidation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> in the revised manuscript).</p><p>These data speak to the broader issue of whether our manipulation is affecting local vs. global activities. With respect to CA1, many studies have shown that contextual fear memory is dependent on CA1 activity at this 24 hour time point (e.g., pharmacological/optogenetic inhibition, and lesions). Therefore, the memory deficits that we observed might be related to disturbance of local activity. That being said, we also showed that the same manipulation disrupts global activity (e.g., ripple-spindle coupling). Therefore, from these CA1 results, it is difficult to dissociate the effects of our manipulation on local vs. global activities.</p><p>However, the ACC results suggest that the effects are most likely due to disturbance of global activity (i.e., ripple-spindle coupling). One day after training, contextual fear memory does not depend on ACC activity (e.g., Frankland et al. [2004]). Therefore, the memory deficit is unlikely to be due to disruption of local activity in the ACC alone. The more plausible explanation is that the observed deficits are caused by disrupted global synchrony (i.e., ripple-spindle coupling).</p><p>Furthermore, according to this account, disrupting ripple-spindle coupling should have no effect on retrieval at 24 hours or 28 days post-training (since we do not expect to observe ripple-spindle coupling while mice are awake and behaving, such as during memory retrieval tests). We therefore also examined the impact of inhibition of PV<sup>+</sup> cells in either CA1 or ACC on retrieval at the 24 hour time point [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>] (in addition to the 28 day data already presented in the original manuscript [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D</xref>]) following contextual fear conditioning. In all cases, we found that inhibition of PV<sup>+</sup> cells in either CA1 or ACC during retrieval at 24 hours or 28 days post-training had no effect on memory performance, suggesting that our manipulation is distinct from other manipulations that more profoundly impact pyramidal cell activity (i.e., direct manipulations of pyramidal cells).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Third, determine the spread of the viruses.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested we have provided more comprehensive characterization of our viral infections, and in particular paid attention to the anterior/posterior, medial/lateral, and dorsal/ventral spread of our infections. We estimated the spread as suggested (CA1: AP -1.2 ~ -2.4 mm, ML ± 0.2 ~ 3 mm, DV -1.5 ~ -2 mm; ACC: AP 1.2 ~ -0.2 mm; ML ± 0.1 ~ 0.8 mm, DV -0.7 ~ -2 mm). This information is now included in the Materials and methods section. Schematics and additional representative examples of infections in each region are now shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>. Importantly, we only included mice where infected neurons were confined to the target region, with negligible spread to neighboring regions. The criteria are stated in the Materials and methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Fourth, please comment on the question of whether ripples during quiet wake and ripples during non-REM are functionally equivalent in terms of their contributions to memory consolidation.</p></disp-quote><p>As awake ripples are generally recorded in the conditioning environment, and we did not do recordings during fear conditioning, we cannot directly speak to the differences between awake ripple and NREM ripples in memory consolidation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally, be aware that a recent publication 'Ognjanovski N, Schaeffer S, Wu J, Mofakham S, Maruyama D, Zochowski M, Aton SJ. Parvalbumin-expressing interneurons coordinate hippocampal network dynamics required for memory consolidation. Nat Commun. 2017 Apr 6;8:15039. doi:10.1038/ncomms15039', which addresses related questions. This paper should be discussed in the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added discussion of the Ognjanovski et al. (2017) paper in the revised manuscript, as suggested. Our results are consistent with those of Ognjanovski et al. insofar as finding that post-training inhibition of CA1 PV<sup>+</sup> interneurons impaired memory consolidation (when tested 24 hours after training). Ognjanovski et al. also showed that inhibition of PV<sup>+</sup> interneurons disrupted learning-induced increases in functional connectivity and stability within CA1, resulting in reduced coherent spiking activities, bolstering the idea that PV<sup>+</sup> interneurons are critical for spike timing activity in CA1. These findings are also consistent with our hypothesis that disrupted timing in CA1 can subsequently disrupt coherent communication with other brain regions (such as ACC), and therefore lead to reductions in learning-induced increases in ripple-spindle coupling.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major reviewer comments:</p><p>1) It is unclear why an aversive-motivated task has been chosen for the study and not a task which does not require the involvement of fear, as, for example, an odor-reward task (Molle et al., 2009). The authors show at a later stage of the manuscript that PV interneuron silencing in weaker conditioning protocols also resulted in similar reduced freezing, but again this behavior includes freezing conditions. The question is, does inhibition of PV interneurons reduce freezing only after aversive-motivated tasks followed by consolidation of the fear memory, or can this finding be more generalized to also other behavioral (non-fear-related) conditions?</p></disp-quote><p>Molle et al. (2009) found that odor-reward learning was associated with increased ripple-spindle coupling. This inspired us to examine whether the same is observed following learning in an aversively motivated task, and further explore the mechanisms underlying the learning-induced increases in ripple-spindle coupling. Although these authors did not directly manipulate PV<sup>+</sup> cells in their study, it seems plausible that the role of PV<sup>+</sup> interneurons would be similar during consolidation of appetitively motivated vs. aversively motivated tasks (although this remains to be tested). We make note of this in the revised Discussion (seventh paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors show that PV interneuron inhibition causes a reduced cross-correlation between spindle and ripple activity. Later they swap to the observation of freezing behavior only and do not show examples of the underlying reduced cross-correlation in oscillatory activities between PFC and CA1. These data should be shown because they are the proposed underlying circuit mechanism.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see above Essential revisions point 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Although the authors showed by using whole-cell recordings in vitro that bath application of CNO reduces the activity of PV interneurons expressing DREADDs, in vivo single unit recordings of fast-spiking interneurons, putative PV cells, would be the better proof of concept.</p></disp-quote><p>We presented several convergent lines of evidence that show that PV<sup>+</sup> cell activity can be efficiently inhibited by CNO (including ex vivo patch clamp recordings, and in vivo immediate early gene analyses). We agree that in vivo single unit recordings would add to this proof of concept. However, unfortunately we were not set up to do in vivo single unit recordings in mice.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) One question emerging from the study is 'how is the here proposed coupling between ripple CA1 and spindle PFC realized with a delay of ~70 ms?' As the authors mention, it must be a polysynaptic pathway and they provide some examples of possible morphological connections, such as the interfacing nucleus reunions. LFP recordings from all three brain areas would be one way of addressing this question.</p></disp-quote><p>We very much agree with this, and this is an avenue that we will explore in future work.</p><p><italic>5) The authors report that</italic> PV<sup>+</sup><italic>inhibition in the PFC or CA1 prevents the post-training increase in ripple-spindle coupling and impairs memory consolidation. The interpretation they prefer is one of the necessity of coupling to drive strengthening of cortical synapses which in turn underlies the consolidation of a 28d memory. The post-training physiology data is used to suggest that the local impact of inhibition is minimal with the primary deficit being the decreased coupling of the events. However, if the local interventions in the PFC and/or CA1 impacted the quality or stability of the recently encoded memory then in essence there would be nothing to consolidate, which is a deficit distinct from a loss of coupled reactivation events. While this may seem trivial or semantic, it is key to their primary conclusion. More importantly, there are experimental approaches to clarify these scenarios. Unfortunately just reporting that ripples and/or spindles are present and unchanged in frequency following CNO tells us nothing about their information content in terms of temporally precise spiking (replay). I realize these types of analyses would be impossible due to the manner in which the current data set was recorded. However there is a behavioral experiment that would strengthen their interpretation. Their model predicts that if the memory were to be tested when it was still 'hippocampal dependent' [in most system consolidation models ~1 week post-training] it should be intact even in animals receiving CNO. The authors do provide some limited 14d testing data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> from recording mice that demonstrates deficits at this point, however this is a difficult time point to interpret. Ideally a behavioral experiment modeled on the experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> should be included that tested context fear at the 7d time point in mice that receive 1 week of post-training CNO treatment. If the impact of PV manipulations is specific to ripple-spindle coupling and the impairment of systems consolidation then memory should be intact at this time. If impairments are seen in either CNO treated group then perhaps an alternative and/or additional explanation is warranted. If a 7d deficit is observed then local inhibition of the PV circuit in the PFC and/or CA1 may impair hippocampal consolidation perhaps through changing ripple participation/timing/replay immediately post-training and the 28d deficit may not necessarily be related to the decrease in event coupling.</italic> </p><p>Please see above Essential revisions point 2.</p><p><italic>6) It was fortunate that a 5mg/kg dose of CNO provided a 'goldilocks' level of inhibition such that no off-target effects (seizure/change in ripple occurrence or frequency/baseline c-Fos expression) were observed nor was baseline coupling reduced (as seen in the Phillips et al. paper), yet increased coupling of spindles and ripples following learning was abolished. Although the authors address this in the Discussion, I still wonder if they think this implies that baseline coupling is unrelated to memory consolidation and/or is simply reflective of chance events? This can be estimated by asking if the frequency of baseline events exceed what is expected by chance based on rate of occurrence of each type of event. Further, given that the authors also report that the learning included c-Fos expression in</italic> PV<sup>+</sup><italic>neurons is lost in the CNO treated mice, does this imply plasticity in the PV network similar to what has been suggested by Caroni and colleagues underlies the appearance of the 'new' coupled events? This should be addressed in greater detail in the Discussion.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. We have calculated the probability of ripple-spindle coupling at chance level for each condition in each mouse (virus in ACC vs. CA1, Pre-training vs. Post-training), and found that all correlations, including those at baseline (Pre-training), were significantly higher than chance for all mice (an example is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>, and the results have been added to the revised manuscript). The results are consistent with previous studies (e.g., Siapas and Wilson [1998]). This suggests that the baseline correlation still likely reflects a significant, continuous communication between the two brain regions. However, the level of coupling is dynamically modulated by learning (i.e., fear learning increases the probability of coupling). This likely reflects an increased need for cross-regional communication during consolidation, which requires increased activity of PV<sup>+</sup> cells in both ACC and CA1.</p><p>We agree that our findings are consistent with those by Caroni and colleagues, and suggest that learning activates PV<sup>+</sup> cells and this may lead to increased network stability (e.g., by switching the network to a high-PV-configuration and reducing synaptic turnover). This may be one of the mechanisms underlying learning-induced increases in local/global coherence. We have added this idea to the Discussion (fourth paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) How large is the extent of the spread of the viral manipulation? A rather large volume of virus was used at each injection site, however from the data and text presented it is impossible to infer the extent of the manipulation. This is important as the phenotypes on both the behavioral and physiological levels are system-wide. Even a rough estimate of the average dorsal/ventral and medial/lateral spread of the infected neurons would be useful.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see above Essential revisions point 3.</p><p><italic>8) The authors demonstrate that fear memory recall induces a significant increase in the fraction of</italic> PV<sup>+</sup><italic>neurons expressing c-Fos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B, C</xref>). However CNO administered before testing did not impair recall (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), suggesting that the activity driving c-Fos induction during recall is unrelated to behavior. While admittedly a minor point, these data seem at odds which each other and should be mentioned in the Discussion.</italic> </p><p>We have now added a brief discussion on this point (Discussion, fifth paragraph), as suggested. While there was an increase in c-Fos in the PV<sup>+</sup> cell populations in ACC and CA1 during tests (and a corresponding decrease in the CNO groups), we did not observe changes in c-Fos levels in mCherry<sup>-</sup> following CNO treatment (compared to vehicle-treated mice; [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref> bottom panel]). This suggests that the overall activity of non-PV<sup>+</sup> cells in these two brain regions was not significantly impacted by our manipulation, and therefore we would not expect an impact on memory retrieval. This also reinforces the idea that our PV manipulation is distinct from other manipulations that more profoundly impact pyramidal cell activity in these regions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) An additional analysis that would offer insights into an important issue in the field is whether ripples during quiet wake and ripples during non-REM are functionally equivalent in terms of their contributions to memory consolidation? Analyses should be included to show awake ripple densities and properties in relation to (a) learning and (b) CNO.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see above Essential revisions point 4.</p></body></sub-article></article>
