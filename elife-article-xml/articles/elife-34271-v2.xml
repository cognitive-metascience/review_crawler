Imaging of individual Env molecules on native virions shows Env trimers to be dynamic, spontaneously transitioning between three distinct well-populated conformational states: a pre-triggered Env (State 1), a default intermediate (State 2) and a three-CD4-bound conformation (State 3), which can be stabilized by binding of CD4 and coreceptor-surrogate antibody 17b. Here, using single-molecule Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (smFRET), we show the default intermediate configuration to be asymmetric, with individual protomers adopting distinct conformations. During entry, this asymmetric intermediate forms when a single CD4 molecule engages the trimer. The trimer can then transition to State 3 by binding additional CD4 molecules and coreceptor.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Single molecule FRET</kwd><kwd>HIV-1 Envelope</kwd><kwd>virus entry</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Virus</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM116654</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mothes</surname><given-names>Walther</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AI116262</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Munro</surname><given-names>James B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM098859</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Blanchard</surname><given-names>Scott C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM056550</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Blanchard</surname><given-names>Scott C</given-names></name><name><surname>Mothes</surname><given-names>Walther</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000884</institution-id><institution>Cancer Research Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Irvington Fellows Program</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Munro</surname><given-names>James B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AI042853</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Munro</surname><given-names>James B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004543</institution-id><institution>China Scholarship Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Yale World Scholars</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ma</surname><given-names>Xiaochu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AI005023-17</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kwong</surname><given-names>Peter D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The identification of a single-CD4 bound asymmetric HIV-1 Envelope trimer intermediate provides new mechanistic insights into the activation of Envelope for fusion, and highlights the importance of asymmetry in biology.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) enters CD4+ T cells through the interaction of its envelope glycoprotein (Env) with cell-surface receptor CD4 and coreceptor CCR5 or CXCR4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wyatt and Sodroski, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Doms and Moore, 2000</xref>). Env is a trimer with each protomer consisting of two subunits: the surface subunit gp120 that binds to receptor and coreceptor, and the transmembrane subunit gp41 that mediates fusion of viral and cellular membranes. CD4 binding induces conformational changes in Env that expose structural elements required for coreceptor binding including the V3 loop and the bridging sheet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Trkola et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kwong et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Huang et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Liu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Pancera et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Herschhorn et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ozorowski et al., 2017</xref>). Binding of coreceptor triggers additional conformational changes in gp41, including the formation of an extended gp41 structure that subsequently collapses into a stable six-helix bundle, which is thought to drive viral and cellular membranes together for fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Pancera et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blumenthal et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Harrison, 2015</xref>). Correspondingly, Env’s capacity to undergo extensive conformational changes is critical for virus entry.</p><p>At the same time, Env evades immune surveillance through ‘conformational masking’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kwong et al., 2002</xref>), which protects key functional elements within the trimer from being recognized by antibodies. This feature renders most Env-targeting antibodies non-neutralizing. However, a portion of patients develop potent broadly neutralizing antibodies that can prevent immunodeficiency virus infections in animal models, lower the viral load when administered to HIV-1-infected patients and can restore immunological control in the absence of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in non-human primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Walker et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Klein et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Caskey et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Gautam et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Schoofs et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Nishimura et al., 2017</xref>). Antibodies that are broadly neutralizing tend to recognize closed Env conformations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Munro et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Guttman et al., 2015</xref>). Substantial efforts have been made to characterize structurally closed Env trimers using stabilized soluble ectodomains as well as detergent-solubilized Env proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Julien et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lyumkis et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pancera et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lee et al., 2016</xref>). However, how the Env trimer opens, and through what structural intermediates it transitions, is poorly understood.</p><p>We have previously applied single-molecule Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (smFRET) imaging to visualize the dynamics of individual Env molecules on the surface of native virions of two HIV-1 strains, NL4-3 and JR-FL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Munro et al., 2014</xref>). Donor and acceptor fluorophores were introduced into the variable loops V1, and V4 or V5 of a single gp120 subunit in an otherwise unlabeled virus. smFRET analysis revealed that single Env protomers spontaneously transit between three distinct conformational states exhibiting low-, intermediate- and high-FRET values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Munro et al., 2014</xref>). The unliganded Env prefers a low-FRET pre-triggered conformation. In the presence of soluble CD4 (D1D2 domain, sCD4), and the additional presence of the coreceptor-surrogate antibody 17b, some Env trimers could be stabilized in high-FRET and intermediate-FRET conformations, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Munro et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>The FRET-indicated Env conformational states initially observed require further structural assignments. Various lines of evidence suggest that the low-FRET state corresponds to the pre-triggered conformation: (1) it is the most populated conformation of the unliganded Env; (2) it is more populated in a clinical isolate such as HIV-1<sub>JR-FL</sub> that is more neutralization-resistant than the laboratory-adapted HIV-1<sub>NL4-3</sub>; and (3) it is stabilized by broadly neutralizing antibodies, and the small-molecule conformational blocker BMS-626529 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Munro et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pancera et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kwon et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Herschhorn et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Pancera et al., 2017</xref>). In contrast, the structural nature of the intermediate- and high-FRET states has been unclear. The stabilization of the high-FRET State two in HIV-1<sub>NL4-3</sub> by sCD4 and of intermediate-FRET State three by sCD4/17b suggested that they might represent CD4 or coreceptor-bound conformations, respectively. However, this conflicts with the finding that the CD4 mimetic JRC-II-191 stabilizes intermediate-FRET configurations (State 3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Munro et al., 2014</xref>), as we would expect CD4 mimetics to reproduce the conformational impact of CD4. Also, there are no substantial Env-structural differences between the gp120 bound to CD4 or to CD4 and 17b (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kwong et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ozorowski et al., 2017</xref>). Finally, HIV-1<sub>JR-FL</sub> does not respond to sCD4 in the same way as HIV-1<sub>NL4-3</sub>.</p><p>Here we provide smFRET analysis that clarify the nature of the intermediate-FRET and high-FRET Env conformations. Through smFRET measurements, we demonstrated that dodecameric CD4 (sCD4<sub>D1D2</sub>-Igαtp), which is a potent neutralizer of HIV-1, stabilizes the intermediate-FRET State 3 of the Env in three strains HIV-1<sub>NL4-3</sub>, HIV-1<sub>JR-FL</sub> and HIV-1<sub>BG505</sub>. We observed no difference in predominant conformational state of Env bound to CD4/17b, to JRC-II-191 (a CD4 small molecule mimetic), or to sCD4<sub>D1D2</sub>-Igαtp, all of which corresponded to the open three-CD4-bound conformation of the trimer (State 3). Moreover, by using a mixed trimer assay, we identified the intermediate configuration of State two to be an asymmetric Env trimer. In this configuration, a single CD4 can engage the trimer such that individual protomers adopt distinct conformations. An asymmetric trimer is thus a prevalent functional intermediate, which can open further either spontaneously or through binding to additional CD4 molecules or to coreceptor.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>State 3 corresponds to the gp120 conformation of the three-CD4-bound HIV-1 Env trimer</title><p>smFRET imaging of HIV-1 Env trimers carrying a single pair of donor and acceptor fluorophores in the V1 and V4 loops of gp120, previously established for HIV-1 isolates NL4-3 and JR-FL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Munro et al., 2014</xref>), was extended to include the mother-to-child transmitted founder (T/F) virus BG505 widely used for structural studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Julien et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lyumkis et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sanders et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pancera et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kwon et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Scharf et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ozorowski et al., 2017</xref>).

Given that the low-FRET state corresponds to a mature pre-triggered conformation of the trimer, these data suggest that the high-FRET state represents a default conformational intermediate during opening of the Env trimer. Based on this sequence of FRET transitions, we refer to the low-FRET state as State 1, the high-FRET state as State two and the intermediate-FRET state as State 3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Herschhorn et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Consistent with previous observations, addition of sCD4 (0.1 mg/ml) stabilized HIV-1<sub>NL4-3</sub> Env in State 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, left).

To clarify the response of HIV-1<sub>NL4-3</sub> Env to receptor CD4, a dodecameric CD4 oligomer (sCD4<sub>D1D2</sub>-Igαtp, 0.1 mg/ml), which is 300 to 1000-fold more potent in neutralizing HIV-1 than sCD4, was used to provide a high local CD4 density (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arthos et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kwong et al., 2002</xref>). Strikingly, sCD4<sub>D1D2</sub>-Igαtp stabilized HIV-1<sub>NL4-3</sub> Env in State 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), indicating that both sCD4/17b (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Munro et al., 2014</xref>) and an oligomerized CD4, both stabilize HIV-1<sub>NL4-3</sub> Env in the three-CD4-bound trimer configuration (State 3).</p><p>In contrast to the NL4-3 isolate, both HIV-1<sub>JR-FL</sub> and HIV-1<sub>BG505</sub> were less responsive to sCD4, with only small increases in the occupancies of States 2 and 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F and I</xref>) although sCD4 and 17b stabilized both in State 3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Munro et al., 2014</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>).

We used the stabilization of HIV-1<sub>NL4-3</sub> State 2 by sCD4 as an assay to identify the origin of the high-FRET signal. We hypothesized that the different conformational effects of sCD4 and sCD4<sub>D1D2</sub>-Igαtp on HIV-1<sub>NL4-3</sub> Env are linked to the differences in CD4 occupancy. The dodecameric sCD4<sub>D1D2</sub>-Igαtp, with its higher avidity and local CD4 density, may engage two or three protomers of the trimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arthos et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bennett et al., 2007</xref>) while monomeric sCD4 binds with less avidity and may only interact with one protomer. The distinct high-FRET conformation of State 2 may then arise from either a distinct conformation in the first CD4-bound protomer, or from neighboring gp120 subunits.</p><p>To distinguish between these possibilities, we took advantage of the D368R mutation in the CD4-binding pocket of Env that reduces affinity for CD4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Olshevsky et al., 1990</xref>). The D368R mutant of HIV-1<sub>NL4-3</sub> Env was resistant to the neutralization of both sCD4 and sCD4<sub>D1D2</sub>-Igαtp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, Table 2). The mutant Env was expressed similarly to that of WT Env (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Their infectivity was reduced by ~100 fold, but the signal to noise ratio in our experiments was orders of magnitude above background permitting a neutralization assay and demonstrating the resistance of D368R to sCD4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Trimers that uniformly contained the D368R mutation exhibited similar conformational landscapes to that of wild-type HIV-1, and did not respond to sCD4 and sCD4<sub>D1D2</sub>-Igαtp as WT HIV-1<sub>NL4-3</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A</xref>). Thus, unlike the double mutant D368R/E370R that was stabilized in State 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Munro et al., 2014</xref>) (likely due to E370R interfering with the adoption of the bridging sheet), the single D368R mutation exhibited little or no conformational effects on the trimer. This allowed us to engineer a ‘mixed trimer 1’ where the two unlabeled protomers carried the D368R mutation to prevent binding of CD4 and the single protomer carrying the fluorophores remained competent for CD4 binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). smFRET analysis for the mixed HIV-1<sub>NL4-3</sub> trimer 1 revealed a clear State 3 stabilization by sCD4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).

Hence, the observed high-FRET state likely originates from an unbound gp120 protomer adjacent to a CD4-bound protomer. Since the State three and State two stabilizations were observed for the same single-CD4 condition, but with dyes placed either into the protomer that binds a single CD4 or adjacent to it, this trimer must be asymmetric with protomers adopting distinct conformations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2L</xref>).</p><p>We next similarly generated mixed Env trimers for the Tier 2 HIV-1 isolates HIV-1<sub>JR-FL</sub> and HIV-1<sub>BG505</sub>.

The broad high-FRET peaks in sCD4<sub>D1D2</sub>-Igαtp-bound mixed trimer two suggest a potential continuum of various conformational states. These data support the hypothesis that the trimer spontaneously opens and closes through an asymmetric trimer configuration. Moreover, during virus entry, a single CD4 may initially engage a closed trimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kwon et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hu et al., 2017</xref>), and a very early version of this intermediate may be presented in the single CD4-bound structure of the Env trimer stabilized by the DS-SOSIP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Liu et al., 2017</xref>) when not fixed by DS mutation, CD4 binding to the trimer would induce the CD4-bound conformation in the bound protomer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2L</xref>).

The unliganded HIV-1<sub>JR-FL</sub> and HIV-1<sub>BG505</sub> Envs more stably adopted State one as compared to the HIV-1<sub>NL4-3</sub> Env. This finding indicates that, relative to the other states, the closed state has lower energy in HIV-1<sub>JR-FL</sub> compared with the lab-adapted HIV-1<sub>NL4-3</sub> isolate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E and H</xref>).

We also found a modest decrease in the activation energy for the sCD4-induced transition out of State 1, and decreased activation energy for exchanges between States 2 and 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and C</xref>, left). Importantly, as was observed for HIV-1<sub>NL4-3</sub> Env, addition of the dodecameric sCD4<sub>D1D2</sub>-Igαtp stabilized State 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and C</xref>, right), decreasing the energy to 0.6 <italic>k<sub>B</sub>T</italic> and 0.79 <italic>k<sub>B</sub>T</italic> lower than that of State 2 of HIV-1<sub>JR-FL</sub> and HIV-1<sub>BG505</sub>, respectively.

Thus, while there are distinct differences in the ability of sCD4 to activate Env for all three strains, the potent dodecameric sCD4<sub>D1D2</sub>-Igαtp stabilizes Envs from all three isolates in the open conformation (State 3).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Here we used smFRET to identify the nature of the three conformational states sampled by HIV-1 Env (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Munro et al., 2014</xref>). The most populated FRET State one corresponds to the gp120 conformation of the mature pre-triggered Env trimer. The State three stabilization by oligomerized sCD4<sub>D1D2</sub>-Igαtp, sCD4 and 17b, and the CD4 mimetic small molecule JRC-II-191 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Munro et al., 2014</xref>), indicated that State three corresponds to the gp120 conformation of the open, three-CD4-bound trimer. By using a mixed trimer assay, we identified the most prevalent default intermediate State two to be an asymmetric Env trimer configuration engaging a single CD4 molecule. The individual protomers within the asymmetric trimer adopted different conformations, and State two population originated from the two unbound protomers adjacent to the single CD4-bound protomer.</p><p>Based on these single-molecule analyses and previous results, we propose a model of HIV-1 Env activation by receptor CD4 and coreceptor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). This description of the molecular events during Env activation requires a nomenclature that specifies the conformational state of each protomer within the trimer. The unliganded trimer resides predominantly in a conformation in which all three protomers are in the pre-triggered State one configuration, which can be represented as the (1,1,1) configuration (where each of the three numbers defines the FRET state of each protomer within the trimer). Binding of a single CD4 molecule then induces conformational changes in the CD4-bound protomer, such that the trimer adopts a (3,2,2) configuration. In the (3,2,2) configuration, the CD4-bound protomer exhibits intermediate-FRET (State 3), while the two neighboring protomers exhibit high-FRET (State 2). The near absence of direct transitions between State one to State three suggests that the trimer opening likely occurs through a conformational intermediate with a FRET value similar to State two such as a (2,1,1) or (2,2,2) configuration.</p><p>The complete activation of HIV-1 Env then likely requires either a local clustering of CD4 or coreceptor binding. This would induce of the Env trimer to reach more open configurations (either (3,3,2) or (3,3,3)) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Yang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Salzwedel and Berger, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ozorowski et al., 2017</xref>). Coreceptor binding then leads to the activation of gp41 and the induction of additional conformational changes necessary for membrane fusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). During the spontaneous opening and closing of the HIV-1 Env trimer between States 1 and 3, it is possible that the opening protomer does not fully adopt the three-CD4-bound conformation. Rather it may only partially open, just far enough for the trimer apex to be disrupted and the adjacent protomers adopting the State two high-FRET conformation.</p><p>In this paper, we used smFRET to reveal asymmetric trimer configurations in the opening of the HIV-1 Env trimer. Asymmetric structural intermediates during the activation of viral fusion machines may be more common than previously thought.

And a recent study on the activation of pre-fusion HIV-1 gp41 to downstream intermediate states suggested that gp41 also opens through asymmetric intermediates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Khasnis et al., 2016</xref>).

The uncertainties of Δ<italic>G</italic>°<italic><sub>ij</sub> and ΔΔG<sup>‡</sup><sub>ij</sub></italic> were determined by propagating the uncertainties from the curve fitting.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Infectivity measurements</title><p>Viruses carrying wild-type, D368R mutant HIV-1 Env were generated by transfection of HEK293 cells with full-length WT or mutant pNL4-3 or Q23_BG505 constructs, or at a 1:1 ratio of pNL4-3 ΔEnv and WT or mutant pCAAGS_JR-FL, along with 1:6 ratio of HIV-1-InGluc to viral constructs, using Fugene 6 (Promega, Madison, WI). Supernatants from 24 and 48 hr post-transfection were combined, filtered through a 0.45 μM filter (Pall Corporation) and titered on TZMbl cells. Titers were determined 48 hr post-infection either by measuring luciferase activity using the Gaussia luciferase assay kit (NEB). For testing the effects of ligands on infectivity, viruses were incubated with ligands for 30 min at room temperature prior to addition to TZMbl cells.</p><p>The V1V4-tagged BG505 was validated in form of the 100% tagged virus, not as the dye-labeled virus since the incomplete labeling efficiencies would leave enough unmodified trimers on the surface of a virus to account for nearly undiminished infectivity. While we cannot exclude additional effects of the dyes, we have not observed anisotropy for singly labeled virus, the dyes are highly hydrophilic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zheng et al., 2014</xref>), do not associate with the viral membrane and no dye associated with viruses in the absence of labeling tags (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Munro et al., 2014</xref>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Alon Herschhorn and Joseph Sodroski for discussions.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Wenhui Li (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Joseph D Puglisi (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The manuscript of Ma et al. addresses the longstanding debate about the conformational state of the HIV-1 Env, and the relationship of conformation to viral entry. Clearly, this is a conformationally flexible system involving challenging protein chemistry; as such, traditional structural approaches have led to conflicting models for the pathway of Env recognition by CD4 and co-receptors, and subsequent conformational steps along the viral entry pathway. Here the authors continue their elegant single-molecule FRET experiments applied to the Env protein on intact virions. They build on prior FRET measurements to assign the nature of the three distinct FRET states observed previously. They use clever choices of mutants, and ligand complexes to illuminate the conformational states of Env, and provide a low resolution cryo-EM structure that they claim supports their key observation – that Env opens through a key asymmetric intermediate involving changes in a single protomer.</p><p>The biophysical studies are an elegant mixture of single-molecule biophysics and challenging biochemistry/virology that deserves publication in <italic>eLife</italic> after changes that would greatly improve the presentation. However, our recommendation is that the EM structure should either be removed from this paper or extensively revised, which would require additional refinement and analyses of the structure.</p><p>We have the following suggestions for revising the smFRET part of the paper.</p><p>1) The authors use a challenging biochemical approach using orthogonal peptide tagging to allow double labeling of the individual protomers, combined with careful titration of unlabeled Env through co-expression. They have presented this approach previously, but it would have been useful for readers to know the extent of labeling efficiency for the virions. Also as described in the first paragraph of the subsection “State 3 corresponds to the gp120 conformation of the three-CD4-bound HIV-1 Env trimer”, the authors validate that insertion of the Q3 and A1 tags for fluorophore labeling did not affect Env functions using various assays, but it is not clear whether they tested labeled viruses in these assays, or viruses with just the peptide insertions. The peptide tag is just one component, and perhaps not the largest one, that distinguishes an unlabeled Env from a labeled Env. If it is not possible to do the validation assays using labeled viruses, then the authors should discuss caveats associated with possible steric occlusion from adding the dyes and whatever other components must be added to attach dyes to the peptide tags.</p><p>2) The use of a dodecameric CD4 oligomer (sCD4<sub>D1D2</sub>-Igαtp) for capturing state 3 in NL4-3 is interesting and promotes different effects than sCD4 in the 3 trimers analyzed by smFRET. It is unclear, however, if the &quot;high local CD4 density&quot; resulting from the architecture of this dodecameric CD4 oligomer would geometrically allow multiple copies of CD4 to engage a single Env? A cartoon showing the structure of the construct used in these experiments demonstrating this is feasible would address this and support the results presented. Figure 1D indicates that sCD4<sub>D1D2</sub>-Igαtp stabilizes state 3 for HIV-1(NL4-3), which corresponds to the open conformation with 3 CD4 bound, whereas the authors also claim that a single CD4 bound to the mixed trimer 1 leads to the same result (Figure 2D). How can these results be reconciled? And were smFRET studies done using sCD4<sub>D1D2</sub>-Igαtp on mixed trimer 1 (labeled protomer that can bind CD4 with two protomers that can't bind CD4)? This would allow a direct comparison of sCD4<sub>D1D2</sub>-Igαtp effects on native HIV-1NL4-3 trimer and mixed HIV-1NL4-3 trimer 1. As shown in Figure 2—figure supplements 3-5, the effects of sCD4<sub>D1D2</sub>-Igαtp were evaluated for JR-FL and BG505 viruses but not for NL4-3. Minor suggestion: it would be easier to compare if Figure 2—figure supplements 3-5 were combined into one figure.</p><p>3) The schematics used in Figure 1, 2 and 3 are confusing. It is hard to see the donor and acceptor, and it's not clear why they should have different FRET values in the different conformational states. It's also hard to see the difference between closed and open on such a small figure. Maybe using axial lines for the 3 protomers, and making the dyes bigger (and their positions different in the states) would help. These are the key figures for understanding all the single-molecule data, so the authors should spend more time on presentation. In particular, in Figure 1K, the donor and acceptor dyes are shown as being the same distance apart whether they are on the closed or the open trimer. This is confusing, since the dyes would be separated by long distances in the low FRET State 1 but by shorter distances in the intermediate and high FRET states 3 and 2. There is little discussion in this paper as to whether it makes structural sense for the dyes to become closer together upon CD4 binding, which is especially important if the authors want to include the cryo-EM structure of Env in the same paper. In particular, this sentence, &quot;Binding of a single CD4 may loosen interaction of the V1/V2 loops in the trimer association domain so that neighboring protomers can adopt a conformation in which the V1 and V4 loops are closer to each other.&quot; Is this consistent with what is known about the relative locations of V1 and V4 in closed and open Env structures?</p><p>4) Figure 3I. Why is 17b shown as binding to the protomers in a mixed trimer that can't bind CD4? 17b won't bind to most Envs in the absence of CD4. It seems reasonable that 17b could bind to the protomer(s) that can bind CD4 in a mixed trimer, but what evidence is there that 17b can also bind to the CD4-incompetent protomers in a mixed trimer?</p><p>5) The authors should present prior measurements on CD4 affinity/kinetics wherever possible.</p><p>6) Figure 1 legend. Why are the authors using standard errors here instead of standard deviations as they used for other error analyses?</p><p>7) For FRET traces, it would be nice to show with lines the high, medium, and low states in each trace.</p><p>8) Materials and methods subsection “Preparation of labeled virions”. The protocol for use of the enzyme AcpS for labeling of one of the peptide tags should be cited.</p><p>9)Discussion, fifth paragraph. The authors say they have compared smFRET values for labeled BG505 virus and labeled BG505 SOSIP in a paper cited as Lu, Ma et al., 2017, under review. As the current submitted paper includes smFRET data for BG505 virus and an EM structure of a BG505 SOSIP, the paper under review is directly relevant to evaluating the submitted paper and should be given to the reviewers.</p><p>Cryo-EM structure</p><p>The structure itself (both results and methods) is problematic, and there is little effort to correlate the EM and smFRET results. We can't figure out why the authors think that the EM structure validates the smFRET results because the EM methods are inadequately described and/or possibly done incorrectly, the figures are poor quality, and the description of the structure is vague. We think this paper would stand alone as an important contribution without the EM structure, but if the authors want to include the EM, the following issues must be addressed before publication in any journal:</p><p>1) The Materials and methods section describing the EM procedures lacks a lot of information. How many particles were collected for the untilted and for the tilted data sets? How many were kept from each dataset after each step of classification? How many frames were collected in each movie? How many classes were used during 3D classification? How was CTF correction achieved for the two datasets; in particular, how was this done for the tilted data? Was dose-weighting used with motioncor2? What was the total exposure time and how many sub-frames was the total dosage divided into? The authors should use the ab initio model as a reference to do 3D classification, and detailed information about 3D classes should be included in the Methods and also shown in a supplementary figure. Additionally, since 2D/3D classification during cryoEM processing often leads to focusing on the &quot;best&quot; class(es), the authors should address whether there are other conformation(s) present in the dataset.</p><p>2) In Figure 4—figure supplement 1C. The authors only show 4 representative 2D classes (all of which look bad and appear to exhibit orientation bias, but this may be due to low resolution of the figure). Did they only use the particles belonging to these 4 classes as input for ab initio model generation? The authors should describe more details about the ab initio model generation input parameters for cryoSPARC in the Materials and methods section, they should use the ab initio model as a reference to do 3D classification, and detailed information about 3D classes should be included in the Materials and methods and also shown in a supplementary figure. Figure 4—figure supplement 4F should show the entirety of gp41 and gp120 rigid-body docked into the EM density, rather than just representative segments. Figure 4—figure supplement 1E is labeled as Map-to-model FSC but the legends states it is the gold standard FSC from refinement. It can only be one of the two.</p><p>3) What model was used as a reference for 3D refinement and was the reference model low pass filtered? The authors should verify that they are using the gold-standard FSC resolution estimation that was generated after post processing because this step would generate a more reliable resolution estimation. This information is especially important to know in the case of this structure because the map density and fitting in Figure 4—figure supplement 1F look worse than an 8Å resolution structure. Indeed, the resolution claim of 8Å seems optimistic since the gp41 inner helices are likely the best resolved part of the map and the one the authors chose to show. As a result, the reader cannot judge how confident the authors can be about the different CD4 orientation detected compared to the higher resolution 3 CD4-bound structure. This is further confounded by the strong preferred orientation of the sample in vitreous ice where each 2D class appears to be of the same orientation.</p><p>4) Materials and methods. We don't understand this sentence: &quot;Atomic models of gp120 in the CD4-bound conformation, and 4-domain CD4, were fitted into the cryo-EM density by rigid body docking…&quot; This implies that CD4-bound gp120 coordinates were fit into all three protomers in the cryo-EM map, but only one protomer is bound to CD4 in this structure. Also, the authors should discuss whether all four domains of CD4 were ordered in the density. It seems unlikely that D3 and D4 were as well-ordered as D1-D2 since CD4 exhibits some flexibility at the D2-D3 interface. Indeed, D2 of CD4 was not well-resolved in the cryo-EM structures of CD4-bound Env cited by the authors. How CD4 was fit is important because in Figure 4C, the authors used the fitted model to describe a CD4 D1-D2 domain orientation change. However, since full-length sCD4 is presumably flexible, this calculation would be unreliable if based on fitting all four domains. The authors should try lowering the contour level of the map and fitting only D1D2 or maybe only D1 and then do the comparison. Finally PDB codes should be cited for all coordinates used.</p><p>5) In order to publish this structure, the authors must show a figure with local resolutions plotted onto the structure. Without this, it is impossible to interpret sentences like this: &quot;…the two adjacent ligand-free gp120 protomers are much more disordered than the CD4-bound protomer. At this resolution, the precise conformational state of the gp120 protomers could not be resolved.&quot; First, it's not clear what the resolutions of the ligand-free gp120 protomers actually are (need to see the requested figure to assess). Second and most importantly, if the precise conformational state of the ligand-free gp120 protomers cannot be resolved, then how is the cryo-EM structure relevant to interpreting the smFRET results?</p><p>6) The quality of Figure 4 is poor and it was difficult/impossible for all three reviewers to confirm the claimed asymmetry of the Env trimer. Additionally, it is also very difficult to see any of the proposed conformational changes on panels C (right) and D.</p><p>7) If the authors decide to retain the cryo-EM structure in this paper, they should provide the map mrc file as well as fitted coordinates file for the reviewers to better judge the cryo-EM map and the model building.</p><p>8) &quot;The model of a gradual opening through asymmetric intermediates is supported by cryo-EM that depicts a single CD4 molecule bound to the DS-SOSIP.664 that cannot open, and the current structure with SOSIP.664 that can open in response to CD4…&quot; We don't follow this logic. The existence of the previously published DS-SOSIP/single CD4 cryo-EM structure that is closed is not relevant to this model because the DS-SOSIP is prevented from opening due to introduction of a S-S bond, therefore what is the evidence that an Env without the added DS disulfide bond would remain closed?</p><p>9) Related to the point 8 above, Figure 4B shows a hypothetical progression of Env conformations from closed, to a single CD4-bound closed Env (the DS-SOSIP/single CD4 structure), to the current structure (described in the figure as single CD4-bound open structure), to the published 3 CD4-bound, open Env structure. This figure is misleading because it implies that the closed DS-SOSIP/single CD4 structure is a relevant intermediate (see above) and that all three protomers in the current structure are open. The current structure is said to &quot;open in response to CD4&quot; – is that what this EM structure shows? We can't tell from the figures. Figure 4B describes the current structure as a &quot;single CD4-bound open structure&quot; which might be interpreted as meaning that all three protomers adopt the open conformation. But in the Results section, the structure is referred to as an &quot;asymmetric, open structure&quot; which might mean that only the CD4-bound gp120 adopts the open conformation. &quot;…the CD4 molecule is bound solely to one protomer in an open trimer configuration…&quot; and later &quot;…the current structure where the SOSIP.664 partially opens in response to binding of a single CD4…&quot; These examples show that the text is confusing and possibly contradictory. Is the Env trimer in this structure &quot;open&quot; or is it &quot;partially open&quot;? Is the structure asymmetric or symmetric? The figures can't be used to address these questions, and since we don't know how disordered the non CD4-bound protomers are (point 9 above), the EM structure detracts from this paper.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34271.022</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The biophysical studies are an elegant mixture of single-molecule biophysics and challenging biochemistry/virology that deserves publication in eLife after changes that would greatly improve the presentation.

This is done with the 100% tagged Env.</p><p>With respect to labeling efficiencies, we have previously determined the labeling efficiencies and found them to be 40% for the Q3 tag and 55% for the A1 tag (Munro et al., 2014). We are still using the same protocols and have not observed a drop in the number of labeled particles in each preparation. Given that labeling efficiencies are not 100%, it’s not valid to test the infectivity of “100% labeled” virus since there are several trimers on the surface of the virus and incomplete labeling leaves enough unlabeled Env to maintain similar infectivity as WT. Thus, the test of Q3 and A1 peptide insertion on virus infectivity was done solely on viruses carrying 100% labeling peptides, but not on fluorophore-labeled viruses. We now mention this in the last paragraph of the Materials and methods subsection “Preparation of labeled virions”. While dyes could affect the outcome, which we acknowledge in the last paragraph of the Materials and methods subsection “Infectivity measurements”, we have not observed anisotropy for singly labeled virions suggesting no trapping of dyes in specific environments. These dyes are highly hydrophilic (Zheng et al., 2014). They also do not interact with the viral membrane. The association of dyes with virions is entirely dependent on the presence of labeling tag (Munro et al., 2014).</p><p>For us most important have been the biological controls. The smFRET signal has been responsive to ligands, mutations in a manner that correlates with virological data (Munro et al., 2014; this paper; Herschhorn et al., 2016). Moreover, the Tier 2 viruses JR-FL and BG505 are more closed and less responsive to sCD4 than the Tier 1 lab-adapted HIV-1 isolate NL4-3 (Figures 1B, 1E and 1H).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The use of a dodecameric CD4 oligomer (sCD4<sub>D1D2</sub>-Igαtp) for capturing state 3 in NL4-3 is interesting and promotes different effects than sCD4 in the 3 trimers analyzed by smFRET.

As shown in Figure 2—figure supplements 3-5, the effects of sCD4<sub>D1D2</sub>-Igαtp were evaluated for JR-FL and BG505 viruses but not for NL4-3. Minor suggestion: it would be easier to compare if Figure 2—figure supplements 3-5 were combined into one figure.</p></disp-quote><p>The dodecameric CD4 oligomer was generated and extensively studied by the group of James Arthos (Bennet et al., 2007; Arthos et al., 2002). The interaction of the sCD4<sub>D1D2</sub>-Igαtp with native virions has been directly visualized by Sriram Subramaniam using cryo-electron tomography. 12xCD4 was found to cover several gp120 subunits of the same trimer as well as neighboring trimers highlighting the strong avidity (Bennet et al., 2007). The off-rate for sCD4<sub>D1D2</sub>-Igαtp from viruses is basically zero (Arthos et al., 2002).</p><p>In Figure 2D, however, only one protomer in a trimer is capable of binding to CD4. This therefore leads to a single-CD4-bound asymmetric trimer, regardless of whether the ligand is a single D1D2 CD4 molecule or sCD4<sub>D1D2</sub>-Igαtp. Viruses carrying the D368R mutation are also resistant to sCD4<sub>D1D2</sub>-Igαtp (Figure 2—figure supplement 3). Thus, upon CD4 binding, this single gp120 adopts the conformation of State 3 that corresponds to the CD4-bound conformation.</p><p>The reason why we use either sCD4 or sCD4<sub>D1D2</sub>-Igαtp is because the Tier 1 lab-adapted HIV-1 isolate is highly responsive and sensitive to sCD4, whereas the Tier 2 viruses JR-FL and BG505 are not. To trigger the CD4 bound conformation, we have to use the more potent ligand 12xCD4 for both Tier 2 isolates. If we use sCD4<sub>D1D2</sub>-Igαtp on NL4-3, it would be more than 1000x above the inhibitory concentration. We are trying to image all ligands at ~10x above the IC90. It wouldn’t be wise to test one ligand at ~10x above an IC90 and another at 1000x above the IC90.</p><p>Upon request, we have combined Figure 2—figure supplements 3-5 into one single Figure 2—figure supplement 3 for better comparison. And have added the figure of 100% D368R NL4-3 in Figure 2—figure supplement 3A.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The schematics used in Figure 1, 2 and 3 are confusing. It is hard to see the donor and acceptor, and it's not clear why they should have different FRET values in the different conformational states.

Thus, 17b likely binds in trans to the neighboring protomers. Mechanistically 17b likely binds by capturing a preexisting State 3 conformation that is more frequently sampled in State 2 as compared to the more closed State 1. However, this is rather speculative. It could in principal be tested experimentally in mixed trimers by combining the D368R mutation with mutations that prevent 17b binding, but introducing several mutations into Env can lead to non-linear effects and phenotypes are increasingly difficult to interpret. We have therefore decided to stay away from this speculation.</p><p>Additional evidence can be found in previous publications such as (Herschhorn et al., 2016) demonstrating that Env mutants residing in State 2 more readily engage coreceptors, leading toward downstream conformations.</p><p>We have previously shown in the 2014 Munro paper that the frequently opening Tier 1 lab-adapted NL4-3 can open in response to 17b alone, while the more closed Tier 2 JR-FL needs CD4.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The authors should present prior measurements on CD4 affinity/kinetics wherever possible.</p></disp-quote><p>We are working with native virions and measure infectivity, not affinities for recombinant proteins.
