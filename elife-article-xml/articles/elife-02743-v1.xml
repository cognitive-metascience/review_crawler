Despite its essential role in orchestrating responses to animal cues, basic principles of information processing by the vomeronasal system are still unknown. The medial amygdala (MeA) occupies a central position in the vomeronasal pathway, upstream of hypothalamic centers dedicated to defensive and social responses. We have characterized sensory responses in the mouse MeA and uncovered emergent properties that shed new light onto the transformation of vomeronasal information into sex- and species-specific responses. In particular, we show that the MeA displays a degree of stimulus selectivity and a striking sexually dimorphic sensory representation that are not observed in the upstream relay of the accessory olfactory bulb (AOB). Furthermore, our results demonstrate that the development of sexually dimorphic circuits in the MeA requires steroid signaling near the time of puberty to organize the functional representation of sensory stimuli.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02743.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02743.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02743.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Many animals emit and detect chemicals known as pheromones to communicate with other members of their own species. Animals also rely on chemical signals from other species to warn them, for example, that a predator is nearby. Many of these chemical signals—which are present in sweat, tears, urine, and saliva—are detected by a structure called the vomeronasal organ, which is located at the base of the nasal cavity.</p><p>When this organ detects a particular chemical signal, it broadcasts this information to a network of brain regions that generates an appropriate behavioral response. Two structures within this network, the accessory olfactory bulb and the medial amygdala, play an important role in modifying this signal before it reaches its final destination—a region of the brain called the hypothalamus. Activation of the hypothalamus by the signal triggers changes in the animal's behavior. Although the anatomical details of this pathway have been widely studied, it is not clear how information is actually transmitted along it.</p><p>Now, Bergan et al. have provided insights into this process by recording signals in the brains of anesthetized mice exposed to specific stimuli. Whereas neurons in the accessory olfactory bulb responded similarly in male and female mice, those in the medial amygdala showed a preference for female urine in male mice, and a preference for male urine in the case of females. This is the first direct demonstration of differences in sensory processing in the brains of male and female mammals.</p><p>These differences are thought to result from the actions of sex hormones, particularly estrogen, on brain circuits during development. Consistent with this, neurons in the medial amygdala of male mice with reduced levels of estrogen showed a reduced preference for female urine compared to control males. Similarly, female mice that had been previously exposed to high levels of estrogen as pups showed a reduced preference for male urine compared to controls.</p><p>In addition to increasing understanding of how chemical signals—including pheromones—influence the responses of rodents to other animals, the work of Bergan et al. has provided clues to the neural mechanisms that underlie sex-specific differences in behaviors.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02743.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02743.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>medial amygdala</kwd><kwd>sensory representation</kwd><kwd>sexual dimorphism</kwd><kwd>vomeronasal system</kwd><kwd>pheromone</kwd><kwd>behavior</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01DC009019</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dulac</surname><given-names>Catherine</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01DC013087</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dulac</surname><given-names>Catherine</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NA</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dulac</surname><given-names>Catherine</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F32 DC10089</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bergan</surname><given-names>Joseph F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Male and female mice respond differently to the same pheromone signals, and the representation of these sensory stimuli by neurons in the medial amygdala correlates precisely with the differences in behavior.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Throughout the animal kingdom, dedicated signals allow individuals to identify and distinguish members of their own species: songbirds attract mates during bouts of singing, cichlid fish communicate dominance status with dramatic changes in body coloration, and rodents signal their social status through the emission of chemical cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brainard and Doupe, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Tinbergen, 1951</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Maruska and Fernald, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dulac and Kimchi, 2008</xref>). In turn, the execution of instinctive behaviors such as mating, parenting, territorial defense, and predator avoidance is triggered and modulated by sensory signals within a given physiological context, including the sex, endocrine, or developmental status of an individual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Tinbergen, 1951</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Insel and Fernald, 2004</xref>). However, the brain circuits that organize species- and sex-specific instinctive behaviors in response to animal cues are still poorly characterized.</p><p>Chemosensory communication in rodents offers a unique opportunity to explore the organizational and functional principles of social behavior circuits.

The main olfactory epithelium (MOE) and vomeronasal organ (VNO) are distinguished by the types of chemical cues that each detects: volatile compounds are primarily detected by the MOE while non-volatile signals are preferentially processed by the VNO. At the circuit level, neurons in the MOE project to the main olfactory bulb (MOB), which in turn projects axons to the lateral amygdala, primary olfactory cortex, and ultimately to areas involved in the cognitive processing of odorants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Sosulski et al., 2011</xref>). In addition, neurons expressing the neuropeptide GnRH, a master regulator of reproduction in vertebrates, receive major inputs from primary olfactory areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boehm et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Yoon et al., 2005</xref>). In contrast, vomeronasal circuits largely bypass cognitive centers, as sensory neurons of the VNO send axons to the accessory olfactory bulb (AOB), which in turn projects to nuclei of the medial amygdala (MeA), the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, and the hypothalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Petrovich et al., 2001</xref>), areas involved in controlling innate behaviors and neuroendocrine changes.</p><p>Recent studies have begun to explore the basic principles of vomeronasal information coding that lead to specific social and defensive behavioral responses. The identification of key components of VNO signal transduction, such as the TRPC2 ion channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Liman et al., 1999</xref>), and the members of the V1R and V2R families of vomeronasal receptors (VRs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dulac and Axel, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Herrada and Dulac, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Matsunami and Buck, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Ryba and Tirindelli, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dulac and Torello, 2003</xref>), has established the molecular foundation of vomeronasal sensing. In vitro recording and imaging of VNO neuronal activity after exposure to various stimuli, as well as in vivo characterization of the vomeronasal receptor response profile to a wide range of animal cues, have revealed that distinct populations of VNO receptors identify ethologically relevant chemosignals with high specificity and that signal detection in the VNO plays an essential role in distinguishing behaviorally relevant sensory information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Holy et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Leinders-Zufall et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Nodari et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Leinders-Zufall et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Haga et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Isogai et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Turaga and Holy, 2012</xref>).</p><p>In contrast to the apparent specificity of VNO responses for distinct animal cues, a large proportion of output neurons in the AOB, the primary targets of VNO sensory projections, were shown to respond to multiple classes of stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Luo et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hendrickson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ben-Shaul et al., 2010</xref>). In particular, many AOB mitral/tufted cells respond with similar strength to cues such as female and predator odors, which are clearly associated with opposing behavioral outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ben-Shaul et al., 2010</xref>). The complex responses of AOB mitral/tufted cells, together with their distinctive multi-branched dendritic trees, suggest that they integrate sensory information across distinct vomeronasal receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Wagner et al., 2006</xref>). Ultimately, downstream vomeronasal centers that control behavioral outputs must be able to interpret and disambiguate the relevant information from these broad patterns of AOB activity.</p><p>Several lines of evidence suggest that the MeA plays a central role in the vomeronasal–sensorimotor transformation that leads to specific behavioral responses. The MeA is the primary recipient of AOB inputs, it projects to distinct nuclei of the hypothalamus involved in social and defensive responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Petrovich et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Choi et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Lin et al., 2011</xref>) and disruptions in MeA signaling cause profound deficits in social and predator recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ferguson et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Li et al., 2004</xref>). However, despite this central position in the vomeronasal sensory pathway, little is known about how neuronal activity in the MeA participates in the transformation of AOB inputs into behaviorally relevant signals.</p><p>We have investigated the characteristics of MeA neuronal activity in both male and female mice in response to conspecific and heterospecific chemosignals. Our results uncovered several emergent features in the MeA representation of olfactory information that are not present in either VNO or AOB responses. These features suggest how key sensory parameters relevant for sex-specific, social and defensive behaviors are extracted from the complex activity pattern of the AOB. Our findings provide significant insights into the neural processing of social cues and open new avenues for further understanding the emergence of sex-specific behaviors.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Extracellular recordings in the MeA of anesthetized animals</title><p>To investigate how the MeA responds to chemosensory cues, we combined multisite extracellular recordings with sensory stimulation of the VNO in anesthetized mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

This targeting strategy was intentionally chosen to focus on the posterior MeA (MeApd and MeApv), allowing simultaneous sampling of single and multi-unit activity from 32 evenly spaced sites distributed between MeA subnuclei with distinct functions. MeA units responsive to sensory stimuli were localized to the ventral surface of the brain and extended approximately 1 mm dorsally, consistent with the anatomy of the posterior MeA.

This prompted us to investigate the respective contributions of MOE and VNO stimulations to MeA responses. MOE stimulation elicited clear olfactory-evoked neuronal activity in the MOB and the posterolateral cortical amygdala (PLCO) in response to volatile urinary cues and odorants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). However, while we observed robust VNO-mediated responses in the MeA, we did not detect stimulus-specific responses for MOE-delivered stimuli (units responsive to MOE stimuli at p≤0.01: 1.1%, 95% CI: 0.8–1.6%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).

We stereotaxically targeted the posterior MeA such that the array of recording sites would span both the MeApv and MeApd. Consistent with previous findings, we found that a clear topographical segregation of sensory responses is apparent in the real time response properties of MeA units.

However, we also observed MeA neurons that responded significantly to multiple stimuli with varying response strengths (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>), indicating that individual neurons distributed throughout the MeA have access to information about both conspecific and defensive stimuli.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Sharpened stimulus representations in the MeA</title><p>Units recorded in the AOB, the sole target of VNO output and the primary input to the MeA, display a wide range of response selectivity with some units responding similarly to seemingly contradictory sensory signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hendrickson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ben-Shaul et al., 2010</xref>).

Similarly, systematic post-mortem histology from experiments yielding isolated units invariably confirmed accurate targeting to the AOB mitral cell layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Thus, we can assume with a high level of confidence that we chiefly recorded from AOB projection neurons and not interneurons.</p><p>Male mouse, female mouse, and predator stimuli each elicited robust responses in the MeA and AOB. Using a threshold for statistical significance of p&lt;0.01, the fractions of units showing sensory responses are 6.3, 5.1, and 6.9% for female, male, and predator stimuli respectively for MeA units, as compared to 16.6, 11.4, and 21.3% for AOB units (p&lt;0.01, non-parametric ANOVA). Thus, the percentage of units responding to each stimulus is dramatically lower in the MeA than it is in the AOB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).

The vertices represent exclusive responses to one of the stimuli. Comparison of the spatial distribution of individual neurons between the AOB and the MeA indicates that, whereas AOB units tend to populate the central region of the triangular plot, MeA units more evenly span the entire area with an increased density at the vertices. Dividing the triangular response space into four equal quadrants (dashed lines <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C,D</xref>) showed that 44.4% of AOB units vs 21.6% of MeA units reside in the central quadrant associated with less specific responses. Thus, flow of information from the AOB to the MeA is associated with a sharpening of stimulus-driven responses. The increased selectivity of sensory responses in the MeA is similarly reflected by a marked decorrelation of responses evoked by different sensory stimuli across the MeA population (AOB: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> inset; MeA: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> inset; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>The sharpened response pattern observed in the MeA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) suggests that MeA activity could represent higher-level categorical information.

A principal component analysis performed on responses evoked by these stimuli revealed that the first PC reflected the distinction between ‘female’ and ‘predator’ categories and accounted for 41% of the total response variance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). The second PC distinguished between ‘female’ vs ‘male’ stimuli and accounted for 19% of the total variance. Therefore, most of the variation of sensory responses in the MeA of male mice is devoted to the distinction between ‘female’ from ‘predator’ and 'male' categories respectively. However, individual sensory responses in the MeA rarely form sharply defined stimulus categories, but rather, maintain enough information to distinguish between individual elements of each category (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Sexually dimorphic responses in the MeA</title><p>Sexually dimorphic behaviors of male and female animals to conspecific stimuli represent a dramatic and reproducible example of individual variability: male stimuli elicit territorial responses from another male mouse, but reproductive displays from a receptive female mouse.

We quantified the sex preference of individual neurons using an index that ranges from −1 to 1, reflecting responses exclusive to male or female stimuli, respectively.

To understand when the MeA circuitry acquires its sex-specific functional features, we recorded responses to sensory stimuli in the MeA of juvenile male and female mice at 18–21 days, which is roughly 1 week prior to puberty onset (28 days; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Nathan et al., 2006</xref>).

Although sparse in the rodent brain, the MeApd is a primary site of aromatase expression, and sexual dimorphisms in MeA regional volume, cell number, and neural connectivity are mediated by aromatase-dependent sex-steroid signaling (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cooke et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">McCarthy, 2008</xref>).</p><p>The dorsal bias in aromatase expression parallels a dorsal bias of sexually dimorphic sensory responses we observed.

As predicted, MeA units from ArKO<sup>−/−</sup> males frequently responded to multiple stimuli; whereas, MeA units from age matched heterozygous littermates (ArKO<sup>+/−</sup>) were similar to those observed in wild-type males (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Indeed, the sex specificity of neurons recorded in adult ArKO<sup>−/−</sup> males is largely symmetric around 0, and presents a pattern of responses intermediate to those observed in intact juvenile and adult male mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). In contrast, adult heterozygous littermates (ArKO<sup>+/−</sup>) displayed a bias towards responses to female stimuli similar to that observed in wild-type males (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,B</xref>). Like juvenile animals, most (42.1%) of MeA units recorded from adult ArKO<sup>−/−</sup> males reside in the central quadrant associated with less specific responses, compared to 19.5% of units recorded from ArKO<sup>+/−</sup>. Similarly, response patterns to different stimuli are much more correlated in the MeA of ArKO<sup>−/−</sup> males (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, bottom) than in ArKO<sup>+/−</sup> littermates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, top) or wild-type males (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), reflecting a loss of discriminability at the individual unit level. These results suggest that estrogen signaling (via conversion of testosterone by aromatase) is essential for generating the pattern of sensory responses observed in the adult male MeA. The fact that adult ArKO<sup>−/−</sup> males are also different from juvenile males indicates that other processes, such as direct testosterone signaling, may play an important role in developing the adult MeA sensory representation.<fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02743.015</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Importance of aromatase signaling for the development of sexually dimorphic MeA responses.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Population summary of MeA responses to male, female, and predator stimuli recorded from adult male ArKO mice (light blue circles) or heterozygous male littermates (dark blue diamonds).

Sensory cues are initially detected by VNO sensory neurons, each expressing a single VR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Leinders-Zufall et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Haga et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Isogai et al., 2011</xref>), which then project to the AOB. While some AOB units display clear selectivity for distinct VNO stimuli, AOB units typically respond to multiple sensory stimuli, and many AOB units respond to multiple stimuli associated with conflicting behavioral outcomes such as female conspecifics and predators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ben-Shaul et al., 2010</xref>). Nearly all AOB output neurons project to the MeA, however, the convergence of input in the MeA lead to a different pattern of sensory responses, such that the fraction of MeA neurons responding to any given stimulus is smaller, and the specificity of MeA responses elicited by sensory stimuli is greater than observed in the AOB.</p><p>One interpretation of our data is that the low stimulus specificity observed in AOB responses represents a recording bias towards local inhibitory interneurons. This, however, seems extremely unlikely because our recordings targeted the mitral cell layer, and because ample evidence from olfactory bulb electrophysiology indicates that granule cells are virtually undetectable through extracellular recordings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bhalla and Bower, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kay and Laurent, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Rinberg et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ben-Shaul et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Doucette et al., 2011</xref>). Instead, the complex AOB representation we observe is likely generated by the integration of VR inputs by individual AOB mitral cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Wagner et al., 2006</xref>). The nature of the units recorded from in the MeA is presently unknown, and further identification by genetic methods is an important goal for future studies.</p><p>A general feature of sensory systems is that neurons located at later stages of sensory processing are less active than those at earlier stages. Sparse coding at higher processing areas is well described in vision and olfaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Olshausen and Field, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Quiroga et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Poo and Isaacson, 2009</xref>), and is thought to reflect the construction of increasingly complex sensory representations. Similarly, we find that the fraction of neurons activated by any given stimulus is approximately threefold greater in the AOB compared to the MeA. While the function of unresponsive units remains unclear, a reasonable suggestion is that these units respond to stimuli that were not presented in these experiments. Alternatively, vomeronasal-induced behaviors are strongly influenced by behavioral state (e.g.: dominant vs subordinate, estrus vs non-estrus, or adult vs juvenile), and it is possible that only a subset of MeA neurons are active in any given behavioral or physiological state.</p><p>We also found that MeA neurons of adult mice respond to vomeronasal stimuli with significantly more specificity for behaviorally distinct classes of stimuli than AOB neurons, and the number of MeA neurons responding to behaviorally conflicting stimuli, although not absent, is lower than observed in the AOB. Thus, the complex responses typical of AOB neurons are interpreted by the MeA in a manner that promotes the emergence of sensory responses more closely associated with a specific behavioral output, and may help generate unambiguous and mutually exclusive behaviors (e.g.: aggression, courtship, parenting, or predator defense). The greater MeA selectivity may result from the preferential contribution of the most selective AOB units to MeA responses, or from the transformation of AOB inputs by sensory processing within the MeA. The apparent functional disambiguation of AOB inputs by MeA units suggests a logic and specificity in AOB to MeA connectivity that strongly contrasts with the distributive pattern of projection reported from the MOB to the piriform cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Sosulski et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Choi et al., 2005</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Responses of single neurons in the MeA</title><p>As observed in the VNO and AOB, MeA responses display a relatively long latency (several seconds) and slow time-course (tens of seconds) that is likely a direct result of the slow dynamics of large non-volatile sensory stimuli that activate VRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Holy et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hendrickson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ben-Shaul et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Shpak et al., 2012</xref>).

In some species, sexually dimorphic processing of sensory cues is already prominent in the sensory epithelium. For example, male and female moths (<italic>Manduca sexta)</italic> and silkworms <italic>(Bombyx mori)</italic> express an array of olfactory receptors that are not expressed by the opposite sex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hansson et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Nakagawa et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Große-Wilde et al., 2010</xref>). Thus, moths of either sex have access to channels of sensory information associated with sex-specific behaviors that are completely absent in the opposite sex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Schneiderman et al., 1986</xref>). The roundworm <italic>C. elegans</italic> displays a variation on this theme such that sexually dimorphic activity of primary sensory neurons (ASI) during development shapes a sexually dimorphic downstream circuit that then contributes to guiding sexually dimorphic behaviors in the adult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">White and Jorgensen, 2012</xref>).</p><p>In other species, stimuli are similarly detected by sensory epithelia of both sexes, but are differentially interpreted by distinct circuits in the male vs female brain. For example, the <italic>Drosophila</italic> pheromone 11-<italic>cis</italic> Vaccenyl acetate (cVA) elicits sexually dimorphic behaviors, but the sensory neurons that detect cVA are anatomically and functionally indistinguishable in males and females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kurtovic et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Datta et al., 2008</xref>). Instead, the influence of cVA on sexually dimorphic behaviors is achieved through differential projections of cVA input to the sexually dimorphic network of <italic>fru</italic> expressing neurons in the central nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Datta et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Ruta et al., 2010</xref>). Even more centrally based, the capacity for male, but not female, finches to sing is attributed to circuit differences in premotor nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Nottebohm and Arnold, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Konishi and Akutagawa, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kirn, 2010</xref>). Thus, the pervasive existence of sexually dimorphic behaviors underscores their evolutionary value, but the strategies employed to achieve sexual dimorphism differ widely between species.</p><p>One of the most striking features of VNO-mediated behaviors is their sexually dimorphic expression: a male mouse elicits territorial aggression in another male mouse, but courtship in a receptive female mouse. Similarly, pups trigger infanticide in virgin males but parental behavior in virgin females. One therefore expects that sex-specific differences in the behavioral significance of certain cues be reflected in the male- and female-specific patterns of neuronal activity within the vomeronasal pathway. However, although sexually dimorphic anatomical features have indeed long been identified at every stage of the vomeronasal pathway, including in the VNO, AOB, amygdala, and hypothalamic areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Guillamón and Segovia, 1997</xref>), there is little evidence for substantial differences in sensory responses of the male and female VNO or AOB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Nodari et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Herrada and Dulac, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ben-Shaul et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Haga et al., 2010</xref>). Thus, downstream circuits are likely to contribute significantly to generate, or amplify, sexually dimorphic sensory processing.</p><p>Previous studies show that silencing the VNO, genetically or surgically, brings about a set of behaviors that are typically seen in the opposite sex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Stowers et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kimchi et al., 2007</xref>). These findings demonstrate the essential contribution of the vomeronasal system to the control of social behaviors, and show that effector circuits for behaviors of both sexes exist in the brain, and are activated or repressed by vomeronasal activity in a sex-specific manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kimchi et al., 2007</xref>). The transformation of the vomeronasal sensory representation in the MeA precisely fulfills the characteristics required of such a behavioral switch. Unlike the AOB, in which sensory responses are similar in males and females, over 80% of the recorded MeA neurons respond preferentially to stimuli from the opposite sex. Accordingly, an entire category of ‘same-sex’ responses is decimated in the MeA representation. Same-sex information is not entirely lost: indeed, the lack of male to male aggression in TRPC2<sup>−/−</sup> mice demonstrates that the representation of male stimuli, in male mice, is present in wild-type animals, depends on vomeronasal signaling, and is capable of driving robust behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Stowers et al., 2002</xref>). Same sex-information may therefore either rely on the minimal representation found in the MeA, or be processed preferentially by other secondary vomeronasal relays.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Developmental organization of sexually dimorphic circuits</title><p>Puberty marks the transitional period during which animals develop the secondary sex traits characteristic of adult animals, and begin to display adult-typical social behaviors. It is generally believed that testosterone accounts for most, if not all, of development of the known sexually dimorphic structures in the mammalian brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Morris et al., 2004</xref>). The manner by which testosterone shapes the nervous system, however, depends on the specific neural circuit, such that cell death, synapse formation, synapse elimination, neurogenesis, and changes to neuron morphology all play important roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cooke et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ibanez et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Morris et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Forger &amp; de Vries, 2010</xref>). The influence of sex-steroids on the brain is strictly controlled according to the developmental stage, with two phases described as critical. During an initial phase, which occurs near birth, neural structures are thought to be differentially ‘organized’ by exposure to testosterone in males, but not in females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Phoenix et al., 1959</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">McCarthy, 2008</xref>). This initial phase is thought to create clear structural and anatomical differences within sexually dimorphic regions. During a second phase, which occurs during puberty, sexually dimorphic circuits are ‘activated’ such that they begin functioning as mature circuits capable of effecting sexually dimorphic behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Phoenix et al., 1959</xref>).</p><p>The MeA of mice is morphologically sexually dimorphic such that males have a larger posterodorsal MeA (MeApd) than females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cooke et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Morris et al., 2004</xref>), a difference primarily attributed to differential cell death at birth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Wu et al., 2009</xref>). Our recordings from the MeA of mice in the week prior to puberty onset demonstrate that MeA units had not developed the sexually dimorphic response patterns characteristic of adult animals, although these recordings were performed after sex-specific cell death is largely complete (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Wu et al., 2009</xref>; see ; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Forger and de Vries, 2010</xref>). Therefore, the organizational phase of steroid-dependent MeA cell death likely provides a template for future sexually dimorphic sensory responses, but is not in itself sufficient to endow the MeA with adult function that might, for example, require further elimination of neurons with the wrong sex cue specificity. Importantly, juvenile MeA neurons are not silent but rather respond vigorously to vomeronasal stimuli in a manner very similar to AOB neurons in adult animals, demonstrating that the MeA is already an actively functioning circuit.</p><p>Taken together, our results indicate that a second phase of circuit organization is required to shape sex-specific responses in adults. Our recordings from animals with manipulated hormone levels and hormone signaling show that sexually dimorphic patterns of MeA function in adult mice are estrogen dependent. Previous experiments studying an independently made ArKO mouse line reported significant impairment in social recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bakker et al., 2002</xref>), which may result from the failure of MeA neurons in ArKO animals to maturate adult patterns of MeA responses. In some species of mammals, the influence of sex-steroids on MeA anatomy persists well into adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cooke et al., 1999</xref>) supporting our conclusion that additional hormone-dependent circuit changes occur after the perinatal organizational phase. Moreover, a multi-stage organizational model of sex-specific behavioral circuits is supported by elegant experiments in hamsters demonstrating profound rearrangements of circuits underlying social behaviors during puberty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Zehr et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Several models could account for the late development of sexually dimorphic responses observed in the MeA. Death of MeA neurons during development is important for sculpting a sexually dimorphic circuit. However, we now know that the functional properties of MeA units can be similar even though the number of cells in the male vs female MeA is different. Therefore, other processes that build on these early differences must exist, and different mechanisms for achieving proper functional sexual dimorphism in the MeA can be proposed, each providing unique and testable predictions on how neural circuits in the adult MeA develop. Synaptic input from the AOB to the MeA may be sculpted in adult mice to disproportionately favor AOB input carrying opposite sex information to the MeA. Alternatively, or in addition to, maturation of inhibition within the MeA at puberty may act to silence, or specifically shunt less robust MeA responses. This latter mechanism could act in a manner similar to the control of critical period plasticity within the cortex through a time- and steroid-dependent maturation of inhibitory connectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hensch, 2005</xref>).</p><p>The emergence of specific topographically segregated, and sexually dimorphic MeA responses indicate that the anatomical and functional processes by which response selectivity is achieved in the MeA do not act randomly. Rather, specific circuit mechanisms yet to be uncovered must act together to allow features of vomeronasal information to be extracted from the overall AOB representation based on intrinsic MeA properties, as well as, the sex, age, and physiological status of the individual animal. Remarkably, the differences in MeA activity observed in males vs females, juveniles vs adults, or mutants vs wild-type animals correlate tightly with distinct patterns of social behaviors from each of these groups. This suggests that the age- and sex-specific transformations in MeA sensory processing uncovered by our study are likely to underlie fundamental changes in social behavior throughout development.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>Mice (adult, litters of juvenile mice, and pregnant females for estrogen treatments of newborn pups) were purchased from Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, MA).

In contrast, negligible neural activity was observed from electrode tracks located in the granule cell layer. These results suggest that AOB projection neurons (mitral and tufted cells) represent the majority of neurons recorded in these experiments. A subset of the AOB data reported in this manuscript were originally reported in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ben-Shaul et al. (2010)</xref>, but have been extensively reanalyzed.</p><p>MeA recordings were made with a 2-shank configuration with 16 recording channels per shank (NeuroNexus Technologies: a2x16-10 mm 100-500-413). Briefly, a craniotomy was opened dorsal to the MeA based on stereotaxic coordinates (1.7–2.0 mm lateral from midline and 1.7–2.0 mm caudal from bregma). Electrophysiological probes were positioned using a stereotaxic manipulator (MP-285; Sutter instruments, Novato, CA) and advanced 5–6 mm from dorsal surface of the brain until a minute deflection in the electrode shaft indicated that the electrode tip had reached the ventral surface. Accurate targeting was associated with a progression of distinct electrophysiological features as the electrode probe advanced through the brain. For example, large amplitude spikes were abundant as the electrodes penetrated the hippocampus. Ventral to the hippocampus, there was a period of relative quiescence, followed by large oscillatory spikes immediately dorsal to the MeA. The spontaneous neuronal activity in the MeA was typically low and isolated action potentials were distinctly smaller in magnitude than those encountered dorsal to the MeA—we used these distinctive characteristics to improve accurate targeting during the experiment. Indeed, post-mortem histology confirmed that the majority of our recordings traversed the entire dorsoventral extent of the MeA.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Post-mortem histological reconstruction</title><p>Electrophysiology probes were coated with one of four fluorescent dyes (DiI, DiO, DiD, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA; FluoroGold, Fluorochrome, LLC). At the end of each experiment, the brain was extracted, fixed, and 50-μm coronal sections were made for histological analysis of the electrode tract location to confirm accurate stereotaxic targeting to either the AOB external cellular layer or posterior MeA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). In nearly all cases, electrode tracts were accurately targeted to either the posterior MeA or the mitral cell layer of the AOB. Data was excluded for the few recording sessions with poor targeting.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Processing of electrophysiological data</title><p>32 recording channels were band-pass filtered (300–5000 Hz) and continuously sampled at 25 kHz using an RZ2 processor, PZ2 preamplifier, and two RA16CH head-stage amplifiers (TDT, Alachua, FL). Custom MATLAB (Mathworks, Natick, MA) programs were used to extract 3.5 ms spike waveforms from the continuous data. The number of recording channels on which a given spike was detectable depended on the inter site distance (more overlap for 50 µm, less overlap for 100 µm), and the recording target (typically more for the AOB that for the MeA).</p><p>Once a spike was detected on any given channel, waveforms were extracted for all electrode channels in close proximity (a total of 8 channels per group). Thus, each single spike was described by its voltage waveforms on 8 contiguous channels and all of these signals were used for spike sorting. Specifically, on each recording session, we calculated the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> principal components (PCs) for each channel. Then, each spike was described by its projections (PC loadings) on the first two PCs for each of the 8 channels in its group. Thus, the shape of each spike was described by a set of 16 PC loading values. These PC loading values were input to KlustaKwik (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Harris et al., 2000</xref>) for automatic classification. Since the algorithm is designed to ‘over cluster’, clusters were then manually verified and adjusted using Klusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hazan et al., 2006</xref>). Spike clusters were evaluated by consideration of their spike shapes, projections on principal component space (calculated independently for each recording session) and autocorrelation functions.</p><p>Classification of a spike cluster as representing a ‘single unit’ required that the cluster displayed a distinct spike shape and was fully separated from both the origin (noise) and other clusters (multi-unit) with respect to at least one principal component projection. We also verified that the interspike interval histogram for a given ‘single unit’ cluster demonstrated a clear refractory period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Numbers of units collected for each experimental condition</title><p>A total of 3543 units were recorded from adult BALB/c mice for all experiments. 1938 units were recorded from the MeA of adult BALB/c mice of which 197 responded to VNO stimulation (106 from male animals; 91 from female animals). 1605 units were recorded from the AOB of adult BALB/c mice of which 274 responded to VNO stimulation (210 from male animals; 64 from female animals). 517 units were recorded from the MeA of juvenile BALB/c mice of which 87 responded to VNO stimulation (37 from male animals; 50 from female animals). 290 units were recorded from the MeA of adult BALB/c female mice perinatally treated with estrogen, with 48 responding to VNO stimulation. 737 units were recorded from the MeA of ArKO<sup>−/−</sup> and ArKO<sup>+/−</sup> mice of which 99 responded to VNO stimulation (41 from ArKO<sup>+/−</sup>; 58 from ArKO<sup>−/−</sup>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Statistical identification of sensory-driven responses</title><p>All statistical analyses were performed with custom Matlab code. Significant responses were identified by comparing each unit's spiking rate during the pre-stimulation (20 s prior to stimulation) and post-stimulation (40 s after stimulation) epochs using a non-parametric ANOVA performed at the significance level of p≤0.01. This post-stimulus window ensured inclusion of responses occurring prior to and after electrical stimulation of the sympathetic nerve. Response magnitude was quantified as the change in average firing rate during the 40 s following stimulus presentation relative to the firing rate during the 20 s prior to stimulus presentation. Spike rates for histograms were binned into 2 s epochs, and then averaged across repeated stimulus presentations. Unless otherwise noted, statistics comparing two populations of units (e.g.: responses from male vs female animals) were performed using a nonparametric permutation test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Efron and Tibshirani, 1993</xref>) as observed distributions were not typically normally distributed.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>MeA topography analysis</title><p>The precise geometry of the multichannel electrophysiology probes allowed us to determine the relative dorsal–ventral location of MeA neurons with high accuracy. First, single units with statistically significant responses to at least one stimulus were classified in a winner-take-all manner as ‘conspecific responsive’ or ‘predator responsive’ based on the magnitude of stimulus-driven responses. Next, the physical distance between the recording sites for each pair of units (between the two categories) was calculated. For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>, positive distances indicate that the conspecific unit was dorsal to the predator unit. Then, we calculated a ‘predator/conspecific contrast ratio’, (resp<sub>con</sub> – resp<sub>pred</sub>)/ (resp<sub>con</sub> + resp<sub>pred</sub>), for each unit that ranges from −1 (entirely predator responsive) to 1 (entirely conspecific responsive). The predator/conspecific contrast ratio values were then subtracted for each predator vs conspecific unit comparison, in a manner identical to the distance analysis described above, to determine if there was a correlation between the location of a unit and the specificity of response tuning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Correlation analysis</title><p>Pearson's correlation values (insets: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C,D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>) were calculated, for all responsive MeA units, based on the array of responses to stimulus ‘A’ vs stimulus ‘B’. To ensure that the observed correlations/regressions were not spurious results generated by a few outliers, we performed a partial leverage analysis. Analyses were then recalculated with high leverage points removed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>), and in no cases did the exclusion of high leverage points significantly alter the final result.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Multidimensional scaling</title><p>A non-metric multidimensional scaling was used to reduce the dimensionality of the stimulus category distance matrix, so that the distance between each stimulus could be approximated in two dimensions based on Kruskal's normalized stress criterion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2C</xref>). Since this algorithm can vary when given a random seed, we performed the analysis 100 times, and the most common result (∼55% of cases) was shown. No cases were observed in any of these repetitions in which the triangles formed by different categories intersected or overlapped.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Triangular plots of neural responses</title><p>Triangle plots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C,D</xref>) of sensory responses to male female and predator stimuli were generated in three steps. First, the pre-stimulus firing rate was subtracted from the post-stimulus firing rate of each unit in order to account for differences in baseline firing rates. The absolute value of the baseline subtracted response was then taken to account for responses that consisted of a reduction in activity as compared to the pre-stimulus epoch. As can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>, such cases are an extreme minority in our data as units typically were inactive before a stimulus was presented and respond to stimuli with an increase in activity. Second, baseline adjusted firing rates were normalized by dividing by the summed responses to all stimuli such that:<disp-formula id="equ1"><mml:math id="m1"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>resp</mml:mtext></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>Male</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>resp</mml:mtext></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>Female</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>resp</mml:mtext></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>Pred</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>.</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>At this point, each unit can be plotted on an equilateral triangle with vertices at (0,0,1), (0,1,0), and (1,0,0), where the three axes represent the normalized responses to male, female and predator stimuli.

Prior to insertion into the brain, a retaining current of −2 μA was applied and the outer surface of the glass electrode was thoroughly washed, to minimize unintentional labeling along the electrode path dorsal to the injection site. At the injection site (1.80 mm lateral, 1.8 mm posterior, and 5.5 mm ventral from Bregma) the polarity of current was switched and +5 μA, constant current was applied for 10 min. Following each injection, a −2 μA retaining current was reapplied for 10 min prior to and during the retraction of the electrode. The scalp was then sutured and a small amount of Vetbond was applied to close the wound. Animals were euthanized following a 7-day post-operative survival period, and the brains were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in saline. Serial vibratome sections (50 μm thickness) of the entire brain and olfactory bulbs were cut, counterstained with NeuroTrace Green (Invitrogen), and mounted on gelatin-coated slides.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Eve Marder (Senior editor) and 3 reviewers, one of whom, Peggy Mason, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This manuscript nicely describes refined stimulus tuning and sexual dimorphism in the MeA in the processing of non-volatile social cues detected by the vomeronasal system. This manuscript describes an elegant set of experiments investigating the response properties of individual MeA neurons to non-volatile odorant cues from predator and male and female rodent urine. They find that 1) neurons in the MeA have heightened stimulus specificity as compared with neurons in the accessory olfactory bulb, the upstream region; 2) sexually dimorphic responses that require intact estrogen signaling in the prenatal mouse brain. This is an important piece of work that should be of interest to a broad audience.</p><p>There are a large number of additional experimental details, figure adjustments, and explanatory text revisions that would enhance this paper. We look forward to a revised manuscript that addresses these points.</p><p><italic>Reviewer</italic> <italic>#1:</italic></p><p>I suggest saying up front when the # of units is given that males and females were grouped together (until they're not) and how many there were of each.</p><p>I think that the response selectivity description in the Results is understated and suggest it needs defining in the Results.</p><p>Single-and multi-units were classified by spike shape, separation of principal component projections, and the presence or absence of a refractory period between successive spikes – I don't understand this for multi units.</p><p>In most experiments, ∼2-6 recording sites were located dorsal to the MeA and were easily distinguished from the quiet baseline activity of the MeA.

What nuclei are</italic> <italic>targeted during recordings?</italic></p><p>One of the best-known functional features of the MeA, demonstrated via immediate early gene studies, is the segregation into dorsal and ventral processing subdivisions. The posterior dorsal MeA, or MeApd, is essential for reproductive and social behaviors while the ventral MeA, or MeApv, is essential for defensive behaviors (Fernandez-Fewell et al., 1994; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Choi et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Wu et al., 2009</xref>). We stereotaxically targeted the posterior MeA such that the array of recording sites would span both the MeApv and MeApd.</p><p><italic>What types of neurons are being recorded</italic> <italic>in the MeA?</italic></p><p>While one can make reasonable predictions regarding which neurons likely constitute our MeA recordings, we simply don't know the answer to this question yet. We now directly address this issue in the text: <italic>“</italic>The nature of the units recorded from in the MeA is presently unknown, and further identification by genetic methods is an important goal for future studies.”</p><p><italic>Also, it would be useful to include some discussion on why only ∼10% of the neurons within the MeA are responsive to stimuli presented</italic>.</p><p>We now discuss this issue more directly. A general feature of sensory systems is that neurons located at later stages of sensory processing are less active than those at earlier stages. Sparse coding at higher processing areas is well described in vision and olfaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Olshausen &amp; Field, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Poo &amp; Isaacson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Quiroga et al., 2005</xref>), and is thought to reflect the construction of increasingly complex sensory representations. Similarly, we find that the fraction of neurons activated by any given stimulus is approximately 3 fold greater in the AOB compared to the MeA. While the function of unresponsive units remains unclear, a reasonable suggestion is that these units respond to stimuli that were not presented in these experiments. Alternatively, vomeronasal induced behaviors are strongly influenced by behavioral state (for example: dominant versus subordinate, estrus versus non-estrus, or adult versus juvenile), and it is possible that only a subset of MeA neurons are active in any given behavioral or physiological state.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p><italic>1) The authors could do a better job of explaining how the primary data is processed to generate the triangular plots. In the methods they say that the triangular plots are generated by “projecting the normalized male, female, and predator responses on the plane,” but do not describe what exact measure of electrical activity is used responses – change in firing rate averaged across repeats? Or explain how the responses are normalized</italic>.</p><p>We have expanded and clarified this description:</p><p>“Triangular plots of neural responses: Triangle plots (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C,D</xref>) of sensory responses to male female and predator stimuli were generated in three steps. First, the pre-stimulus firing rate was subtracted from the post-stimulus firing rate of each unit in order to account for differences in baseline firing rates. The absolute value of the baseline subtracted response was then taken to account for responses that consisted of a reduction in activity as compared to the pre-stimulus epoch. As can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1–figure supplement 2A</xref>, such cases are an extreme minority in our data as units typically were inactive before a stimulus was presented and respond to stimuli with an increase in activity. Second, baseline adjusted firing rates were normalized by dividing by the summed responses to all stimuli such that:</p><p>resp<sub>Male</sub> + resp<sub>Female</sub> + resp<sub>Pred</sub> = 1.</p><p>At this point, each unit can be plotted on an equilateral triangle with vertices at (0,0,1), (0,1,0), and (1,0,0) where the three axes represent the normalized responses to male, female and predator stimuli. Third, the plane segment defined by the intersections of this plane with the three Cartesian axes was then rotated for ease of visualization.”</p><p><italic>2) It is not clear if the animals are exposed to just one sample of female/male/predator urine (obtained from multiple animals) or whether in each experiment they are tested with a second independent sample. This would be important to confirm that any one response is due to chemosignals from one of the three categories. There is a discussion of principal component analysis and a supplemental figure which shows that cells responsive to a female (male or predator) stimulus are generally sensitive to an independent stimulus from the same class, but the correlation appears to hover at less than 50% for male/female odors and lower for predator. Moreover, the diagram in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2"><italic>Figure 3–figure supplement 2</italic></xref><italic>seems a bit misleading, as bobcat appears closer to Male BalbC and Male C57, yet is drawn with a line connecting it, arbitrarily it seems, to rat and fox. The argument that states the predator stimuli group together seems thin, at best. The male and female stimuli are more convincingly correlated/clustered. This should be discussed</italic>.</p><p>The stimuli presented are now clarified in the results section: “Unless otherwise noted, predator stimuli were a mixture of bobcat, fox, and rat urine diluted 1:100 in Ringer's solution; female and male stimuli were a mixture of urine from balbC, C57, and CBA strains diluted 1:100 in Ringer's solution.”</p><p>During the categorization experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3–figure supplement 2</xref>), 1:100 diluted unmixed stimuli were presented. The reviewer is correct that the correlations between stimuli from the same class are clear, however, there is clear diversity in responses across these experimenter-defined categories. This diversity is most pronounced for the predator category.</p><p>Regarding the lines connecting each stimulus in panel C, these lines represent categories defined a priori and are not the result of an unbiased categorization. This is now clarified in the figure legend: “Multidimensional scaling analysis shows that stimuli from a single category populate a region of the response space that is non–overlapping with stimuli drawn from a different category. Lines connecting individual data points indicate ethologically defined stimulus categories.”</p><p><italic>3) Which predator urine was used for the main series of experiments? This should be mentioned in the text</italic>.</p><p>This is now defined (see above).</p></body></sub-article></article>
