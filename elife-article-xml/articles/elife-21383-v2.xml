Unlike actomyosin in sarcomeres, which cycles through contraction and relaxation, the cytokinetic ring disassembles during contraction through an unknown mechanism. Here we find in <italic>Schizosaccharomyces japonicus</italic> and <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> that, during actomyosin ring contraction, actin filaments associated with actomyosin rings are expelled as micron-scale bundles containing multiple actomyosin ring proteins. Using functional isolated actomyosin rings we show that expulsion of actin bundles does not require continuous presence of cytoplasm. Strikingly, mechanical compression of actomyosin rings results in expulsion of bundles predominantly at regions of high curvature. Our work unprecedentedly reveals that the increased curvature of the ring itself promotes its disassembly. It is likely that such a curvature-induced mechanism may operate in disassembly of other contractile networks.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.21383.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.21383.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>cytokinesis</kwd><kwd><italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic></kwd><kwd>actomyosin ring</kwd><kwd>curvature</kwd><kwd><italic>Schizosaccharomyces japonicus</italic></kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>S. pombe</italic></kwd><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>103895/Z/14/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cross</surname><given-names>Robert Anthony</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>103741/Z/14/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Oliferenko</surname><given-names>Snezhana</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>WT101885MA</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Balasubramanian</surname><given-names>Mohan K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000288</institution-id><institution>Royal Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Balasubramanian</surname><given-names>Mohan K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Cytokinetic actomyosin ring disassembly occurs through a novel mechanism in which the increased ring curvature, generated through contraction, itself promotes the disassembly process.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Many eukaryotes assemble a dynamic actomyosin-based contractile ring to divide one cell into two (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Pollard and Wu, 2010</xref>). During ring contraction, ring components continuously disassemble while maintaining ring contractility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Pollard and Wu, 2010</xref>). This is in stark contrast to other actomyosin machineries, particularly the thick and thin filament based sarcomeres in muscle fibers, which undergo contraction and relaxation cycles without disassembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Murrell et al., 2015</xref>). ADF1/Cofilin together with Coronin and WD-repeat protein Aip1 modulate actin turnover by severing actin bundles in many types of actin networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Jansen et al., 2015</xref>). However, their involvement in actomyosin ring contraction and disassembly is still unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Chen and Pollard, 2011</xref>). The F-actin based molecular motor Myosin II may also regulate disassembly of actin networks during cytokinesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Guha et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Murthy and Wadsworth, 2005</xref>), presumably by myosin II mediated actin filaments buckling and breakage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Murrell and Gardel, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Reymann et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Vogel et al., 2013</xref>). The exact mechanism governing disassembly of actomyosin rings and whether and how the ring disassembly is coordinated to ring contraction have remained unknown so far.</p><p>To address these gaps in our knowledge, we studied the dynamics of actomyosin ring contraction and disassembly in the fission yeasts <italic>Schizosaccharomyces japonicus</italic> and <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic>. We report that micron-scale actin bundles are expelled during contraction of the actomyosin ring in a ring curvature-dependent manner in intact cells, in spheroplasts, and when isolated actomyosin rings are triggered to contract with ATP. We test the curvature-dependence of the actomyosin ring disassembly by physically deforming protoplasts to defined geometries.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><p>Whilst studying F-actin dynamics in <italic>S. japonicus</italic> cells expressing LifeAct-GFP, as a marker for all actin structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Gu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Huang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Riedl et al., 2008</xref>), large F-actin bundles appeared to be connected with the contracting ring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We imaged actin rings in the axial plane to achieve higher resolution by preparing spheroplasts, in which actomyosin rings were oriented randomly and slid along the cell membrane during contraction, consistent with previous work in <italic>S. pombe</italic> and in reconstituted giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Mishra et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Miyazaki et al., 2015</xref>). In spheroplasts where the actomyosin ring was positioned close to the imaging plane, actin filaments appeared to project outwards from the contracting ring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Permeabilized spheroplasts retained substantial numbers of actin filaments that remained attached to the ring, indicating that the actin filaments were connected to the contracting ring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). To ensure that the observed actin filaments were not an artifact of LifeAct-GFP used in these experiments, we fixed and stained wild type cells (that did not express any fusion protein) and wild type cells expressing LifeAct-GFP with Rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We also fixed and stained permeabilized spheroplasts generated from these two strains with Rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin. In both cases, we were able to detect actin filaments connected to the contracting actomyosin ring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>), ruling out the possibility that the observed filaments were an artifact of the tag used. When fixed cells expressing Rlc1p-GFP were stained with Rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin, actin filaments attached to the ring colocalized with Rlc1p, suggesting that Rlc1p-GFP (and by extension Myosin II) was also part of the actin filaments attached to contracting rings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Furthermore, actin filaments linked to the contracting actomyosin ring were detected in <italic>S. pombe</italic> cells and permeabilized spheroplasts of wild type cells (with no genetic tag) and of wild type cells expressing LifeAct-GFP or Rlc1-GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>), establishing that this phenomenon is not unique to <italic>S. japonicus</italic> cells and spheroplasts. Actin and myosin II filaments attached to contracting actomyosin rings have been observed by Wollrab and colleagues in <italic>S. pombe</italic> cells, although the significance of these structures was not investigated in their work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Wollrab et al., 2016</xref>).

On this basis, we now refer to them as ring-associated actin bundles.</p><p>Time-lapse microscopic analysis of spheroplasts expressing LifeAct-GFP showed that actin bundles appeared to emerge from the contracting ring, continued to extend in length and were progressively expelled from the sites of their initial appearances (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>). Occasionally, upon the expulsion of actin bundles, the contracting ring seemed to disintegrate at the region of release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Similar observations of actin bundles being expelled from contracting rings were also made in <italic>S. pombe</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Actin bundles were also expelled during contraction in <italic>S. japonicus</italic> intact cells expressing LifeAct-GFP in which the GFP intensity was reduced and actin appeared disorganized near the end of cytokinesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F and G</xref>).

However, the combined actin fluorescence intensity from rings and associated bundles was roughly comparable in large and small rings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1I</xref>), suggesting that the expulsion of actin bundles from the ring may represent a mechanism for ring disassembly.

To quantitate aspects of actin bundle expulsion in cell ghosts, we fixed and stained contracting and contracted actomyosin rings with CF633-phalloidin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). The ring-associated bundles appearing in cell ghosts after ATP addition were similar to those observed during in vivo ring contraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). We observed 4.3 ± 1.4 bundles associated with the rings in cell ghosts, with individual average length of 3.9 ± 1.3 µm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>; total bundle length 16.1 ± 6.7 µm). The sum F-actin intensity of cell ghosts (ring actin + bundle actin) following ATP addition showed no significant changes, whereas there was a decrease of actin intensity in the rings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). We estimated protein levels of actin and the actin filament binding protein tropomyosin Cdc8p in the supernatant and pellet fractions following centrifugation of contracting actomyosin rings in cell ghosts (treated with ATP for 20 or 40 min). We did not find a significant increase in the amount of actin and Cdc8p in the supernatant in cell ghosts treated with ATP for 20 or 40 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>), consistent with the idea that ring contraction resulted in denser actin filaments containing binding proteins such as tropomyosin that remain in the pellet fraction. These results indicated that in cell ghosts treated with ATP for 20 to 40 min, the rings reduced in actin amounts. However, this did not lead to an increase in soluble G-actin during ring contraction, suggesting that most actin was expelled in filaments contained in bundles during this period of time. Furthermore, these experiments established that the expulsion of actin bundles was a result of ring contraction and was independent of continuous presence of cytosol. Finally, the absence of cytosolic components such as G-actin also suggests that the actomyosin bundles are expelled as a result of contraction rather than the possibility that these bundles were newly polymerized actin cables that were not incorporated into the highly curved actomyosin ring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21383.009</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Expulsion of actomyosin bundles during contraction of isolated rings.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) i, bundle expulsion mediated by cytosolic proteins; ii, newly polymerized actin filaments that are unable to incorporate into a highly curved actomyosin ring.

We had previously noted that actomyosin bundles were expelled at later stages of contraction. As the actomyosin bundles were expelled from contracting rings of smaller diameters, which have higher curvatures, we speculated that the local curvature of rings might induce bundle expulsion. In spheroplasts expressing Rlc1p-GFP, the expelled bundles became visible and their numbers increased with the progression of time and increasing the curvature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Although rings started with curvatures (1/radius) of even smaller than 0.4 µm<sup>−1</sup> (translates to a ring diameter of &gt;5 µm in spheroplasts), the mean curvature at which bundles began to be expelled was 1.1 ± 0.4 µm<sup>−1</sup> (translates to a ring diameter of ~2 µm) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Given that bundle expulsion was only observed after a significant reduction in ring diameter, suggesting that bundle expulsion in rings is promoted by increased curvature. Furthermore, even in partially contracted and curved actomyosin rings in ATP treated cell ghosts, the majority (~68%) of ring-associated bundles were detected at regions of increased local curvature where the ring appeared to be bent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21383.012</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Increased ring curvature promotes actomyosin bundle expulsion.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Analysis of the curvature of sliding rings in spheroplasts expressing Rlc1p-GFP (n = 11 rings).

Strikingly, about 95% of the actomyosin bundles were expelled from the curved regions of compressed rings compared to flat regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C,D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media5">Video 5</xref>; average 5.2 ± 0.9 bundles per ring), and the local curvature at the sites of expelled bundles was 1.5 ± 0.3 µm<sup>−1</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>; mean curvature of compressed rings was 0.7 ± 0.2 µm<sup>−1</sup>). Whereas actomyosin bundles were expelled when uncompressed rings contracted to a perimeter of 6.3 ± 1.5 µm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>), majority of compressed rings started releasing actomyosin bundles when contracted to a perimeter of only 12.5 ± 2.4 µm, indicating that the curvature change induced expulsion of actomyosin bundles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). Curiously, following compression, the ring contraction rate (△perimeters/time) was 0.37 ± 0.09 µm/min, which was significantly less than the 1.26 ± 0.57 µm/min observed in uncompressed spheroplasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). The bundles were expelled at a reduced rate of 1.18 ± 0.42 µm/min as compared to 2.19 ± 0.61 µm/min in uncompressed spheroplasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Furthermore, shortening of the flat regions (△<italic>d</italic>) of compressed rings occurred faster than the decrease of ring heights (△<italic>h</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>; △<italic>d/</italic>min= 0.16 ± 0.04 µm/min vs. △<italic>h/</italic>min = 0.07 ± 0.02 µm/min). Thus, the actomyosin bundles were constrained by the local curvature of contracting rings, and their expulsion depends on the curvature changes during ring contraction. Our results showed that ring disassembly is coupled physically to ring contraction in a ring-geometry coordinated manner.<media content-type="glencoe play-in-place height-250 width-310" id="media5" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-21383-media5.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21383.014</object-id><label>Video 5.</label><caption><title>Curvature-induced expulsion of actomyosin bundles in distorted rings.</title><p>Curvature of distorted rings is color-coded.

It is presently unclear if other mechanisms, such as cofilin and myosin II mediated filament severing / breakage and loss of actin monomers also contribute to actin disassembly during cytokinesis. New probes exhibiting reduced photobleaching and directly reporting actin cytoskeleton dynamics will be required to help estimate if other mechanisms are in operation as well. The coupling of bundle expulsion mediated-ring disassembly to ring contraction appears intrinsic to the ring itself, and is potentially driven by a physical mechanism that is independent of cytosolic factors. It is possible that the affinity of binding of unidentified actin binding proteins with F-actin is reduced upon increased curvature of actin filaments. Thus, actomyosin bundles may not be able to bend sufficiently to accommodate the high ring curvature at later times in contraction, leading to their expulsion from the ring. It is likely that attainment of a curved morphology is an energetically unfavorable conformation since actin filaments have a persistence length of ~10 microns (which can increase further with bundling) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ott et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Riveline et al., 1997</xref>).</p><p>Although we were able to visualize actin filaments, Rlc1p-GFP, GFP-Rng2p, and Cdc15p-GFP on expelled bundles in living cells and spheroplasts, we were only able to visualize expulsion of actin filaments in bundles in contracting actomyosin rings within cell ghosts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref> and data not shown for GFP-Rng2). It is possible that other ring proteins do not associate tightly to actin bundles during ring contraction in a less crowded environment (such as permeabilized cell ghosts), whereas they are able to associate with expelled bundles in a cellular environment of increased molecular crowding. Alternatively, it is possible that, in the presence of cytosol, as in a cellular context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Pelham and Chang, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Wong et al., 2002</xref>), loss of ring proteins from actin bundles in the ring is balanced by replenishment from the cytosolic pool. However, in cell ghosts, such replenishment of ring proteins does not occur due to the absence of cytosol. Future work should investigate these possibilities.</p><p>Several types of actin filament behaviors such as branching and bundling are coupled to the curvature of the actin filament network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Liu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Risca et al., 2012</xref>).

The STORM images were reconstructed using GDSC SMLM plugins from the University of Sussex installed in Fiji (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>). To measure the bundle or ring width from STORM images, a portion of a bundle or a ring was selected and straightened (Fiji/Edit/Selection/Straighten) using the segmented line function of Fiji. A vertical line was drawn every 200 nm along the straighten line. The intensity of pixels along the vertical line was measured (Fiji/Analyze/Plot Profile). The width was measured by taking the Full-Width-Half-Maximum (FWHM) value after fitting the vertical line profile to a Gaussian curve function (Fiji/Analyze/Tools/Curve Fitting).

Briefly, raw Z stacks containing the actomyosin ring were de-noised with non-local means filter using a plugin installed in Fiji (plugin source: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://imagej.net/Non_Local_Means_Denoise">http://imagej.net/Non_Local_Means_Denoise</ext-link>). To facilitate shape measurement, the 3D stack was converted to 2D maximum intensity projection along the normal to the ring plane (Fiji/Image/Stacks/3D_project) in each time point. As the ring plane was often tilted to the X-Y plane, the projection angle was determined manually for each ring prior to the projection. The shape of the ring at each time point was extracted from 2D projections using segmentation via auto-thresholding by Otsu (Fiji/Image/Adjust/Thresholding) and subsequent skeletonization of the resulting mask (Fiji/Process/Binary/Skeletonize). The centres of skeleton pixels were defined as skeleton points.</p><p>Further processing of ring skeletons was done in Matlab. In order to measure the local curvature of the ring skeleton at the point-of-interest (POI), two skeleton points that were 10 pixel points (2 µm apart along the skeleton) away from the POI in clockwise and counter-clockwise directions were assigned. Next, a circle with radius R was fitted to these three points. The local curvature at the POI was then derived as the inverse of the radius of that circle (1/radius). For representation in figures, the curvature was smoothened over 10 skeleton points.</p></sec><sec id="s3-9"><title>Purification of the recombinant LifeAct-GFP fusion protein</title><p>Expression of GST-LifeAct-GFP was induced in <italic>E. coli</italic> BL21 (DE3-pLysS) (Promega) using 0.5 mM IPTG at 30°C for 4 hr.

The first decision letter after peer review is shown below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Curvature-Induced Expulsion of Actomyosin Bundles During Cytokinetic Ring Contraction&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Richard Losick as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Michael Glotzer (Reviewer #1).</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic> at this point.</p><p>Although both reviewers and the reviewing editor found your work of interest, they were unable to come to a conclusion until your data was better quantified. In particular we agree that a major flaw is the lack of a quantitative analysis of the relationship of the extruded actin to the ring actin.</p><p>We do note that this is a report, describing the initial finding of an exciting new mechanism for ring disassembly. Therefore, while the primary conclusions must be rigorously established, I think that some of the less central points could be stated less strongly and strengthened in future publications.</p><p>Therefore, I would recommend that you follow the suggestions of the reviewers to further quantify your work. If you feel that this still supports your conclusions, <italic>eLife</italic> would be happy to see a new manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>This interesting report presents strong evidence that under some conditions, bundles of actin are expelled by the contractile ring during constriction, rather than being depolymerized in place. The expulsion of actin bundles is more prominent as constriction occurs, can be seen in cell ghosts, and mechanical perturbations reveal that this specifically occurs at regions of high local curvature. The images provided are striking and the data are well quantified. These findings will be of interest for the readership of <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>1) While the authors do demonstrate this phenomenon in a wide variety of contexts including two different <italic>Schizosaccharomyces</italic> species, different labels, intact cells, spheroplasts, cell ghosts, upon seeing these images it is striking that this was not seen previously in all the extensive work on <italic>S. pombe</italic> cytokinesis, particularly as investigators have been visualizing cytokinesis en face quite frequently in recent years. Indeed, en face views with a similar/identical label (Rlc1) does not appear to show this expulsion behavior (PMID 25355954). In addition, some, but not all the experiments in this paper have been performed with LifeAct which can induce filament bundling. To ensure that this phenomenon is general and robust and intrinsic to the contractile ring, it would be important to visualize evidence of this behavior in intact cells. It would be best to fix LifeAct-GFP, Rlc1-GFP, and unlabeled cells of both <italic>S. pombe</italic> and <italic>S. japonicus</italic> and stain them with phalloidin. It would be critical to detect these extruded filaments in cells that do not express a fluorescent protein (performing the experiment with the FP will allow the authors to assess that these bundles can be preserved and labeled).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>It is well-established that the cytokinetic ring closes via actomyosin dynamics. A more poorly understood aspect of ring ingression is that, as its diameter decreases, ring components are likely eliminated to allow continued contraction. In this manuscript, Huang et al. propose that actin and myosin containing filaments can be continuously expulsed from the contractile ring contributing to the completion of cytokinesis in two yeast species. Since the authors only observe such filaments in late stages of cytokinesis they suggest that this represents a separate phase during cytokinesis where filament expulsion promotes ring closure. Furthermore, the authors claim that this expulsion phenomenon is dependent on changes in cell curvature and is driven by mechanical forces generated by high curvature independent of cytoplasmic regulators or polymerization driven elongation of these filaments.</p><p>While the model proposed by the authors is intriguing and has the potential to expand our understanding of the mechanism of contractile ring closure, in its current form, the manuscript fails to support many of the authors' assertions and requires significant revisions and improvements before being suitable for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>In general, much of the data are poorly annotated in the figure, figure legend, text, or all three places. Some data also appear to be contradictory to the conclusion drawn by the authors or lacking quantification to support the conclusions. The following is a list of comments in chronological order. I cannot predict whether a revision will be suitable for publication before these points are addressed.</p><p>1) Many graphs presented in this manuscript contain the axis label relative intensity (AU) without any mention of what the intensity is normalized to. Typically, when relative values are shown in a graph, one of the data sets presented has the average of 1, and thus indicates that it is the reference point. This is not the case for any of the graphs (non-exhaustive list of figures affected: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). The notation of figures, in general, needs to be improved. &quot;B.r. and s.r.&quot; are not appropriate abbreviations – writing out &quot;big and small&quot; would be adequate and far less cumbersome for the reader. The protein imaged should always be part of the image notation. Spectrum bars need to be annotated on the figure.</p><p>2) The data presented in the top and bottom panels of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref> are not consistent. The bottom panel shows drastic reduction in fluorescence in the ring over time while levels of ring fluorescence in the top seems to change very little. Is the top series saturated? Which one is representative of properly imaged ring dynamics?</p><p>3) What is the difference between <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C and 1F</xref>? 1C shows a 3-fold decrease in fluorescence intensity while the intensities in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref> are barely statistically significantly different. (How is total actin detected and distinguished from actin in the ring in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>?) In fact, claiming that there is a significant difference between small and large rings in 1F is tenuous at best since the difference is minimal and could well be explained by a few outlying data points.</p><p>4) The following conclusion is not supported by the data presented: &quot;Cdc8p, IQGAP protein Rng2p, and F-BAR protein Cdc15p were also present in actin bundles associated with contracting rings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1G</xref>), which suggested that the bundles associated with contracting actomyosin rings signified disassembly of the entire ring as a single unit&quot;. All that is shown is that the bundles contain these components. Whether they have been part of a disassembling ring or just associated with filaments after expulsion is not clear. Along the same line, the authors observe bi-directional movement of myosin in expulsed bundles. Is this behavior observed in the ring? If not, wouldn't this suggest that these filaments are structurally distinct from filaments in the ring?</p><p>5) The biphasic nature of ring closure speed appears to be a minor, poorly substantiated observation, since it is entirely possible that expulsion starts to happen earlier but that the filaments are short and therefore not detectable. The really interesting observation in my opinion is the relationship between ring perimeter and bundle length. There appears to be a pretty good correlation in phase 2, suggesting that expulsion is a compensatory mechanism for reduction in ring size. However, the quantification of this in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref> is confusing and contradictory. What are the units in the graphs? It appears that total length of bundles is larger than ring perimeter (max value 58 vs. 28) but T.I. + perimeter is smaller than perimeter alone? In addition, biphasic behavior of ring intensity (constant in phase 1, decreasing in phase 2), would further substantiate this biphasic concept.</p><p>6) The following statement is not supported by the data presented &quot;These experiments showed that loss of function of actomyosin ring proteins tested did not affect the timing or the ability of these cells to expel actomyosin bundles during ring contraction&quot;. All that is shown are two pictures for each condition showing that small rings have bundles but no quantification is provided. All one can conclude from this is that neither of those proteins is essential for formation of these bundles. What about the kinetics, number of bundle, length or dynamics? Given the amount of redundancy in regulating cytokinesis, it would not be surprising if any one perturbation does not completely abolish the formation of bundles but the protein in question may still contribute to bundle formation and dynamics.</p><p>7) When making cell ghosts it appears that rlc1p-gfp is no longer associated with actin bundles. Is this just not evident from the picture shown or does this mean that myosin is lost from the bundle?</p><p>8) How is total actin intensity measured in cell ghost experiments? Just the sum of intensities on ring and filaments or total fluorescence in entire field of view? I presume Cdc8p is a loading control for western blots but this needs to be explicitly stated in the text. What is the quantification of the western blot comparing? Supernatant to pellet levels, loading control to actin monomers, filaments? It appears that most actin in the preparation is monomeric so that a significant reduction in filamentous actin may not be easily detected by changes in monomeric actin.</p><p>9) The authors claim that expulsion depends on ring curvature in non-compressed cells The data presented are insufficient to support this conclusion. All I see in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> is a picture. No quantitative data except for an arbitrary value of 68% of something, with no explanation of what is considered high curvature. In fact, based on the data presented it would be reasonable to conclude that high curvature is not essential for expulsion since a large fraction of filaments form in regions of &quot;low&quot; curvature (32%). In fact, maximum expulsion seems to occur at intermediate curvatures not at high curvature and small rings with high curvature appear to have fewer expulsion events.</p><p>10) The description of experimental details in the Materials and methods section needs significant revision. Just one example: &quot;Unless specified otherwise, all spinning-disk images were shown by 2D maximum/sum intensity projections.&quot; Which one is it? There is a critical difference between sum and max projections. What do the authors mean by 2D projection? Do they mean Z-projection?</p><p>[Editors’ note: what now follows is the decision letter after the authors submitted for further consideration.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Curvature-Induced Expulsion of Actomyosin Bundles During Cytokinetic Ring Contraction&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.

Indeed, en face views with a similar/identical label (Rlc1) does not appear to show this expulsion behavior (PMID 25355954). In addition, some, but not all the experiments in this paper have been performed with LifeAct which can induce filament bundling. To ensure that this phenomenon is general and robust and intrinsic to the contractile ring, it would be important to visualize evidence of this behavior in intact cells. It would be best to fix LifeAct-GFP, Rlc1-GFP, and unlabeled cells of both S. pombe and S. japonicus and stain them with phalloidin. It would be critical to detect these extruded filaments in cells that do not express a fluorescent protein (performing the experiment with the FP will allow the authors to assess that these bundles can be preserved and labeled).</italic> </p><p>We agree with reviewer 1 that bundle expulsion that we report here was not obvious in the Fred Chang lab paper (Zhou et al:PMID 25355954). However, recently (while our paper was under review / revision) a similar expulsion phenomenon was noticed in <italic>S. pombe</italic> cells in a paper from Daniel Riveline’s group (Wollrab et al:PMID 27363521), although they did not characterize this bundle expulsion phenomenon. Rather they focused on a different aspect of actomyosin ring dynamics.</p><p>As suggested by reviewer 1, we performed formaldehyde fixation of untagged wild type cells and spheroplasts and wild-type cells and spheroplasts expressing LifeAct- GFP or Rlc1p-GFP in both <italic>S. japonicus</italic> and <italic>S. pombe</italic> (to ensure that the ring- associated bundles observed in our study was not an artifact of LifeAct-GFP or Rlc1p-GFP). After staining the actin structures with Rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin in these fixed samples, we were able to observe actin bundles associated with contracting actomyosin rings, including in untagged wild type cells. We have included these images in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A and 1B</xref>.

Typically, when relative values are shown in a graph, one of the data sets presented has the average of 1, and thus indicates that it is the reference point. This is not the case for any of the graphs (non-exhaustive list of figures affected: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). The notation of figures, in general, needs to be improved. &quot;B.r. and s.r.&quot; are not appropriate abbreviations – writing out &quot;big and small&quot; would be adequate and far less cumbersome for the reader. The protein imaged should always be part of the image notation. Spectrum bars need to be annotated on the figure.</italic> </p><p>We thank reviewer 2 for pointing out the incorrect axis label. This is unfortunately a mistake on our part in choosing the incorrect terminology. The referee is right in that these are not relative units, but they are the raw intensity of fluorescence of the proteins described. We have replaced all incorrect axis labels by showing the identity of the protein measured (e.g. actin intensity). All the micrographs are labeled with the protein being imaged and spectrum / calibration bars have also been included in the micrographs in the current manuscript. Abbreviations “b.r. and s.r.” have been replaced by “large and small”, as suggested.</p><p><italic>2) The data presented in the top and bottom panels of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref> are not consistent. The bottom panel shows drastic reduction in fluorescence in the ring over time while levels of ring fluorescence in the top seems to change very little. Is the top series saturated? Which one is representative of properly imaged ring dynamics?</italic> </p><p>The inconsistency of top and bottom panels in the previous <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref> was due to an unfortunate and erroneous swap of the bleach corrected panel with a bleach-uncorrected panel (we generated both versions during preparation of the manuscript). We now show the appropriate bleach corrected micrographs in the top and bottom panels that reveals the phenomenon of bundle expulsion even better than in the original manuscript (shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref> in the revised manuscript).</p><p><italic>3) What is the difference between <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C and 1F</xref>? 1C shows a 3-fold decrease in fluorescence intensity while the intensities in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref> are barely statistically significantly different. (How is total actin detected and distinguished from actin in the ring in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>?)

The previous <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref> showed the combined actin intensity (total actin) from rings and associated bundles. Please note that the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref> and 1F are now <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1H</xref> and 1I in the current manuscript.</p><p>To measure the sum actin fluorescence intensity, the permeabilized spheroplasts were stained with CF633-phalloidin to label the actin structures.

These details are provided in the corresponding figure legend.</p><p>In the previous <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref> we were not claiming any difference between total actin in large and small rings. Rather, based on the statistics presented, we were claiming that they were of comparable intensity (as the referee agrees from his/her own analysis). Our apologies that this was described confusingly. This has been clearly rewritten now.</p><p><italic>4) The following conclusion is not supported by the data presented: &quot;Cdc8p, IQGAP protein Rng2p, and F-BAR protein Cdc15p were also present in actin bundles associated with contracting rings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1G</xref>), which suggested that the bundles associated with contracting actomyosin rings signified disassembly of the entire ring as a single unit&quot;.

If not, wouldn't this suggest that these filaments are structurally distinct from filaments in the ring?</italic> </p><p>We have performed time-lapse microscopy to document the dynamics of two cytokinetic ring proteins: GFP-Rng2p and Cdc15p-GFP (in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), in addition to Rlc1p-GFP, which was presented in the original submission. Consistent with our original description from single images, these proteins were found to be associated with the expelling / expelled bundle in contracting rings using time-lapse microscopy (presented in the revised manuscript, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Despite this, we have toned down the statement (for reasons described in the response to #7 below) that “the bundles associated with contracting actomyosin rings signified disassembly of the entire ring as a single unit”, by stating that several cytokinetic ring proteins associate with expelling / expelled bundles in living cells and discussed this in the manuscript (Results and Discussion, tenth paragraph).</p><p>We have removed the data showing bi-directional movements of Rlc1p-GFP on expelled bundles as, in our opinion, it is less central to our study describing bundle expulsion. This is partly also due to the suggestion from the editors to remove data not central to the main point of our manuscript. However, we have been able to detect clusters moving in the ring, although this point has been better described in a recent paper from Daniel Riveline and colleagues that was published (Woolrab et al; PMID 27363521) while our paper was under review/revision.</p><p><italic>5) The biphasic nature of ring closure speed appears to be a minor, poorly substantiated observation, since it is entirely possible that expulsion starts to happen earlier but that the filaments are short and therefore not detectable.

The graphs have been updated with the appropriate units (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). We show individual graphs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> without insets so that data points are clearer.</p><p>Thanks to Reviewer 2 for pointing out the confusing data points, i.e. total bundle length + ring perimeter in contracted rings is smaller than the initial ring perimeter. We investigated the graph again, and realized that the upper limit for y-axis (inset of 3<sup>rd</sup> graph in our previously submitted manuscript) was unfortunately set at a lower value erroneously, which eliminated some of the important points. We have rectified this mistake and the revised graph fully supports the conclusions that we have made (Figure 3Ev).</p><p><italic>6) The following statement is not supported by the data presented &quot;These experiments showed that loss of function of actomyosin ring proteins tested did not affect the timing or the ability of these cells to expel actomyosin bundles during ring contraction&quot;.

Also, as pointed out by the referee, while our data are suggestive they are not conclusive, which requires generation of a large number of double and triple mutants in <italic>S. pombe</italic>, and crucially generation of many single mutants in <italic>S. japonicus</italic>, all of which are beyond the scope of this study.</p><p><italic>7) When making cell ghosts it appears that rlc1p-gfp is no longer associated with actin bundles. Is this just not evident from the picture shown or does this mean that myosin is lost from the bundle?</italic> </p><p>We have been able to detect Rlc1p, Cdc15p, Rng2p, and F-actin in expelled bundles in cells and spheroplasts, but only F-actin was clearly detected in expelled bundles in cell ghosts. Although the reasons for this are presently unclear, it is likely that ring proteins undergo constant turnover in expelled actin bundles (as they do in actomyosin rings) in cells and spheroplasts in which a continuous supply of a molecularly crowded cytosol is available, whereas this is not available in cell ghosts. Alternatively, the molecular crowding itself may help retain ring proteins on actin bundles whereas in the absence of such crowding, ring proteins may be lost from actin bundles. We have discussed this in the revised manuscript (Results and Discussion, eleventh paragraph).</p><p><italic>8) How is total actin intensity measured in cell ghost experiments? Just the sum of intensities on ring and filaments or total fluorescence in entire field of view? I presume Cdc8p is a loading control for western blots but this needs to be explicitly stated in the text. What is the quantification of the western blot comparing? Supernatant to pellet levels, loading control to actin monomers, filaments? It appears that most actin in the preparation is monomeric so that a significant reduction in filamentous actin may not be easily detected by changes in monomeric actin.</italic> </p><p>To measure the sum actin fluorescence intensity in cell ghosts, they were stained with CF633-phalloidin to label the actin structures.

Cdc8p was not used as a loading control. We have changed the axis labeling to “supernatant fraction”. This fraction is calculated by dividing the protein band intensity of supernatant lanes to the sum intensity of the bands of supernatant lanes and pellet lanes (fraction = supernatant intensity / (supernatant intensity + pellet intensity). We have expanded the descriptions of protein band intensity quantification in the Materials and methods section of the current manuscript.</p><p><italic>9) The authors claim that expulsion depends on ring curvature in non-compressed cells The data presented are insufficient to support this conclusion. All I see in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> is a picture. No quantitative data except for an arbitrary value of 68% of something, with no explanation of what is considered high curvature. In fact, based on the data presented it would be reasonable to conclude that high curvature is not essential for expulsion since a large fraction of filaments form in regions of &quot;low&quot; curvature (32%). In fact, maximum expulsion seems to occur at intermediate curvatures not at high curvature and small rings with high curvature appear to have fewer expulsion events.</italic> </p><p>The data that support the conclusion that expulsion depends on ring curvature was/is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> in the original and revised manuscript. In the representative movie shown (n = 11) in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, expelled bundles become visible from ~ the 60-second time point, and with progression of time and increasing curvature the expelled bundle number increases. We find that although rings can start with curvatures (1/radius) of even smaller than 0.4 µm<sub>-1</sub> (translates to a ring diameter of &gt; 5 µm in spheroplasts), the mean curvature at which bundles begin to be expelled is ~ 1.1 µm<sub>-1</sub> (translates to a ring diameter of ~ 2 µm). Given that bundle expulsion is only observed after a significant reduction in ring diameter, we believe our data strongly support the view that bundle expulsion in uncompressed rings is promoted by increased curvature. We have then tested this hypothesis with the spheroplast compression experiment.</p><p>Our apologies for the confusing description of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>. In this panel we are looking at a partially contracted ring in a cell ghost. Rings in cell ghosts do not undergo symmetric contraction. Rather, they undergo irregular contraction with regions of sharp edges. What we were indicating in this figure was that, even within a curved and contracted ring in a cell ghost ~ 68% of actin bundles are expelled from regions where the ring is bent. In other words, <italic>the entire ring has an increased curvature</italic>, due to partial contraction, but nearly 68% of the cables are found preferentially in regions in which the rings are bent, which means that the rings have a further increased local curvature. We were unable to perform curvature analysis on contracting isolated rings in cell ghosts because the rings do not contract on a flat x-y plane. The poor z-resolution affects the accuracy of curvature analysis. We took precaution not to over-estimate the number, thus, the 68% is a conservative value of this quantification.</p><p>Together, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>, establish that bundle expulsion is promoted by increased ring curvature even in uncompressed cells.</p><p><italic>10) The description of experimental details in the Materials and methods section needs significant revision. Just one example: &quot;Unless specified otherwise, all spinning-disk images were shown by 2D maximum/sum intensity projections.&quot; Which one is it? There is a critical difference between sum and max projections. What do the authors mean by 2D projection? Do they mean Z-projection?</italic> </p><p>We fully appreciate that maximum intensity and sum intensity projections are very different. Our apologies for not making this point clear in the original manuscript. This has been fully rectified in the revised manuscript. We have clearly stated whether an image shows a maximum intensity or sum intensity in the Methods section, which clarifies the panels in which maximum intensity was used and those in which sum intensity was used. The referee is right in that we are using Z- projection to show a 2-dimensional image in the X-Y plane. This has now been corrected to “projected along the Z-axis”.</p><p>[Editors' note: the author responses to the re-review follow.]</p><p><italic>The authors have made significant changes to their manuscript that documents that during cytokinesis actin bundles with its associated binding proteins are expelled from the constricting contractile ring, particularly as it reaches small diameters.

Since the goal of the experiment suggested by reviewer 1 was to estimate the fraction of the ring-associated actin lost through bundle expulsion, an initial diameter of ~ 3.5 µm seemed like a good starting point. We therefore do not believe the reported calculations are misleading. As to the issue of whether actin is also lost through other “classical” disassembly pathways, this is an interesting and open question. Further analysis, using better probes for the actin cytoskeleton will be required to fully address this possibility.</p><p>As suggested by this reviewer, we have made a mention of these considerations in the revised manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
