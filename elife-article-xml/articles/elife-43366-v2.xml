wide range of physiological processes by enabling the direct intercellular electrical and chemical coupling. However, the in vivo distribution and function of gap junctions remain poorly understood, partly due to the lack of non-invasive tools with both cell-type specificity and high spatiotemporal resolution. Here, we developed PARIS (<underline>p</underline>airing <underline>a</underline>ctuators and <underline>r</underline>eceivers to optically <underline>is</underline>olate gap junctions), a new fully genetically encoded tool for measuring the cell-specific gap junctional coupling (GJC). PARIS successfully enabled monitoring of GJC in several cultured cell lines under physiologically relevant conditions and in distinct genetically defined neurons in <italic>Drosophila</italic> brain, with ~10 s temporal resolution and sub-cellular spatial resolution. These results demonstrate that PARIS is a robust, highly sensitive tool for mapping functional gap junctions and study their regulation in both health and disease.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43366.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>For the tissues and organs of our bodies to work properly, the cells within them need to communicate with each other. One important part of cellular communication is the movement of signals – usually small molecules or ions – directly from one cell to another. This happens via structures called gap junctions, a type of sealed ‘channel’ that connects two cells.</p><p>Gap junctions are found throughout the body, but investigating their precise roles in health and disease has been difficult. This is due to problems with the tools available to detect and monitor gap junctions. Some are simply harmful to cells, while others cannot be restricted to specific cell populations within a tissue. This lack of specificity makes it difficult to study gap junctions in the brain, where it is important to understand the connectivity patterns between distinct types of nerve cells. Wu et al. wanted to develop a new, non-harmful method to track gap junctions in distinct groups of cells within living tissues.</p><p>To do this, Wu et al. devised PARIS, a two-part, genetically encoded system. The first part comprises a light-sensitive molecular ‘pump’, which can only be turned on by shining a laser onto the cell of interest. When the pump is active, it transports hydrogen ions out of the cell. The second part of the system is a fluorescent sensor, present inside ‘receiving’ cells, which responds to the outcoming hydrogen ions (small enough to pass through gap junctions). If an illuminated ‘signaling’ cell is connected via gap junctions to cells containing the fluorescent sensor, they will light up within seconds, but other cells not connected through gap junctions will not.</p><p>The researchers first tested PARIS in cultured human and rat cells that had been genetically engineered to produce both components of the system. The experiments confirmed that PARIS could both detect networks of gap junctions in healthy cells and reveal when these networks had been disrupted, for instance by drugs or genetic mutations. Experiments using fruit flies demonstrated that PARIS was stable in living tissue and could also map the gap junctions connecting specific groups of nerve cells.</p><p>PARIS is a valuable addition to the toolbox available to study cell communication. In the future, it could help increase our understanding of diseases characterized by defective gap junctions, such as seizures, cardiac irregularities, and even some cancers.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>optogenetics</kwd><kwd>gap junctions</kwd><kwd>cardiomyocytes</kwd><kwd>electrical synapses</kwd><kwd>olfactory system</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31371442</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Yulong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31671118</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Yulong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31630035</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Shi-Qiang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002855</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2015CB856402</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Yulong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002855</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2016YFA0500401</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Shi-Qiang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Beijing Brain Initiative</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Z181100001518004</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Yulong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>As the first fully genetically encoded method, PARIS allows cell-specific, long-term, repeated measurements of gap junctional coupling with high spatiotemporal resolution, facilitating its study in both health and disease.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Gap junctions are intercellular channels that are expressed in virtually all tissue types in both vertebrates and invertebrates. They allow direct transfer of small molecules such as ions, metabolites and second messengers between connected cells, thereby playing essential roles in various physiological processes, including embryo development, metabolic coordination of avascular organs, tissue homeostasis and synchronizing electrical activity in excitable tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bennett and Zukin, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kumar and Gilula, 1996</xref>). Defects of gap junction function are linked with a wide array of diseases, including myocardial infarction, hearing loss and hypomyelinating disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jongsma and Wilders, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Laird, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Söhl et al., 2005</xref>). Studying gap junction coupling (GJC) under physiological or disease conditions in complex systems such as the nervous system requires a non-invasive method with both cell-type specificity and high spatiotemporal resolution. Current methods used to monitor GJC include paired electrophysiological recordings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bennett et al., 1963</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Furshpan and Potter, 1959</xref>), dye microinjection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Stewart, 1978</xref>), fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wade et al., 1986</xref>), and local activation of molecular fluorescent probes (LAMP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dakin et al., 2005</xref>), all of which are either invasive and/or lack cell-type specificity, thus limiting their use in heterogeneous tissues. Recently, hybrid approaches have been developed in which genetically encoded hydrolytic enzymes or promiscuous transporters are used to introduce small molecule substrates or peptides tagged with a fluorescent label in specific cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Qiao and Sanes, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tian et al., 2012</xref>). Although these methods might provide cell-type-specific investigation of GJC, the requirement of exogenous substrate and the background generated by endogenous enzymes or transporters still make them difficult to apply in vivo. In addition, dye diffusion is an irreversible process and thus these methods are difficult to be applied to examine the same gap junctions repeatedly in order to measure their dynamics, regulations and plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dong et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>To overcome these limitations, we developed an all-optical approach named PARIS (<underline>p</underline>airing <underline>a</underline>ctuators and <underline>r</underline>eceivers to optically <underline>is</underline>olate gap junctions) in which we express an optically controlled actuator in one cell, to generate an electrochemical gradient of specific molecules between two connected cells, and a fluorescent receiver in the adjacent cell, to detect the movement of the molecules across the gap junctions. GJC between the actuator cell (i.e. expressing actuators) and the receiver cell (i.e. expressing receivers) is detected by a fluorescence increase in the receiver following the optical activation of the actuator (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43366.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The principle behind PARIS and proof-of-concept in cultured cells by PARIS based on ArchT and pHluorin.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic diagram depicting the principle and process of PARIS.

Our first step was to test whether the actuator/receiver pair can generate a cell-autonomous signal. We found that, when co-expressed in HEK293T cells (i.e. in the <italic>cis</italic> configuration), neither a light-activated cGMP cyclase BeCylOp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gao et al., 2015</xref>) paired with a cGMP sensor FlincG3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bhargava et al., 2013</xref>) nor the red shifted channelrhodopsin CsChrimson (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Klapoetke et al., 2014</xref>) paired with a sensitive Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator GCaMP6s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2013</xref>) could generate detectable light-induced signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, when we co-expressed a light-gated outward proton pump ArchT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Han et al., 2011</xref>) and a pH-sensitive green fluorescent protein pHluorin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Miesenböck et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sankaranarayanan et al., 2000</xref>) in HEK293T cells, a 4 s laser illumination at 561 nm elicited a robust increase in pHluorin fluorescence, with the membrane-targeted pHluorin (pHluorinCAAX) producing a larger change in fluorescence than the cytosolic pHluorin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A,B</xref>). No light-induced change in fluorescence was observed in cells that co-expressing pHluorinCAAX and the deficient proton-pump ArchTD95N (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kralj et al., 2011</xref>), or in cells that only express pHluorinCAAX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A,B</xref>). Furthermore, the evoked response is dependent on both the duration and the power of the activating light (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C–F</xref>).

When ArchT and pHluorin were separately expressed in neighboring cells (i.e. in the <italic>trans</italic> configuration, see Materials and methods; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B1</xref>), a brief photoactivation of ArchT in the actuator cells (4 s,~0.5 mW, indicated by the yellow circle in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B2</xref>) faithfully induced a ~ 4.3% ∆F/F<sub>0</sub> increase in pHluorinCAAX fluorescence in the neighboring receiver cells whereas non-adjacent pHluorinCAAX-expressing cells had no measurable change in fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1B2–B3</xref>). Application of carbenoxolone (CBX, 100 μM) which blocks gap junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Connors, 2012</xref>) significantly decreased the light-induced PARIS signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), confirming that the signal measured in receiver cells is mediated by GJC. Similar to autonomous signals, increasing the duration of the illumination pulse from 1 s to 20 s incrementally increased the PARIS response from ~2% to~20% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–E</xref>).

Next, we further validated PARIS by patch-clamping the receiver cell in order to record the gap junction-mediated current induced by activating the actuator cell using a laser pulse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B1</xref>). Applying increasingly stronger light pulses to the actuator cell yielded time-locked currents in the receiver cell that were blocked by CBX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B2,D2</xref>).

Quantification of the group data showed that the CBX inhibition of GJC was independent from the approaches used to activate the actuator cell (by light or voltage) and from the signals measured in the receiver cell (pHluorinCAAX fluorescence or currents) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). In addition, we performed a head-to-head comparison between PARIS and FRAP—a dye diffusion based methods which detects the gap junction mediated fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>).

We performed PARIS in HeLa cells, which do not express measurable levels of endogenous Cxs (Elfgang et al., 1995).

We show that PARIS can be readily adapted for use in both in vitro and ex vivo preparations, including cultured cell lines, primary cardiomyocytes, and transgenic flies. We validated that this system specifically reports functional gap junctions using a variety of electrophysiological, pharmacological, and genetic approaches. By focusing on defined sets of neurons in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> olfactory system, we show that as the first completely genetically encoded method, PARIS can be applied to repeatedly probe electrical synapses in distinct, genetically tractable neurons with high temporal resolution (on the order of ~10 s) and high spatial resolution.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Choice of the actuator and receiver</title><p>We initially screened three pairs of actuators/receivers, namely ArchT/pHluorin, BeCylOp/FlincG3 and CsChrimson/GCaMP6s. The latter two pairs failed to function in cis to generate receiver responses by activating the actuator (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). For the cGMP based pair, we have also performed the <italic>cis</italic> experiments in the presence of PDE inhibitor IBMX that prevented the cGMP hydrolyzation and still observed no signal; meanwhile FlincG did response to exogenous application of cGMP (data not shown). Thus, one possible explanation for the absence of the autonomous signal is that light activation of BeCylOp generated limited cGMP that could not induce FlincG3 (EC<sub>50</sub> = 0.89 μM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bhargava et al., 2013</xref>) response. For the pair with CsChrimson, a non-selective cation channel allows not only Ca<sup>2+</sup> but also other cations to pass the channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Klapoetke et al., 2014</xref>), we deduce the photoactivation induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx in the CsChrimson expressing HEK293T cells was still under the detection limit of GCaMP6s. Indeed, we found CsChrimson/GCaMP6s could function in cis to generate cell autonomous signals in cultured hippocampus neurons that endogenously express voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel to allow further Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx (data not shown).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Advantages of PARIS over existing techniques</title><p>First, PARIS relies solely on light and therefore is virtually non-invasive compared with existing methods including paired-recording (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bennett et al., 1963</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Furshpan and Potter, 1959</xref>), dye microinjection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Stewart, 1978</xref>) and scrape loading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">el-Fouly et al., 1987</xref>). In addition, given that the activation of the actuator can be specific to subcellular resolution, PARIS can provide spatial information of the functional gap junctions, as shown by our ability to functionally map gap junctions formed at dendrite-dendrite contacts in AL but not at axon-axon contacts in LH between ePNs and iPNs in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> olfactory system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), while such resolution cannot be easily achieved by any of the previously existed method.</p><p>With respect to those relatively non-invasive methods which rely on the diffusion of small fluorescent dyes across gap junctions such as FRAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wade et al., 1986</xref>) and LAMP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dakin et al., 2005</xref>), a significant advantage of PARIS is that it is fully reversible and does not require the delivery of exogenous dyes. PARIS may serve as a robust tool for screening existing and newly developed gap junction blockers and/or modulators, including clinically relevant compounds such as inhibitors of PKC signaling. In addition, PARIS could possibly be applied to study the dynamic regulation of gap junctions in vivo, such as the formation and break of gap junction connections during brain development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arumugam et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>Moreover, the actuator and receiver proteins in PARIS are both genetically encoded. Recently, several innovative hybrid approaches were developed to monitor gap junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kang and Baker, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Qiao and Sanes, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tian et al., 2012</xref>). Using a channel/transporter/enzyme-dependent step for the transfer of small molecules, these approaches can in principle achieve genetic specificity in terms of targeting defined cells. In practice, however, these methods require the addition of an exogenous substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Qiao and Sanes, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tian et al., 2012</xref>) or a patch electrode to establish an electrochemical gradient between connected cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kang and Baker, 2016</xref>), thereby limiting their application, particularly in vivo. In contrast, all the components in PARIS are genetically encoded by relatively small genes, vastly increasing the range of cell types in which they can be selectively expressed. For example, we show that the PARIS proteins can be introduced using transfection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>), virus-mediated expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), and ex vivo transgenic labeling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4 and 5</xref>). Given that similar transgenic tools are available for higher organisms, including mammals, PARIS can easily be adapted to other preparations and animal models, including the highly complex mammalian nervous system. In mammalian systems and model organisms in which transgenic techniques are currently unavailable or impractical, recombinant viruses such as lentiviruses, retroviruses, and adeno-associated viruses can be conveniently packaged with these genetic components and used to infect the appropriate target cells.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Limitations of PARIS</title><p>In most animal cells, intracellular pH is believed to be tightly regulated for optimal biochemical reactions; thus, even a small change in intracellular pH is rapidly restored to a set point by buffers and proton exchangers/transporters located on the membrane of cells or intracellular organelles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hoffmann and Simonsen, 1989</xref>). This robust system for maintaining pH homeostasis enabled us to repeatedly elicit a PARIS signal in both cultured cells and transgenic animals. One caveat to our approach may be the ability of pH to regulate gap junction activity during PARIS. The uncoupling effect of acidic intracellular pH on GJC has long been described across different Cx-consisted gap junctions in vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Peracchia, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Turin and Warner, 1977</xref>) and different innexin-consisted gap junctions in invertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Giaume et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Obaid et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Stergiopoulos et al., 1999</xref>), while alkalization was reported to increase the junctional conductance and the total number of opened channels in gap junction plagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Palacios-Prado et al., 2010</xref>). For the mostly wide expressed Cx43 channels, it has a pKa of ~6.7 in oocytes and fully closed when pH is under 6.4 while fully open when pH is above 7.2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Stergiopoulos et al., 1999</xref>), which enables PARIS measurement to reveal the GJC mediated by Cx43. However, there is one type of gap junctions that has been reported to be sensitive to alkalization—Cx36 consisted gap junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">González-Nieto et al., 2008</xref>). Based on the reported pH-conductance curve, the junctional conductance decreased to 50% when pH increased 0.8 unit from 7.2 to 8. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplements 4</xref> and 0.1-unit pH increase from 7.35 to 7.45 was enough to induce PARIS signal. So PARIS is still possible in reporting Cx36 consisted GJC under proper activation of the actuator. Even though we conclude that PARIS induced pH fluctuation is controllable and transient, one should still be cautious to the possible modification towards gap junctions as well as cell physiology. For the long-time measurements, either reduce the power or shorten the time of laser illumination, meanwhile increase the interval between each measurement should be helpful to decrease the pH influence. An even more sensitive pH indicator could help to minimize the pH influence as well.</p><p>As we have demonstrated, PARIS is powerful as a genetic tool to map gap junction connections between targeted neurons in the complex central nervous system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4 and 5</xref>). To map unknown gap junctions, firstly we need anatomic information about the two group of cells that we concern to make sure they are spatially contacted, which could be achieved by immunostaining or EM. As the intensive efforts have been or being made to create whole brain connectomes from <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jarrell et al., 2012</xref>), <italic>Drosophila</italic> (FlyEM project, Janelia Campus Research) to zebra fish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hildebrand et al., 2017</xref>) and mice (Allen Mouse Brain Connectivity Atlas), PARIS could utilize these information and databases and possibly help creating electrical connectome.</p><p>PARIS requires the exclusive expression of the actuator and receiver in different cells. Such genetic tools specifically labeling two distinct groups of cells from different cell types or two subgroups from one cell type, might not be accessible in mammals. However, this limitation can be overcome by the intersectional non-overlapping expression of the actuator and receiver, for example using flp-out system. By fusing the receiver with a flippase, the frt sequence flanked actuator would not express in the presence of the receiver. Meanwhile the receiver and the actuator can both designed to be turned on in a cre-dependent manner. This design could make PARIS more versatile in detecting GJC between specific cells labeled by cre-lines without the contamination of the autonomous signal.</p><p>Lastly, to protect against false negatives of PARIS, a control experiment in the cis configuration is recommended in different customized preparations and context to ensure the function of the actuators and help to optimize the expression level of actuators/receivers as well as the photostimulation parameters accordingly; Meanwhile, PARIS signals alone from cells connected by potential unknown gap junctions should not be interpreted as definitive without confirmation from pharmacology, genetic interventions or a complementary method.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Future perspectives</title><p>Future refinements to PARIS include the use of the new actuators we have screened combining a receiver with higher pH sensitivity, thereby increasing both the signal-to-noise ratio and temporal resolution, allowing for an even wider range of in vitro and in vivo applications. Finally, the use of additional spectrally non-overlapping pairs of proton-related actuators and receivers, as well as developing actuator-receiver pairs that transport and detect other gap junction‒permeable small molecules, may provide the opportunity to detect gap junctions between multiple cell types and/or structures.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent <break/>(<italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>)</td><td valign="top">GH146-Gal4</td><td valign="top">Liqun Luo lab</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/BDSC_30026">BDSC_30026</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent <break/>(<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td valign="top">GH146-QF</td><td valign="top">Liqun Luo lab</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/BDSC_30015">BDSC_30015</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent <break/>(<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td valign="top">GH298-Gal4</td><td valign="top">Liqun Luo lab</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/BDSC_37294">BDSC_37294</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent <break/>(<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Krasavietz-Gal4</td><td valign="top">Donggen Luo lab</td><td valign="top">flybaseID#_ <break/>FBti0027494</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent <break/>(<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td valign="top">ShakB<sup>2</sup></td><td valign="top">Donggen Luo lab</td><td valign="top">flybaseID#_ <break/>FBal0015575</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent <break/>(<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Mz699-Gal4</td><td valign="top">Liqun Luo lab</td><td valign="top">flybaseID#_ <break/>FBti0007260</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent <break/>(<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Repo-Gal4</td><td valign="top">Yi Rao lab</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/BDSC_7415">BDSC_7415</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent <break/>(<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td valign="top">MB247-Gal4</td><td valign="top">Yi Rao lab</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/BDSC_64306">BDSC_64306</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent <break/>(<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td valign="top">UAS-pHluorinCAAX</td><td valign="top">This study</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent <break/>(<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td valign="top">QUAS-pHluorinCAAX</td><td valign="top">This study</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent <break/>(<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td valign="top">UAS-ArchT-P2A- <break/>mRuby3CAAX</td><td valign="top">This study</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent <break/>(<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td valign="top">QUAS-ArchT-P2A-mRuby3CAAX</td><td valign="top">This study</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cell line <break/>(Human)</td><td valign="top">HEK293T</td><td valign="top">ATCC</td><td valign="top">Cat#CRL-3216;

The medium was replaced 10 hr later, and the cells were incubated for an additional 24 hr prior to imaging. pH calibration in HEK293T cells.</p><p>HEK293T cells were co-transfected with the mTagBFP-pHluorinCAAX and ArchT-P2A-mRuby3 plasmids (each at 0.5 μg per well in a DNA:PEI ratio of 1:3) or mTagBFP-pHluorinCAAX alone (1 μg per well) 24 hr prior to imaging. Cover slips with cells attached were immersed in Tyrode’s solution containing (in mM): 150 NaCl, 4 KCl, 2 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 HEPES, and 10 glucose (pH 7.4) and then pre-treated with 10 μM Nigericin for 5 min, after which the calibration buffers were perfused into the chamber. After Nigericin was added, GFP and BFP channels were recorded simultaneously at 5 s intervals (500 ms/frame, 512 × 512 pixels) using a Nikon A1 confocal microscope. Calibration buffers (containing 10 μM Nigericin) at pH 7, 7.5, 8, 8.5, and 9.5 contained (in mM) 120 KCl, 30 NaCl, 2 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 Glucose, and 10 HEPES; for pH 5.5 and 6.5 buffers, HEPES was replaced with 10 mM MES.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Electrophysiology</title><p>Patch-clamp recordings were performed using an Olympus IX81 upright microscope equipped with a 40x/0.95 NA objective; images were acquired using Micro-Manager (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://micro-manager.org/">https://micro-manager.org/</ext-link>). Laser light was delivered via a Sutter DG-4 equipped with a xenon lamp. Cultured HEK293T cells were bathed in Tyrode’s solution. Actuator HEK293T cells were identified by blue fluorescence (excitation filter: 350/50 nm; emission filter: 448/60 nm). ArchT was activated using the same light source filtered through a 560/25 nm Sutter VF5 filter. Light intensity was adjusted using the Sutter DG-4 and was calculated by measuring the light power transmitted through the objective using a SANWA laser power meter LP1). Recording electrodes (with a tip resistance of 3–6 MΩ when filled with internal solution) were fabricated using a Sutter P-97 electrode puller and controlled using Sutter MP-225 micromanipulators. The recording electrodes were filled with an internal solution containing (in mM): 130 K-gluconate, 10 KCl, 2 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 2.5 Mg-ATP, 0.25 Na-GTP, 10 HEPES, and 0.4 EGTA (pH adjusted to 7.4 with KOH; osmolarity adjusted to 300 mOsm with sucrose); where indicated, 100 μM carbenoxolone (CBX) (Sigma-Aldrich) was applied by perfusion. The recording signal was amplified and digitized using a HEKA EPC10 double patch-clamp amplifier and collected using Patch Master. Currents were smoothed using a 20 ms moving average in order to minimize 50 Hz AC noise. For simultaneous optical and electrophysiology recordings, the Sutter DG-4 light source was triggered by the HEKA EPC10 amplifier in order to synchronize the electrophysiological recording with the light simulation. All recordings were performed at room temperature.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>FRAP measurements in HEK293T cells</title><p>A 1 mM stock solution of Calcein-AM was added to the culture medium to a final concentration of 1 μM. The cells were then incubated for 10 min before washing 3 times with 1 ml Tyrode’s solution. The coverslips containing the attached cells were then placed in a chamber containing Tyrode’s solution and imaged using a Nikon A1 confocal microscope. A typical FRAP experiment was performed using 488 nm imaging for measuring the baseline (1 s/frame, 5 s interval, five frames, 512 × 512 pixels), 405 nm bleaching (12 s, ROI ~5 μm in diameter within the cell), and 488 nm imaging for 2 min in order to track Calcein recovery.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Preparation, culture, transfection, and infection of primary cardiomyocytes</title><p>Cardiomyocytes (CMs) were enzymatically dissociated from the ventricles of neonatal (P0) Sprague-Dawley rats, and 0.5–1 × 10<sup>5</sup> CMs per well were seeded on 12 mm glass coverslips coated with poly-D-lysine (Sigma-Aldrich) in 24-well plates and grown in DMEM containing 10% FBS and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (all from Gibco) at 37°C in humidified air containing 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Forty-eight hours after plating, CMs were simultaneously transfected with the ArchT-BFP2 plasmids using Lipofectamine 3000 (Invitrogen) and infected with an adenovirus carrying pHluorinCAAX under CMV promoter (Vigene Biosciences). In brief, before transfection/infection, the medium in each well was replaced with 500 μl Opti-MEM.

CMs were imaged with 488 nm excitation in Tyrode’s solution at room temperature using a Nikon A1 confocal microscope for 1 min to record Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients, followed by stimulation with 561 nm for 20 s (5 trials at 2 min intervals). After stimulation, another 1 min of time-lapse imaging was performed using 488 nm excitation to record Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients. Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients recorded before and after light stimulation were counted using ImageJ analysis of the green channel. All images were generated at a rate of 100 ms/frame.

The brain was then transferred to a glass-bottom chamber containing ALH for confocal imaging. The brain was held in place using a custom-made platinum frame and positioned with the anterior surface of the brain toward the objective (for imaging and stimulation of the antennal lobe), or with the posterior surface toward the objective (for imaging and stimulation of the lateral horn).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Fluorescence imaging and light stimulation</title><p>Imaging and light stimulation were performed at RT using an inverted Nikon A1 confocal microscope equipped with a Nikon sapphire laser and either a 40x/1.35 NA oil objective (for HEK293T and HeLa cells) or a 20x/0.75 NA air objective (for CMs and fly brains). During imaging, the cells (HEK293T cells, HeLa cells, or CMs) were immersed in Tyrode’s solution. Cells expressing the actuator (ArchT-BFP2) or receiver (pHluorinCAAX) were identified by the presence of blue or green fluorescence respectively. ArchT-BFP2 was excited at 405 nm and visualized using a 450/50 nm filter; pHluorin was excited at 488 nm and visualized using a GaSP photomultiplier after passing through a 525/50 nm filter. Blue fluorescent cells in adjacent to green cells were selected to conduct photostimulation with a ROI of 10–20 μm in diameter. ArchT was photostimulated using a 561 nm scanning laser at 0.5 mW for experiments using cell lines (except for the power-dependent measurements) and 0.1 mW for experiments using CMs. Typically, cells were first imaged using 488 nm excitation (256 × 256 pixels, 500 ms/frame, 2–5 s intervals) to obtain a baseline fluorescence measurement. After obtaining a baseline, pulses of 561 nm laser light were applied to activate the ArchT (4 s/pulse, 5–10 pulses with no delay), intertwined with 488 nm imaging of the receiver. The 488 nm imaging was continued (2–5 s intervals) for 1–2 min after the 561 nm stimulation in order to record the fluorescence recovery of the receiver. For experiments using gap junction blockers and modulators, 100 μM CBX (Sigma-Aldrich), 2 mM heptanol (J and K Scientific), 500 μM 8-Br-cAMP (Sigma-Aldrich), 500 μM forskolin (TargetMol), or 340 nM TPA (Sigma-Aldrich) was applied by adding a 1000x stock solution to the chamber. For CM experiments, heptanol was washed out of the chamber for 3 min by perfusion with Tyrode’s solution.</p><p>Fly brains were stimulated and imaged in ALH using the same laser configuration described above at RT. Genotypes of samples were verified by both the presence and the pattern of green (pHluorin) or red (ArchT) fluorescence.

eLife includes the editorial decision letter and accompanying author responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;PARIS, an optogenetic method for functionally mapping gap junctions&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Eve Marder as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: David J. Schulz (Reviewer #1); Alberto Pereda (Reviewer #2); James Jeanne (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>During the consultation session, the three reviewers were in agreement that no new experiments are required, but that there are issues that will require editorial changes and some rewriting. I am taking the unusual tactic of including all three complete reviews so that you have the benefit of the context for the concerns as you prepare your revisions.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>The authors present a novel optical method to visualize gap junction connections (PARIS). Strengths of this new method include non-invasiveness, subcellular resolution, and the ability to apply this through transgenic means that allow for targeting to specific defined cell types.</p><p>Overall, I find the work novel and innovative and potentially interesting to a growing field of researchers focused on these underappreciated cellular connections. The manuscript itself is very well crafted – and the figures of very high quality throughout. In many ways this was a pleasure to read. Of particular note is the authors' care to appropriately discuss the benefits and limitations of the new technique.</p><p>If I have one major concern with the utility of PARIS, it is that it seems to be at this point a largely qualitative tool. The authors have demonstrated that functional coupling can be identified with PARIS. What would truly be exceptional is if this could be used to measure not only the presence of coupling, but the relative strength of coupling as well. To do so, the authors would need to measure coupling strength with a traditional approach (e.g. current clamp or voltage clamp), measure with PARIS in the same cells, and correlate this across a number of cell pairs with varying coupling strengths. While I do not think this is required for this study to be ready for publication, it would greatly enhance the utility of this approach.</p><p>My only other concern, which is touched on by the authors, is that PARIS will manipulate intracellular pH – and invoke homeostatic mechanisms to maintain cellular pH. If this occurs, there may be physiological questions that alter cellular properties as a result. This may limit the utility of PARIS for longitudinal studies where multiple measurements of coupling are taken over the time course of some manipulation.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>This paper 'PARIS, an optogenetic method for functionally mapping gap junctions' by Wu at al. describes a novel approach to explore gap junctional communication. Taking advantage of genetics the method pairs an actuator (a light gated outward proton pump ArchT) in one cell with a receiver (the pH sensitive GFP pHluorin) in an adjacent cell, a combination that has the ability of to detect gap junctional communication between these two cells. The development of this method represents a significant contribution to the current toolbox of techniques available to study intercellular communication via gap junctions because:</p><p>a) It allows repeated measurements of gap junctional coupling.b) It is cell-specific.c) Although not comparable with electrophysiological approaches, it has an acceptable temporal resolution, better than that of comparable methods.d) More importantly, it has exquisite spatial resolution, a property without parallel in any other method.e) Combined, these properties make this new method ideal for the study of electrical synapses in neural circuits of genetically-tractable species.</p><p>The authors provide evidence of the sensitivity of this method that results from extensive testing under different conditions. Every possible source of confound was explored and addressed. Thus, this method certainly adds to the palette of methods available for studying gap junctional communication and it could be used in combination with other approaches.</p><p>A concern of the technique is the modification of intracellular pH resulting from changes in the concentration of protons. As the authors discuss, gap junction channels were shown to be gated by pH. However, the authors document the changes in pH resulting from different activation strengths and conclude that it is possible to operate with sufficient sensitivity and minimal variation in intracellular pH. It is anyway a limitation of the technique that should be used with caution, as the sensitivity for pH might be different for gap junction channels made of different isoforms and the pH buffering capability (although highly conserved) could be different between cells types. While the authors discuss the effect of pH on connexin-based gap junction channels there is not reference to the effect of pH on innexin-based gap junctions, at which this novel approach was also tested and will most likely be used. I suggest the authors should include this point into their Discussion/considerations. Here are a few papers on the effect of pH on invertebrate gap junctions that the authors should include: Giaume, Spira and Korn, 1980; Obaid, Socolar and Rose, 1983; Moreno et al., 1991; Landesman et al., 1999; Anderson and Woodruff, 2001. Anyway, while a limitation (inherent to any method) reminding the experimenter to use this method with caution, it does not weaken the many virtues of the approach.</p><p>Overall, this is a new exciting approach that provides a new tool to study the role of electrical synapses in neuronal circuits. The presence, distribution and functional role of electrical synapses has recently received a great deal of attention in <italic>C. elegans</italic> and <italic>Drosophila</italic>, at which neurons are less accessible with electrophysiological approaches. Together with the future technical improvements discussed by the authors its likely immediate use in these genetically tractable invertebrate species will promote the necessary improvements to make possible its use in the vertebrate brain.</p><p>References:</p><p>Anderson KL, Woodruff RI., A gap junctionally transmitted epithelial cell signal regulates endocytic yolk uptake in Oncopeltus fasciatus.

The approach involves expression of an actuator in one cell (or cell type) and a receiver in another cell (or cell type). The authors tested several possible actuators and receivers and settled on ArchT (a light-gated proton pump) and pHluorinCAAX (a membrane-bound pH sensitive GFP). Photoactivation of ArchT lets protons flow out of the actuator cell, which are then replenished by protons flowing in from another cell, through gap-junctions. If the gap-junction-coupled cell expresses pHluorinCAAX, then the loss of protons changes the pH, which yields a change in fluorescence.</p><p>The authors demonstrate that this methodology works in HEK cells, cardiomyocytes, and <italic>Drosophila</italic> neurons ex vivo. They validate it against other established methodologies for detecting gap junctions, specifically with paired patch-clamp recordings or with fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP). Because PARIS is an optical method, it is easier to perform than paired electrophysiological recordings and has the advantage of subcellular localization of signals. Further, they demonstrate that PARIS is more stable and has higher temporal resolution than FRAP.</p><p>Overall, I see this as a useful new methodology in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. I feel that this tool is appropriate for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>, since it promises to facilitate the detection of gap junctions, which could easily enable novel insights into neural circuit functions. I do however, have a couple of substantial concerns that the authors should address.</p><p>1) In many instances, researchers may want to apply this technique in vivo. Is the ΔF/F<sub>0</sub> signal amplitude large enough for this technique to be useful in vivo, where spontaneous activity might mask the small signal? The authors should include either a demonstration of in vivo signal detection, or a frank discussion of limitations of its use in vivo. Potential users of this technique would want to know about these limitations, as this knowledge could potentially save them considerable time when applying it.</p><p>2) As with any signal detection question, there is the issue of false positives and false negatives. The authors should provide a practical guide to assessing this issue. For instance, to protect against false negatives (missing a connection when one indeed exists), it seems that a control experiment in the cis configuration is advisable (to ensure that the actuator is having its desired effect). To protect against false positives (finding a connection when one does not actually exist), it seems that washing on CBX as a control is important, especially as a way to confirm that the detected signal is indeed due to a gap junction. The authors should clearly state that these controls are necessary to drawing strong conclusions from this tool (or, if they disagree, clearly explain why). These are important issues, since other tools for detecting synaptic connectivity (e.g. early versions of GRASP in <italic>Drosophila</italic>) were susceptible to false positives (see Shearin et al., 2018, for a discussion). Thus, the authors should address this issue directly.</p><p>3) The authors should provide some explanation for why Ca<sup>2+</sup> based approaches don't work (Figure 1—figure supplement 1B). It is surprising that combining CsChrimson and GCaMP in the same cell (i.e. in the &quot;cis&quot; configuration) does not yield a measurable signal, especially since this general approach has been used successfully in other systems (e.g. Packer et al., 2015).</p><p>References:</p><p>Packer AM, Russell LE, Dalgleish HW, Häusser M.

Even though we did not perform the exact experiments as the reviewer suggested, as we have shown in Figure 3, PARIS signals were decreased in cell pairs under TPA (PKC pathway agonist) applications and in the cell pairs expressing mutated gap junction proteins compared to the control cell pairs, which may partially indicate PARIS has the potential to distinguish the different coupling strength at least in vitro. While we agree that it would be even better if we could calibrate PARIS by the quantitative patch-clamp method, in order to more accurately compare the coupling strength between different cells/animals.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>My only other concern, which is touched on by the authors, is that PARIS will manipulate intracellular pH – and invoke homeostatic mechanisms to maintain cellular pH.

The in vivo signal will be at least related to several aspects, including the expression level of the actuators and receivers, photostimulation efficiency of the actuators, and most of all, the coupling efficiency of the gap junction channels (the opening state as well as the amount of channels displayed on the membrane). In the manuscript, we showed that PARIS could detect eLN-ePN coupling ex vivo with ΔF/F<sub>0</sub>around ~5% and a SNR of nearly 10 to 30. The eLN-ePN coupling efficacy was actually very low (Ju Huang et al., 2010, Figure 3D; Kaiyu Wang et al., 2014, see Discussion) which could probably only otherwise be detected by patch-clamping (the recorded coupling voltage were less than 1mV and have been averaged for 20 trials in the 2010 paper mentioned above). This may to some extend indicate that our PARIS method which generates and detects locally altered pH concentration is already relatively sensitive among the existing methods. While we do suggest that the researchers start with the in cis test in different preparations and contexts and use the cell-autonomous signal to optimize the expression level of actuators/receivers as well as the photostimulation conditions. Besides, based on the in vitro result in Figure 5, the use of the more powerful proton pump Lari, is worth trying. This concern about PARIS’s in vivo sensitivity is also related to the false negative issue in the reviewer’s second point and it has been discussed in our revised manuscript (see below).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) As with any signal detection question, there is the issue of false positives and false negatives.

As the reviewer pointed out, false negative/positive issues are inevitable for any methods, which should be addressed with proper controls that have been demonstrated in the manuscript (Figure 4 and 5, both the in cis test and the CBX blocking controls have been performed in flies). We agree with the reviewer that it is advisable to state more directly about the importance of such controls.
