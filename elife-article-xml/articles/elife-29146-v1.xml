In Drosophila, histamine recycling is required for visual synaptic transmission. Synaptic histamine is rapidly taken up by laminar glia, and is converted to carcinine. After delivered back to photoreceptors, carcinine is hydrolyzed to release histamine and β-alanine. This histamine is repackaged into synaptic vesicles, but it is unclear how the β-alanine is returned to the laminar glial cells. Here, we identified a new β-alanine transporter, which we named BalaT (<underline>B</underline>eta-<underline>ala</underline>nine <underline>T</underline>ransporter). Null balat mutants exhibited lower levels of β-alanine, as well as less β-alanine accumulation in the retina. Moreover, BalaT is expressed and required in retinal pigment cells for maintaining visual synaptic transmission and phototaxis behavior. These results provide the first genetic evidence that retinal pigment cells play a critical role in visual neurotransmission, and suggest that a BalaT-dependent β-alanine trafficking pathway is required for histamine homeostasis and visual neurotransmission.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.29146.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.29146.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29146.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Neurons transmit information around the body in the form of electrical signals, but these signals cannot cross the gaps between neurons. To send a message to its neighbor, a neuron releases a molecule known as a neurotransmitter into the gap between the cells. The neurotransmitter binds to proteins on the recipient neuron and triggers new electrical signals inside that cell. When the message has been received, the neurotransmitter molecules are returned to the first neuron so that they can be reused.</p><p>This recycling is particularly important in the visual system, where neurons communicate via rapid-fire signaling. In fruit flies, for example, light-sensitive neurons in the eye known as photoreceptors release a neurotransmitter called histamine when they detect light. Supporting cells called laminar glia take up any leftover histamine and combine it with another molecule known as β-alanine to form a larger molecule. The photoreceptors absorb this larger molecule and break it back down into histamine and β-alanine. However, it is not clear how the β-alanine returns to the glia to allow this cycle to continue.</p><p>Many molecules rely on so-called “transporter” proteins to help them move into or out of cells. To identify transporters that might help to move β-alanine, Han, Xiong et al. prepared a list of fruit fly genes that encode transporter proteins found inside the insect’s head. Testing the resulting proteins in a cultured cell system revealed that one of them was able to transport β-alanine. This protein, named BalaT, is found in another type of support cell called retinal pigment cells. Mutant flies that cannot produce BalaT are blind because their photoreceptors have problems in transmitting information to other neurons.</p><p>Han, Xiong et al. propose that BalaT transports β-alanine from photoreceptors to retinal pigment cells, which then pass β-alanine on to the laminar glia. Follow-up studies are required to find out exactly how the laminar glia take up histamine.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.29146.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.29146.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>neurotransmitter transporter</kwd><kwd>histamine recycling</kwd><kwd>retinal pigment cell</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Chinese Ministry of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2014CB849700</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Tao</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81670891</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Tao</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>BalaT-dependent β-alanine trafficking pathway in retinal pigment cells is critical for maintaining synaptic transmission of photoreceptor neurons in <italic>Drosophila</italic>.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>eLife Digest</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Efficient clearance of neurotransmitters from the synaptic cleft is crucial for terminating a synaptic signal. These cleared neurotransmitters must then be recycled for sustained synaptic transmission (i.e., to maintain stable levels of transmitters) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Blakely and Edwards, 2012</xref>). Neurons that utilize histamine as a neurotransmitter play important roles in a variety of biological processes, including cognition, sleep, and metabolism, and dysfunction of the histaminergic system in the brain has been linked to multiple neurological diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Haas et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Panula and Nuutinen, 2013</xref>). Histamine is particularly important in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> visual system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hardie, 1989</xref>), and histamine recycling is the dominant pathway for maintaining adequate levels of histamine in adult photoreceptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Borycz et al., 2002</xref>). In this system, and in mammalian systems as well, the histamine recycling process involves both neurons and glial cells that surround the synapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Edwards and Meinertzhagen, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Yoshikawa et al., 2013</xref>). In fact, a network of glia cells and pigment cells interconnected via gap junctions plays a key role in the long-distance recycling of histamine in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> visual system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chaturvedi et al., 2014</xref>). However, the mechanisms by which this cellular network recycles histamine and its metabolites are unknown.</p><p>Once histamine is released by a photoreceptor into the optic lamina, it is quickly removed from the synaptic cleft by epithelia glial cells that surround the synapse. In these laminar glia, histamine is conjugated to β-alanine by an N-β-alanyl-dopamine synthase, called Ebony, to form the inactive metabolite, carcinine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Borycz et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Richardt et al., 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">2002</xref>). Recently, a carcinine transporter, CarT that is responsible for the uptake of carcinine from the synaptic cleft into photoreceptors has been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chaturvedi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Stenesen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Xu et al., 2015</xref>). The discovery that CarT retrieves carcinine directly from the laminar synaptic cleft indicates that carcinine is not transported from laminar glia to photoreceptor cell bodies through a long-distance trafficking mechanism involving the laminar glial and pigment cell network.</p><p>Within photoreceptors, carcinine is hydrolyzed to generate histamine and β-alanine, a reaction catalyzed by an N-β-alanyl-dopamine hydrolase called Tan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Borycz et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">True et al., 2005</xref>). This regenerated histamine is then repackaged into synaptic vesicles for subsequent light-induced release, but it is unclear how β-alanine is returned to the laminar glial cells (where it is needed to inactivate histamine). It is also unclear whether β-alanine recycling is required for visual transmission. The finding that high levels of β-alanine are detected in retinal pigment cells suggested that pigment cells may be critical for the transport and storage of β-alanine in this system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Borycz et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chaturvedi et al., 2014</xref>). To address these questions, we sought to determine whether there was a β-alanine transporter that was required for <italic>Drosophila</italic> vision transmission.</p><p>Here, we identified BalaT, which is a plasma membrane transporter capable to transporting β-alanine into cells. Mutations in the <italic>balat</italic> gene disrupted photoreceptor synaptic transmission, phototaxis behaviors, and contents and retinal distribution of β-alanine. BalaT expression in retinal pigment cells completely rescued the defective visual transmission of <italic>balat</italic> mutants. Furthermore, the gap junction proteins Inx1 and Inx3 were required in retinal pigment cells for visual neurotransmission. We therefore provide evidence for a novel β-alanine recycling pathway, in which β-alanine that is released from photoreceptor cells is taken up and stored by retinal pigment cells, and then delivered to laminar glia via gap junctions, where histamine is inactivated by conjugation with β-alanine.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>CG3790 transports β-alanine in vitro</title><p>In <italic>Drosophila</italic> photoreceptors, carcinine is hydrolyzed to form histamine and β-alanine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">True et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Wagner et al., 2007</xref>). Histamine is then released as a neurotransmitter, taken up by laminar glial cells, and then conjugated with β-alanine to form carcinine. Although it is known that CarT transports carcinine into photoreceptors, it is unclear how β-alanine is delivered to laminar glia. To begin to understand this process, we sought to identify a β-alanine transporter in the fly visual system. We speculated that a transporter responsible for β-alanine uptake would likely be enriched in fly heads, so we examined previous RNA-seq data comparing mRNAs isolated from the head with mRNAs isolated from the body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Xu and Wang, 2016</xref>).

Each candidate was transiently expressed in HEK293T cell, and their ability to uptake [<sup>3</sup>H]-β-alanine was assessed. Only one candidate transporters, CG3790, exhibited β-alanine uptake activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The β-alanine content of CG3790-transfected cells was approximately 119 Bq/mg, which was 2.7-fold greater than measured for mock- or RFP-transfected controls (55 and 53 Bq/mg, respectively). CG3790 shares significant amino acid identity with the mammalian solute carrier family 22 (SLC22), which includes both mouse and human OCT3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). The β-alanine transporting activity of CG3790 was further confirmed in S2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Mouse GAT3 (GABA transporter type 3), which is known to efficiently take up β-alanine, exhibited levels of β-alanine transporting activity that were similar to CG3790, suggesting that CG3790 is a <italic>bona fide</italic> β-alanine transporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Christiansen et al., 2007</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). We next sought to determine whether CG3790 is a specific β-alanine transporter in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Because a histamine transporter has not yet been identified, we first asked whether CG3790 is able to transport histamine. Histamine uptake assays revealed that CG3790 does not exhibit histamine uptake activity. As a control, the human Organic Cation Transporter (OCT2), which is known to take up histamine, exhibited high levels of histamine transport activity when expressed in S2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Since mGAT3 is also a GABA transporter, we asked whether CG3790 is able to transport GABA. While mGAT3 efficiently transported GABA, CG3790 did not exhibit GABA transporting activity when expressed in S2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Moreover, when we expressed Flag-tagged CG3790 in S2 cells the Flag signal localized exclusively to the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). These data suggest that <italic>CG3790</italic> encodes a plasma membrane β-alanine transporter.</p><p>To further confirm that the CG3790 transporter functions in the fly head, we performed quantitative PCR comparing mRNAs isolated from wild-type heads, wild-type bodies, or heads from <italic>GMR-hid</italic> flies, which are devoid of eyes.

As such, <italic>ninaE</italic> and <italic>pdh</italic> expression is greatly reduced in the heads of <italic>GMR-hid</italic> flies. Similarly, <italic>CG3790</italic> transcript levels were also greatly reduced in the heads of <italic>GMR-hid</italic> flies, suggesting that <italic>CG3790</italic> is primarily expressed in the fly compound eye (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A–B</xref>).

Exposing wild-type flies to light results in two primary components in the ERG recording, including a sustained corneal negative response resulting from photoreceptor depolarization, and ‘on’ and ‘off’ transients resulting from postsynaptic neuronal activity in the optic lamina (downstream of the photoreceptors) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Wang and Montell, 2007</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).

To test this idea, we sectioned fly heads and labeled them with an antibody against β-alanine. In wild-type flies, levels of β-alanine were highest in the retina, consistent with previous analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Borycz et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chaturvedi et al., 2014</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C and F</xref>). In contrast, levels of β-alanine were lower in <italic>balat<sup>1</sup></italic> sections (for comparison, retinal signals were normalized to the β-alanine signal in the lobula) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D and F</xref>). <italic>GMR-balat</italic> restored retinal β-alanine levels in <italic>balat<sup>1</sup></italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E and F</xref>), and rescued photoreceptor synaptic transmission. Reduced levels of β-alanine in retina lacking BalaT support the hypothesis that BalaT transports β-alanine into retinal pigment cells. We next checked if reductions in β-alanine change its distribution. In <italic>pyd1</italic> and <italic>black</italic> double mutants (<italic>pyd1;b<sup>1</sup></italic>), two independent metabolic pathways for de novo β-alanine biosynthesis are blocked and thus β-alanine levels are largely reduced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Borycz et al., 2012</xref>). However, in <italic>pyd1;b<sup>1</sup></italic> flies the pattern of β-alanine distribution is the same as seen in wild type, although immune intensity is reduced, as is the case with <italic>balat<sup>1</sup></italic> mutant flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Therefore, pigment cells may serve as a reservoir of storedβ-alanine through a BalaT-dependent mechanism. Since Inx1/Inx3 double knockdown flies showed significant reductions in ‘on’ and ‘off’ transients, we asked whether Inx1/Inx3 is required for β-alanine trafficking. Of importance, β-alanine primarily accumulated in the retinal layer of Inx1/Inx3 double knock-down flies compared with control flies with either <italic>CG2198</italic> or <italic>CG9962</italic> RNAi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H–J</xref>). Meanwhile in vivo levels of β-alanine in heads of Inx1/Inx3 double knockdown flies are significantly higher than in control flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). These results further support our hypothesis that Inx1/Inx3 functions to transport β-alanine back into glia cell. Taken together, we have identified a previously uncharacterized β-alanine transporter, which we have named BalaT, and shown that BalaT is responsible for β-alanine transportation and storage in pigment cells.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Histamine is the primary neurotransmitter released by photoreceptors in flies, and the synthesis of histamine can occur de novo by photoreceptor cell-specific histidine decarboxylase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Burg et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hardie, 1987</xref>). However, during light stimulation, flies depend primarily on histamine recycling to sustain tonic visual transmission. Histamine is inactivated when Ebony catalyzes its conjugation to β-alanine in laminar glial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Borycz et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Richardt et al., 2002</xref>). In photoreceptors, CarT and Tan are involved in transporting carcinine and regenerating histamine, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chaturvedi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Stenesen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Wagner et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Xu et al., 2015</xref>). Histamine is then loaded into synaptic vesicles, but fate of the β-alanine generated by Tan remains unknown. Here, we identify a new β-alanine transporter, BalaT, and provide evidence that BalaT is required for visual transmission. BalaT is a plasma membrane protein, and is sufficient to facilitate β-alanine uptake in cultured cells. BalaT is expressed predominantly by retinal pigment cells, and the specific expression of BalaT in these cells rescues photoreceptor synaptic transmission in <italic>balat<sup>1</sup></italic> mutant flies. The reduced levels and altered distribution of β-alanine in the heads of <italic>balat<sup>1</sup></italic> mutants support the hypothesis that BalaT functions to transport β-alanine. Therefore, we suggest that a novel β-alanine transporter, BalaT, functions in retinal pigment cells to help recycle β-alanine.</p><p>Disrupting the synthesis of histamine and carcinine abolishes photoreceptor synaptic transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Borycz et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Burg et al., 1993</xref>). The transport of β-alanine seems less important, as it is present at higher concentrations in Drosophila. Two common metabolic pathways have been shown to synthesize β-alanine: (1) aspartate decarboxylase, encoded by the <italic>black</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hodgetts, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Phillips et al., 2005</xref>), and (2) the uracil degradation pathway, which includes the enzymes dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (Pyd1), dihydropyrimidine amidohydrolase (Pyd2), and β-ureidopropionase (Pyd3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Piskur et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Rawls, 2006</xref>). The Black protein is enriched in lamina glia, together with the protein Ebony, and functions as the major enzyme in generating β-alanine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ziegler et al., 2013</xref>). Although levels of β-alanine are reduced in the heads of <italic>black</italic> mutants (or <italic>pyd1 and black</italic> double mutants) compared to wild type, these flies still exhibit ERG transients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Borycz et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ziegler et al., 2013</xref>). Therefore, an efficient β-alanine recycling systems has been proposed to compensate for the rapid loss of β-alanine that occurs in the conversion of histamine to carcinine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Borycz et al., 2012</xref>). Here we show that mutations in <italic>balat</italic> disrupted transport and storage of β-alanine in the retina, resulting in dramatically reduced photoreceptor synaptic activity and visual behavior. Thus, we propose that Balat plays a key role in shuttling β-alanine from photoreceptor cells to glial cells.</p><p>A similar recycling system has been demonstrated for histamine. Mutations in <italic>Hdc</italic> (histidine decarboxylase) result in the loss of visual transduction. Feeding these flies histamine fully restores the visual transduction, whereas supplying histamine fails to rescue the ERG phenotypes of <italic>ebony</italic> mutants or <italic>Hdc;ebony</italic> double mutant flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Melzig et al., 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ziegler et al., 2013</xref>). In <italic>pyd1;black</italic> double mutant<italic>s</italic>, β--alanine levels are still higher than histamine, which may be because of the uptake of exogenous β-alanine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Borycz et al., 2012</xref>). Meanwhile, the β-alanine recycling pathway is able to sustain visual synaptic transmission in <italic>black</italic> mutant flies, even in the absence of in situ β-alanine generation. Therefore, β-alanine recycling is essential for maintaining histamine homeostasis and photoreceptor synaptic transmission. In addition, establishing and maintaining a β-alanine pool play key roles in sustaining visual synaptic transmission.</p><p>The majority of pigment granules, which reduce the intensity of light exposure, are formed in retinal pigment cells of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> compound eye. Recently, it has been demonstrated that retinal pigment cells are functionally equivalent to cells within the mammalian retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), in terms of chromophore cycling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Travis et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Wang et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">2012</xref>). Just like chromophore (a subunit of rhodopsin) is sent back to pigment cells for regeneration, it has been suggested that the metabolism of β-alanine involves pigment cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Borycz et al., 2012</xref>). Several observations indicate that BalaT functions in retina pigment cells to help regenerate histamine. Most notably, BalaT is expressed in pigment cells and visual transmission is rescued in <italic>balat</italic> mutants by the expression of wild-type BalaT in pigment cells, but not photoreceptor neurons. Our work provides strong genetic evidence for the involvement of retinal pigment cells in histamine recycling, and suggests that BalaT is the key player responsible for the transport of β-alanine into pigment cell.</p><p>It has been suggested that the transportation of histamine metabolites within the <italic>Drosophila</italic> visual system is mediated by a network of retinal pigment cells and laminar glia that are interconnected by gap junctions, and that this transport network is essential for fly vision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chaturvedi et al., 2014</xref>). However, histaminergic photoreceptor cells directly acquire carcinine from synaptic terminals within the optic lamina through a CarT-dependent trafficking pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Xu et al., 2015</xref>). Here we provided evidence that the intercellular gap junctions between retinal pigment cells and laminar glial cells are involved in trafficking β-alanine, another histamine metabolite. Although the Inx2 gap junction protein is required in laminar glial cells for visual transmission, Inx2 was not required in retinal pigment cells. In contrast, downregulating the gap junction proteins Inx1 and Inx3 within the compound eye greatly impaired photoreceptor synaptic transmission. These data indicate that the Inx1 and Inx3 proteins are required in retinal pigment cells for maintaining fly vision. It has also been suggested that gap junctions may play a role in the formation of synapses between the retina and lamina in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> visual system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Curtin et al., 2002</xref>). Therefore, an alternative explanation would be that Inx1 and Inx3 are required for the development of synapses between retinal and laminar neurons. Although electron microscopy studies in <italic>Drosophila</italic> have not revealed gap junctions between retinal pigment cells and laminar fenestrated glia, accumulation of β-alanine in the retinal layer of <italic>inx1/inx3</italic> double mutant flies indicates defective β-alanine trafficking.</p><p>BalaT belongs to the SLC22 family of transporters, which mediate sodium-independent transport of neurotransmitters, amino acids, and energy metabolites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Koepsell, 2013</xref>). We provide evidence that BalaT functions specifically in pigment cells as a β-alanine transporter, as BalaT mediated β-alanine transport in vitro, and is expressed predominately in retinal pigment cells. The reduced levels and altered distribution of β-alanine in the heads of <italic>balat</italic> null mutant flies supports this hypothesis. β-alanine is one of the two constituents of the naturally occurring dipeptides, carnosine and carcinine, and is considered rate-limiting for their synthesis. Both carnosine and carcinine are found in the retina where they exert protective effects. This is because they function as antioxidants, scavenging toxic activated oxygen species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Marchette et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Pfister et al., 2011</xref>). There is evidence that several members of the SLC family of proteins that can transportβ-alanine are present in the retina, including taurine transporter (Slc6a6/TauT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Liu et al., 1993</xref>). This suggests a conserved function for β-alanine trafficking in mammals and <italic>Drosophila</italic>.</p><p>Our current work, together with previous reports, provides evidence for the formulation of a more complete histamine recycling pathway, which is critical for sustaining photoreceptor synaptic transmission (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). In this pathway, carcinine is synthesized in epithelial glial cells within the optic lamina, and is transported back to photoreceptor cells via the synaptic cleft. Once in the photoreceptor cells it is hydrolyzed into histamine and β-alanine by Tan, and histamine is used as neurotransmitter. Meanwhile, β-alanine is released via an unknown mechanism, and is subsequently delivered to and stored within pigment cells by BalaT. Finally, β-alanine is transported back to epithelial glia through the network of retinal pigment cells and laminar glia for histamine inactivation and carcinine synthesis.<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29146.024</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>A model of the histamine recycling pathway.</title><p>Histamine is initially synthesized by histidine decarboxylase (Hdc) in photoreceptor cells (PR). Upon light stimulation, PRs release histamine into the synaptic cleft. Released histamine is quickly taken up by an unknown histamine transporter into epithelial glial cells that express Ebony. In these glia, histamine is conjugated to β-alanine, which inactivates histamine and generates carcinine. Carcinine is released into the synaptic cleft and subsequently internalized, via CarT, by the PRs. After carcinine is hydrolyzed to histamine and β-alanine by Tan hydrolase in the PR, histamine is re-packaged into synaptic vesicles, whereas β-alanine is delivered to and subsequently internalized, via the BalaT transporter, by retinal pigment cells (PCs). PCs can store β-alanine or deliver β-alanine to the laminar glia cells through a gap junction network involving Inx1 and Inx3, which are expressed in PCs. In glial cells, β-alanine is conjugated to histamine, and the cycle repeats. Moreover, β-alanine can be synthesized by Black, which is an aspartate decarboxylase that is expressed together with Ebony in optic lobe glia.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.29146.024">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.29146.024</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="postscript" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-29146-fig6-v1"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Fly stocks</title><p>The <italic>pyd1; b<sup>1</sup></italic> (<italic>su(r) r<sup>C</sup>; b<sup>1</sup></italic>)<italic>, UAS-inx1<sup>RNAi</sup></italic>, <italic>UAS-inx2<sup>RNAi</sup></italic>, and <italic>UAS-inx3<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> flies were provided by the Bloomington <italic>Drosophila</italic> Stock Center.

ERG signals were amplified with a Warner electrometer IE-210, and recorded with a MacLab/4 s A/D converter and the clampelx 10.2 program (Warner Instruments, Hamden, USA).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>β-alanine, histamine, and GABA uptake assay</title><p>Alanine, β-[3-<sup>3</sup>H (N)] (30–60 Ci/mM, American radiolabeled chemicals, Saint Louis, USA) uptake was measured as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Tomi et al., 2008</xref>). Briefly, pcDNA3/RFP/BalaT or mock-transfected HEK293T cells were cultured in 12-well plates (BD-Falcon) and washed with 1 mL extracellular fluid (ECF) buffer consisting of 120 mM NaCl, 25 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 3 mM KCl,1.4 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>,1.2 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 0.4 mM K<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>,10 mM D-glucose, and 10 mM Hepes (pH 7.4) at 37°C. Uptake was initiated by applying 200 μL ECF buffer containing 7400 Bq [<sup>3</sup>H] β-alanine at 37°C. After 10 min, uptake was terminated by removing the solution, and cells were washed with 1 mL ice-cold ECF buffer. The cells were then solubilized in 1 N NaOH and subsequently neutralized. An aliquot was taken to measure radioactivity and protein content using a liquid scintillation counter and a DC protein assay kit (Bio-rad, USA), respectively, with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Histamine, histamine [ring, Methylenes-3H(N)] dihydrochloride, (10–40 Ci/mM, American radiolabeled chemicals, Saint Louis, USA), and GABA, 4-amino-n-[2, 3-<sup>3</sup>H]butyric acid ([<sup>3</sup>H]GABA, 30–60 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer, Waltham, Massachusetts, USA) uptake assays were initiated by applying 200 μL ECF buffer containing 7400 Bq radiolabeled histamine or radiolabeled GABA. The mixture was incubated for 30 min. The continuous procedures are similar to the β-alanine transport assay.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Immunohistochemistry</title><p>Fly head sections (10 μm thick) were prepared from adults that were frozen in OCT medium (Tissue-Tek, Torrance, USA).

The first decision letter after peer review is shown below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;The β-alanine transporter BalaT is required for visual neurotransmission in <italic>Drosophila</italic>&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Hong-Sheng Li (Reviewer #2).</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that although the work is of interest, it will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic> as the findings at this stage are too preliminary. However, if you can address the comments raised by the reviewers we are willing to re-review a substantially edited version that address the reviewers concern.</p><p>The following are important issues to address:</p><p>The authors proposed that β-Ala diffuses between retinal and lamina through gap junctions and provided RNAi evidence that either Inx1 or Inx3 forms the junctions. Although this hypothesis represents the most direct model of β-Ala trafficking, EM studies from both <italic>Drosophila</italic> and Musca didn't reveal any gap junction between retinal pigment cells and laminar fenestrated glia.</p><p>We know from research reported from the Hovemann lab that epithelial glia express Black, which synthesizes β-alanine from aspartate (Ziegler 2013, J Comp Neurol 521: 1207-1224). In the same paper the coexpression of Ebony in the epithelial glia was also demonstrated. This indicates that the machinery to produce β-alanine and carcinine is exactly present in the site involved in β-alanyl-histamine synthesis and probably should be sufficient to maintain the histamine recycling. It is strange that the authors choose not to report the findings of that study, since they bear critically on this submission.</p><p>The authors' interests seem to be one-sided and focus only on β-alanine transport, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>. As a standard in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> is presented the function of a transporter that is not specific for β-alanine transport e.g. GAT3. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> the tritiated β-alanine uptake into S2 cells is similar for that for CG3790 and for the GABA transporter GAT3. Why have the authors not checked whether CG3790 is a GABA transporter in <italic>Drosophila</italic>? Maybe CG3790 also acts as a transporter for other biologically important and structurally similar molecules, such as glycine, taurine or even glutamate. Transport by the product of CG3790 of some other substances engaged in phototransmission, could explain the ERG abnormalities observed after deleting this gene. Why did the authors not test histamine as a substrate for CG3790 product?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>Wang et al. present a straightforward manuscript on the characterization of a novel β-alanine transporter with a specific defect in visual transmission in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. This is an interesting system to study neurotransmitter recycling through support cells, even though the neurotransmitter system itself (histamine) is quite special. The manuscript presents the novel and interesting finding, namely that in addition to glia cells another cell type, the interommatidial pigment cells, have a special requirement in the process: histamine is generated through 'splitting' of histamine and β-alanine from carcinine in photoreceptor terminals; β-alanine is apparently then taken up by the pigment cells through the newly described BalaT transporter for delivery into glia cells, where histamine and β-alanine get conjugated again for delivery back into photoreceptor terminals.</p><p>The strength of the manuscript is in the clear straight-forward discovery of the balat transporter using a β-alanine uptake assay and demonstration of its function in pigment cells using cell-specific rescue. The link to glia is a bit weaker: RNAi experiments in two innexins that are supposed to be the delivery route of β-alanine back into the glia are not controlled and not fully convincing. This and a few minor gaps in the story can be fixed in a reasonable amount of time. These fixes should include a better characterization of the <italic>balat-mcherry</italic>, quantification of ERGs and better immunohistochemistry.</p><p>The key experiment I would like to see regards the innexin link: if innexin mutants really are the link between pigments cells and glia, then β-alanine should accumulate in the pigment cells in the innexin double RNAi knock-down (which also needs some RNAi controls). With inclusion of these revisions, I am in support of the manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The <italic>Drosophila</italic> visual system is a great model in the study of neurotransmitter homeostasis, in which the primary visual transmitter, histamine, is recycled through a glial pathway that involves two essential enzymes (Ebony and Tan) and multiple steps of transmembrane transport. Previous genetic and immunostaining data have suggested the involvement of retinal pigment cells in the storage/transport of β-Ala, a histamine-inactivating metabolite during this transmitter recycling. Here Wang et al. identified a β-Ala transporter in the pigment cells and demonstrated its importance to the visual transmission at both electrophysiological and behavioral levels. This is merely the second membrane transporter identified in the histamine recycling pathway, and the work provides direct evidence for the involvement of retinal pigment cells.</p><p>My only concern is about the step of β-Ala transport from pigment cells to laminal glia, where β-Ala is conjugated to histamine to form the inactive metabolite carcinine. The authors proposed that β-Ala diffuses between retinal and lamina through gap junctions and provided RNAi evidence that either Inx1 or Inx3 forms the junctions. Although this hypothesis represents the most direct model of β-Ala trafficking, EM studies from both <italic>Drosophila</italic> and Musca didn't reveal any gap junction between retinal pigment cells and laminar fenestrated glia. It is thus important to discuss on alternative, Inx-independent trafficking mechanisms. The ERG defects of Inx1+Inx3 knockdown flies could have different interpretations. For instances, they could be required for the development of synapses between retinal and laminar neurons (see Curtin et al., 2002, J. Cell Sci.), or for the β-Ala transport into core cells for storage.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The authors report a new β-alanine transporter, encoded by CG3790, which they named BalaT, and which is present in the retinal pigment cells of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> visual system. The results indicate that BalaT is critical for β-alanine recycling together with the action of innexins. The authors demonstrate that lacking BalaT disrupts the normal ERG and phototaxis. The results are consistent with the authors' theory but they run contrary to current knowledge about β-alanine and its sources in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> head. We know from research reported from the Hovemann lab that epithelial glia express Black, which synthesizes β-alanine from aspartate (Ziegler 2013, J Comp Neurol 521: 1207-1224). In the same paper the coexpression of Ebony in the epithelial glia was also demonstrated. This indicates that the machinery to produce β-alanine and carcinine is exactly present in the site involved in β-alanyl-histamine synthesis and probably should be sufficient to maintain the histamine recycling. It is strange that the authors choose not to report the findings of that study, since they bear critically on this submission. What do the authors suppose is the reason that the long way to transport β-alanine into the epithelial glia, as suggested in their manuscript, would offer adaptive advantage and be critical for histamine recycling?

These biochemical processes are not the only ones and there are also reports of alternative pathways for β-alanine synthesis. Borycz et al. (2012) reported more than 10 ng β-alanine/head in the wild type, which is 5 times the histamine head content in these flies. The process of histamine conjugation with β-alanine, mediated by Ebony in the epithelial glia, requires roughly equal amounts of both compounds, which indicates that head β-alanine greatly exceeds the requirements for Ebony function.

The link to glia is a bit weaker: RNAi experiments in two innexins that are supposed to be the delivery route of β-alanine back into the glia are not controlled and not fully convincing. This and a few minor gaps in the story can be fixed in a reasonable amount of time. These fixes should include a better characterization of the balat-mcherry, quantification of ERGs and better immunohistochemistry.</italic></p><p>We improved the immunostaining assays in <italic>balat-mcherry</italic> flies, and now show these results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>.

The authors proposed that β-Ala diffuses between retinal and lamina through gap junctions and provided RNAi evidence that either Inx1 or Inx3 forms the junctions. Although this hypothesis represents the most direct model of β-Ala trafficking, EM studies from both Drosophila and Musca didn't reveal any gap junction between retinal pigment cells and laminar fenestrated glia. It is thus important to discuss on alternative, Inx-independent trafficking mechanisms. The ERG defects of Inx1+Inx3 knockdown flies could have different interpretations. For instances, they could be required for the development of synapses between retinal and laminar neurons (see Curtin et al., 2002, J. Cell Sci.), or for the β-Ala transport into core cells for storage.</italic></p><p>We have analyzed β-alanine levels and performed β-alanine immunostaining of inx1/inx3 double knock-down mutants (data is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H, 4I and 4J</xref>). Β-alanine largely accumulated in the retinal layer. This may represent direct evidence that Inx1/Inx3 functions to transport β-alanine back to glia cells. However, we have been unable to detect gap junctions between these cells at the EM level. Therefore, we discuss the possibilities that developmental roles of Inx may be an alternative explanation (Discussion, fifth paragraph).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p><italic>The authors report a new β-alanine transporter, encoded by CG3790, which they named BalaT, and which is present in the retinal pigment cells of the Drosophila visual system. The results indicate that BalaT is critical for β-alanine recycling together with the action of innexins. The authors demonstrate that lacking BalaT disrupts the normal ERG and phototaxis. The results are consistent with the authors' theory but they run contrary to current knowledge about β-alanine and its sources in the Drosophila head. We know from research reported from the Hovemann lab that epithelial glia express Black, which synthesizes β-alanine from aspartate (Ziegler 2013, J Comp Neurol 521: 1207-1224). In the same paper the coexpression of Ebony in the epithelial glia was also demonstrated. This indicates that the machinery to produce β-alanine and carcinine is exactly present in the site involved in β-alanyl-histamine synthesis and probably should be sufficient to maintain the histamine recycling. It is strange that the authors choose not to report the findings of that study, since they bear critically on this submission. What do the authors suppose is the reason that the long way to transport β-alanine into the epithelial glia, as suggested in their manuscript, would offer adaptive advantage and be critical for histamine recycling? It seems obvious that the more energetically demanding process should be outcompeted by the simpler one. The authors have forgotten to mention, or possibly have overlooked the Ziegler et al. (2013) paper in their manuscript, and in this way have avoided discussing the strongest arguments against their proposed β-alanine recycling pathway. From the work of others (Borycz et al. 2012, J Exp Biol 215: 1399-1411; Ziegler 2013, J Comp Neurol 521: 1207-1224; Rawls 2006, Genetics 172: 1665-1674) it is known that the metabolism of uracil produces β-alanine, so it is a substance present in all living cells.

The abundance of β-alanine may in fact indicate that there is no need to recycle this substance. For these reasons the controversy with the Ziegler at al. (2012) paper should be resolved, and could only be considered in a resubmitted version.</italic></p><p>It is our mistake that we did not discuss in detail the relationship between de novo synthesis and recycle of β-alanine. To remedy this, we have added two paragraphs to the Discussion (second and third paragraphs).</p><p>In wild type flies, β-alanine levels in the head are 5 times higher than histamine. Even in pyd and black double mutant flies, β-alanine levels are still higher than histamine. Black is expressed in Ebony-expressing lamina glia, and serves as the major enzyme in the local generation of β-alanine. The pyrimidine catabolism pathway is an alternative pathway for β-alanine synthesis. However, the <italic>pyd</italic> and <italic>black</italic> double mutant flies do not completely lose the ability to synthesize β-alanine, which may be due to the uptake of exogenous β-alanine. This low level of β-alanine is enough to sustain visual transduction. If β-alanine does not need to be recycled, the phenotype should be the same as seen in ebony mutants. Therefore, the normal visual response in black and <italic>pyd,black</italic> double mutants indicates that the β-alanine shuttle system indeed exists in the visual system. In <italic>balat</italic> mutant flies, levels of β-alanine in the head are reduce as well, but remain a few times higher than histamine. However, <italic>balat</italic> mutant flies display obvious ERG phenotypes, as they lack “on” and “off” transients. If the abundance of β-alanine indicates that there is no need to recycle this substance, we should not observe ERG phenotypes and β-alanine decreases in <italic>balat</italic> mutant fly heads. We could explain this by the β-alanine distribution changes which indicates that the β-alanine trafficking is blocked.</p><p>It has been demonstrated in many cases that de novo synthesis and the recycling of metabolites are both critical to maintain their threshold levels. For example, histamine is easily generated by Hdc in photoreceptor cells. However, the recycling of histamine to photoreceptor cells is also important to sustain visual transduction. Loss of either pathway disrupted visual transduction. However, loss of visual transduction caused by mutations in <italic>Hdc</italic> (which disrupts de novo synthesis) can be fully restored by feeding histamine. The same situation occurred in pyd and black double mutant flies, in which exogenous β-alanine is enough to keep β-alanine levels over histamine. In contrast, feeding histamine did not restore visual transduction in ebony mutants (which affect the recycle pathway). This situation is similar to balat-dependent β-alanine trafficking, which is required for synaptic transmission even though local de novo synthesis takes place in glia cells.</p><p><italic>The authors' interests seem to be one-sided and focus only on β-alanine transport, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>.
