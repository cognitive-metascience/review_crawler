Recently identified as hetero-hexamers formed by LRRC8 proteins, their activation mechanism remains elusive. Here, we measured Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) between fluorescent proteins fused to the C-termini of LRRC8 subunits. Inter-subunit FRET from LRRC8 complexes tracked VRAC activation. With patch-clamp fluorometry, we confirmed that the cytoplasmic domains rearrange during VRAC opening. With these FRET reporters, we determined VRAC activation, non-invasively, in live cells and their subcompartments. Reduced intracellular ionic strength did not directly activate VRACs, and VRACs were not activated on endomembranes. Instead, pharmacological manipulation of diacylglycerol (DAG), and protein kinase D (PKD) activity, activated or inhibited plasma membrane-localized VRACs. Finally, we resolved previous contradictory reports concerning VRAC activation, using FRET to detect robust activation by PMA that was absent during whole-cell patch clamp. Overall, non-invasive VRAC measurement by FRET is an essential tool for unraveling its activation mechanism.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>volume regulation</kwd><kwd>ionic strength</kwd><kwd>FRET</kwd><kwd>LRRC8 heteromer</kwd><kwd>VSOR</kwd><kwd>channel gating</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002347</institution-id><institution>Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>031A314</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stauber</surname><given-names>Tobias</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>VRAC activation, observed with a FRET sensor of intracellular LRRC8-domains movement during gating and by fluorometry, requires plasma membrane localization and diacylglycerol signaling, but is independent of intracellular ionic strength.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Volume regulation is essential for virtually all cell types, not only to counteract osmotic swelling and shrinkage but also during various processes like proliferation, migration and apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hoffmann et al., 2009</xref>). Volume-regulated anion channels (VRACs) are ubiquitously expressed and involved in regulatory volume decrease (RVD) of vertebrate cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jentsch, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Stauber, 2015</xref>). These channels open slowly following osmotic cell swelling and mediate the extrusion of chloride and organic osmolytes, leading to the efflux of water and hence cell shrinkage.</p><p>VRACs are composed of LRRC8 heteromers containing the essential subunit LRRC8A and at least one other LRRC8 protein, LRRC8B-E (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Qiu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Voss et al., 2014</xref>).

Although unlikely to be of physiological relevance, LRRC8A homomers can form anion channels, but with weak volume-sensitivity and very low conductance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Deneka et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Syeda et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yamada and Strange, 2018</xref>). LRRC8 proteins form hexamers with the N-terminal halves of the six LRRC8 proteins constituting the transmembrane domain of the channel complex with a single pore. The C-terminal halves contain at least 16 leucine-rich repeats that form horseshoe-like structures reaching into the cytoplasm and their apparent flexibility has been hypothesized to be related to channel gating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Deneka et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kasuya et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kefauver et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kern et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Prior to cloning, the biophysical properties of VRAC-mediated chloride currents (I<sub>Cl,swell</sub>) and osmolyte conductance were studied extensively using mainly electrophysiological and pharmacological methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">König and Stauber, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pedersen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Strange et al., 2019</xref>); but their activation mechanism remained enigmatic for decades, in the absence of an unequivocal molecular identity for the channel. Numerous studies proposed contributions from membrane tension, the actin cytoskeleton and signaling pathways involving reactive oxygen species, calcium, G-proteins and phosphorylation cascades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akita and Okada, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pedersen et al., 2016</xref>). Notably, the reduction of intracellular ionic strength (Γ<sub>i</sub>) was reported to be crucial for VRAC activation upon osmotic cell swelling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Voets et al., 1999</xref>) and reconstituted LRRC8 complexes in lipid bilayers could indeed be activated by low ionic strength (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Syeda et al., 2016</xref>). However, VRACs can also be activated under iso-osmotic conditions that are unlikely to encompass any changes in Γ<sub>i</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pedersen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Strange et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Here, we use intra-complex Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) to monitor VRAC activity in a spatio-temporal manner.

In HeLa cells co-expressing CFP- and YFP tagged LRRC8A (A-CFP/A-YFP), bleaching of YFP (the FRET acceptor) robustly increased the intensity of CFP (the FRET donor), compared to unbleached cells in the same field of view (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>). The same was observed when LRRC8A was combined with the VRAC subunit LRRC8E (A-CFP/E-YFP or A-YFP/E-CFP), but not when combined with plasma membrane-localized CD4-YFP, used as control for FRET by membrane crowding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).

We used sensitized-emission FRET and monitored the corrected FRET (cFRET, see Materials and methods) values in HeLa cells expressing A-CFP/E-YFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Switching from isotonic (340 mOsm) to hypotonic (250 mOsm) buffer led to a robust decrease in cFRET by 5–10% within 90 s in both HeLa and HEK293 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). In contrast, the intra-molecular cFRET of a cytosolic tandem FRET pair construct, CFP-18aa-YFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Elder et al., 2009</xref>), and of a plasma membrane-localized ionotropic glutamate receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zachariassen et al., 2016</xref>) were unaffected by hypotonic buffer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). These observations rule out FRET artifacts from changes of osmolarity or ion concentrations. To better understand the cFRET changes with the activation of VRAC, we expressed fluorescently-labelled A-CFP/E-YFP (in this case Cerulean/Venus, see Materials and methods) in HEK293 cells deficient for all five LRRC8 genes (HEK293 KO) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lutter et al., 2017</xref>) and monitored cFRET and whole-cell currents simultaneously using patch-clamp fluorometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zheng and Zagotta, 2003</xref>). The kinetics of the cFRET drop and its reversibility correlated with the activation and inactivation of hypotonicity-induced VRAC-mediated anion currents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>), demonstrating that the cFRET decrease indeed reflects VRAC opening. The current was in addition to any potential residual activity at isotonicity due to the fluorescent tags (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gaitán-Peñas et al., 2016</xref>). A progressive decrease in cFRET accompanied additional hypotonicity but, again mirroring VRAC, cFRET did not increase with hypertonic treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). We frequently observed varying extents of intracellular retention of LRRC8A or LRRC8E. We did not see a correlation between intensity of CFP or YFP and absolute cFRET values (not shown), neither did relative changes in cFRET depend on the A-CFP/E-YFP expression ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Remarkably, cFRET also decreased for A-CFP/A-YFP constructs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), providing evidence for activation of homomeric LRRC8A complexes in a cellular context.</p><p>Overall, these cFRET measurements show that the C-termini of LRRC8 proteins in VRAC complexes rearrange during activation and that this can be exploited to monitor their activity in living cells via FRET microscopy.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Reduced ionic strength does not activate VRAC on endomembranes</title><p>Reduced ionic strength is sufficient to activate reconstituted VRACs in lipid bilayer droplets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Syeda et al., 2016</xref>). To measure intracellular ionic strength, we used a FRET-based sensor that reports the electrostatic attraction between arginine and aspartate residues in opposed α-helices (‘RD’ sensor) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Liu et al., 2017</xref>). As expected, this sensor indicated a reversible decrease in Γ<sub>i</sub> in HeLa cells during hypotonic treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Notably, the decrease was homogeneous over the entire cell volume (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig2video1">Figure 2—video 1</xref>). If a decline in Γ<sub>i</sub> were sufficient to activate VRAC, then we hypothesized that it should already do so in the secretory pathway. To test for this, we trapped FRET-endowed VRACs in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by treatment with brefeldin-A (BFA) during expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). FRET and hence complex formation in the ER of A-CFP/E-YFP (but not A-CFP/CD4-YFP) was confirmed by acceptor bleaching (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). However, ER-trapped VRACs surprisingly did not respond to hypotonic treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). This was likely not due to incomplete glycosylation since mutation of the LRRC8A N-glycosylation sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Voss et al., 2014</xref>) did not impinge on the activation-dependent cFRET drop at the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.45421.006</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Hypotonicity reduces ionic strength over the whole cell, but does not activate intracellular VRACs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Changes of ionic strength measured in HeLa cells expressing the ratiometric RD sensor during hypotonic treatment.

In agreement with earlier reports on I<sub>Cl,swell</sub> in lymphocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Levitan et al., 1995</xref>), depolymerization of the actin cytoskeleton by latrunculin B did not alter VRAC activation by ~25% hypotonicity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A,B</xref>). In contrast, cholesterol depletion by methyl-β-cyclodextrin potentiated VRAC activation, as judged by the reduction in cFRET (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B,C</xref>), as was previously shown for VRAC-mediated I<sub>Cl,swell</sub> in bovine aortic endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Levitan et al., 2000</xref>). However, absence of cholesterol is unlikely to underlie plasma membrane localization as a prerequisite for VRAC activation, since the ER membrane usually has lower cholesterol concentrations than the plasma membrane.</p><p>Phospholipase C (PLC) activity was reported as a determinant of I<sub>Cl,swell</sub> activation, but contradictory results abound for the involvement of protein kinase C (PKC), activated by the PLC product diacylglycol (DAG) is required (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hermoso et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Roman et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zholos et al., 2005</xref>). PKC contains a C1 domain and can hence be activated by phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA). In isotonic conditions, PMA evoked a robust decrease in cFRET in HeLa and HEK293 cells expressing A-CFP/A-YFP or A-CFP/E-YFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), but not CFP-18aa-YFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). This reflects gating of the LRRC8 complex, because subsequent inactivation of VRAC by treatment with hyper-osmotic solution restored basal FRET levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Like hypotonicity-driven VRAC activation, activation by PMA required cell surface localization, as VRACs released from aggregation were immune to PMA in the ER and Golgi, but they were activated at the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Surprisingly, recording HEK293 KO cells expressing A-CFP/E-YFP in whole-cell voltage-clamp configuration, we could no longer detect any FRET reduction, nor did PMA activate VRAC currents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). To test whether this discrepancy was due to the absence of endogenous LRRC8 proteins, or to the dialysis of the cell contents during whole-cell patch, we first incubated HEK293 KO cells expressing A-CFP/E-YFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, left panel) and wild-type (WT) HEK293 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, right panel) with PMA for at least five minutes before membrane breakthrough. We then established the whole-cell configuration for immediate current measurements. Indeed, with this experimental design we observed a reliable increase in classical VRAC currents in HEK293 KO cells expressing A-CFP/E-YFP incubated with PMA. The increase was robust compared to cells in isotonic buffer alone, or untransfected HEK293 KO cells incubated with PMA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). This result demonstrates that the whole-cell voltage-clamp configuration affects signaling pathways involved in activation of VRAC in a time-dependent manner, an experimental caveat that can be overcome with our non-invasive FRET sensor.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.45421.014</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>VRAC activation by PMA.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Addition PMA (1 µM, indicated by arrows) activated VRACs composed of A-CFP/A-YFP (left; 11 cells), A-CFP/E-YFP (middle; 12 cells) in HeLa cells or A-CFP/A-YFP in HEK293 cells (right; 12 cells).

The activation of low-conducting VRACs composed of only LRRC8A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Deneka et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kefauver et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Syeda et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yamada and Strange, 2018</xref>) could also be detected by FRET. Importantly, the non-invasive, genetically-encoded FRET sensor enables the study of VRAC in connection with signaling pathways that are altered (presumably by dialysis of critical signaling molecules) by the whole-cell patch-clamp configuration. This way we could observe VRAC activation by PMA, which was otherwise blocked by whole-cell patch clamp of cells.</p><p>Cryo-EM structures of VRAC complexes suggest a certain flexibility of their C-terminal leucine-rich domains (LRRDs) on the intracellular side. Related conformational rearrangements might be related to channel gating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Deneka et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kasuya et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kefauver et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kern et al., 2019</xref>). In support of this idea, we observe a decrease in FRET between fluorophores at the C-termini of LRRC8 proteins upon VRAC activation, which may reflect a displacement of LRRDs or possibly a simple change in the average orientation of the fluorophores to each other. Thus, as has previously been shown for cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zheng and Zagotta, 2000</xref>), slow gating of CLC chloride channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bykova et al., 2006</xref>), BK potassium channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Miranda et al., 2013</xref>) and ionotropic glutamate receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zachariassen et al., 2016</xref>), changes in FRET demonstrate movement of the cytosolic domains during VRAC activation.</p><p>VRACs were previously shown to be directly activated by low ionic strength in lipid bilayer reconstitution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Syeda et al., 2016</xref>). However, we find that reduced Γ<sub>i</sub> is neither sufficient to activate VRAC on intracellular compartments, nor is it indispensable to keep plasma membrane-localized VRACs active. When cells were treated with the DAG kinase inhibitor DOG, VRAC remained active in isotonic buffer after activation by hypotonicity, even though Γ<sub>i</sub> recovered to normal levels. The notion that ionic strength directly activates VRACs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sabirov et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Voets et al., 1999</xref>) has been controversial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">König and Stauber, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Strange et al., 2019</xref>). Several studies reported VRAC activation when isotonic fluid was injected into, or inactivation when fluid was withdrawn from the cells without altering the intracellular ionic strength (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Best and Brown, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cannon et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Poletto Chaves and Varanda, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhang and Lieberman, 1996</xref>). Moreover, the extents of low ionic strength required for VRAC activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cannon et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Deneka et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nilius et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Syeda et al., 2016</xref>) are unlikely to occur in physiological conditions or during whole-cell current measurements routinely used to study hypotonicity-induced VRAC currents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Strange et al., 2019</xref>). Instead, a putative role for ionic strength in controlling the volume set point for VRAC activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Best and Brown, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cannon et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jackson et al., 1996</xref>) would be consistent with our findings.</p><p>Rather than ionic strength, we observe a specific and potent action of the DAG-PKD pathway in VRAC activation. Application of PMA led to VRAC opening even under isotonic conditions and VRACs did not inactivate completely in isotonic buffer after activation by hypotonicity when the consumption of DAG by DAG kinase was inhibited. A role for DAG, which is generated by the activity of phospholipases C (PLCs), in the signaling for VRAC activation has been reported previously, for example (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Roman et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rudkouskaya et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zholos et al., 2005</xref>). However, there are multiple contradictory reports on the involvement of DAG-activated PKCs. In some studies, PKCs were shown to be required for regulatory volume decrease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hermoso et al., 2004</xref>), activation of swelling-induced VRAC currents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Roman et al., 1998</xref>) and ATP-induced VRAC-mediated glutamate release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hyzinski-García et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rudkouskaya et al., 2008</xref>). These results are somewhat compromised by variations in the efficacy of pharmacological PKC inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Haskew-Layton et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mongin and Kimelberg, 2005</xref>). Other studies found no role for PKC despite a VRAC-activating effect of DAG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zholos et al., 2005</xref>), or even reduction or prevention of hypotonicity-induced VRAC-mediated currents by pharmacological PKC inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ben Soussia et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Shlyonsky et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">von Weikersthal et al., 1999</xref>). While our data speak against a core role for PKC in VRAC activation, they do not rule out a regulatory role for this kinase family. Instead, our experiments reveal that protein kinase D (PKD) activity is critically involved in hypotonicity-induced activation of VRAC. LRRC8 proteins possess several putative and some confirmed phosphorylation sites for various kinases in their intracellular loops and C-terminal domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abascal and Zardoya, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mongin, 2016</xref>). As opposed to direct phosphorylation of LRRC8 subunits, PKD may act on another, as yet unknown, third party in the process of VRAC activation.</p><p>The central role for DAG and PKD, however, does not explain the observed plasma membrane requirement for VRAC activation by hypotonicity as PKD is also recruited to endomembranes of the secretory pathway by DAG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baron and Malhotra, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fu and Rubin, 2011</xref>). Plasma membrane-intrinsic properties such as membrane stiffness, the lipid composition, including the amount of cholesterol and different phosphatidylinositol phosphates (PIPs), or the transmembrane potential may play a role. Besides, further limiting factors are likely to be involved, potentially explaining why the overexpression of functional LRRC8 heteromers does not increase I<sub>Cl,swell</sub> above wild-type levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Voss et al., 2014</xref>) and similar VRAC subunit expression levels displayed different activities in different cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Okada et al., 2017</xref>). Such limiting factors at the plasma membrane could include substrates of PKD. Although we also observed PMA-mediated activation of LRRC8A homomers, regulatory proteins could require particular VRAC subunit combinations to contribute to VRAC activation. Alternatively, cell type-specific factors may exist, explaining inconsistent findings on the signal transduction pathways impinging on VRAC activation. This could explain divergent results related to PKC in different cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ben Soussia et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hermoso et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Roman et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">von Weikersthal et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zholos et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>In summary, activation-dependent inter-subunit FRET in VRACs demonstrated movement of their C-termini and enabled subcellular monitoring of VRAC activity. Importantly, this noninvasive FRET sensor supersedes some aspects of electrophysiological measurements because it leaves intracellular signaling pathways untouched. Measurement of FRET can also be used for non-invasive structure-activity studies. The genetic encoding of this sensor also makes it highly amenable to studying VRAC activation during various cell physiological processes in situ.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or <break/>reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td valign="top">HeLa</td><td valign="top">RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_0030">CVCL_0030</ext-link></td><td valign="top">ACC no. 57</td><td valign="top">Obtained from Leibniz Forschungsinstitut DSMZ (Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen undZellkulturen GmbH, Germany)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td valign="top">HEK293</td><td valign="top">RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_0045">CVCL_0045</ext-link></td><td valign="top">ACC no. 305</td><td valign="top">Obtained from LeibnizForschungsinstitut DSMZ (Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen GmbH, Germany)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td valign="top">HEK293 KO (<italic>LRRC8</italic><sup>-/-</sup>)</td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lutter et al., 2017</xref> (PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28193731">28193731</ext-link>)</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Gift from T.J.

To stain the actin cytoskeleton, PFA-fixed cells (as above) were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton-X100 in PBS + 1% BSA for 5 min at room temperature and incubated with Alexa Fluor 546-phalloidin (Thermo Fisher Scientific) diluted 1:1000 in PBS + 1% BSA at room temperature for 1 hr, washed with PBS, air dried and mounted on glass cover slides for imaging with a rhodamine filter set (EX:540/23, DC:580,EM:590 lp). Cells co-expressing LRRC8A-CFP-FM<sub>2</sub> with organelle markers were fixed and mounted as described above 24 hr after transfection and incubation with D/D solubilizer for the indicated times. Images where acquired with filter sets for CFP (EX:436/20, DC:455 EM:480/40), YFP (EX:500/20, DC:515, EM:535/30) and rhodamine (as above).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Acceptor photo-bleaching, sensitized-emission and ratiometric FRET assays</title><p>FRET experiments were performed on a high-speed setup of Leica Microsystems (Dmi6000B stage, 63x/1.4 objective, high speed external Leica filter wheels with Leica FRET set filters (11522073), EL6000 light source, DFC360 FX camera, controlled by Las AF). All experiments were executed at room temperature. Isotonic imaging buffer (340 mOsm) contained (in mM): 150 NaCl, 6 KCl, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.5 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 glucose,10 HEPES, pH 7.4. NaCl was adjusted for osmolarity titration in hypotonicity; standard hypotonic buffer (250 mOsm) contained 105 mM NaCl. Hypertonic buffers were as isotonic buffer supplemented with 60 mM (for 400 mOsm) or 160 mM (for 500 mOsm) mannitol.</p><p>Acceptor bleaching experiments were conducted on field-of views (FOVs) with at least two cells expressing both fluorescent proteins. An image in both CFP and YFP channels was taken per time point. To bleach only part of the FOV, the field diaphragm was closed until control cells were no longer illuminated. Cells were bleached with 515–560 nm light at full intensity (Leica filter cube N2.1) for 2.5–5 min per time point until YFP signals reached below 10% of initial intensity. Intensities of CFP and YFP for respective time points were measured in Fiji in background-subtracted images and the percentage change of CFP intensity calculated for bleached and control cells.</p><p>Sensitized-emission FRET (seFRET) images were recorded with the same settings for donor, acceptor and FRET channels (8 × 8 binning, 100 ms exposure, gain 1) every 10–20 s.

Because of the variability in absolute FRET values between individual cells, cFRET values of individual cells were normalized to their mean cFRET in isotonic buffer.</p><p>For monitoring ionic strength in living cells, we used the ratiometric FRET-based RD sensor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Liu et al., 2017</xref>). Sequential images of the CFP and FRET channels were acquired using the same filters as for seFRET experiments every 10 s. Images were acquired with 2 × 2 binning, 500 ms exposure, gain 3.0 and intensity four for hypotonicity experiments and with 8 × 8 binning, 127 ms exposure, gain 3.0 and intensity two for DOG experiments. Ratio maps of I_FRET/I_Cerulean were created from background-subtracted images in Fiji and mean ratio values were taken from hand-drawn ROIs of individual cells. To account for ionic strength differences between individual cells, ratios were normalized to baseline values in isotonic buffer.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Electrophysiology and simultaneous seFRET measurements</title><p>For whole-cell patch-clamp recordings, the isotonic bath solution was composed as follows (in mM): 150 NaCl, 6 KCl, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.5 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 glucose, and 10 HEPES, pH 7.4 with NaOH (320 mOsm). We used an intracellular (pipette) solution with the following composition (in mM): 40 CsCl, 100 Cs-methanesulfonate, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.9 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 5 EGTA, 4 Na<sub>2</sub>ATP, and 10 HEPES, with pH adjusted to 7.2 with CsOH (290 mOsm). For VRAC activation, cells were perfused with drugs and/or a hypotonic buffer containing (in mM) 105 NaCl, 6 CsCl, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.5 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 glucose, 10 HEPES, pH 7.4 with NaOH (240 mOsm). The osmolarities of all solutions were measured with a vapor pressure osmometer (VAPRO 5600, Elitech). Pipettes had a resistance of 3–5 MΩ when filled with intracellular solution, and we used ISO-type pipette holders (G23 Instruments) to minimize pipette drift. For cells overexpressing exogenous, fluorescently-labelled VRAC constructs, the success rate for obtaining a gigaseal and whole-cell configuration were &lt;20%, compared to &gt;50% for wild-type untransfected HEK293 cells. Whole-cell recordings from cells overexpressing VRAC were also less stable. For normalizing current to cell capacitance, we used the capacitance from the manual compensation of transients from the Axopatch 200B amplifier (Molecular Devices). After whole-cell configuration was obtained, cells were held at –30 mV and the currents were recorded using Axograph X (Axograph Scientific) via an Instrutech ITC-18 D-A interface (HEKA Elektronik). The standard protocol for VRAC current recordings consisted of 9 episodes of a 0.5 s step to –80 mV every 12 s, followed by a 3 s voltage step protocol (300 ms steps to –40, 0, 40, 80, 100 mV in turn). This protocol was repeated throughout the recording. The voltage-step protocol confirmed VRAC-typical properties of outward rectification and depolarization-dependent inactivation for LRRC8A/E-containing VRAC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">König and Stauber, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ullrich et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Voss et al., 2014</xref>). Excitation by 445 and 514 nm diode lasers (iChrome MLE, Toptica Photonics) for CFP and YFP was directed through a manual total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) input to an Olympus IX81 microscope. We used a 40 × Olympus objective (NA 0.6) for all recordings. For simultaneous ratiometric FRET recordings, filters specific to donor and acceptor excitation and emission wavelengths were alternated using the fluorescence turret. We controlled the microscope turret control with an in-house script written in PYTHON. Briefly, the turret was synchronized to the electrophysiology acquisition computer using voltage output from the digitizer via an Arduino microcontroller to a reverse-engineered serial connection (using the PySerial library; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pythonhosted.org/pyserial/index.html">https://pythonhosted.org/pyserial/index.html</ext-link>) from a second computer to the IX81 microscope. Fluorescence intensities in response to 445 and 514 nm excitation were recorded sequentially with 100 ms exposure time and 2 × 2 binning on a Prime 95B CMOS camera (Photometrics) fitted to Cairn Optosplit-II. CFP and YFP emission were split with a T495lpxr dichroic mirror, and recorded on the same frame after passing through ET520/40 m (YFP) and ET470/24 m (CFP) filters (all mounted within the Optosplit, all Chroma). Exposures were timed to precede the –80 mV voltage steps. Laser emission and camera exposure were triggered in hardware directly from the digitizer. Images were recorded with Micromanager (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Edelstein et al., 2014</xref>) and analyzed with FIJI as described above.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Reverse aggregation system</title><p>A-CFP-FM<sub>2</sub>- or A-CFP-FM<sub>2</sub>/E-YFP-expressing cells were measured 24 hr post-transfection. Aggregates were released by adding 0.5 µM D/D solubilizer (TaKaRa) to the growth medium and incubation for 10, 80 or 165 min at 37°C in 5% CO<sub>2</sub> before seFRET measurements. All buffers used during the measurement contained 0.5 µM D/D solubilizer. Mean cFRET was acquired from manually-drawn ROIs over the whole cell for ER- and plasma membrane-localized VRAC. For plasma membrane, only cells with clear plasma membrane localization were selected by visual inspection. To determine the cFRET of Golgi-localized VRAC, masks were created on CFP images by applying a threshold over the high-intensity, juxta-nuclear regions and applying these masks on the respective cFRET maps.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Data are represented as mean of individual cells ± standard deviation (s.d.) or mean of n (number of independent experiments) ± standard error of the mean (s.e.m.) as indicated.

What follows is the editors’ letter requesting such plan.]</p><p>Thank you for sending your article entitled &quot;FRET changes by C-terminal movement reveal VRAC activation by plasma membrane PKC signaling rather than ionic strength&quot; for peer review at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article is being evaluated by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation is being overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Richard Aldrich as the Senior Editor.</p><p>Given the list of essential revisions, including new experiments, the editors and reviewers invite you to respond within the next two weeks with an action plan and timetable for the completion of the additional work. We plan to share your responses with the reviewers and then issue a binding recommendation.</p><p>The three reviewers agree that the main concern in this paper is that there isn't a validation by electrophysiology of the FRET data. It is essential that you perform simultaneous experiments measuring FRET and current in response to the activating stimuli. If this is not within your technical possibilities, at least the same kind of experiments to measure FRET should be repeated by electrophysiology. It is also essential that the FRET and imaging data is presented in a clearer manner and that the PKC FRET experiments be also validate by electrophysiology. Please see the reviewers report below for a more detailed list of comments.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This paper by the Stauber group presents results from experiments in which they have measured a FRET signal between an attached fluorescent protein pair in the LRRC8A or E proteins which form the volume-regulated VRAC channels. The measurements show that the FRET signal is modulated by application of hypotonic solutions. The authors assert that the signal is related to activation of the VRAC channel and present further experimental evidence that activation is also mediated by activation of PKC phosphorylation. The experimental methods are adequate and in general the conclusions are supported by the evidence.</p><p>There are a few points that need to be presented in a clearer manner. In particular, while there is evidence that the FRET signal is specific of LRRC8, the authors cite a couple of reviews as evidence that the FRET signal correlates with the time course of activation of VRAC by the same stimulus. However, the evidence in those references shows activation of VRAC by voltage clamp stimuli occurs in an ms time scale and no data is shown on the time course of responses to a hypertonic stimulus. The authors need to show a parallel experiment showing the magnitude of the VRAC current produced by LRRC8A/A and LRRC8A/E in their particular expression system.</p><p>Voltage-clamp experiments show that VRAC currents inactivate in response to sustained applied stimulus. It is important to discuss the sustained nature of the FRET signal if it is related to channel activation. Is it thought that there are distinct gates for each modality of channel activation?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>For editors</p><p>The authors developed a highly interesting assay to monitor activity of LRRC8 mediated VRAC channels using a purely optical FRET based assay. Such an assay could be useful for structure-function studies, as well as for studies of VRAC function in physiological settings. However, a major criticism is that the assay has not been validated by parallel electrophysiological measurements. In case the authors can provide such validation I would be in favor of publication.</p><p>For authors</p><p>The manuscript by König et al., reports a method to monitor VRAC/LRRC8 volume sensitive channel activity in a time- and space-resolved manner by measuring intra-complex FRET between C-terminally fused fluorescent proteins. Two major aims are pursued: first, to demonstrate the flexibility of the leucine-rich-repeat domains (LRRDs) and their involvement in the gating of the channel; second, to provide evidence that low intracellular ionic strength is not the physiologically relevant parameter for the opening of VRACs. Rather, the authors propose that activation under hypotonic stimulation is coupled to PKC activity.</p><p>In addition, the authors use the assay to show that LRRC8 mediated VRAC is not activatable in endomembranes, but only in the plasma membrane.</p><p>The crucial questions driving the work are laudable and potentially very important for the field. In particular, the method of introducing an intramolecular FRET sensor of subunit distance is highly innovative and potentially very useful. The possibility to monitor LRRC8 activity with a purely optical assay is very intriguing.</p><p>However, several technical controls are necessary to fully validate the assay. Most importantly, it is mandatory that the assay itself, and other results, are corroborated by electrophysiological data.</p><p>All the experiments should be complemented with electrophysiological recordings. In principle, it would be most convincing if the FRET assay could be performed on the same cell that is patch-clamped to verify that FRET changes reflect current activation. Since this maybe technically too demanding, it is at least necessary to validate the constructs used by electrophysiological recordings, under the same conditions as the FRET assay. Attaching fluorescent proteins to the C-terminus might alter the &quot;volume-sensitivity&quot; by itself.

These channels are heterohexamers composed of the obligatory subunit LRRC8A and additional LRRC8-B-E subunits. The mechanism of activation of VRAC in not understood, but it has been proposed to be related to conformational changes at its C-terminus, and has been shown to be triggered by reduced ionic strength in a reconstituted system. In the present manuscript, Benjamin Koenig and collaborators construct a FRET-based VRAC-activity sensor by fusing the C-termini of different subunits with either of two fluorescence proteins capable of FRET. The authors show changes in FRET in response to hypotonic media that are reversible upon return to isotonic conditions, with kinetics and pharmacology that is consistent with the signal originating from VRAC activation. They also show that hypotonicity-driven FRET changes occur only for channels in the plasma membrane, whereas those located at intracellular compartments (ER and golgi) don't exhibit changes in FRET. They demonstrate that the requirement for activity of localization in the plasma membrane does not involve differences in cholesterol concentration or the integrity of the actin cytoskeleton. In contrast, the authors find that stimulation of PKC activity leads to prominent FRET changes similar to those produced by hypertonic media, whereas inhibition of PKC prevents FRET changes in response to hypotonic media. The authors have developed a set of clever tools to follow VRAC activity without requiring electrophysiological measurements, and provide relevant information on the cell-physiological conditions that enable VRAC activity and on the role of the C-terminus in channel activation. However, I think the manuscript would be much stronger if the authors provided more direct evidence that the FRET changes are indeed connected with channel activation.

However, the evidence supporting this is not direct, but rather depends on correlative observations of the effects of non-specific treatments that could also affect other processes in the cell. It is possible that the FRET changes reflect a conformational change that is independent or at least partially independent of activation. This issue is particularly important given that the role of the C-terminus for activation has not been well established. I think the manuscript would be significantly stronger if the authors could provide more direct evidence for this, by performing electrophysiological measurements in combination with FRET measurements, or by using additional specific VRAC inhibitors or performing experiments with loss-of-function VRAC subunits.</p><p>2) One of the main observations of the paper is that localization in the plasma membrane is required for the observed FRET changes and channel activation. However, there is a significant amount of intracellularly located LRRC8 subunits even without treatment with BFA (see LRRC8E-RFP in Figure 2C, for example), and the hypotonicity-dependent FRET signals shown in Figure 1 appear to originate from the entire cell (see Figure 1D). The authors should address this apparent contradiction, and provide detailed information on the way they performed their analysis to measure signals mostly originating from the plasma membrane. The observation that LRRC8E appears to be more heavily retained in the ER that LRRC8A (see Figure 2C) seems to counter the observation that the 8A/8E ratio does not correlate with the observed changes in FRET, except if the majority of the measured FRET signal originates from the plasma membrane.

It is essential that you perform simultaneous experiments measuring FRET and current in response to the activating stimuli. If this is not within your technical possibilities, at least the same kind of experiments to measure FRET should be repeated by electrophysiology. It is also essential that the FRET and imaging data is presented in a clearer manner and that the PKC FRET experiments be also validate by electrophysiology. Please see the reviewers report below for a more detailed list of comments.</p></disp-quote><p>As we describe in the point-by-point response below, we have aimed to address all these points. We have conducted patch-clamp fluorometry to measure FRET and currents simultaneously, demonstrating the relation of the change in FRET signal with VRAC activation. We improved the presentation of our data and experimental methods. Furthermore, we have performed electrophysiological experiments and simultaneous FRET/current measurements to investigate the activation mechanism of VRAC. By doing so, we have confirmed the role of diacylglycerol. Instead of PKC, we were able to identify a role for PKD in VRAC activation by using the combined power of electrophysiology and our FRET sensor. In addition, we have surprisingly found whole-cell configuration-related artifacts that have would have remained uncovered without our optical tool.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>This paper by the Stauber group presents results from experiments in which they have measured a FRET signal between an attached fluorescent protein pair in the LRRC8A or E proteins which form the volume-regulated VRAC channels. The measurements show that the FRET signal is modulated by application of hypotonic solutions. The authors assert that the signal is related to activation of the VRAC channel and present further experimental evidence that activation is also mediated by activation of PKC phosphorylation. The experimental methods are adequate and in general the conclusions are supported by the evidence.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for these positive comments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There are a few points that need to be presented in a clearer manner. In particular, while there is evidence that the FRET signal is specific of LRRC8, the authors cite a couple of reviews as evidence that the FRET signal correlates with the time course of activation of VRAC by the same stimulus. However, the evidence in those references shows activation of VRAC by voltage clamp stimuli occurs in an ms time scale and no data is shown on the time course of responses to a hypertonic stimulus. The authors need to show a parallel experiment showing the magnitude of the VRAC current produced by LRRC8A/A and LRRC8A/E in their particular expression system.</p></disp-quote><p>Following the reviewers’ suggestions, we have now performed patch-clamp fluorometry to simultaneously measure FRET and currents of LRRC8A-CFP/E-YFP in HEK293 cells deficient in endogenous VRAC. These measurements demonstrated that the time course of FRET changes correlated with the current activation and inactivation when applying hypotonic buffer and consecutively isotonic buffer (new Figure 1F). This replaces the citation of the reviews at this position. So far, we were not able to measure currents from LRRC8A/A homomeric channels – perhaps due to the extremely low conductance (Gaitán-Peñas et al., 2016; Deneka et al., 2018).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Voltage-clamp experiments show that VRAC currents inactivate in response to sustained applied stimulus. It is important to discuss the sustained nature of the FRET signal if it is related to channel activation. Is it thought that there are distinct gates for each modality of channel activation?</p></disp-quote><p>As also seen in our simultaneous FRET/current measurements, the FRET signal (reduced FRET, correlating to active VRAC) follows the currents (which we measure at -80mV). Sustained VRAC activity in hypotonicity is not unusual both in whole-cell voltage-clamp mode (e.g. reviewed by Pederson et al., 2016, and shown in their Figure 1A) and cells not subjected to whole-cell patch clamp (as seen in numerous experiments investigating VRAC-mediated osmolyte efflux). Time-dependent inactivation by non-physiological depolarized voltages is typical for VRAC currents (with the inactivation kinetics and voltage-dependence varying with LRRC8 subunit composition – Voss et al., 2014, Ullrich et al., 2016). We observed this characteristic inactivation in our voltage-step protocol measurements that we routinely conducted to confirm that the currents we measured were mediated by VRAC (new Figure 1F and new Figure 4C). There are likely distinct gates for activation/inactivation by osmolarity and depolarization-induced inactivation, but a discussion on this is beyond the scope of this study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>For editors</p><p>The authors developed a highly interesting assay to monitor activity of LRRC8 mediated VRAC channels using a purely optical FRET based assay. Such an assay could be useful for structure-function studies, as well as for studies of VRAC function in physiological settings. However, a major criticism is that the assay has not been validated by parallel electrophysiological measurements. In case the authors can provide such validation I would be in favor of publication.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the generally positive comments. Following the reviewers’ suggestions, we have now performed a series of electrophysiological measurements, also in parallel to our FRET assay.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>For authors</p><p>The manuscript by König et al., reports a method to monitor VRAC/LRRC8 volume sensitive channel activity in a time- and space-resolved manner by measuring intra-complex FRET between C-terminally fused fluorescent proteins. Two major aims are pursued: first, to demonstrate the flexibility of the leucine-rich-repeat domains (LRRDs) and their involvement in the gating of the channel; second, to provide evidence that low intracellular ionic strength is not the physiologically relevant parameter for the opening of VRACs. Rather, the authors propose that activation under hypotonic stimulation is coupled to PKC activity.</p><p>In addition, the authors use the assay to show that LRRC8 mediated VRAC is not activatable in endomembranes, but only in the plasma membrane.</p><p>The crucial questions driving the work are laudable and potentially very important for the field. In particular, the method of introducing an intramolecular FRET sensor of subunit distance is highly innovative and potentially very useful. The possibility to monitor LRRC8 activity with a purely optical assay is very intriguing.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for these positive comments. Indeed, we now see a major advantage of a purely optical assay – we do not dialyze the cell and lose signaling pathways.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>However, several technical controls are necessary to fully validate the assay. Most importantly, it is mandatory that the assay itself, and other results, are corroborated by electrophysiological data.</p><p>All the experiments should be complemented with electrophysiological recordings. In principle, it would be most convincing if the FRET assay could be performed on the same cell that is patch-clamped to verify that FRET changes reflect current activation. Since this maybe technically too demanding, it is at least necessary to validate the constructs used by electrophysiological recordings, under the same conditions as the FRET assay. Attaching fluorescent proteins to the C-terminus might alter the &quot;volume-sensitivity&quot; by itself. In fact, the addition of fluorescent proteins to the C-terminus resulted in constitutive anion channel activity in Xenopus oocytes (Gaitán-Peñas et al., 2016).</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by the reviewers, we have now performed patch-clamp fluorometry and measured FRET and current in the same cells. We found that (as previously described by Gaitán-Peñas et al., 2016) the tagged constructs yielded residual currents in isotonicity. Nonetheless, the currents were clearly potentiated by hypotonicity (as shown with measurements in oocytes by Gaitán-Peñas et al., 2016). This rendered the measurements indeed technically demanding (with a gigaseal rate below 20% overexpressing cells versus more than 50% success rate in wild-type cells), as also stated by Gaitán-Peñas et al., 2016: “However, we found this to be extremely difficult because of a very low success rate of giga-seal formation. In the few successful recordings, constitutive VRAC-like channel activity could be observed (data not shown).” Nonetheless, by using patch-clamp fluorometry we could convincingly confirm the relationship of the observed FRET changes with the activation of VRAC.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors propose a central role for PKC in the gating of the channel and indicate that its pharmacological inhibition prevented hypotonicity-driven VRAC opening. Again, this result should be verified by electrophysiological recordings employing the same constructs, and constructs without tag – a quantitative comparison of the current density with and without application of PMA / Gö6983 / staurosporine is necessary.</p></disp-quote><p>We first confirmed that PMA also induced a reduction in cFRET in HEK293 in addition to HeLa cells (new right panel in Figure 4A) and that cFRET changes were specific for VRAC, since an unrelated FRET sensor (CFP-18aa-YFP) did not respond to PMA (new Figure 4—figure supplement 1A). Subsequently, we have performed electrophysiological experiments on cells overexpressing our fluorescently-tagged LRRC8 constructs and on wild-type cells with endogenous VRAC to investigate the role of DAG (and PMA)-activated kinases.</p><p>Remarkably, and at first in apparent contradiction to our results from the FRET measurements, we found that PMA did not activate VRAC in clamped cells (new Figure 4B). Neither the current, nor –surprisingly- the cFRET were affected by PMA application. However, when we incubated the cells with PMA before establishing the whole-cell configuration, we detected activation of fluorescently-tagged VRAC and of endogenous VRAC, as shown in new Figure 4C. Therefore, we could validate our cFRET data by electrophysiological methods and could show for the first time that whole-cell patching of cells affects signaling in the VRAC activation pathway, possibly by cell dialyzes. Electrophysiological measurements further verified the inhibiting effect of DOG (inhibitor of the DAG kinase) on VRAC inactivation after hypotonicity for both fluorescently tagged LRRC8s and for endogenous VRAC (new Figure 5C), corroborating the role of DAG signaling in VRAC activation.</p><p>Our attempts to confirm the effect of Gö6983 on cFRET by electrophysiological measurements led to paradoxical results. In cells held in the whole-cell patch-clamp configuration, we observed a tremendous increase in cFRET by a factor of four, which we simply cannot explain. In parallel, Gö6983 did not inhibit VRAC currents, in fact falsifying the proposed role of PKC in VRAC activation. Indeed, we would have missed this point without performing the electrophysiological control experiments suggested by the three reviewers. We have changed all respective statements in the manuscript accordingly. Instead, application of Gö6983 reduced the inactivation of currents when we changed buffers from hypotonic to isotonic. We show these data in new Figure 4—figure supplement 2, but avoid drawing strong conclusions.</p><p>Having ruled out PKC as a core mediator of VRAC activation by diacylglycerol (or PMA), we tested PKD, which can also be recruited to the membrane and activated by DAG (and PMA). In contrast to Gö6983, the PKD inhibitor CRT 0066101 reduced hypotonicity-induced VRAC currents both during clamping and when applied before membrane breakthrough (new Figure 5A,B).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>Volume-regulated anion channels (VRACs) play a central role in the modulation of cell volume in animals, by enabling the flow of chloride ions and larger osmolytes out of the cell upon activation by hypotonic conditions, and therefore counteracting cell-swelling.

However, there is a significant amount of intracellularly located LRRC8 subunits even without treatment with BFA (see LRRC8E-RFP in Figure 2C, for example), and the hypotonicity-dependent FRET signals shown in Figure 1 appear to originate from the entire cell (see Figure 1D). The authors should address this apparent contradiction, and provide detailed information on the way they performed their analysis to measure signals mostly originating from the plasma membrane.

The authors should discuss these issues.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for bringing up this issue. Indeed, a portion of either LRRC8 subunit is frequently stuck in the secretory pathway, as we observed previously for exogenously expressed LRRC8 combinations (Voss et al., 2014). The amount of signal that is not from the plasma membrane showed a high variability, with some cells showing much LRRC8A and some cells LRRC8E intracellularly. Usually, there is a tendency towards LRRC8E being more stuck in the endomembrane system, but importantly, we did not observe a correlation with the expression levels. As VRACs can adopt varying subunit stoichiometries, this suggests that the amount of correctly paired (and trafficked) subunits is unaffected by the expression levels as well. Consistently, we did not observe a correlation between absolute acceptor-normalized cFRET values and LRRC8E expression levels (not shown). Indeed, the YFP signal originating from a part of the cell with little CFP (LRRC8A) will not contribute to the real FRET signal of correctly formed VRAC channels (see lack of co-localization in Figure 2C), but it would indeed lower the acceptor-normalized cFRET (see equation in Material and methods section). However, as we did not observe a correlation between expression levels and intracellular localization, there is no correlation between the expression ratio of 8A/8E and the decrease in cFRET (Figure 1—figure supplement 2B). We agree with the reviewer that this is an important issue that deserves clarification in the manuscript, and have therefore added a corresponding statement (subsection “Inter-subunit FRET shows C-terminal movement during VRAC activation”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors should discuss the apparent contradiction of their data with the observations in a reconstituted system where decreased ionic strength is sufficient to activate VRAC channels.</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, Syeda et al., (2016) observed activation of LRRC8 complexes reconstituted in membrane bilayers by reduced ionic strength. So far, we have no explanation for this apparent contradiction, except for the environment of the VRACs, i.e. artificial membrane bilayer system versus cellular context. In the cellular context, however, there are several studies providing evidence for VRAC activation without alteration of the ionic strength. Furthermore, alterations of ionic strength required to activate VRACs are usually not reached in experiments using the whole-cell configuration to study VRAC. This has recently been reviewed in detail by Strange et al., (2019). Following the reviewer’s suggestion, we have now expanded our discussion on this, also adding further citations of important studies on the regulatory role of ionic strength on VRAC activation (Discussion section).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) From the images in Figure 3B, it is impossible for me to determine which channels are localized at the ER vs golgi, even though the authors used a marker for golgi expression. The authors should use ER, golgi and plasma membrane markers, and provide a semi-quantitative analysis to demonstrate the location of the different channel populations, and provide a more detailed description of how they selected their ROIs for performing group analysis of channels in each of the cellular compartments.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now added images (new Figure 3—figure supplement 1) showing the co-localization of LRRC8A-CFP-FM2 with the ER marker ER-YFP, the Golgi marker GalNAc-RFP, and with CD4-YFP as plasma membrane marker after release from the aggregation block. We provide a semi-quantitative analysis for a representative cell in which we follow the LRRC8A-CFP-FM2 construct through the secretory pathway (Figure 3—video 1; quantifications shown for each time frame), for which we measure the CFP fluorescence intensity in the Golgi area and a ROI for plasma membrane (depicted in the video). We have now added a more detailed description of the ROI selection in subsection “Reverse aggregation system”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) In Figure 1—figure supplement 1, the authors should show the net FRET rather than the normalized values, to allow readers to see how much variability there was in FRET between the controls and the VRACs.</p></disp-quote><p>Net FRET values with our fluorescently-labelled VRAC subunits varied tremendously, with measured FRET efficiencies ranging between 10% and 80%. This is likely due to the flexible subunit stoichiometry of hexameric VRAC complexes, at least when expressed exogenously LRRC8 (e.g. Gaitán-Peñas et al., 2016). Accordingly, cFRET (i.e. the corrected FRET value normalized to the acceptor level) varied within the cell population, making a normalization of the values necessary. The relative reduction in cFRET during VRAC activation was independent from the net FRET of a given cell, just as it neither correlated with the subunit expression ratio (see point 2 and Figure 1—figure supplement 2B). Therefore, we decided not to show net FRET values, since this would not add valuable information. However, we now state the variability of FRET as the reason for the normalization (subsection “Acceptor photo-bleaching, sensitized-emission and ratiometric FRET assays”). The net FRET values for the FRET control constructs (CFP-18aa-YFP and GluA2-6Y-10C), on the other hand showed little variability between cells, but we also present them as normalized values for clarity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The authors should show whether the treatments with LatB or MbCD affected net FRET levels, rather than just the normalized values.</p></disp-quote><p>Net FRET values vary extremely between cells explained (see our answer to point 5). The mean of this highly variable value was not altered by the treatment with LatB or MbCD: we observed mean (non-normalized) cFRET of 52 ± 15% (untreated cells in isotonic buffer), 45 ± 17% (LatB) and 47 ± 12% (MbCD). We opt not to present these data in the manuscript, since we think it will not provide further useful information.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The Abstract, Title and the overall text seem to imply that PKC activation is connected with the physiological activation of VRACs upon exposure to hypotonic solutions. However, the presented data does not really establish a link between VRAC stimulation by PKC and changes in extracellular osmolarity. It might very well be that PKC-stimulated VRACs are indeed activated by ionic strength, and that this sensitivity is obscured by PKC inhibition. The authors should provide a more lengthy discussion on how PKC might be affecting channel activity, even if based only on speculation.</p></disp-quote><p>This aspect of the manuscript has changed substantially following new patch-clamp measurements and the realization that PKC is not as central as we suspected. Instead, we show a much stronger connection to DAG-PKD signaling, because we can activate, inhibit or sustain VRAC currents in the absence of, or in opposition to, hypotonicity.</p></body></sub-article></article>
