(N-methyl-D-aspartate) glutamate receptors. Activated by synaptically evoked NMDAR-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, the synaptic SK2-containing channels modulate excitatory post-synaptic responses and the induction of synaptic plasticity. In addition, their activity- and protein kinase A-dependent trafficking contributes to expression of long-term potentiation (LTP). We have identified a novel synaptic scaffold, MPP2 (membrane palmitoylated protein 2; p55), a member of the membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK) family that interacts with SK2-containing channels. MPP2 and SK2 co-immunopurified from mouse brain, and co-immunoprecipitated when they were co-expressed in HEK293 cells. MPP2 is highly expressed in the post-synaptic density of dendritic spines on CA1 pyramidal neurons. Knocking down MPP2 expression selectively abolished the SK2-containing channel contribution to synaptic responses and decreased LTP. Thus, MPP2 is a novel synaptic scaffold that is required for proper synaptic localization and function of SK2-containing channels.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.12637.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.12637.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12637.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The neurons in the brain communicate with each other by releasing chemical messengers across structures called synapses. This signaling always occurs in the same direction: at a given synapse, one neuron sends signals that bind to receptor proteins on the surface of the receiving neuron. Repeatedly signaling across a synapse strengthens it, making it easier to communicate across, and sometimes such stimulation can cause a persistent strengthening of the synapse: this is known as long-term potentiation. Changes in synaptic strength are important for learning and memory.</p> <p>In the synapses formed between a type of brain cell called CA1 neurons, a protein called SK2 forms part of an ion channel in the membrane of the receiving neuron and is important for synaptic strengthening and long-term potentiation. To work correctly, the SK2 channels must be precisely positioned at the synapse, but the mechanisms responsible for this positioning were not clear.</p> <p>Now, by experimenting with purified proteins taken from the CA1 neurons of mice, Kim et al. show that SK2 physically interacts with a scaffold protein called MPP2. Further experiments revealed that MPP2 is responsible for positioning SK2 at the synapses, and this allows SK2-containing channels to contribute to long-term potentiation and synaptic strengthening.</p> <p>During synaptic strengthening, it is possible that SK2 disengages from MPP2, which influences learning. The next step is to understand the processes that dictate this behavior.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.12637.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.12637.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>synaptic transmission</kwd><kwd>synaptic plasticity</kwd><kwd>synaptic scaffold</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Spanish Ministry of Education and Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BFU-2012-38348</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Luján</surname><given-names>Rafael</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>European Union</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HBP - Project Ref. 604102</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Luján</surname><given-names>Rafael</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Junta de Comunicades de Castilla-La Mancha</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PPII-2014-005-P</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Luján</surname><given-names>Rafael</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MH093599</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Maylie</surname><given-names>James</given-names></name><name><surname>Adelman</surname><given-names>John P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS038880</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Maylie</surname><given-names>James</given-names></name><name><surname>Adelman</surname><given-names>John P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A new synaptic scaffold important for neurotransmission and synaptic plasticity has been identified.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>At most excitatory synapses in the central nervous system, such as the Schaffer collateral to CA1 synapses in the <italic>stratum radiatum</italic> of the hippocampus, excitatory neurotransmission is largely mediated by ionotropic AMPA-type (α-Amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid) and NMDA-type glutamate receptors. Yet, an emerging theme is that several conductances that limit membrane depolarization also make substantial contributions to the integrated excitatory post-synaptic potential (EPSP). For example, synaptically evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx into dendritic spines activates apamin-sensitive SK2-containing channels (small conductance Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated K<sup>+</sup> channels type 2; KCNN2), and their outward K<sup>+</sup> conductance shunts the AMPAR-mediated depolarization, effectively reducing the EPSP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ngo-Anh et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Faber et al., 2005</xref>). Kv4.2-containing channels are expressed in spines, close to, but not in the PSD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kim et al., 2007</xref>). Synaptic activity evokes Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through R-type voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels in spines that boosts nearby Kv4.2-containing A-type K<sup>+</sup> channels to further decrease the AMPA-mediated depolarization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). In addition, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated Cl<sup>-</sup> channels are expressed in the spines and provide further inhibitory contributions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Huang et al., 2012</xref>). Indeed, the sum of these repolarizing conductances may reduce the depolarizing AMPA-NMDA component by more than 50%. It is likely that each of these components can be regulated by a variety of second messenger pathways, greatly expanding the repertoire of targets to fine-tune synaptic transmission. For example, the Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity of SK2 channels is regulated in an activity-dependent manner by co-assembled protein kinase CK2 and protein phosphatase 2A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bildl et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allen et al., 2007</xref>) that are engaged by cholinergic signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Giessel and Sabatini, 2010</xref>). Moreover, the various contributions to synaptic responses may be dynamic, changing in response to distinct patterns of activity. Synaptic SK2-containing channels undergo protein kinase A (PKA)-dependent endocytosis upon the induction of LTP by theta burst pairing. The endocytosis of synaptic SK2-containing channels acts together with the PKA-dependent exocytosis of additional GluA1-containing AMPARs to mediate the expression of LTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lin et al., 2008</xref>). Moreover, after the initial expression of LTP and loss of the SK2-containing channel contribution, homeostatic mechanisms act to re-establish the synaptic SK balance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lin et al., 2010</xref>). Similarly, Kv4.2-containing channels expressed in spines undergo PKA-dependent endocytosis after the induction of LTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kim et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hammond et al., 2008</xref>). Therefore, the appropriate localization, spatial distribution, and orchestrated dynamics of these protein complexes provide a powerful regulator of excitatory neurotransmission and plasticity.</p><p>One class of proteins that plays a major role in synaptic organization and dynamics are the MAGUKs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Elias and Nicoll, 2007</xref>), of which there are 10 subfamilies. These modular, usually multivalent scaffolds bind to synaptic receptors, channels, and signaling molecules to anchor them into their proper locations within the post-synaptic membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Oliva et al., 2012</xref>), creating a spatially and temporally restricted signaling domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hammond et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Colledge et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dell’Acqua et al., 2006</xref>). Thus, within the post-synaptic density of excitatory synapses PSD-95 binds to NMDARs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cousins and Stephenson, 2012</xref>), while SAP97 binds to AMPARs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Howard et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Leonard et al., 1998</xref>), and Shank and Homer may serve as modular organizers of the lattice of synaptic MAGUKs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sheng and Kim, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hayashi et al., 2009</xref>). However, the molecular mechanisms that engender synaptic localization and dynamics to SK2-containing channels are not well understood. There are two major isoforms of SK2 that are expressed in CA1 pyramidal neurons; SK2-L (long) has an extended intracellular N-terminal domain compared to SK2-S (short) and the two isoforms co-assemble into heteromeric channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Strassmaier et al., 2005</xref>). In mice that selectively lack SK2-L expression, the SK2-S channels are expressed in the plasma membrane of dendrites and dendritic spines, yet fail to become incorporated into the post-synaptic membrane. Consequently, the SK2-containing channel contributions to EPSPs and plasticity are absent, and this loss of synaptic SK2-containing channel function enhances hippocampus-dependent learning tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allen et al., 2011</xref>). To identify proteins that might serve to localize synaptic SK2-containing channels, candidate SK2 interacting proteins were identified. One of them, the MAGUK protein MPP2 (membrane palmitoylated protein 2), is localized to the PSD and is essential for synaptic SK2-containing channel function.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>MPP2 interacts with SK2</title><p>Proteomic analyses (on high-resolution quantitative mass spectrometry) of SK2-containing channels immunoaffinity-purified from rodent whole brain membrane preparations suggested that the MAGUK protein, MPP2 might be an interaction partner. To further investigate this interaction, two newly generated antibodies targeting MPP2 were tested. Probing Western blots of proteins prepared from total mouse brain with either MPP2 antibody detected a predominant band at ~55 kDa. Similarly a single band, ~60 kDa, was detected in proteins prepared from HEK293 cells expressing FLAG-tagged MPP2, but not from mock transfected cells.

The results demonstrated that both antibodies robustly purified MPP2 and co-purified SK2 as well as SK3. In addition, these experiments identified DLG1 (SAP97) and Lin-homologs 7A and 7C as proteins co-assembling with MPP2 in rodent brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). To rule out off-target effects of the two MPP2 antibodies, we tested their binding of C8-tagged of SAP97, Lin7A, or Lin7C, C8-tagged versions of each of these proteins after expression in HEK293 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). While all 8-tagged proteins were recognized by anti-C8 antibody only C8-MPP2 was recognized by anti-MPP2 antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). MPP2, a member of the p55 Stardust family of MAGUK proteins, is predicted to be a 552 amino acid protein. Like most MAGUKs, MPP2 is a modular protein comprised of several distinct protein-protein interaction domains. There are two predicted L27 domains, followed by a single predicted PDZ domain, and then the SH3-HOOK-GK domains.</p><p>To test for direct interaction with SK2 channels, SK2-L and SK2-S, the SK2 isoforms that contribute to synaptic SK2-containing channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allen et al., 2011</xref>), and either C8-MPP2 or PSD-95 were co-expressed in HEK293 cells. Immunoprecipitations were performed using an anti-SK2 antibody raised in guinea pig that is directed to the common C-terminal domain of the two SK2 isoforms, or using IgG as a control. Precipitated proteins were prepared as Western blots. Probing with anti-SK2 antibody that was raised in rabbits and directed against the same C-terminal sequence, demonstrated equivalent SK2 expression for input and after immunoprecipitation in each sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Probing with anti-C8 antibody detected a band of the appropriate apparent molecular weight for C8-MPP2 in the sample co-expressed with SK2-S plus SK2-L but not in the IgG control sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Probing with anti-PSD-95 antibody did not detect co-immunoprecipitation with SK2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The results demonstrated that C8-MPP2 but not PSD-95 was specifically co-precipitated with SK2. To examine the possibility that SAP97 interacts with SK2-S, C8-SAP97 was co-expressed in HEK293 cells together with either myc-SK2-S or GluA1, a known SAP97 interaction partner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Leonard et al., 1998</xref>). Immunoprecipitations were performed using anti-SK2 antibody, anti-GluA1 antibody, or IgG as a control. Western blotting with anti-C8 antibody revealed that C8-SAP97 only co-immunoprecipitated when co-expressed with GluA1, despite equivalent levels of input and immunoprecipitated proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). To test if MPP2 interacts with the unique N-terminal domain of SK2-L that is required for synaptic localization GST pull-down experiments were performed. While PDZ interactions are important for many MAGUK-partner protein interactions, the unique N-terminal domain of SK2-L does not contain a PDZ ligand motif and using the PDZ domain from MPP2 failed to show an interaction with the N-terminal domain of SK2-L. Therefore, the SH3-HOOK-GK domain of MPP2 was employed.

Synaptically evoked EPSPs in CA1 pyramidal neurons are increased by the SK channel blocker, apamin, but in CA1 pyramidal neurons expressing shRNAs directed against <italic>Mpp2</italic> mRNA apamin has no effect. MPP2 knockdown selectively affects synaptic SK2-containing channel function, as the SK2-containing channels expressed in the dendrites that are activated by somatic voltage steps are not altered. Consistent with the effects of MPP2 on synaptic SK2-containing channels, MPP2 knock-down reduces the expression of TBP-induced LTP by ~30%. This is slightly more than the component of LTP attributed to SK2 endocytosis in untransfected CA1 pyramidal neurons, ~17% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lin et al., 2008</xref>). This might reflect effects of MPP2 knock-down on other interaction partners (see below).</p><p>Previous results showed that synaptic SK2-containing channels are heteromeric assemblies that contain two isoforms of SK2, SK2-S and SK2-L. Compared to SK2-S, SK2-L has an additional 207 amino acids in the intracellular N-terminal domain and SK2-S is otherwise entirely contained in SK2-L (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Strassmaier et al., 2005</xref>). In a transgenic mouse selectively lacking SK2-L, the SK2-S channels are expressed in the dendrites and even in the plasma membrane of dendritic spines, but they are specifically excluded from the PSD, and apamin fails to boost synaptically evoked EPSPs. Re-expressing SK2-L reinstates synaptic function as measured by apamin sensitivity of EPSPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allen et al., 2011</xref>). These results implicated the unique N-terminal domain of SK2-L in directing SK2-containing channel synaptic localization and function, and suggested that the N-terminal domain of SK2-L might interact with a partner protein to engender PSD localization. Indeed, MPP2 binds to the unique N-terminal domain and knocking down MPP2 expression phenocopied the effect of SK2-L deletion on synaptic responses. MAGUK proteins recruit and stabilize AMPA and NMDA receptors in the PSD. Our results suggest that MPP2 similarly serves to stabilize SK2-containing channels in the PSD.</p><p>MPP2 is a member of the p55 Stardust subfamily of MAGUK scaffold proteins, named after the founding member MPP1, the major palmitoylated protein in erythrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alloisio et al., 1993</xref>). Similar to other MAGUK scaffold proteins, MPP2 is modular, consisting of two L27 domains that may mediate homo- or heterophilic interactions, a single PDZ domain followed by SH3-HOOK-GK domains. Biochemical studies showed that MPP2 is enriched in the PSD fractions of rat brain, and pull-down assays to test for interactions suggested MPP2 may interact with itself as well as a number of other synaptic proteins, among them are PSD-95, SAP97, GKAP, CASK, GRIP, neuroligin, and CaMKII. The SH3-HOOK-GK domain of MPP2 was implicated in mediating these interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jing-Ping et al., 2005</xref>), similar to the interaction between MPP2 and the N-terminal domain of SK2-L.</p><p>The results presented here, using an unbiased approach also identified SK3 as immunopurifying with MPP2. SK2 and SK3 can form heteromeric channels in brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Strassmaier et al., 2005</xref>), and SK3 is expressed in CA1 pyramidal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ballesteros-Merino et al., 2014</xref>). Different from SK2 that has two N-terminal isoforms, there is only one SK3 N-terminal isoform and it is similar to the extended N-terminal domain of SK2-L, harboring several islands of homology that might mediate interactions with MPP2.</p><p>The proteomics analyses of MPP2 also identified three additional scaffold proteins, the MAGUK protein, DLG1 (SAP97), as well as Lin7A and Lin7C as MPP2-interacting proteins. In epithelial cells, MPP7, a closely related member of the p55 Stardust family, dimerizes with Lin7 proteins, an interaction mediated by the C-terminal L27 domain, and the dimeric complex then associates with DLG1 via the N-terminal L27 domain that is insufficient to mediate DLG1 interactions in the absence of bound Lin7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bohl et al., 2007</xref>). DLG1 also binds the C-terminal PDZ ligand on the GluA1 subunit of AMPA receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Leonard et al., 1998</xref>). Indeed, upon the induction of LTP at Schaffer collateral to CA1 synapses, additional GluA1-containing AMPA receptors undergo exocytosis at a perisynaptic site followed by translocation into the post-synaptic membrane, increasing the AMPA component of EPSPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Yang et al., 2008</xref>). This exocytosis is dependent on the PDZ ligand at the C-terminus of the GluA1 subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Yang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Shi et al., 2001</xref>), and exocytosis of GluA1-containing AMPA receptors is prerequisite to SK2-containing channel endocytosis; specifically blocking GluA1-containing AMPA receptor exocytosis prevents the rapid, subsequent endocytosis of SK2-containing channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lin et al., 2010</xref>). Moreover, immunopurification of AMPA receptors from whole brain identified MPP2 as a protein that co-purified with AMPA receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Schwenk et al., 2012</xref>). Synaptic SK2-containing channels reside in very close proximity to synaptic NMDA receptors within the PSD, providing a molecular microdomain that facilitates their functional coupling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ngo-Anh et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lin et al., 2008</xref>). PSD-95 interacts with NMDARs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kornau et al., 1995</xref>), is crucial for the proper synaptic localization of ionotropic glutamate receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Schnell et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Elias et al., 2008</xref>), and interacts with SAP97 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cai et al., 2006</xref>). It will be interesting to determine whether MPP2 additionally interacts, directly or indirectly with PSD-95 to maintain the spatial synaptic relationship between SK2-containing channels and NMDA receptors. MPP2 contains multiple different protein-protein interaction domains that may bind not only receptors and channels but, additionally, signaling molecules as well as connections to the cytoskeleton. These observations raise the possibility that there is a dynamic protein lattice encompassing SK2-containing channels, AMPARs and NMDARs, and regulatory proteins that is woven together by molecular interactions between scaffold proteins to precisely tune synaptic responses during basal neurotransmission and plasticity.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animal care</title><p>All procedures involving animals were performed in accordance with the guidelines of Oregon Health and Science University (Portland, OR), animal care protocol number: IP00000191; University of Freiburg (Freiburg, Germany), Regierungspräsidium Freiburg, AZ: 35–9185/G-12/47; and University of Castilla-La Mancha (Albacete, Spain).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Molecular biology</title><p>MPP2 shRNAs were designed using an online algorithm (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://sirna.wi.mit.edu">http://sirna.wi.mit.edu</ext-link>).

For rescuing MPP2 knock-down, the MPP2 shRNA plasmids (GFP) were co-transfected with a plasmid expressing the MPP2 coding sequence, cloned between the CAG promoter and the 3’ UTR from bovine growth hormone. This plasmid was co-transfected with a plasmid directing mApple expression from the ubiquitin promoter.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Antibodies</title><p>To generate antibodies to MPP2, rabbits were immunized with synthetic peptides representing amino acids 116–145 and 480–507 of mouse MPP2 (NP_057904). To test the antibodies using Western blots, mouse whole brains were homogenized in ice-cold homogenization buffer (0.32 M sucrose, 1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, 1 mM ethyleneglycoltetraacetic acid, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 0.4 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The resultant homogenate was subjected to centrifugation at 1000 <italic>g</italic> for 10 min to remove nuclei and debris. The protein concentration was determined with Lowry’s method. Human embryonic kidney 293T (HEK293T) cells were transfected with pFLAG-CMV vector (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) encoding mouse FLAG-MPP2 in a 10 cm dish. Cells were harvested in 0.5 ml of PBS. Homogenates and suspended cells were mixed with an equal volume of 2 x sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) sampling buffer (63 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 20% glycerol, 0.002% bromophenol blue), and denatured with 50 mM ( ± )-dithiothreitol at 55°C for 30 min. Proteins (100 µg of brain homogenates and 0.5 µl of cell lysates) were separated using 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and electroblotted onto an Immobilon-P Transfer Membrane (Millipore, Billerica, MA). After blocking with 5% skimmed milk for 30 min, blotted membranes were incubated with primary antibodies (1 µg/ml) for 1 hr, then with peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 hr (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA; 1:10,000). Tris-buffered saline (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl) containing 0.1% Tween-20 was used as the dilution and washing buffer. Immunoreactions were visualized with the ECL chemiluminescence detection system, and captured using an ImageQuant LAS 500 (GE Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, UK). For specificity control, anti-MPP2a and anti-MPP2b (1 μg/ml) were mixed with 20 μg/ml of GST fusion proteins of the respective immunizing antigen.</p><p>Anti-SK2 antibodies have been previously characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lin et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ballesteros-Merino et al., 2012</xref>).

Proteins retained in APs and identified by mass spectrometry were quantified by integration of peptide m/z signal intensities over time (peak volumes, PVs) that were extracted from FT full scans using MaxQuant (v.1.4.1.2; <underline><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.maxquant.org">http://www.maxquant.org</ext-link></underline>; with integrated off-line mass calibration). Relative abundance of proteins in anti-MPP2 samples versus control (abundance ratio or rPV) was determined by the TopCorr method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bildl et al., 2012</xref>) as the median of either (i) six individual peptide PV ratios of the best correlating protein-specific peptides (as determined by Pearson correlation of their abundance values; TopCorr6), or (ii) the 50% best of all individual peptide PV ratios (Top50). The linear dynamic range of the TopCorr method is about 4 orders of magnitude (detailed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bildl et al., 2012</xref>]).

Bead–protein complexes were washed one time with PWB followed by a 5 min wash at 4°C with PWB plus 0.1% BSA, and two 1 min washes with PWB. These 'baits' were incubated at 4°C overnight with bacterial cell lysate from cultures expressing the His-tagged 'prey', washed four times with PWB, added to SDS sample buffer, heated at 95°C for 5 min and resolved by SDS-PAGE.

Electron photomicrographs were captured with an ORIUS SC600B CCD camera (Gatan, Munich, Germany). Digitized electron images were modified for color, brightness, and contrast with Adobe Photoshop, version 7.0. Labelled structures were classified based on unambiguous morphological information in each section. Axon terminals were identified by the presence of synapses and small round and/or large granular vesicles. Synapses were identified as parallel membranes separated by widened clefts that were associated with membrane specializations. Synapses displaying a prominent density on the post-synaptic side were characterized as asymmetrical. Dendritic spines were identified as small protrusions exhibiting membrane continuity with the dendritic shaft. Significance of immunogold particle labelling in GFP-positive versus GFP-negative spines and dendrites was assessed by ANOVA.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>In utero electroporation</title><p>Timed-pregnant mice were anesthetized with isofluorane, their abdominal cavity cut open, and the uterine horns/sac exposed.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Richard Aldrich as the Senior Editor.</p> <p>The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Leonard Kaczmarek and John Scott (peer reviewers).</p> <p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p> <p>Summary:</p> <p>This is an interesting, generally well-written and straightforward article that defines a role for the synaptic scaffold protein membrane palmitoylated protein 2 (MPP2) in the modulation of synaptic SK2 channel action. The authors delineate the domains of interaction between MPP2 and the cytosolic domains of SK channels. Using an appropriate combination of proteomic, immunocytochemistry and electrophysiological techniques they show that manipulation of MPP2 affects SK2 channel modulation and synaptic long-term potentiation.</p> <p>Essential revisions:</p> <p>The data are not yet conclusive because there are five points that need to be more firmly established.</p> <p>1) The initial finding that led to the characterization of MPP2 as an interacting partner for SK2 was a mass spec-based analysis of SK2-containing channels immunopurified from rat brain. Other than the statement in the first sentence of the Results that this finding was the key to the all of the other experiments in the entire study, nothing is reported about this experiment.</p> <p>A).The authors should provide data files of the peptide peak areas that were measured by mass spectrometry and used to calculate ratios shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>. How were those peptides chosen? How was the dynamic range established?</p> <p>B) The information in the Methods section is not adequate to establish the nature or specificity of the antibodies generated against MPP2. The authors need to state what antigen they used to generate the antibodies. They need to show a Western blot made with an entire lane of fractionated brain homogenate; the lane should show the molecular weights of all bands recognized by the antibody (including MPP2), and a second lane should show that the MPP2 band is not labeled when the antibody is preincubated with the antigen. The data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> do not establish the specificity of the antibodies against MPP2. The authors have suggested that this data indicates that SAP-97, Lin7A and/or Lin7C co-assemble with MPP2 in rodent brain. However, the data are equally compatible with the conclusion that the two antibodies cross-react with SAP-97, Lin7A and/or Lin7C. Without this demonstration of specificity, the immunocytochemistry experiments carried out in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref> are also not conclusive.</p> <p>2) The data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref> appear to establish that: 1. the channel protein SK2 can interact with MPP2 when the two proteins are expressed in HEK cells, and 2. SK2 does not interact with PSD-95 when the two proteins are co-expressed in HEK cells. However, the data would be more convincing if the authors indicated the molecular weight of the immunoprecipitated MPP2 band, and showed an entire lane, identifying any other cross-reacting bands. In the second paragraph of the subsection “MPP2 interacts with SK2 “the authors indicate a control as &quot;data not shown.&quot; These are important controls and the data should be presented.</p> <p>3) The data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> presented problems for two reviewers:</p> <p>A) The data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> shows that the SK2L isoform does not interact with Shank, SAP97, or CACNB4 when co-expressed; however, this data does not exclude interaction of SK2-S with SAP-97. In the subsection “MPP2 interacts with SK2”, referring to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, the authors state that &quot;…several other MAGUK proteins (Shank1, SAP97, CaCNB4) were prepared… and used as baits for the His-tagged N-terminal domain of SK2-L.&quot; Shank1 and CaCNB4 are not MAGUK proteins and do not have an SH3-HOOK-GK domain. The experiment in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> shows that the SH3-HOOK-GK domain of SAP-97 doesn't pull down SK2-L. The significance of its lack of interaction with Shank1 and CaCNB4 is less clear.</p> <p>B) A major part of the text that refers to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> (subsection “MPP2 interacts with SK2”, second paragraph) describes experiments showing that the SH3-HOOK-GK domain of MPP2 is the domain that is required for interaction with SK2-L. While <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> may perhaps represent the data for this, there is no reference to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> in the text. In addition, the legend for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> makes no mention of SH3-HOOK-GK domains (but does refer to GST-pulldowns) and gives the impression that the full length proteins are being used here. The Methods do not give any information that allows one to identify what sequence is being used as bait in these experiments. Finally, the text erroneously refers to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> as showing that Kv1.4 pulls down PSD-93. In summary, either an important part of the text is missing or these experiments have to be described more clearly (or both).</p> <p>4) The immunohistochemistry and EM analysis that represent the core of MPP2 analysis are well done but need to be accompanied by intermediate resolution staining that shows the subcellular location of MPP2 in synapses of cultured neurons and whether or not the protein exhibits a distinct pattern of neuronal distribution from the marker protein PSD-95.</p> <p>5) The data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> is not a convincing demonstration of specific knockdown of MPP2. The authors should demonstrate the specificity of knockdown in cultured neurons where more quantitative measures are possible and where the possibility of off-target effects can be assessed.

If cultured neurons have synapses mirroring native synapses, we would see immunoreactivity for MPP2 – or for PSD-95 – in spines without resolution to the synapse itself that is only provided by post-embedding immunoEM. It is also unclear what additional information would be conveyed by comparisons to PSD-95. But in fact we have studied PSD-95 localization by iEM in previous work (Lin et al., Nat. Neurosci. 2008; Allen et al., Nat. Neurosci. 2011; Fukaya and Watanabe, J. Comp. Neurol. 2000), and we see no difference in the subcellular localization of MPP2 and PSD-95. Both proteins are integral PSD components and are also localized to a lesser extent to the dendrites. Consistent with other studies with PSD-95, MPP2 also appears to be distributed evenly across the PSD consistent with comprising part of a backbone that stabilizes its binding partners at the synapse (see DeGioris, Galbraith, Dosemeci, Chen and Reese, Brain, Cell Biol.2006)</p> <p><italic>5) The data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> is not a convincing demonstration of specific knockdown of MPP2. The authors should demonstrate the specificity of knockdown in cultured neurons where more quantitative measures are possible and where the possibility of off-target effects can be assessed. For example, is the expression of SAP97 altered?</italic></p> <p>We respectfully disagree with the reviewers on this point. The data in original <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> (now, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) are quantified at very high resolution by comparing transfected and non-transfected spines and dendrites at the level of electron microscopy, and quite clearly demonstrate effective knockdown. We have analyzed particle distribution by ANOVA and added the appropriate p value (&lt; 0.001).</p> <p>The reviewers request quantitation of knockdown in cultured neurons, but they present problems that are circumvented by the higher resolution quantitation of knockdown we have provided. In cultures, knockdown analysis would be measured by transfecting them with shRNA plasmids and subsequent Western blots. Since cultured neurons are difficult to transfect, quantifying efficiency of knockdown would be far less precise than the EM level quantification presented in original <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).</p> <p>Also, while neuronal cultures have been well used to study some aspects of synaptic physiology, particularly AMPA and NMDA receptor mediated events and trafficking, they do not fully reflect native synapses. For example we have never recorded an apamin effect on EPSPs, nor even an SK current in cultured neurons. Thus, while cultured neurons may be useful for insights into glutamate receptors, it has become clear in the last several years that additional conductances make important contributions to post-synaptic responses in native spines and not all of these are recapitulated in neuronal cultures.</p> <p>We very much appreciate the possibility of off-target effects and for this reason we applied the most direct and potent measure of knockdown specificity: re-establishment of the wild type phenotype by expression of an shRNA immune MPP2. It is indeed possible that SAP97 levels, or other synaptic proteins are reduced or altered by MPP2 shRNA expression. Using our online tool, we found no evidence that SAP97 mRNA would be knocked down by the MPP2 shRNAs. Thus if MPP2 knockdown is associated with altered levels of SAP97 this is more likely to be a consequence of MPP2 knockdown and compensatory changes at the level of the synapse than to a spurious cross-reaction of the shRNA with SAP97 mRNA. Our follow up studies are focused on collateral consequences of MPP2 loss for synaptic physiology. It is unclear how far the reviewers want us to go to search for possible off-target effects when we provide the explicit specificity control of the shRNA immune MPP2 rescuing the knockdown phenotype on which this work is focused.</p></body> </sub-article> </article>
