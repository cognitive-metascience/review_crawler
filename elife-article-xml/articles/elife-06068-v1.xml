hematopoietic stem cells (HSC). Bouts of reactivation are normally controlled by the immune system, but can be fatal in immuno-compromised individuals such as organ transplant recipients. Here, we reveal that HCMV latency in human CD34<sup>+</sup> HSC reflects the recruitment on the viral genome of KAP1, a master co-repressor, together with HP1 and the SETDB1 histone methyltransferase, which results in transcriptional silencing. During lytic infection, KAP1 is still associated with the viral genome, but its heterochromatin-inducing activity is suppressed by mTOR-mediated phosphorylation. Correspondingly, HCMV can be forced out of latency by KAP1 knockdown or pharmacological induction of KAP1 phosphorylation, and this process can be potentiated by activating NFkB with TNF-α. These results suggest new approaches both to curtail CMV infection and to purge the virus from organ transplants.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06068.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06068.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06068.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is an extremely common virus that causes life-long infections in humans. Most individuals are exposed to HCMV during childhood, and the infection rarely causes any symptoms of disease in healthy individuals. However, in people with weaker immune systems—for example, newborn babies, people with AIDS, or individuals who have received an organ transplant—HCMV can cause life-threatening illnesses.</p><p>It is difficult for the immune system to fight the infection because HCMV is able to hide in cells within the bone marrow called hematopoietic stem cells. Inside these cells, the virus can survive in a ‘dormant’ state for many years, before being reactivated and starting to multiply again. In most people, the immune system manages to control this new outbreak of HCMV, and the virus becomes dormant again, but reactivation of the virus in individuals with weakened immune systems is much more likely to cause serious illness.</p><p>The results of previous studies suggest that when HCMV infects the hematopoietic stem cells, human proteins switch off the expression of many virus genes, which makes the virus inactive. The virus can be reactivated when infected stem cells change into a type of immune cell called dendritic cells, but it is not clear how this is controlled.</p><p>Here, Rauwel et al. reveal that a human protein called KAP1 is responsible for switching off the virus genes in the stem cells. It does so by interacting with two other proteins to alter the structure of the DNA in these genes. However, if the stem cells are stimulated to change into dendritic cells, KAP1 becomes inactive, which allows the virus genes to be switched on.</p><p>Rauwel et al. also show that it is possible to force HCMV out of its dormant state by using drugs to block the activity of KAP1. This may aid the development of treatments that prevent the virus from causing serious illness in patients with weakened immune systems. For example, it could be used to remove dormant HCMV infections from bone marrow before it is transplanted into a new individual.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06068.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06068.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>epigenetic</kwd><kwd>hematopoietic stem cell</kwd><kwd>cytomegalovirus</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerische Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung (Schweizerische Nationalfonds)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Trono</surname><given-names>Didier</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council (ERC)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Trono</surname><given-names>Didier</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Inactivation of KAP1 by mTOR-mediated phosphorylation releases human cytomegalovirus from latency, and has the potential to be used as a therapy to purge the virus from transplant organs.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), a member of the β-herpes virus family, is a highly prevalent pathogen that induces life-long infections notably through the establishment of latency in hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sinclair, 2008</xref>). Bouts of reactivation are normally asymptomatic because rapidly controlled by the immune system, but can be fatal in immuno-compromised individuals such as AIDS patients and transplant recipients, in particular when grafts from HCMV-positive donors are given to HCMV-negative individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sissons and Carmichael, 2002</xref>). Furthermore, primary HCMV infection during pregnancy is a leading cause of congenital malformations of the central nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Britt, 2008</xref>).</p><p>The approximately 250 kb genome of HCMV encodes several hundred proteins, some 14 miRNAs and a few long-noncoding RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Stern-Ginossar et al., 2012</xref>). Infection of permissive targets such as epithelial cells or fibroblasts leads to a lytic cycle, with a highly orderly transcriptional cascade that first expresses the viral immediate early (IE) genes, the products of which set the cellular stage for the virus and activate the viral early (E) genes. These yield the effectors of viral genome replication, before proteins encoded by the viral late (L) genes finally trigger the formation of new particles. In contrast, when HCMV infects a HSC, the expression of lytic genes is rapidly suppressed and only a few latency-associated transcripts are detected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Goodrum et al., 2012</xref>). The viral genome is then maintained as a stable episome, without replicating or producing new virions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Goodrum et al., 2004</xref>). When HCMV-infected HSC are differentiated in vitro into dendritic cells (DCs) and these are induced to mature, the virus resumes a lytic cycle. Accordingly, blood CD14<sup>+</sup> monocytes, which are circulating precursors of DCs, harbor latent HCMV.</p><p>HCMV reactivation is thus tightly coupled with myeloid differentiation. However, the molecular mechanisms of its persistence in latently infected cells are incompletely understood, albeit known to be associated with epigenetic modifications of the viral chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Avdic et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Umashankar et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mason et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Petrucelli et al., 2012</xref>). In latently infected CD34<sup>+</sup> HSC or circulating monocytes isolated from seropositive individuals, chromatin at the major immediate early promoter (MIEP) bears histone 3 trimethylated on lysine 9 (H3K9me3), a repressive mark, and heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sinclair, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Reeves and Sinclair, 2013</xref>). Upon differentiation of latently infected precursors into dendritic cells, H3K9me3 is replaced by high levels of histone acetylation, HP1 is lost, and a lytic cycle is triggered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Taylor-Wiedeman et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mendelson et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hahn et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Reeves et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>KAP1 (KRAB-associated protein 1), also known as TRIM28 (tripartite motif protein 28) or TIF1β (transcription intermediary factor 1 beta) is a transcriptional co-repressor essential for the early embryonic silencing of endogenous retroelements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rowe et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Castro-Diaz et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Turelli et al., 2014</xref>) and involved in regulating multiple aspects of mammalian homeostasis, including in the hematopoietic system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jakobsson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bojkowska et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chikuma et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Santoni de Sio et al., 2012a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">2012b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barde et al., 2013</xref>). KAP1 binds to the Krüppel-associated box (KRAB) domain present at the N-terminus of KRAB-containing zinc finger proteins (KRAB-ZFPs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Friedman et al., 1996</xref>). These constitute the single largest family of transcriptional repressors encoded by the genomes of higher organisms, with close to four-hundred members in either human or mouse, and are endowed with sequence-specific DNA binding ability via a C-terminal array of zinc fingers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Urrutia, 2003</xref>). KAP1 harbors from its N- to its C-terminus a RING finger, B-boxes, a coiled-coil region, a HP1-binding motif, a PHD finger and a bromodomain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Iyengar and Farnham, 2011</xref>). The first three of these motifs define the so-called RBCC or TRIM (tripartite motif) region, which is both necessary and sufficient for homo-oligomerization and direct binding to KRAB. The C-terminal effector end of the protein recognizes the backbone of histone tails, and interacts with two histone-modifying enzymes: Mi2α, an isoform of the Mi2 protein found in the NuRD (nucleosome remodeling and histone deacetylation) complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Schultz et al., 2001</xref>), and SETDB1 (SET domain, bifurcated 1), an H3K9me3-specific histone methyltransferase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Schultz et al., 2002</xref>). The H3K9me3 mark in turn creates high affinity genomic binding sites for HP1, bringing more KAP1 complex, which likely explains that KAP1-induced heterochromatin formation can spread several tens of kilobases away from an initial KAP1 docking site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Groner et al., 2010</xref>). SETDB1 recruitment is stimulated by sumoylation of the KAP1 bromodomain, the last step of which is mediated intra-molecularly by an E3 ligase activity contained in the PHD domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ivanov et al., 2007</xref>). Within the context of DNA damage, the ATM (ataxia telangiectasia mutated) kinase phosphorylates KAP1 at position 824, resulting in decreased KAP1 sumoylation and SETDB1 recruitment, with secondary loss of KAP1 repressor activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">White et al., 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Noon et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Histone 3 lysine 9 trimethylation and HP1 recruitment are thus signatures of KAP1 action. Furthermore, we previously demonstrated that KRAB/KAP-mediated repression is functional within the context of episomal DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barde et al., 2009</xref>). Finally, the KRAB/KAP pathway has been found to influence the replication of two members of the herpes virus family, Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liao et al., 2005</xref>) and Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpes virus (KSHV) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cai et al., 2013</xref>). Based on these premises, we investigated a possible role for KAP1 in the control of HCMV latency. We found that KAP1 is a key mediator of this process, and that it is targeted by an mTOR-mediated phosphorylation switch that can be exploited to force the virus out of latency. Our results suggest new avenues not only for controlling HCMV infection but also for purging the virus from organ transplants.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>KAP1 is necessary for both establishment and maintenance of HCMV latency in HSC</title><p>We first infected either MRC5 fibroblasts or cord blood-derived CD34<sup>+</sup> cells with the TB40-E HCMV clinical strain. Monitoring the levels of viral DNA and various RNA transcripts during the following days confirmed that lytic replication occurred in MRC5 cells, known to be fully permissive, whereas latency was established in HSC after an initial outburst of viral gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>), as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Goodrum et al., 2007</xref>). To examine the possible impact of KAP1 on this process, we depleted the corepressor by lentivector-mediated RNA interference, complementing <italic>Kap1</italic> knockdown cells by transduction with a vector expressing an shRNA-resistant <italic>Kap1</italic> allele when relevant. We then infected these cells with TB40-E HCMV. In MRC5 cells, where KAP1 depletion was around 98% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>), levels of viral transcripts indicative of a lytic cycle (the IE genes UL123, UL122, the E gene UL54 and the L gene UL94) were comparable in control and KAP1-depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) and production of viral proteins IE1 and IE2 was unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>), indicating that the regulator is not essential for productive HCMV replication. In unsorted population of HSC exposed to the knockdown lentivector, KAP1 reduction was only 85% but in sorted CD34<sup>+</sup> GFP-positive, that is, transduced cells, it reached 95% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C,D</xref>). In this KAP1-depleted subpopulation, expression of immediate early, early and late viral genes at 7 days post-infection was increased between 10- and 35-fold compared with control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), and massive amounts of infectious HCMV particles were released in the supernatant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Furthermore, complementation of KAP1-depleted cells with an shRNA-resistant <italic>Kap1</italic> allele restored HCMV latency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2E–I</xref>). These results thus indicated that KAP1 is necessary for the establishment of HCMV latency in HSC. We then inverted the sequence of our manipulations to induce <italic>Kap1</italic> knockdown in CD34<sup>+</sup> cells that had been infected 7 days earlier with the TB40-E virus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2J</xref>). 7 days after transduction, we measured the expression of the UL122, UL123, UL54 and UL94 mRNAs, which are found only during a lytic cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Reeves and Sinclair, 2013</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). All transcripts were significantly upregulated in knockdown cells, which accordingly released infectious viral particles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Furthermore, the NF-κB activator TNFα increased viral gene expression and virion production from <italic>Kap1</italic> knockdown but not from control TB40-E-infected CD34<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,E</xref>). These data indicate that (i) KAP1 is necessary both for the establishment and for the maintenance of HCMV latency in human HSC, and (ii) the relief of KAP1-mediated repression is not in itself sufficient for full HCMV reactivation in CD34<sup>+</sup> cells, but provides the ground for stimulation of viral gene expression by HCMV activators such as NF-κB.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06068.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>KAP1 is required for HCMV latency.</title><p>RT-qPCR analysis of indicated HCMV genes expression in MRC-5 (<bold>A</bold>) or cord blood CD34<sup>+</sup> (<bold>B</bold>, <bold>C</bold>, <bold>D</bold>, <bold>E</bold>) cells infected with the TB40-E strain 3 days after (<bold>A</bold>, <bold>B</bold>, <bold>C</bold>) or 7 days prior to (<bold>D</bold>, <bold>E</bold>) being transduced or not (NT) with lentivectors expressing (shKAP1) or not (empty) a small hairpin RNA against <italic>Kap1</italic>, sorting CD34<sup>+</sup> cells for GFP and CD34 expression.

Still, as KAP1 exerts pleomorphic effect on hematopoiesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barde et al., 2013</xref>), we could not exclude that its depletion induced HCMV lytic genes expression through indirect effects. We thus asked whether the co-repressor associates with the HCMV genome by performing KAP1-specific chromatin immunoprecipitation-deep sequencing (ChIP-seq) analyses on material isolated from human CD34<sup>+</sup> HSC at 7 days post-TB40-E infection. Using a stringent peak-calling algorithm and validating its results by ChIP-PCR, we identified 28 major KAP1-enriched regions on the HCMV genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>).

When HSC infected 5 days earlier with TB40-E were incubated with the ATM activator chloroquine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bakkenist and Kastan, 2003</xref>), intracellular levels of viral RNAs and DNA increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,B</xref>), and infectious viral particles were released in the supernatant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Supporting the specificity of the observed phenomenon, Torin-1 did not block chloroquine-induced HCMV RNA, DNA and viral particle production, whereas the ATM inhibitor Ku55933 prevented this process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). These results obtained in a first set of HSC obtained from three donors were confirmed in another group of three donors, where it was further observed that levels of viral transcripts increased in drug-treated cells only transiently after a single dose of drug but steadily if three doses were administered over 5 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>), and that single doses of the ATM activator prevented the progressive drop in viral DNA that was observed in control cells, while repeated doses triggered an augmentation in viral DNA copies, indicative of genome replication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Correlating these quantitative virological data, chloroquine treatment allowed the detection by immunofluorescence of pS<sup>824</sup>KAP1-positive cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>). These were also systematically positive for IE antigens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>), confirming that the virus harbored by these cells had exited latency. Finally, when the supernatant of TB40-E-infected HSC exposed to chloroquine was used to inoculate MRC5 fibroblasts, it induced the accumulation of viral DNA in these targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1D</xref>), demonstrating that the production of replication-competent virus had been induced by ATM-activating treatment of the latently infected HSC. Noteworthy, pS<sup>824</sup>KAP1 was detected only in HCMV IE-positive cells, which strongly suggests that KAP1 became phosphorylated in these cells through the combined action of ATM and some HCMV-encoded factor. Importantly, these effects were induced without drop in KAP1 levels or loss of surface expression of the CD34 stem cell marker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A,B</xref>).

Nevertheless, levels of viral gene expression achieved in this setting remain lower than observed when HCMV-harboring precursors are differentiated into macrophages or mature dendritic cells, where NF-κB has been demonstrated to drive viral transcription. We thus exposed latently infected CD34<sup>+</sup> cells to chloroquine and TNF- α (5 ng/ml), either alone or in combination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). With TNF alone, HCMV transcription was not induced, indicating that the virus remained latent. With chloroquine alone, significant induction of cell-associated viral transcripts (approx. 100-fold) and DNA (approx. fivefold) was measured, and viral particles were released in the supernatant (10,000 PFU/ml in the experiment depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). With the further addition of TNF, levels of CMV-specific RNAs increased by another 10-fold, the amounts of cell-associated viral DNA doubled, and virion production was boosted by a factor 10. Importantly, this dual treatment did not trigger the differentiation of the HSC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Our results correlate with the observation that, in latently infected CD34<sup>+</sup> HSC or circulating monocytes isolated from seropositive individuals, chromatin at the HCMV MIEP bears H3K9me3 and HP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sinclair, 2010</xref>). Our finding that KAP1 partakes in both the establishment and the maintenance of HCMV latency also corroborates the previously noted absence of more permanent silencing marks, such as DNA methylation, on latent HCMV genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hummel et al., 2007</xref>). We provide another important clue to the understanding of HCMV biology by revealing that the virus exits latency when KAP1 becomes phosphorylated on serine 824, which blocks its ability to recruit SETDB1 hence abrogates its co-repressor potential. We further identify mTOR as responsible for this KAP1 phosphorylation switch, and capitalizing on these findings we finally demonstrate that HCMV can be forced out of latency by pharmacological activation of ATM, another KAP1 kinase, and that this effect can be potentiated by adding TNF, an inducer of NF-kB. Whether KAP1 phosphorylation relieves HCMV from latency only by dislodging SETDB1 and HP1 from the viral chromatin or through more active mechanisms remains to be determined. Interestingly, a small molecule inhibitor of LSD1/KDM1A was recently found to decrease HCMV immediate early gene transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Liang et al., 2013</xref>). It could be that pS<sup>824</sup>KAP1 plays a role in attracting this H3K9 demethylase to the viral genome.</p><p>There are remarkable analogies but also interesting differences between our results and recent data implicating KAP1 in the control of KSHV latency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cai et al., 2013</xref>). In cells harboring latent KSHV genomes, KAP1, HP1 and H3K9me3 were enriched at more than two thirds of viral promoters, and KAP1 knockdown reduced these repressive marks and stimulated virus production. Furthermore, upon induction of a lytic cycle by overexpression of the Rta viral transactivator, KAP1 dissociated from the viral genome, resulting in loss of HP1 and H3K9me3. This correlated with phosphorylation of KAP1 on S<sup>824</sup>, apparently mediated by the viral kinase vPK, with reciprocal decrease in the level of KAP1 sumoylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chang et al., 2009</xref>). Here, while we find that a KAP1 phosphorylation switch can also force HCMV out of latency, we demonstrate that, with this virus, the phosphorylated form of the master repressor remains associated with actively transcribed viral genomes. Furthermore, we implicate the cellular kinase mTOR in KAP1 phosphorylation. It was previously noted that both the mTORC1 (mTOR complex 1) and mTORC2 (mTOR complex 2) arms of the mTOR pathway are activated during lytic HCMV replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kudchodkar et al., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">2007</xref>). This results in phosphorylating notably the eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E)-binding protein (4E-BP1) and the p70S6 kinase (S6K), which enhances viral protein translation and more generally minimizes cellular stress responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Clippinger et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Poglitsch et al., 2012</xref>). Here, we identify KAP1 as another substrate of this cascade, by observing that (i) the co-repressor is phosphorylated on serine 824 in cells productively infected with HCMV; (ii) this process is inhibited by the mTOR inhibitors rapamycin and Torin1; and (iii) mTOR targets the viral chromatin at KAP1-bearing genomic sites during a lytic cycle. Conversely, we could force HCMV out of transcriptional dormancy by inducing the activation of ATM, another kinase targeting KAP1 on serine 824, in latently infected HSC and circulating monocytes. Nevertheless, our data also point to the role of viral factors in targeting this process. First, S<sup>824</sup> phosphoKAP1 was detected only in HCMV IE antigen-positive cells. Second, KAP1 conserved its ability to repress a chromosomal target in cells where its HCMV silencing activity was abrogated by phosphorylation. This strongly suggests that mTOR is targeted to the HCMV genome, where the viral DNA-associated KAP1 molecules are then exposed to its action, a model supported by the results of our mTOR-specific chromatin immunoprecipitation. Such spatial compartmentalization would not be unprecedented, as site-specific KAP1 phosphorylation is also observed in case of DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">White et al., 2006</xref>), and as mTOR has itself been observed to be directed to sites of HCMV assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Clippinger and Alwine, 2012</xref>). More generally, it will be interesting to ask whether the KRAB/KAP1 pathway contributes to the latency of other herpes viruses, even though in the case of EBV the only evidence available so far is that it instead promotes viral DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liao et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>Latency is a dominant, cell type- and differentiation stage-specific mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Saffert et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Goodrum et al., 2012</xref>), as it is limited to HSC and cells of the myeloid lineage such as monocytes, and to HCMV clinical isolates (e.g., TB40-E) that contain genomic regions commonly deleted in latency-incompetent laboratory strains (e.g., AD169) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Goodrum et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Reeves and Sinclair, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Petrucelli et al., 2012</xref>). Our findings thus suggest that, in HSC, a latency-specific gene product counters HCMV-induced mTOR-mediated KAP1 phosphorylation, for instance by either blocking the kinase or by acting as or inducing a KAP1-specific phosphatase. This warrants investigations aimed at elucidating this aspect, and at determining whether, when and, if so, downstream of what pathway mTOR becomes activated and KAP1 phosphorylated during the differentiation of HSC towards macrophages or activated DCs, the cells in which HCMV transcription becomes fully productive.</p><p>KAP1 is not a DNA-binding protein, and is classically tethered to given genomic loci, for instance endogenous retroelements, by sequence-specific KRAB-ZFPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Friedman et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wolf and Goff, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rowe and Trono, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Castro-Diaz et al., 2014</xref>). By analogy, it is tempting to hypothesize that members of the KRAB-ZFP family are also involved in recognizing the HCMV DNA. In support of this model, KAP1 recruitment to the HCMV genome was lost when the KRAB-binding RBCC domain was deleted (not illustrated). Since we detected close to thirty major KAP1 peaks on the HCMV DNA and failed to identify a common motif amongst all these sequences, more than one DNA-binding protein, whether or not KRAB-ZFP, is likely involved in docking the corepressor at these sites. In the case of KSHV, the latency protein LANA is responsible for tethering sumoylated KAP1 and the KAP1-bound Sin3A repressor to the Rta promoter, through its ability to interact with SUMO-2-bearing proteins. Upon hypoxia, KAP1 is de-sumoylated and together with Sin3A is released from the KSHV genome, leading to the activation of the LANA-associated HIF-1α, the inducible subunit of the hererodimeric HIF-1 (hypoxia-induced factor 1), thus activating viral gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cai et al., 2013</xref>). By analogy, it could be that a virally encoded product contributes to targeting KAP1 to the HCMV genome.</p><p>Our data have important clinical implications. First, it was recently noted that transplant recipients placed on immunosuppressive regimens that included rapamycin were less likely to suffer serious CMV-related complications than patients for whom this drug was omitted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andrassy et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sabé et al., 2012</xref>). The present work indicates that this beneficial effect might stem at least in part from a prevention of viral reactivation. This warrants further studies to assess the positive impact of this and other mTOR inhibitors on the control of HCMV infection, whether after transplantation or in other settings. Of note, a recent study demonstrated that rapamycin did not prevent HCMV reactivation from latently infected dendritic cells in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Glover et al., 2014</xref>). However, it could be that KAP1 phosphorylation was already established in this system, and that maturation of the DCs only resulted in activating transcription factors that are strong stimulators of HCMV gene expression, such as NF-κB.</p><p>Our discovery that HCMV can be forced out of latency by pharmacological manipulation suggests new avenues to eradicate infection by combining ATM and NF-κB activation with immune- or drug-based approaches aimed at killing HCMV-infected cells. The systemic administration of ATM and NF-κB activators may cause important side effects, and HCMV eradication is anyway probably unnecessary in immuno-competent individuals. However, the ex vivo treatment of HCMV-positive transplants, for instance bone marrow or HSC purified therefrom, could be readily envisioned to purge latently infected cells prior to engraftment, notably in the high-risk setting of HCMV-negative recipients.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture and treatments</title><p>CD34<sup>+</sup> cells from HCMV negative human cord blood were obtained from the Lausanne University Hospital (Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Vaudois, CHUV, Switzerland) delivery room with proper informed consent, layered on Ficoll gradient, purified with the CD34<sup>+</sup> cell separation kit (Miltenyi Biotec, Germany) and freshly used for experiments without freezing to avoid differentiation.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Tadatsugu Taniguchi (Senior editor), a guest Reviewing editor, and two additional reviewers.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p><italic>Reviewer 1</italic>:</p><p>The manuscript by Rauwel et al. reports that the master co-repressor KAP1 is involved in regulating viral lytic gene expression during latent infection of undifferentiated myeloid cells by HCMV; KAP1 mediates recruitment of chromatin post-translational modifiers to the viral Major Immediate Early Promoter (MIEP) resulting in repression of the viral MIEP and the establishment of a latent transcription programme.</p><p>This is an interesting paper which presents data which goes some way to identifying at least one of the mechanisms by which the viral MIEP might be repressed during latent infection of myeloid cells with HCMV. However, in some cases the data could be presented more clearly, proper controls should be used and the data should be analysed in more depth.</p><p>The authors should address the following:</p><p>1) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> provides key data for the authors' hypothesis but conflate two very different analyses. Panel A and B analyse permissiveness of cells for infection (KAP1 is knocked-down, then cells are infected with HCMV); panel D analyses reactivation (cells are infected with HCMV, left to go latent and then KAP1 is knocked-down); it is unclear from the information in the figure legend how the cells were treated in panel C but my reading of the text suggests that panel C represents virus production from cells which were knocked-down for KAP1 prior to infection.</p><p>These different analyses are informative but should be separated clearly into panels which show analyses of permissiveness (KAP1 knock down then HCMV infection) and reactivation from latency (HCMV infection, then subsequent KAP1 knock-down). A key question then is whether cells that are reactivated from latency (HCMV infection, then subsequent KAP1 knock-down) actually produce virus in this model. This only appears to be shown, in panel C, for cells that have been made permissive (KAP1 knock down then HCMV infection). This is important, as delivery genome in the context of virions (with pp71 tegument activator etc.) is a very different condition to reactivation of latent genome (in which no such tegument proteins will be present).</p><p>The authors should carry out a comprehensive analysis of IE/E/late RNAs (as shown in panels 1 A/B) on cells that are induced to reactivate by KAP1 depletion (HCMV infection, then subsequent KAP1 knock-down) and also analyse these cells for de novo virus production (as shown in panel C). This is important as more data are accumulating to suggest that other hurdles, besides just induction of IE1/IE2, may be needed for full reactivation of infectious virus.</p><p>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2 fig3">Figure 2 and 3</xref>. These analyses should be carried out side-by-side with latent myeloid cells that have been induced to reactivate by standard differentiation conditions (not compared to permissive fibroblasts, or to an laboratory isolate of virus that is missing a large amount of viral genome and is inefficient at establishing latency in CD34<sup>+</sup> cells).</p><p>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4 fig5">Figure 4 and 5</xref>. I am uncertain why the authors have reverted to using permissive fibroblasts for these analyses. They should be carried out in latent CD34<sup>+</sup> which have been differentiated to reactivate latent HCMV genome (alternatively, latent monocytes differentiated to DCs could be used).</p><p>4) The authors must discuss their observations in the light of recently published data that mTOR inhibition does not prevent HCMV reactivation from dendritic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Glover et al. 2014</xref>) and that macrophages infected with HCMV, contrary to observations with fibroblasts, are sensitive to rapamycin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Poglitsch et al. 2012</xref>).

The argument is that KAP1 exerts functions via recruitment of secondary modulators (HP1 etc.). This, to me, needs to be explored. For instance, a recent report from the Pari laboratory suggests HCMV encodes a viral RNA that recruits Polycomb repressor complex and H3K27meth marks at the MIEP. Why aren't HP1 etc. recruited? How does KAP1 effect these functions? This seems pivotal for understanding the role of KAP1. Ultimately, what is it about AD169 that negates any activity of KAP1? An alternative explanation could be that the data from analysing TB40-E and AD169 suggests that KAP1 binding to the viral genome is irrelevant and that any KAP1 effects observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> are indirect due to the multitude effects KAP1 KO would have on other cellular function which then impact on HCMV gene expression.</p><p>2) Which KAP1 (indirect) binding site do the authors believe is important for controlling the MIEP (given that it doesn't appear to bind to be recruited directly to the MIEP in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>)? Some means to block KAP1 recruitment to the viral genome (via sequence mutagenesis) would provide more compelling evidence that KAP1 binding to the viral DNA drives heterochromatic formation at the MIEP. However, this would require identification of the KAP1 binding partner tethering it to the viral DNA. I appreciate the siRNA KO of KAP1 blocks heterochromatic formation at the MIEP but the AD169 observation requires explanation and again suggests that any KAP1 effects could be highly indirect and due to major changes in the cellular biology when knocking out such a key regulator. Again the AD169 data really argues against KAP1 binding being important for controlling latency since KAP1 is recruited to this genome perfectly well but does not provide the same level of control as it apparently does in TB40-E.</p><p>3) The authors make an important observation in their studies of CD34<sup>+</sup> precursors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). The chloroquinone expt (thought to be via KAP1) has only a minor effect on HCMV reactivation and you need subsequent NF-kB stimulation to make it more robust. But they never compare it to DCs directly they just make inference (even DCs given these additional treatments). This would be very interesting and provide a more complete set of data. That aside, is the prediction that if you were to KO KAP1 and see the effect observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> then the addition of chloroquinone (thought to be active via modulation of KAP1) to KAP1 KO cells should have no incremental impact on HCMV reactivation if the authors predictions are true i.e. if KAP1 mediated repression is deleted by siRNA then any effects of chloroquinone should be abrogated.</p><p>In summary, the link between KAP1, heterochromatic control of viral latency and the activation of mTOR pathways is all correlative. I think there has, at least, to be some appreciation that whilst pharmacological modulators of KAP1 could trigger reactivation the data does not state it is the activity of those inhibitors towards KAP1 which is mediating the effect. One would presume ATM promotes phosphorylation of a number of cellular proteins but that does not mean they are all involved in HCMV reactivation. The paper sets out to show that KAP1 is the regulator of HCMV latency and reactivation and becomes less and less convincing. If the premise of the paper was chloroquinone and ATM trigger HCMV reactivation and we aim to identify a mechanism it would be more compelling.</p><p><italic>Reviewer 3:</italic></p><p>The authors provide evidence that shKAP1 transduction can induce high levels of hCMV transcription and virus production in latently infected CD34<sup>+</sup> cells, but not in permissively infected MRC-5 cells.

ChIP with KAP pS824-specific antibody suggests that phosphorylated KAP is enriched in MRC-5 cells, but not CD34<sup>+</sup> cells. They show that chloroquine treatment induces HCMV reactivation from CD34<sup>+</sup> cells, and that this is attenuated by treatment with an ATM inhibitor, but not an inhibitor of mTOR.

Fine monitoring of the timing of mTOR recruitment in a system where HCMV naturally exits from latency to induce productive infection would be worthwhile, but it is not straightforward, hence beyond the scope of the present study.</p><p><italic>8) The effects of chloroquine on HCMV viral production is impressive, but chloroquine has many pleiotropic effects on the cell and it is not clear that KAP is a major regulator under these conditions. One way to demonstrate the importance of the KAP pS</italic><sup><italic>824</italic></sup> <italic>in control of HCMV would be to re-introduce the KAP wt or KAP S</italic><sup><italic>824</italic></sup><italic>A into shKAP depleted cells and assay HCMV reactivation. A mutation like S</italic><sup><italic>824</italic></sup><italic>A can be assayed for its ability to block KAP phosphorylation and viral reactivation</italic>.</p><p><italic>Very good suggestions, which helped strengthen out model through additional experiments illustrated in new</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s6"><italic>Figure 6–figure supplement 6</italic></xref> <italic>as explained in our response to reviewer 1, point 3</italic>.</p><p><italic>9) The different effects of TORIN and KU on HCMV are interesting, but may not fit well with the overall model of a KAP1 phospho-switch. The effects of these inhibitors on KAP pS</italic><sup><italic>824</italic></sup> <italic>needs to be assessed by Western blot during normal infection and reactivation induced by chloroquine</italic>.</p><p>The effect of Torin and KU on KAP1 phosphorylation was documented by IF in the MRC-5 model, as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><italic>Figure 4</italic></xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1"><italic>Figure 4–figure supplement 1</italic></xref>. The corresponding antibody works poorly for Western blot, and monitoring KAP1 phosphorylation during viral reactivation in low numbers of HCMV-infected cells is beyond our current technical abilities.</p></body></sub-article></article>
