We determined the structures of the archaeal sodium/proton antiporter MjNhaP1 in two complementary states. The inward-open state was obtained by x-ray crystallography in the presence of sodium at pH 8, where the transporter is highly active. The outward-open state was obtained by electron crystallography without sodium at pH 4, where MjNhaP1 is inactive. Comparison of both structures reveals a 7° tilt of the 6 helix bundle. <sup>22</sup>Na<sup>+</sup> uptake measurements indicate non-cooperative transport with an activity maximum at pH 7.5. We conclude that binding of a Na<sup>+</sup> ion from the outside induces helix movements that close the extracellular cavity, open the cytoplasmic funnel, and result in a ∼5 Å vertical relocation of the ion binding site to release the substrate ion into the cytoplasm.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03583.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03583.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03583.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Although the membrane that surrounds a cell is effective at separating the inside of a cell from the outside environment, certain molecules and ions must enter or leave the cell for it to work correctly. Proteins embedded in the cell membrane, called transporters, ensure this occurs.</p><p>Transporters that are found in all organisms include the sodium/proton antiporters, which exchange protons from inside the cell with sodium ions from outside. However, exactly how these antiporters work was unknown.</p><p>Paulino, Wöhlert et al. have now examined the structure of a sodium/proton antiporter from a single-celled organism called <italic>Methanocaldococcus jannaschii</italic>, a species of archaea that thrives at high temperature. Using X-ray crystallography, Paulino, Wöhlert et al. uncovered the structure of the antiporter in the presence of sodium ions and in alkaline conditions. Under these conditions the sodium/proton antiporter adopts an ‘inward-open’ state, where the substrate-binding site—the region where the ions bind to be transported—of the transporter is open towards the cell interior. Paulino, Wöhlert et al. also used electron cryo-microscopy to investigate the antiporter's structure under acidic conditions in the absence of salt. This revealed an ‘outward-open’ state, where the substrate-binding site of the transporter is open towards the space outside of the cell. The main difference between this and the inward-open state is the movement of a bundle of six helices within the antiporter. This activating structural change occurs when a sodium ion binds to the antiporter rather than by a change in acidity.</p><p>Paulino, Wöhlert et al. found that the structure of the <italic>M. jannaschii</italic> antiporter is very similar to the structures of an antiporter from another archaea species, which was studied in separate work. The acidity range under which the two transporters are most active is different, indicating that minor changes in the amino acid sequence that make up their structure can have a substantial effect on the activity of these antiporters.</p><p>The next step will be to use computer simulations to calculate how sodium/proton antiporters change from an inward-open to an outward-open state. The <italic>M. jannaschii</italic> antiporter will be particularly suitable for such simulations, as Paulino, Wöhlert et al. found that it transports ions more rapidly than any previously known transporter. Understanding how these transporters work is also medically relevant, as defects in related sodium/proton antiporters in humans are implicated in serious and life-threatening diseases.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03583.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03583.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>Methanocaldococcus jannaschii</kwd><kwd>membrane transport</kwd><kwd>sodium/proton antiport</kwd><kwd>electron cryo-microscopy</kwd><kwd>x-ray crystallography</kwd><kwd>transport mechanism</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004189</institution-id><institution>Max-Planck-Gesellschaft (Max Planck Society)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Paulino</surname><given-names>Cristina</given-names></name><name><surname>Wöhlert</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name><name><surname>Kapotova</surname><given-names>Ekaterina</given-names></name><name><surname>Yildiz</surname><given-names>Özkan</given-names></name><name><surname>Kühlbrandt</surname><given-names>Werner</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Cluster of Excellence, Macromolecular Complexes</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kühlbrandt</surname><given-names>Werner</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004189</institution-id><institution>Max-Planck-Gesellschaft (Max Planck Society)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>International Max Planck Research School, Frankfurt</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Paulino</surname><given-names>Cristina</given-names></name><name><surname>Wöhlert</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name><name><surname>Kapotova</surname><given-names>Ekaterina</given-names></name><name><surname>Kühlbrandt</surname><given-names>Werner</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Transport and communication across biological membranes SFB807</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Paulino</surname><given-names>Cristina</given-names></name><name><surname>Wöhlert</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name><name><surname>Kühlbrandt</surname><given-names>Werner</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001871</institution-id><institution>Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia (Foundation for Science and Technology)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFRH/BD/62643/2009</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Paulino</surname><given-names>Cristina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The inward-open and outward-open structures of MjNhaP1 explain the mechanism of electroneutral sodium-proton antiport across the cell membrane.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> antiporters are essential secondary-active transporters of the cation-proton antiporter (CPA) family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brett et al., 2005</xref>).

The two dimers in the asymmetric unit were refined to 3.5 Å resolution (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). The 13 TMHs in the monomer are arranged into a 6-helix bundle and a row of seven helices at the dimer interface, as in PaNhaP, but the two structures differ in important details. Seen from above or below the membrane, the MjNhaP1 dimer is oval (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>) rather than rectangular.

Its cytoplasmic surface is flat and does not extend more than 10 Å above the membrane. The cytoplasmic cavity protrudes only 13 Å into the interior of the protomer. On the extracellular side, a negatively charged funnel, which is considerably wider and deeper than in PaNhaP, extends 15 Å towards the center of the protomer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). A short loop on the extracellular side of MjNhaP1 connects H6 to H7 and a short amphipathic helix connects H12 to H13 above the center of the helix bundle, whereas in PaNhaP, H6 and H7 are connected by a helix and H12 and H13 by a short loop (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>).<table-wrap id="tbl1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03583.004</object-id><label>Table 1.</label><caption><p>X-ray crystallographic data</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03583.004">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03583.004</ext-link></p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th/><th>Native</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Data collection</td><td/></tr><tr><td> Wavelength</td><td>0.976</td></tr><tr><td> Space group</td><td>P2<sub>1</sub></td></tr><tr><td> Cell dimensions</td><td/></tr><tr><td> <italic>a</italic>, <italic>b</italic>, <italic>c</italic> (Å)</td><td>98.4, 102.5, 132.1</td></tr><tr><td> α, β, γ (°)</td><td>90.0, 105.6, 90.0</td></tr><tr><td> Resolution (Å)</td><td>31.93–3.5 (3.72–3.5)</td></tr><tr><td> <italic>R</italic><sub>pim</sub></td><td>0.086 (0.573)</td></tr><tr><td> <italic>I</italic> / σ<italic>I</italic></td><td>6.0 (1.7)</td></tr><tr><td> CC*</td><td>0.999 (0.918)</td></tr><tr><td> Completeness (%)</td><td>99.3 (99.2)</td></tr><tr><td> Multiplicity</td><td>7.0 (7.2)</td></tr><tr><td>Refinement</td><td/></tr><tr><td> Resolution (Å)</td><td>31.93–3.5 (3.72–3.5)</td></tr><tr><td> Unique reflections</td><td>58,249</td></tr><tr><td> Reflections in test set</td><td>3115</td></tr><tr><td> R<sub>work</sub>/R<sub>free</sub> (%)</td><td>25.2/30.2 (34.4/39.2)</td></tr><tr><td> CC(work)/CC(free)</td><td>0.905/0.930 (0.799/0.645)</td></tr><tr><td> Wilson B-Factor (Å<sup>2</sup>)</td><td>141</td></tr><tr><td> Atoms in asymmetric unit</td><td>12,548</td></tr><tr><td> Protein</td><td>12,535</td></tr><tr><td> Ligands</td><td>13</td></tr><tr><td> r.m.s. deviations:</td><td/></tr><tr><td> Bond lengths (Å)</td><td>0.003</td></tr><tr><td> Bond angles (°)</td><td>0.785</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03583.005</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>X-ray structure of MjNhaP1.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The MjNhaP1 dimer seen from the cytoplasmic side.

H10 of MjNhaP1 is much shorter and does not protrude into the cytoplasm. MjNhaP1 has no equivalent for His292 in H10, a key residue for transport in PaNhaP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wöhlert et al., 2014</xref>). On the cytoplasmic side of the MjNhaP1 dimer interface, a line of ionic and polar residues parallel to the membrane surface maintains tight interactions between protomers. On the extracellular side, dimer interactions are mediated largely by the hydrophobic H1, although deletion of this helix, which is necessary for function, did not abrogate dimer formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Goswami et al., 2011</xref>). Mutational analysis indicates that the first 15 N-terminal residues of H1 are dispensable for activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). On the dimer interface of MjNhaP1 there is a deep, hydrophobic cavity, which, unlike that in PaNhaP, spans nearly the entire thickness of the membrane and is covered on the extracellular side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). As in PaNhaP, this cavity contains density indicative of co-purified, flexible lipids, which was however not sufficiently well-defined for building an atomic model.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Substrate binding and transport</title><p>Structural homology to PaNhaP indicates that the substrate ion, which is not resolved in MjNhaP1, is coordinated by Asp132 and the backbone of Thr131 in the unwound stretch of H5. Other key residues in the ion-binding site are Ser157 and Asp161 in H6 (Ser155 and Asp159 in PaNhaP; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). MjNhaP1 lacks an equivalent of the ion-coordinating Glu73 in H3 of PaNhaP, which is however not essential for transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wöhlert et al., 2014</xref>). Instead, Thr76 in H3 of MjNhaP1 interacts with Glu154 in H6, which may guide the substrate ion from the binding site to the cytoplasm. Asn160 in H6 is part of the characteristic ND motif in the CPA1 antiporters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). Comparison with PaNhaP suggests that Asn160 is unlikely to coordinate the substrate ion directly. Rather, it forms a hydrogen bond to the hydroxyl group of Thr131, which in PaNhaP does participate in substrate-ion coordination via its main-chain carbonyl. Nevertheless, changing N160 to alanine renders MjNhaP1 inactive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). A mutant in which N160 is exchanged against aspartate has reduced activity but is not electrogenic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B,C</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03583.011</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Detailed views of the MjNhaP1 x-ray structure.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Cytoplasmic view of the 6-helix bundle with residues involved in substrate-ion binding and transport.

Amplitudes and phases obtained from 128 images were merged to yield a 3D map (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) with an in-plane resolution of 6 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). The unit cell contained two dimers, with one protomer in the asymmetric unit. The MjNhaP1 x-ray structure was fitted manually to the EM map to obtain an atomic model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). A 3D difference map calculated between the experimental 6 Å EM density and the x-ray map truncated to this resolution indicated clear changes in the orientation of key helices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Of the interface helices, only H10 required a tilt of ∼6° about the helix center. Within the 6-helix bundle, H6 was tilted by ∼14° and H12<sub>E</sub> by ∼15°. H5<sub>C</sub> and H5<sub>E</sub> changed direction by ∼15° and ∼7°, respectively. The 6-helix bundle as a whole tilted by ∼7° towards the dimer interface on the cytoplasmic side and away from the dimer interface on the extracellular side, about an axis in the membrane plane roughly parallel to the dimer interface. On the cytoplasmic side of the EM model, H5<sub>C</sub> and H6 are closer to the interface than in the x-ray structure and obstruct access to the substrate-binding site. On the extracellular side, the tilt of the 6-helix bundle, especially of H6 and 12<sub>E</sub>, widens and deepens the exterior funnel. Whereas the x-ray structures of MjNhaP1 and PaNhaP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wöhlert et al., 2014</xref>) both show the inward-open conformation, the EM structure of MjNhaP1 is closed on the cytoplasmic and open on the extracellular side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>).

The inward-open model of TtNapA implied that the 6-helix bundle moves up and down by 10 Å and rotates by 21° about an axis roughly perpendicular to that in MjNhaP1 and ASBT. The similarity of the MjNhaP1 EM structure to the TtNapA x-ray structure suggests however that the inward-open state of TtNapA closely resembles the x-ray structure of MjNhaP1 rather than that of EcNhaA.

CPA2 antiporters, such as EcNhaA and TtNapA, exchange two protons against one Na<sup>+</sup>. One of the predicted motifs for the electrogenic transport is the DD motif in helix V in place of the ND motif in H6 of CPA1 antiporters, such as MjNhaP1 and PaNhaP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). In CPA2 antiporters the two conserved aspartates have been proposed to each bind one of the translocated protons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Taglicht et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hunte et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arkin et al., 2007</xref>). However, replacing N160 in the ND motif does not render MjNhaP1 electrogenic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). The inactive N160A mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) shows that this sidechain is important for ion translocation, even though it does not participate in ion coordination directly. The reduced activity of the N160D mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B,C</xref>) suggests a possible role in stabilizing the proton or substrate-bound state, which can also be fulfilled by an aspartate. Note that an asparagine in this position renders EcNhaA and TtNapA inactive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Inoue et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lee et al., 2013a</xref>), probably because it cannot form an ion bridge, as observed for Lys305 and Asp156 in TtNapA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lee et al., 2013a</xref>), which may be important for protein stability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). In MjNhaP1 and PaNhaP the arginine replacing this lysine does not interact with the ND motif but forms an ion bridge to the neighboring conserved glutamate in H6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), which would stabilize the 6-helix bundle. In terms of its overall structure, TtNapA is more similar to MjNhaP1 and PaNhaP than to EcNhaA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hunte et al., 2005</xref>), especially with respect to the relative position of the dimer interface with the seven helices. The tertiary structure of CPA antiporters thus does not correlate with their transport stoichiometry. There appear to be two types, one of which, represented by MjNhaP1, PaNhaP and TtNapA, is more common than the other type, that seems to be confined to EcNhaA and its close relatives.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Transport rates</title><p><sup>22</sup>Na<sup>+</sup> uptake measurements with MjNhaP1 proteoliposomes acidified by an ammonium sulfate gradient indicated a bell-shaped pH profile with a pH maximum at around pH 7.5. Activity dropped to background levels below pH 4 or above pH 9. Earlier studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hellmer et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Vinothkumar et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Goswami et al., 2011</xref>) had found that MjNhaP1 is active at pH 6 but inactive at pH 7.5 or above. This discrepancy is due to the C-terminal affinity tag on the construct that was used in previous transport measurements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hellmer et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Goswami et al., 2011</xref>). We repeated the measurements with this tagged construct under symmetrical pH conditions and found that it was indeed inactive at pH 8 but active at pH 6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Apparently the affinity tag at the C-terminus of H13, which is part of the 6-helix bundle, impairs the mobility of the bundle at elevated pH. This movement is an integral feature of the transport mechanism. For reliable functional measurements on flexible, conformationally active membrane transporters it is therefore advisable to use untagged proteins. <sup>22</sup>Na<sup>+</sup> uptake by untagged MjNhaP1 reconstituted at a high lipid/protein ratio into proteoliposomes acidified by an ammonium gradient also avoids other potential problems associated with the limited pH range of fluorescent dyes, everted vesicles energized by a process that is itself pH-dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Reenstra et al., 1980</xref>), or with leaky proteoliposomes produced at low lipid/protein ratio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tsai et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>The bell-shaped pH profile of MjNhaP1 and PaNhaP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wöhlert et al., 2014</xref>) confirms an earlier conclusion that the antiporter has to shut down at acidic or basic pH for physiological reasons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Vinothkumar et al., 2005</xref>). Our finding that proton-driven Na<sup>+</sup> uptake drops at decreasing external pH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>) is in good agreement with the inverse experiment, which showed that Na<sup>+</sup> efflux in MjNhaP1 proteoliposomes increases under these conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Calinescu et al., 2014</xref>). In the Na<sup>+</sup> uptake experiment, substrate ions bind less well from the outside at low external pH due to proton competition. Conversely, in the efflux experiment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Calinescu et al., 2014</xref>), a decrease in external pH has no effect on Na<sup>+</sup> binding from the inside.</p><p>The turnover number of MjNhaP1 was derived from v<sub>max</sub> = 2187 ± 88 nmol · min<sup>−1</sup> · mg<sup>−1</sup> at pH 8 measured at 0°C. At any higher temperature, transport was too fast to be reliably recorded. The measured rate of 1.68 ions per second per protomer is more than 400 times higher than the transport rate of PaNhaP extrapolated to 0°C. The difference is most likely due to an extra acidic sidechain (Glu73) in the ion-binding site of PaNhaP, which has no equivalent in MjNhaP1. Removal of this sidechain in PaNhaP increases the transport rate, because the substrate ion is released more readily (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wöhlert et al., 2014</xref>). Although compared to EcNhaA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Taglicht et al., 1991</xref>), neither MjNhaP1 nor PaNhaP are particularly fast at ambient conditions, the activity of PaNhaP increases exponentially with temperature to an extrapolated turnover number of 5000 ions per second at 100°C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wöhlert et al., 2014</xref>). Given its similarity to PaNhaP, MjNhaP1 will be very much faster at its physiological temperature of 85°C than at room temperature, and most likely also considerably faster than PaNhaP under physiological conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Transport mechanism</title><p>The x-ray structure of MjNhaP1 was determined at pH 8 in the presence of substrate ions, where the antiporter is highly active. The x-ray structures of PaNhaP were determined at pH 4 or pH 8 also in the presence of Na<sup>+</sup>. Under both conditions PaNhaP is inactive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wöhlert et al., 2014</xref>). The close resemblance of the MjNhaP1 and PaNhaP x-ray structures proves that there is no pH-induced conformational switch to regulate either antiporter. This is in excellent agreement with a recent study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Paulino and Kühlbrandt, 2014</xref>), which indicated that a change in pH in the absence of substrate ions has only minimal effects on the conformation of MjNhaP1, whereas Na<sup>+</sup>-binding induces helix movements that are similar in the entire activity range and consistent with the changes in helix orientation described here (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). We propose that these considerations hold true for all CPA1 antiporters.</p><p>Like the mammalian NHE exchangers, the electroneutral Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> antiporters MjNhaP1 and PaNhaP are thought to work as Na<sup>+</sup>-driven proton transporters. They maintain an intracellular neutral pH by utilizing the inward Na<sup>+</sup> gradient that is always present in their native saline habitat. In PaNhaP, Na<sup>+</sup> coordination stabilizes the inward-open state, whereas the apo or proton-bound state of MjNhaP1 adopts the outward-open conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Paulino and Kühlbrandt, 2014</xref>). Thus, their default resting state is inward-open with a sodium ion in the binding site. As suggested for EcNhaA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mager et al., 2011</xref>) and recently shown for MjNhaP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Calinescu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Paulino and Kühlbrandt, 2014</xref>), protons and Na<sup>+</sup> compete for a single binding site in the protomer. When the intracellular pH drops, the binding site becomes protonated and the Na<sup>+</sup> ion is released into the cytoplasm. The conformational changes we observe are consistent with a rocking bundle mechanism, as proposed for other secondary transporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Forrest and Rudnick, 2009</xref>).

Lattice images were screened by optical diffraction, and well-ordered areas of 4k × 4k or 6k × 6k pixels were digitized at 7 μm step size on a Zeiss SCAI scanner. Images were processed by the 2dx software package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gipson et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>A total of 128 image areas (15 at 0°, 23 at 20°, 44 at 30° and 46 at 45° or above) were used for 3D reconstruction. Data quality was improved by synthetic unbending (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arheit et al., 2013</xref>). To compensate for the resolution-dependent degradation of image amplitudes a negative temperature factor of B = −200 Å<sup>2</sup> was used. A molecular model was build by fitting the MjNhaP1 x-ray structure into the 3D EM density in COOT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Emsley and Cowtan, 2004</xref>). 3D difference maps were calculated with scripts from the CCP4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Winn et al., 2011</xref>) and the PHENIX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams et al., 2010</xref>) software packages (as indicated below). The EM and x-ray density maps were expanded, scaled and the resolution cut to 6 Å (sftools). Maps were superimposed in PHENIX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams et al., 2010</xref>) and placed into a cell with identical units (mapmask, maprot). The density of one protomer was masked with the help of the pdb models (pdbset, ncsmask, maprot, mapmask), and both maps were subtracted from one another (overlapmap).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Figures and movies</title><p>Figures and movies were prepared with PyMOL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">DeLano and Lam, 2005</xref>).

Liposomes were preformed using polycarbonate filters with a pore size of 400 nm and destabilized by addition of octyl glucoside to a final concentration of 1%. MjNhaP1 was added at an LPR of 200:1 and the suspension was incubated for 1 hr. Detergent was removed by dialysis (14 kDa cut-off) overnight against detergent-free reconstitution buffer. To ensure complete detergent removal, 1 g of Biobeads were added to the dialysis buffer per 4 ml of lipids. Proteoliposomes were centrifuged at 300,000×<italic>g</italic> for 20 min and washed once with reconstitution buffer. Liposomes were centrifuged again and resuspended at a lipid concentration of 60 mg/ml in reconstitution buffer. 2 µl of proteoliposomes were diluted in 2 ml of reaction buffer (10 mM choline citrate/Tris/glycine at the same pH, 5 mM KCl, 2 µM acridine orange) to start the reaction. Antiport activity of MjNhaP1 establishes a ΔpH across the membrane, observed as acridine orange quenching. As a control, (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> was added to a final concentration of 25 mM at the end of the reaction to dissipate the pH gradient. Measurements were performed at 25°C and acridine orange fluorescence was monitored at 530 nm (excitation: 495 nm) in a Hitachi fluorimeter.</p><p>For <sup>22</sup>Na uptake measurements<italic>,</italic> reconstitution was performed as described for sodium efflux under symmetrical pH conditions, with the following changes. Lipids were resuspended in 20 mM choline citrate/Tris/glycine pH 4–10, 10 mM (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, 10 mM β-mercaptoethanol and the LPR was 400:1. Transport was initiated by diluting 2 µl of proteoliposomes into 200 µl of reaction buffer (20 mM choline citrate/Tris/glycine at the same pH, 10 mM choline chloride, 2 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>) containing NaCl at final concentrations between 25 µM and 6.5 mM and 1 µCi/ml <sup>22</sup>Na. Dilution of proteoliposomes in (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>-free reaction buffer results in NH<sub>3</sub> efflux, acidifying the interior of the liposomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dibrov and Taglicht, 1993</xref>). Transport was stopped by filtering the proteoliposomes on 0.2 µm nitrocellulose filters and washing with 3 ml ice-cold <sup>22</sup>Na-free reaction buffer. Before counting, filters were transferred to counting tubes and 4 ml scintillation cocktail (Rotiszint, Roth, Germany) was added. All measurements were performed on ice and repeated at least three times.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Mutagenesis studies</title><p>The activities of N-terminal truncated MjNhaP1 constructs and the Asn160 mutant were determined under asymmetrical pH by fluorescence in everted vesicles or proteoliposomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Goswami et al., 2011</xref>).

Your article has been evaluated by Michael Marletta (Senior editor), Richard Aldrich (Reviewing editor), and 2 reviewers.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments.</p><p>This paper, like its companion, looks at structures of Na/H exchangers homologous to the NHE family in mammals. Here, the authors present an x-ray structure of MjNhaP1 (at pH 8.0), a close homolog of the PaNhaP presented in the companion paper. Because they could not obtain crystals of MjNhaP1 at low pH they present a 3D EM map of the protein at low pH and suggest, based on differences between this map and the x-ray model, that conformational changes demonstrate the EM map to be in an outward facing state. Unfortunately, the methods used to compare EM map and x-ray model are poorly justified and the results are not convincing. In particular many of the differences between the maps are slight vertical displacements, in the direction where the resolution of the EM map is quite limited (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>), as can easily be seen in the EM density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). The accompanying biochemical experiments are nicely performed but the overall significance of the high pH structure alone is not compelling.</p><p>Additional issues:</p><p>1) The structure of MjNhaP1 at pH 8, solved by molecular replacement with PaNhaP (reported in the accompanying paper), is also “inward open” but has an extracellular funnel that is surprisingly wide and deep. It was not clear whether this funnel is seen in the putative outward facing conformation derived from the 3D EM structure, and the authors do not discuss the significance of its dimensions. Was there also a narrow cytoplasmic channel analogous to the one seen in PaNhaP?</p><p>2) The authors extrapolate their measured transport rate (1.68 ions per second) to a number of 500,000 ions per second at 85 degrees. We strongly doubt that this is an accurate number as this is essentially the turnover rate of an ion channel and is much faster than any transporter we know. Many other factors are likely to come into play to limit the turnover of the protein at these high temperatures and this misleading speculation should be removed, especially from the Abstract.</p><p>3) The kinetic data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C and 5D</xref> does not seem to be approaching saturation; it is therefore not possible to rely on the fits of these data to obtain kinetic parameters.</p><p>4) The acridine orange assay used in both papers to measure proton flux is an excellent assay for qualitative assessment of proton flux. However, the actual mechanism of acridine orange is unknown in detail and it is impossible to quantitatively measure pH change with this assay. Therefore the relative rates as a function of pH in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> are unreliable and should be omitted. Na22 flux could be used to measure these rates if desired, or a more quantitative pH probe, like pyranene.</p><p>5) The close similarity of the active MjNhaP and inactive PaNhaP structures at pH 8 argue against large pH induced conformational changes that drive transporter activation. This is a useful finding of this study and an excellent counter to the criticism that both structures reported in accompanying paper of Wohlert et al. represent the inactive transporter. In this respect, it would have been helpful to see the MjNhaP and PaNhaP structures presented side by side in the same paper.</p><p>6) There are some interesting differences between MjNhaP and PaNhaP including an absence of pH-dependent cooperativity that is attributed to the absence of a titratable histidine in H10 and the stabilizing effect of ionic interactions at the dimer interface. It is noted that the replacement of this His with Cys crosslinks the dimer interface in PaNhaP, with corresponding loss of function, but it was not shown that formation of the disulfide bond is pH dependent. Therefore, the attribution of non-cooperativity in MjNhaP to the absence of this His, or to stable salt bridges, is speculative and could have been tested more thoroughly.</p><p>7) The protein was crystallized in the presence of sodium, but unfortunately a corresponding density for substrate is not apparent. Functional studies by mutagenesis are minimal and disappointingly restricted to Asn160 that is part of the conserved ND motif. Replacement with the equivalent Asp in the DD motif of CPA2 transporters or with Ala gave convincing, but unsurprising results given findings in other Na+/H+ antiporters. The paper would have benefitted from more thoughtful mutagenesis experiments that bolstered the relatively weak structural advances made.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03583.029</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>This paper, like its companion, looks at structures of Na/H exchangers homologous to the NHE family in mammals.

Unfortunately, the methods used to compare EM map and x-ray model are poorly justified and the results are not convincing</italic>.</p><p>We not only compare the models of the EM and x-ray structures. We have actually calculated difference maps between the electron density obtained by x-ray crystallography of 3D crystals and the experimental 3D map obtained by cryo-EM of 2D crystals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). This is not trivial and as far as we are aware it has not been done before. The maps indicate clearly that the differences between the inward-open and outward-open state we observe by this unique combination of experimental techniques are real and significant.</p><p>We did obtain 3D crystals of MjNhaP1 at low pH and low Na+ concentration, but they do not diffract well enough for x-ray crystallography. This is why we used electron crystallography to obtain the outward-open structure, as explained in the manuscript.</p><p><italic>In particular many of the differences between the maps are slight vertical displacements, in the direction where the resolution of the EM map is quite limited (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8"><italic>Figure 8</italic></xref><italic>), as can easily be seen in the EM density (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6"><italic>Figure 6</italic></xref><italic>). The accompanying biochemical experiments are nicely performed but the overall significance of the high pH structure alone is not compelling</italic>.</p><p>We have now added a projection difference map between the inward-open x-ray structure and the outward-open EM structure (Figure 8–figure supplement 1B, C). This map provides incontrovertible evidence that the helix movements in the six-helix bundle are mainly lateral, not vertical. Since several of the helices in MjNhaP1 are tilted, they can be fitted unambiguously to the cryo-EM map not only in the horizontal but also in the vertical direction, as shown clearly in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>. This criticism raised by the reviewers is therefore invalid.</p><p>Furthermore, we compare this difference map (Figure 8–figure supplement 1B, C) to the projection difference map in an earlier paper on substrate-ion induced conformational changes in MjNhaP1 (Paulino &amp; Kühlbrandt, <italic>eLife</italic> 2014). Figure 8–figure supplement 1D in our revised manuscript is an adaptation of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> in that paper (top row, 500 mM NaCl, brought to the same phase origin for consistency). The virtually identical positions and intensities of difference peaks in the two maps indicate clearly that the difference between no salt and 500 mM NaCl at pH8 (or at pH4, for that matter, see bottom row in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> of Paulino &amp; Kühlbrandt, <italic>eLife</italic> 2014) is the same as between the inward-open and outward-open conformation of MjNhaP1. This allows us to relate the conformational changes we observed in response to ionic conditions in the earlier paper to the 3D structures of the inward-open or outward-open state presented in the present manuscript. Note that this was not possible before, because the earlier paper (Paulino &amp; Kühlbrandt, <italic>eLife</italic> 2014) did not contain any 3D information. The two studies are fully consistent with one another, and with the results of the PaNhaP manuscript.</p><p>The observed helix tilts in the conformational change from the inward-open to the outward-open state are of the order of ∼7°. This range is typical for state changes in secondary transporters such as BetP, LeuT, Mhp1, ASBT. In particular the conformational changes in MjNhaP1 and the structurally related bile acid symporter ASBT, for which high-resolution x-ray structures of both the inward-open and the outward-open state are available, are strikingly similar, as shown in <xref ref-type="other" rid="media3">supplementary video 3</xref>. The conformational changes we see in MjNhaP1 are thus exactly in line with those in other, well-characterized secondary transporters.</p><p><italic>Additional issues</italic>:</p><p><italic>1) The structure of MjNhaP1 at pH 8, solved by molecular replacement with PaNhaP (reported in the accompanying paper), is also “inward open” but has an extracellular funnel that is surprisingly wide and deep. It was not clear whether this funnel is seen in the putative outward facing conformation derived from the 3D EM structure, and the authors do not discuss the significance of its dimensions. Was there also a narrow cytoplasmic channel analogous to the one seen in PaNhaP?</italic></p><p>The substrate-binding site in the x-ray structure of MjNhaP1 at pH8 is accessible from the cytoplasm but not from the extracellular side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2–figure supplement 1</xref>). Therefore this structure represents the inward-open state of MjNhaP1. In the inward-open state, the extracellular funnel in MjNhaP1 is both deeper and wider than that of PaNhaP, but it does not extend to the ion-binding site, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>. In the outward-open EM structure the extracellular funnel deepens and widens further, making the substrate-binding site accessible from the extracellular side. In this state, access from the cytoplasm is blocked by the cytoplasmic halves of helices 5 and 6. Hence the EM structure obtained at pH4 in absence of sodium is in the outward-open state. This is clearly shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>. The narrow cytoplasmic channel seen in PaNhaP is not present in MjNhaP1, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2–figure supplement 1</xref>.</p><p><italic>2) The authors extrapolate their measured transport rate (1.68 ions per second) to a number of 500,000 ions per second at 85 degrees. We strongly doubt that this is an accurate number as this is essentially the turnover rate of an ion channel and is much faster than any transporter we know. Many other factors are likely to come into play to limit the turnover of the protein at these high temperatures and this misleading speculation should be removed, especially from the Abstract</italic>.</p><p>The extrapolation is indeed likely to be inaccurate, as noted by the reviewers. However, the extrapolated transport rate of MjNhaP1 is still far below the diffusion rate of ion channels, which is at least two orders of magnitudes higher (&gt;107 ions per second). Compared with other antiporters at physiological temperatures, MjNhaP1 would be 100 times faster than PaNhaP (extrapolated to ∼5000 ions per second at 100°C, as noted in the accompanying manuscript), but only 35 times faster than the widely accepted transport rate of EcNhaA (extrapolated to 14,000 ions per second at 37°C, the physiological temperature of E.coli). We do not see a problem with these high turnover numbers, which seem feasible at high temperature, especially since the conformational changes are small. We do agree with the reviewers however that the transport rate may be limited by other factors, such as the surrounding lipids, which in our experiments are different from the host lipids. As requested, we have taken the extrapolated turnover rate out of the Abstract.</p><p><italic>3) The kinetic data presented in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"><italic>Figure 5C and 5D</italic></xref> <italic>does not seem to be approaching saturation; it is therefore not possible to rely on the fits of these data to obtain kinetic parameters</italic>.</p><p>In the revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, panels B and C (same as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5 C and D</xref> in the original manuscript) show substantially smaller activity increases for the three data points at higher salt concentration than in the mid-range of the curves. As a result the extrapolated non-linear fit flattens towards the end of the curve, indicating saturation. This is also reflected by the apparent half-saturation values that are in the middle of the measured concentration range. That our measurements approach saturation conditions is even clearer when the curves are plotted on a linear scale (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5–figure supplement 1</xref>). The linear plots indicate near saturation from around 5 mM NaCl.</p><p><italic>4) The acridine orange assay used in both papers to measure proton flux is an excellent assay for qualitative assessment of proton flux.

Na22 flux could be used to measure these rates if desired, or a more quantitative pH probe, like pyranene</italic>.</p><p>The transport rates as a function of pH in both papers were in fact measured by 22Na+ uptake. This was clearly stated in the original MjNhaP1 manuscript and in Figure legend 5 and in 7 different places in the PaNhaP manuscript, which must have escaped the reviewers’ attention. To avoid any possible confusion, we have omitted the former <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> from the revised manuscript, which did show acridine orange measurements, but had been included only to demonstrate transport under symmetrical pH conditions.</p><p><italic>5) The close similarity of the active MjNhaP and inactive PaNhaP structures at pH 8 argue against large pH induced conformational changes that drive transporter activation.

The original manuscript stated that His292 affects transport activity in PaNhaP and that this residue is absent in MjNhaP1. However we did not attribute the lack of cooperativity in MjNhaP1 to a single residue.</p><p><italic>7) The protein was crystallized in the presence of sodium, but unfortunately a corresponding density for substrate is not apparent.

The focus of this manuscript is on the observed conformational changes between the inward and outward-open conformation and new insights into the transport mechanism. More mutagenesis studies are in progress but go well beyond the scope of the present manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
