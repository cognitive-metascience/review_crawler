rhythmic activity in motor behaviors, such as breathing, walking, and chewing, remains elusive. For breathing, rhythm generation is localized to a brainstem nucleus, the preBötzinger Complex (preBötC). Rhythmic preBötC population activity consists of strong inspiratory bursts, which drive motoneuronal activity, and weaker burstlets, which we hypothesize reflect an emergent rhythmogenic process. If burstlets underlie inspiratory rhythmogenesis, respiratory depressants, such as opioids, should reduce burstlet frequency. Indeed, in medullary slices from neonatal mice, the μ-opioid receptor (μOR) agonist DAMGO slowed burstlet generation. Genetic deletion of μORs in a glutamatergic preBötC subpopulation abolished opioid-mediated depression, and the neuropeptide Substance P, but not blockade of inhibitory synaptic transmission, reduced opioidergic effects. We conclude that inspiratory rhythmogenesis is an emergent process, modulated by opioids, that does not rely on strong bursts of activity associated with motor output. These findings also point to strategies for ameliorating opioid-induced depression of breathing.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>opioids</kwd><kwd>breathing</kwd><kwd>rhythm generation</kwd><kwd>central pattern generator</kwd><kwd>motor systems</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS072211</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Feldman</surname><given-names>Jack L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HL135779</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Feldman</surname><given-names>Jack L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS097492</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kam</surname><given-names>Kaiwen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004359</institution-id><institution>Vetenskapsrådet</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Thörn Pérez</surname><given-names>Carolina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Inspiratory rhythmogenesis is mediated by an emergent mechanism independent of bursts associated with motor output and is modulated by opioids, pointing to strategies for ameliorating opioid-induced respiratory depression.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Rhythmic motor behaviors in mammals, such as breathing, walking, and chewing, are controlled by neural circuits that determine the period of the movement and shape the pattern of motor activity. The neural circuits controlling breathing are increasingly being recognized as relevant for elucidating mechanisms of rhythm and pattern generation and other principles of neural circuit function in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Grillner, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Moore et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ruder and Arber, 2019</xref>). Generation of breathing rhythm is localized to a compact nucleus in the ventrolateral medulla, the preBötzinger Complex (preBötC; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Smith et al., 1991</xref>). Rhythmic bursts of preBötC population activity were previously considered unitary events that both determined the timing and initiated the pattern of periodic inspiratory movements. However, we showed that these preBötC bursts consist of two separable components: i) strong inspiratory bursts that are transmitted via premotoneurons to inspiratory motoneurons to activate muscles that produce inspiratory airflow; and ii) weaker burstlets that we postulated are an emergent property of the network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Feldman and Kam, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kam et al., 2013a</xref>). Burstlets appear as preinspiratory activity when preceding preBötC bursts and are not normally seen in motor nerve or muscle activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kam et al., 2013a</xref>).</p><p>Because preBötC rhythmic activity does not rely on intrinsic ‘pacemaker’ conductances or inhibitory synaptic transmission and can consist solely of burstlets that do not produce motoneuronal output, we hypothesize that inspiratory rhythmogenesis is an emergent process, distinct from burst generation, that manifests as burstlets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Feldman and Kam, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kam et al., 2013a</xref>). In this model, burstlets occur when spontaneous firing among preBötC neurons reaches a threshold for synchrony, and the time required for preBötC neurons to assemble and achieve this synchrony (percolation) in each cycle is an essential determinant of the period of the rhythm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ashhad and Feldman, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Feldman and Kam, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kam et al., 2013a</xref>). A strong prediction of this hypothesis is that manipulations that slow breathing act specifically on this emergent rhythmogenic mechanism.</p><p>To test this prediction, we examined the effects of opioids, analgesics that significantly depress breathing at high doses, on bursts and burstlets and tested opioidergic interactions with other neurotransmitters and neuromodulators that affect preBötC neuronal excitability. We bath-applied [D-Ala<sup>2</sup>,N-MePhe<sup>4</sup>,Gly-ol<sup>5</sup>]-enkephalin (DAMGO), a potent synthetic µ-opioid receptor (µOR) agonist, in conditions of low excitability in vitro when burstlets appeared at times bursts would have been expected or when preBötC rhythmic activity consisted solely of burstlets. We find that opioids depress inspiratory frequency by acting on burstlet-producing preBötC Dbx1-derived (Dbx1<sup>+</sup>) neurons, an important glutamatergic subpopulation. These data are consistent with our hypothesis that an emergent mechanism, discernable as burstlets and independent of bursts, governs the cyclical assembly and activation of preBötC neurons underlying inspiratory rhythmogenesis. Our results also inform potential approaches for combating opioid-induced depression of breathing.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>DAMGO slows preBötC rhythmic activity without affecting burstlet fraction</title><p>Systemic administration of opioids slows breathing in rodents in vivo and in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boom et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gray et al., 1999</xref>). Inspiratory activity driving breathing can be assayed using extracellular field electrodes placed in the preBötC that measure action potentials generated by neurons near the electrode tip (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kam et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Telgkamp and Ramirez, 1999</xref>). This preBötC population activity is typically integrated, which accentuates activity that is synchronous across the network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kam et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Telgkamp and Ramirez, 1999</xref>). Integrated rhythmic preBötC population activity consists of: i) large bursts, reflecting high-frequency action potential firing across a number of neurons, that are coincident with inspiratory motor output as well as ii) smaller deflections, that is burstlets, which reflect lower frequency action potential firing across a similar number of preBötC neurons and which occur without simultaneous motor output (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,G</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kam et al., 2013a</xref>). We investigated how opioids affect preBötC burstlets and bursts in neonatal mouse brainstem slices that contain the preBötC and the hypoglossal motor nucleus and nerve (XII) and generate a physiologically relevant motor output, that is inspiratory-related rhythmic activity. To elicit rhythmic inspiratory activity in medullary slices, extracellular K<sup>+</sup> is typically raised to 8–9 mM to enhance circuit excitability and compensate for excitatory drive that is lost due to isolation of the preBötC from the intact brainstem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Del Negro et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Smith et al., 1991</xref>). Under baseline conditions in artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) containing 9 mM K<sup>+</sup> and 1.5 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> (‘9/1.5’), preBötC population activity and XII activity, when integrated, consists primarily of coincident, large amplitude rhythmic bursts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Smith et al., 1991</xref>). Subsaturating concentrations of [D-Ala<sup>2</sup>,N-MePhe<sup>4</sup>,Gly-ol<sup>5</sup>]-enkephalin (DAMGO), a potent synthetic µ-opioid receptor (µOR) agonist, caused a dose-dependent decrease in the frequency (<italic>f</italic>) of rhythmic preBötC and XII bursts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–C</xref>). 10 nM DAMGO significantly decreased preBötC <italic>f</italic> from 0.22 ± 0.05 Hz to 0.13 ± 0.04 Hz (p=0.01, n = 6; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). 30 nM DAMGO further decreased preBötC <italic>f</italic> to 0.07 ± 0.04 Hz (p=0.0001, n = 6; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), and 100 nM DAMGO led to complete cessation of XII activity and, in some cases, also blocked all preBötC activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>µOR activation depresses inspiratory frequency without affecting burstlet fraction.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative traces of ∫preBötC and ∫XII population activity in 9/1.5 ACSF control and 30 nM DAMGO.

The fraction of total preBötC events that were burstlets (burstlet fraction), which was very low in control conditions without DAMGO (0.14 ± 0.14), was not significantly different from that in 30 or 100 nM DAMGO (p=0.8, n = 6; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,C</xref>). Burstlet fraction was unaffected by changes in preBötC <italic>f</italic>, as there were no significant correlations in control 9/1.5 ACSF conditions, and no correlations developed in 10 nM or 30 nM DAMGO (p=0.8, n = 6; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Moreover, the amplitude of preBötC bursts was similar between control conditions without DAMGO (0.60 ± 0.10 a.u.) and 9/1.5 ACSF with 10 nM (0.61 ± 0.13 a.u.) or 30 nM DAMGO (0.56 ± 0.19 a.u.; p=0.8, n = 6).</p><p>In previous studies in rat medullary slices bathed in 9/1.5 ACSF, DAMGO-induced decreases in XII <italic>f</italic> were not affected by the presence of blockers of inhibitory synaptic transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gray et al., 1999</xref>), which can raise excitability independent of baseline increases in extracellular K<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Del Negro et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ren and Greer, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Shao and Feldman, 1997</xref>). We therefore examined whether the effects of DAMGO were similarly persistent when a cocktail of the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor antagonist picrotoxin and the glycine receptor antagonist strychnine (picrotoxin/strychnine) was added to mouse medullary slices and whether recording preBötC population activity could reveal effects that were not visible in XII activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Del Negro et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kam et al., 2013a</xref>). In 9/1.5 ACSF, adding picrotoxin/strychnine (100 µM/1 µM) with 30 nM DAMGO increased preBötC burst amplitude (0.95 ± 0.43 a.u.) compared to baseline (0.63 ± 0.062 a.u.; p=0.01, n = 13; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,E</xref>). Despite the increase in preBötC burst amplitude, preBötC <italic>f</italic> in slices bathed in 30 nM DAMGO and picrotoxin/strychnine (0.038 ± 0.023 Hz) was similar to preBötC <italic>f</italic> in 30 nM DAMGO alone (0.073 ± 0.037 Hz; p=0.6, n = 13) and significantly lower than preBötC <italic>f</italic> in 9/1.5 ACSF (0.23 ± 0.075 Hz; p=4×10<sup>−6</sup>, n = 13; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,F</xref>). preBötC <italic>f</italic> and burst amplitude showed no correlation under these conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Burstlet fraction was again unaltered when DAMGO and picrotoxin/strychnine were co-applied (p=0.09, n = 13; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,F</xref>), and no significant correlation between burstlet fraction and preBötC <italic>f</italic> was observed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).</p><p>To determine the effects of DAMGO when preBötC burstlets could be separated from bursts, we lowered ACSF K<sup>+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations to physiological levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kam et al., 2013a</xref>). In 3 mM K<sup>+</sup> and 1 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> (‘3/1’) ACSF, preBötC rhythmic activity is maintained, but consists of a mixed pattern of burstlets and bursts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>, upper traces). While the burstlet fraction under these conditions (0.58 ± 0.26) was significantly higher than that in 9/1.5 ACSF (0.14 ± 0.14; p=0.003, n = 6 for 9/1.5, n = 7 for 3/1), preBötC <italic>f</italic> was similar (0.23 ± 0.10 Hz in 3/1 vs. 0.22 ± 0.05 Hz in 9/1.5; p=0.8, n = 6 for 9/1.5, n = 7 for 3/1; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,I</xref>).

Again, no significant correlations were observed between burstlet fraction and preBötC <italic>f</italic> in picrotoxin/strychnine, and the slope of the linear fit was similar to that in control 3/1 ACSF (p=0.4, n = 13; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). While preBötC burstlet amplitudes were similar across these conditions (3/1 ACSF: 0.61 ± 0.13 a.u., picrotoxin/strychnine: 0.74 ± 0.42 a.u., p=0.2, n = 13), preBötC and XII burst amplitudes were significantly larger in picrotoxin/strychnine (preBötC burst: 0.90 ± 0.31 a.u., XII burst: 1.63 ± 0.86 a.u.) compared to 3/1 ACSF (preBötC burst: 0.71 ± 0.19 a.u., XII burst: 0.74 ± 0.20 a.u.; preBötC burst: p=0.004, XII burst: p=0.003, n = 13; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E,F</xref>).

Therefore, while both SP and inhibitory blockade can modulate the conversion of burstlets to bursts and picrotoxin/strychnine can have an effect on preBötC burst amplitudes, only NK1R activation could offset the depressant effects of DAMGO.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Inspiratory rhythm generation in mammals must be both robust, to operate almost continuously throughout the lifetime, and highly labile, to adapt to changing metabolic and environmental conditions and coordinate with other behaviors. How the preBötC generates rhythm to meet these challenges has thus far defied a thorough understanding. We put forth a hypothesis that respiratory rhythmogenesis is driven not by strong bursts, but by an emergent process that manifests as preBötC burstlets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kam et al., 2013a</xref>). In contrast to pacemaker-driven networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Phillips et al., 2019</xref>), where rhythm depends on the kinetics of conductances, such as I<sub>h</sub> or persistent inward currents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Marder and Calabrese, 1996</xref>), in this model, the period is determined by the gradual synchronization of spontaneously active, recurrently connected excitatory preBötC neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ashhad and Feldman, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Feldman and Kam, 2015</xref>). Each cycle consists of the generation, propagation, and integration of spontaneous activity within the preBötC and culminates in the generation of a burstlet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ashhad and Feldman, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Feldman and Kam, 2015</xref>).</p><p>A strong prediction of this hypothesis is that manipulations that depress respiratory frequency should also slow burstlet <italic>f</italic>. Indeed, we found that DAMGO specifically slowed preBötC <italic>f</italic> without affecting burstlet fraction when the rhythm was: i) composed of mostly bursts; ii) a mixed pattern of bursts and burstlets; or iii) mostly (or all) burstlets. Additionally, DAMGO prolonged the latency between photostimulation of ≤10 Dbx1<sup>+</sup> neurons and burst generation. Together, these effects are consistent with our hypothesis that both are products of percolation of activity within the preBötC microcircuit, a critical process for rhythmogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kam et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kam et al., 2013b</xref>). Moreover, when µORs were genetically deleted in Dbx1<sup>+</sup> neurons in <italic>Dbx1<sup>Cre</sup>;Oprm1<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice, the potent rhythmic slowing effect of DAMGO in slices was no longer present, suggesting that DAMGO directly affects rhythmogenic mechanisms through µORs in preBötC Dbx1<sup>+</sup> neurons. In line with our functional studies, we found abundant μOR expression in preBötC Dbx1<sup>+</sup> neurons that form the core circuitry for inspiratory rhythmogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wang et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>How could μOR activation affect the percolation of activity in the preBötC to slow down inspiratory rhythm? The synchronous low-frequency firing across preBötC neurons that defines a burstlet requires that a critical number of preBötC neurons be active and that their firing coincide in a short time frame to allow integration of inputs, depolarization above threshold, and further propagation of activity within the preBötC network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Feldman and Kam, 2015</xref>). μORs are found on dendrites and cell bodies, where they can regulate neuronal excitability, as well as on axon terminals, where they can inhibit neurotransmitter release via activation of K<sup>+</sup> conductances and/or inhibition of Ca<sup>2+</sup> conductances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Le Merrer et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mansour et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Montandon et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Williams et al., 2001</xref>). We suggest that DAMGO decreases the spontaneous firing rate and interferes with propagation of action potentials by hyperpolarizing membrane potential and/or decreasing synaptic probability of release in and among μOR-expressing preBötC Dbx1<sup>+</sup> neurons. These effects prolong the time required for preBötC neurons to increase their firing and reduce the probability that a critical number of neurons is simultaneously active to generate the next burstlet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ashhad and Feldman, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Feldman and Kam, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kam et al., 2013a</xref>). Thus, by depressing excitability and affecting percolation, DAMGO alters rhythmogenesis, independent of effects on strong bursts of activity associated with motor output.</p><p>DAMGO-mediated depression of preBötC <italic>f</italic> was mitigated by the NK1R agonist, SP, an effect that we suggest is mediated by intracellular signaling pathway interactions in preBötC Dbx1<sup>+</sup> neurons that coexpress μOR and NK1R. The μOR expression and DAMGO sensitivity of NK1R-expressing neurons are well-documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gray et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Montandon et al., 2011</xref>), and G<sub>s</sub>-protein coupled signaling of NK1R can oppose the G<sub>i/o</sub>-coupled signaling of μORs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gray et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Johnson et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Manzke et al., 2003</xref>). Indeed, we showed colocalization of μOR with NK1R in some preBötC neurons as well as with a partially overlapping preBötC subpopulation expressing TAC1 that may be one endogenous source of SP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Liu et al., 2004</xref>). Consistent with increases in XII and preBötC <italic>f</italic> observed when SP is applied to slices bathed in 9/1.5 ACSF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gray et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yeh et al., 2017</xref>), the effects of co-application of opioids and SP support a role for NK1R activation in modulating rhythm. However, the actions of SP and the interaction of NK1R and μOR can be complicated. In 3/1 ACSF alone, SP did not change preBötC <italic>f.</italic> A ceiling effect, that is preBötC <italic>f</italic> being near or at maximal, may have limited the rhythmogenic effect of SP in 3/1 ACSF alone. Alternatively, the primary targets of NK1R modulation of preBötC, whether within preBötC or elsewhere in the slice, for example medullary raphe, may be state/condition-dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nattie and Li, 2008</xref>). Additionally, opioids may inhibit SP release, and SP potentiates the antinociceptive effects of morphine through release of endogenous opioids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fukazawa et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kream et al., 1993</xref>). SP may also act directly on μORs as a weak agonist since naloxone, the μOR antagonist, blocks SP excitation in some neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Davies and Dray, 1977</xref>). Nonetheless, we predict that only neuropeptides and neuromodulators whose receptors are coexpressed with μORs in rhythmogenic preBötC neurons, like NK1Rs, are able to modulate μOR signaling intracellularly to mitigate DAMGO-mediated depression.</p><p>Consistent with this hypothesis, the depressant effects of DAMGO were not reduced by inhibitory blockade. The effects of picrotoxin and strychnine on excitability depend on developmental age, extracellular K<sup>+</sup>, and experimental preparation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ren and Greer, 2006</xref>), which may account for their inability to mitigate DAMGO-induced depression. Alternatively, as inhibitory synaptic activity in preBötC is dispensable for generation of breathing rhythm in vivo and in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Janczewski et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Shao and Feldman, 1997</xref>), inhibition may act elsewhere in the microcircuit or upstream of opioidergic signaling pathways within Dbx1<sup>+</sup> neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Oke et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>In the absence of DAMGO, we observed that both inhibitory blockade and NK1R activation could specifically affect burstlet fraction or burst amplitude independent of preBötC <italic>f</italic>. Indeed, variability in preBötC <italic>f</italic> was poorly correlated with variability in burstlet fraction across a number of conditions. How could burstlet fraction be specifically modulated? To generate a burst, the low level synchronous firing across the population that defines burstlets must increase in frequency and/or engage additional neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Feldman and Kam, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kam et al., 2013a</xref>). Because burst generation is all-or-none, we propose that burstlets become bursts when a functional threshold of activity is reached (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Feldman and Kam, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kam et al., 2013a</xref>). This threshold mechanism is distinct from the assembly process governing burstlet generation and likely involves activation of persistent inward conductances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Phillips et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Picardo et al., 2019</xref>) and recruitment of an additional subpopulation of preBötC neurons that may have a higher threshold for firing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kam et al., 2013a</xref>). Inspiratory preBötC somatostatin-expressing neurons, which do not show preinspiratory activity, or a population of premotoneurons that alter burst amplitude when photoablated are candidates for this recruited subpopulation and may, along with Dbx1<sup>+</sup> neurons generating both burstlets and bursts, represent an output layer for inspiratory rhythm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ashhad and Feldman, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cui et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kam et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). By modulating this threshold mechanism, SP and blockade of inhibitory synaptic transmission decreased, whereas Cd<sup>2+</sup> increased, the fraction of preBötC events that are burstlets, without altering frequency of these events. These neurons may then be targets of additional modulation to alter preBötC burst amplitude. Inhibition may regulate the threshold to recruit additional neurons during the burst and/or modulate membrane potential to augment or prolong activation of inward currents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Isaacson and Scanziani, 2011</xref>).</p><p>In vertebrate central pattern generators (CPGs), whether the timing signal is propagated, how the activity is distributed to muscle groups, and the intensity and duration of activity transmitted to muscle are typically considered pattern generating functions that are distinct from rhythmogenic mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Feldman, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Feldman and Kam, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">McCrea and Rybak, 2008</xref>). A basis for separating rhythm and pattern generation is the phenomenon of ‘non-resetting’ deletions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Janczewski and Feldman, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">McCrea and Rybak, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mellen et al., 2003</xref>). Deletions in locomotor CPGs may occur when neurons in the pattern formation layer are inhibited and the rhythmic signal is not transmitted to individual or multiple muscle groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">McCrea and Rybak, 2008</xref>). For the respiratory CPG, we suggest that transmission of the timing signal from preBötC to multiple muscle groups can fail at the level of the preBötC (via modulation of burst generating mechanisms) to underlie non-resetting deletions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Feldman and Kam, 2015</xref>). Inspiratory rhythmogenesis and the initial stages of inspiratory pattern generation are therefore mechanistically distinct, but are functions that can be performed in networks that overlap, perhaps significantly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Feldman and Kam, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kam et al., 2013a</xref>). Thus, burstlet rhythm constitutes the metronomic activity underlying rhythmic breathing movements, and preBötC bursts, by transmitting the burstlet timing signal as activity that has duration, amplitude, and shape to downstream motoneurons, are the first stage of a multilayer pattern formation process. The ultimate pattern of inspiratory activity determined by this microcircuitry includes both the temporal pattern (whether each burstlet beat is transmitted) and the strength and duration of muscle activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Feldman and Kam, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Janczewski and Feldman, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kam et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">McCrea and Rybak, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mellen et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>Understanding this organization and the interaction between excitatory neuromodulatory systems with opioids in respiratory neural circuits is relevant for addressing the depressive effects of opioids on breathing. Opioids are the most commonly prescribed drugs for severe acute and chronic pain and play an important role in palliative care. However, with a high potential for addiction, opioid overprescription and abuse has created a pressing public health crisis that affects millions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality, 2018</xref>). Morbidity and mortality from opioid addiction and overdose is largely a result of opioid-induced depression of breathing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jaffe and Martin WR, 1990</xref>). Opioids given systemically will act on opioid receptors throughout the nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kibaly et al., 2019</xref>), and μORs are expressed in various brain structures regulating breathing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gray et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Manzke et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Phillips et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pokorski and Lahiri, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Prkic et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zhang et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zhang et al., 2011</xref>). While depression of breathing is unlikely to be dependent on actions at a single site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lalley et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Montandon and Horner, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Stucke et al., 2015</xref>), our data are consistent with compelling in vitro and in vivo evidence that the preBötC is the most sensitive site to μOR agonists and that it is largely responsible for respiratory frequency depression by opioids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bachmutsky et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ballanyi and Ruangkittisakul, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Janczewski et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Montandon and Horner, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Montandon et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Varga et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>In summary, our findings support an essential role for burstlets in respiratory rhythm generation and suggest that opioids act on µORs in preBötC Dbx1<sup>+</sup> neurons to slow burstlet frequency and depress breathing. The depressive effect of the µOR agonist DAMGO on preBötC burstlet frequency, in the absence of a change in burstlet fraction, is consistent with the hypothesis that rhythm and pattern generating mechanisms within the preBötC are separable. We propose that having distinct mechanisms generating burstlets and bursts provides functional substrates for targeted modulation of the rhythmic timing and/or pattern of breathing by other brain areas and neuromodulators. This organization enables the dynamic temporal and pattern lability that is characteristic of breathing and essential for adaptation to changing metabolic demands and coordination with other respiratory-related and orofacial behaviors. Opioids are able to overcome these safety factors by targeting µORs on preBötC neurons responsible for generating rhythm and directly modulating their activity. A better understanding of the mechanisms of μOR actions in respiratory neural circuits has important implications for developing stimulants that excite breathing via non-opioidergic pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">van der Schier et al., 2014</xref>) and drugs that reverse opioid actions on preBötC Dbx1<sup>+</sup> neurons to maintain breathing without affecting analgesia.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>Experimental procedures were carried out in accordance with the United States Public Health Service and Institute for Laboratory Animal Research Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.

To obtain slices with the preBötC at the surface, the rostral cut was made above the first set of XII nerve rootlets at the level of the dorsomedial cell column and principal lateral loop of the inferior olive, and the caudal cut captured the obex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ruangkittisakul et al., 2011</xref>). Slice cutting artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) solution was composed of (in mM): 124 NaCl, 3 KCl, 1.5 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 25 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 0.5 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, and 30 D-glucose, equilibrated with 95% O<sub>2</sub> and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, 27°C, pH 7.4. Slices were placed rostral side up in a chamber and perfused at 2–3 ml/min with 28–30°C recording ACSF. Baseline recording ACSF consisted of either the cutting ACSF solution with K<sup>+</sup> raised to 9 mM and Ca<sup>2+</sup> maintained at 1.5 mM (9/1.5 ACSF) for a robust burst rhythm or the cutting ACSF solution with K<sup>+</sup> maintained at 3 mM and Ca<sup>2+</sup> lowered to 1 mM (3/1 ACSF) to study burstlets and bursts together (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kam et al., 2013a</xref>). Drugs, including DAMGO, SP, picrotoxin, strychnine, and CdCl<sub>2</sub>, were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich and bath-applied at the specified concentrations. The concentrations for each drug were chosen based on their demonstrated efficacy in in vitro preparations and well-below levels that would produce off-target receptor binding as shown either by dose-response curves or ineffectiveness in receptor knockout mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gray et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ptak et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ren and Greer, 2006</xref>). In all experiments, slices were allowed to equilibrate for 30 min to ensure that the frequency and magnitude of XII and preBötC population activities reached steady-state. Respiratory activity reflecting suprathreshold action potential firing from populations of neurons was recorded from XII motor nucleus or nerve roots and as population activity directly from the preBötC using suction electrodes (tip size ~50 µm) and an Axiopatch 200A (Molecular Devices), Multiclamp 700B (Molecular Devices), and/or a differential AC amplifier (AM systems), filtered at 2–4 kHz, integrated, and digitized at 10 kHz. Integration was performed on custom built Paynter filter with a 20–100 ms time constant. Digitized data were analyzed off-line using custom procedures written for IgorPro (Wavemetrics).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Holographic photostimulation</title><p>Holographic photostimulation was performed on a Phasor SLM system (Intelligent Imaging Innovations, Inc) mounted around an epifluorescence upright microscope (Axioscope; Zeiss). We used a 405 nm diode laser (CUBE 405–100; Coherent) to uncage MNI-glutamate (0.5 mM) and depolarize targeted neurons. An iterative Fourier transform algorithm, implemented in Slidebook 5 (Intelligent Imaging Innovations, Inc), computed the phase pattern on the SLM corresponding to the desired distribution of light intensity at the focal plane of the objective. A blocker was inserted in the intermediate Fourier plane to block the unmodulated light component (zero order spot) and replicate patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Golan et al., 2009</xref>). Neurons were targeted by centering 10 μm circular spots over the somata of the selected neurons. The laser intensity per spot was set at 1–3 mW, which was previously determined to elicit bursts of action potentials in the targeted neurons without the spread of glutamate to neighboring neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kam et al., 2013b</xref>). Each laser stimulation consisted of 5 × 0.8 ms pulses, delivered at 200 Hz. A threshold stimulus was determined as the minimum number of neurons and minimum laser power required to entrain preBötC bursts at slightly faster than the endogenous frequency with a success rate &gt;80%. The latency between laser stimulation and burst initiation was calculated as the time between the start of the next preBötC burst and the beginning of laser stimulation. preBötC activity was used here, rather than XII activity, to isolate the effects of DAMGO on rhythmogenic mechanisms and avoid additional delays or failures due to depression of XII premotoneurons and motoneurons. Successful triggering of a burst by photostimulation was defined as burst detection within 0.5 s of laser stimulation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Data analysis and statistics</title><p>Semiautomated event detection of respiratory-related activity recorded in XII output or preBötC population recordings was performed using custom procedures written in IgorPro. Multiple criteria, including slope and amplitude thresholds, were used to select events automatically, which were then confirmed visually. Event duration, amplitude, shape, and synchrony between XII and preBötC activity were criteria used to categorize detected events as burstlets, bursts, and doublets. Burstlets were events in preBötC that did not temporally overlap a XII burst. Doublets were distinguished from bursts by their longer duration and the presence of multiple peaks of activity. Two closely spaced bursts were considered a doublet based on the distribution of the period of XII output. A small peak at &lt;2 s in the distribution of periods of XII bursts was usually observed. A Gaussian was fit to this small peak and a threshold time interval was set. Two bursts separated by less than this threshold were considered a doublet. As doublets were in phase with bursts and burstlets, these events were grouped with bursts and not separately analyzed.</p><p>Rhythmogenic processes were captured by measuring the frequency of preBötC rhythmic activity, which included small amplitude burstlets that were not transmitted to XII motor output, larger amplitude bursts that produced XII bursts, and longer duration doublets that were also transmitted to XII motoneurons. The average frequency was calculated as the mean of the instantaneous frequencies (1/interevent interval) across all preBötC activity (burstlets, bursts, and doublets) in that condition. Pattern generating processes that included the production and transmission of preBötC activity to XII output were characterized by measuring the fraction of preBötC events that were burstlets. The burstlet fraction was calculated as the ratio of the number of burstlets to the total number of rhythmic preBötC events (burstlets, bursts, and doublets). Amplitudes were normalized to the amplitude of the largest burst in the control condition.</p><p>Data are expressed as mean ± standard deviation. In figures displaying average data, data points from individual experiments are displayed in gray. To determine sample sizes, a priori power analysis was performed using G*power 3.1.9.2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Faul et al., 2009</xref>). In this program, the appropriate statistical test along with a desired power of 95% at a 5% significance level was selected for each type of experiment with effects sizes based on published or preliminary data. These parameters yielded minimum total sample sizes of 6 for all tests. Sample sizes represent the number of biological replicates for each group. Statistical analysis was performed using IgorPro or GraphPad (PRISM software). Comparisons between two groups were performed with paired or unpaired Student’s <italic>t</italic>-tests when normality assumptions were met, and Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic>-tests in non-parametric cases. Multiple comparisons were evaluated using parametric one-way or two-way repeated measures ANOVA. Post-hoc Tukey or paired Student’s <italic>t</italic>-tests with the Bonferroni-Holm comparison were then used to determine significance for within group comparisons. Outliers were defined as data points greater than three standard deviations from the mean. To test for correlations between burstlet fraction and preBötC <italic>f</italic>, we determined a best-fit line and reported the coefficient of determination (r<sup>2</sup>), a measure of goodness of fit. We applied an <italic>F</italic>-test to evaluate the null hypothesis that the slope of the fitted line was not different from zero, that is there was no relationship between burstlet fraction and preBötC <italic>f</italic>. To determine whether the slope of the linear model changed across conditions, that is whether drug application changed the correlation, we performed an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) and applied a <italic>t</italic>-test for an ANCOVA with two groups or an <italic>F</italic>-test for an ANCOVA with more than two groups that tests for the equality of the slopes of the linear model across conditions (homogeneity of regression slopes). Statistical significance was set at p&lt;0.05.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors thank Grace Li for excellent technical work. <italic>Oprm1<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice were generously provided by Dr. Wendy Weibel, Dr. Chris Evans, and the Animal Breeding Core at UCLA (NIDA P50 Center Grant, DA005010).

problem in understanding how rhythm emerges from the neuronal circuit that controls the inspiratory cycle of breathing in mammals within the preBötC of the brainstem. Understanding how rhythm arises here has implications for other mammalian central pattern generating networks that also rely on interconnected glutamatergic interneurons. Recent work by this group has implicated a process within a glutamatergic subpopulation of Dbx1-derived (Dbx1<sup>+</sup>) interneurons of preBötC that are spontaneously spiking and organize into synchronous activation that is manifest as a burstlet. These burstlets can be sub-threshold in some way for premotor burst generation. In medullary slices from neonatal mice, they find that the μ-opioid receptor (μOR) agonist DAMGO slowed burstlet generation. Opioid-mediated depression was abolished by genetic deletion of μORs in a glutamatergic preBötC subpopulation and was reduced by the neuropeptide Substance P, but not blockade of inhibitory synaptic transmission. They conclude that opioids alter a rhythmogenic process giving rise to burstlets that does not rely on strong bursts of activity associated with motor output.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Opioids modulate an emergent rhythmogenic process to depress breathing&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen Ronald Calabrese as the Senior and Reviewing Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Shawn Hochman (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers were in general enthusiastic about the data but had some significant concerns about how the data is presented and interpreted. The individual reviewer comments should all be addressed. To help focus the revision, we offer a few consensus comments.</p><p>1) The results with SP seem to counter the main hypothesis, and the alternative explanation of a ceiling effect is not fully convincing.</p><p>2) The reviewers did not think that framing the work in terms of rhythm vs. pattern generation was useful and might be counterproductive to getting at the real interest in the work, which is how burst activity begins and how 'full' premotor network activation is achieved. Similarly the discussion of emergence as part of the rhythm generating mechanism was not wholly convincing and needs specific clarification.</p><p>3) Presentation of the data should be clarified and reviewer suggested new analyses added.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>1) The notion of rhythm vs. pattern has little heuristic value in the preBötC; there is no pattern here just the presence or absence of a full premotor burst. In the full respiratory CPG and in other mammalian CPGs like that for locomotion, rhythm vs. pattern makes sense; muddying the waters with this usage here may become quite counterproductive to getting at the mechanism that the authors are interested in. Are the authors suggesting that a different subpopulation of glutamatergic Dbx1-derived (Dbx1<sup>+</sup>) interneurons drives down stream motor neurons than those that participate in burstlet formation? If so, please be explicit.</p><p>2) The vagueness of the rhythmogenic process as presented in the Discussion leave this reader confused. What exactly do the authors imagine is happening in this network? Can you be more explicit in your hypothesis? What is emergent? What is the threshold you envision that converts a burstlet to a burst? The Discussion states &quot;We suggest that DAMGO-mediated hyperpolarization and/or decreases in synaptic probability of release in and among μOR-expressing preBötC Dbx1<sup>+</sup> neurons reduce spontaneous firing rate, weaken the propagation of action potentials to postsynaptic neurons, and increase the number of inputs required to reach action potential threshold. These effects reduce the moment-to-moment probability that a critical number of neurons will be simultaneously active and prolong the time required for preBötC neurons to increase their firing, achieve synchrony, and generate burstlets (Ashhad and Feldman, 2019; Feldman and Kam, 2015; Kam et al., 2013a). The pattern-generating mechanism that converts burstlets to bursts may, by analogy, require a higher threshold of activity and synchrony be reached via independently regulated, distinct mechanisms, such as the activation of persistent inward conductances (Picardo et al., 2019).&quot; There are many things here that are vague. Please be explicit about how action potentials are propagated through the system to what postsynaptic neurons and how action potential threshold affects this process. What generates the activity in the first place? Do you envision some spontaneously active bursters or tonic firers? How is the &quot;critical number of neurons&quot; related to the less than ten randomly selected preBötC Dbx1<sup>+</sup> neurons that can induce an extopic burst? Why is the mechanism that converts burstlets to bursts called a pattern generating mechanism? Is this some kind of threshold? Is the threshold determined by the number of preBötC Dbx1<sup>+</sup> neurons that are active, thus forming some kind of bigger burstlet? Must the neurons participating in a burstlet be μOR-expressing? The authors need not answer all these questions in rebuttal, but they should obviate a lot of the confusion that gives rise to them by being more explicit.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript Sun et al. use a set of complementary experimental strategies to test the hypothesis that inspiratory rhythmogenesis manifested as burstlets is an emergent process by examining how opioid modulation affects the frequency of these burstlets. The results reported here support this hypothesis; they show that the µ-opioid receptor agonist DAMGO decreases the burstlet frequency and the respiratory motor output. These effects persisted after blockade of inhibitory synaptic transmission, but were reduced by the neuropeptide substance P. The µ-opioid receptors were found in a glutamatergic subpopulation in the preBötzinger complex (preBötC) and restricted genetic deletion of these receptors in these neurons abolished the effects of DAMGO. This is a clear study reporting strong support for the hypothesis that burstlets represent an emergent process underlying rhythmogenesis in the preBötC. I have some points that could help the clarity of the presentation this manuscript.</p><p>1) It would be helpful to provide additional explanations about the rhythm and pattern generation. The burstlets and inspiratory bursts are interlinked and it is not clear why the inspiratory burst would only be generated by pattern- and not rhythm-related mechanisms. It is also not clear how the lack of a change in the burstlet fraction is consistent with the hypothesis that the rhythm and pattern generation mechanisms are separable.</p><p>2) It should be made clear in the Results section that photostimulation was used to uncage glutamate. Figure 2: Could you produce burstlets using photostimulation? And could you counteract the DAMGO-induced depression of the burst by increasing the number of the activated neurons?</p><p>3) The rescue of DAMGO-induced depression by SP in vitro is interesting, have the authors tried to rescue the opioid-induced depression of respiration in vivo? Such results would further enhance the impact of this study.</p><p>4) Figure 3: The panels and the text are too small to clearly distinguish the positive and negative neurons. The authors should provide quantification of the number of positive neurons and number of puncta. As it stands, it is very difficult to evaluate the difference between samples from animals with and without µ-opioid receptors.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The present manuscript tests the hypothesis that small subthreshold burstlet activity reflects an emergent rhythmogenic process that coalesce into bursts associated with respiratory inspiration.</p><p>The authors use an in vitro model and transgenic approaches to demonstrate that the μOR expressed in preBotC (Dbx1) glutamatergic neurons essential to inspiratory rhythmogenesis are responsible for μOR mediated (DAMGO) respiratory depression.</p><p>Observed threshold bursts relative to the total number of subthreshold burstlets were used to support the hypothesis that depressive effects were associated with corresponding reduced incidence of burstlets, and thereby identifying a subthreshold rhythm-generating neural-network mechanism of action.</p><p>The work makes an important contribution to understanding the role of μORs in the depressant actions on respiratory rhythmogenesis.</p><p>Overall, experimental design is strong and methods employed are impressive and elegant.

Also, there is indeed evidence that a subpopulation of Dbx1<sup>+</sup> neurons, which primarily fires during inspiration and does not show preinspiratory activity, constitutes part of an output layer (SST<sup>+</sup>). The novel aspect of our model, which may be unique to breathing, is that the first patterning layer includes these neurons as well as Dbx1<sup>+</sup> neurons that generate burstlets and bursts. So pattern formation begins as a distinct process from rhythmogenesis that manifests as bursting in a preBötC population that overlaps with rhythmogenic neurons. We consider bursting as the initial stage of pattern generation as it is the burst that is transmitted to and further shaped by downstream premotor and motoneurons. Furthermore, we consider bursts critical for determining the temporal pattern, i.e., whether the burstlet beat generates motor activity. We now describe this explicitly in the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The vagueness of the rhythmogenic process as presented in the Discussion leave this reader confused.

See response to consensus comment #2 above. Also, the effects of Cd<sup>2+,</sup> which selectively delete bursts, as well as the various manipulations that specifically alter either preBötC ƒ or burstlet fraction strongly suggest that the mechanisms generating rhythm and burstlets can be separated from burst generation. The primary link between the two is that these mechanisms both involve a population of preBötC neurons.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) It should be made clear in the Results section that photostimulation was used to uncage glutamate.

The question of whether we could produce burstlets with photostimulation is a very interesting one, and we are pursuing that question. We would predict that increasing the number of activating neurons might counteract DAMGO-induced depression; however, we do not know how many more might be required and a negative result would be difficult to interpret.
