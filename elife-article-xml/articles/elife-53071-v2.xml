efficiently regenerated, but this capacity is lost by one week after birth. We found that IGF2, an important mitogen in heart development, is required for neonatal heart regeneration. IGF2 originates from the endocardium/endothelium and is transduced in cardiomyocytes by the insulin receptor. Following injury on postnatal day 1, absence of IGF2 abolished injury-induced cell cycle entry during the early part of the first postnatal week. Consequently, regeneration failed despite the later presence of additional cell cycle-inducing activities 7 days following injury. Most cardiomyocytes transition from mononuclear diploid to polyploid during the first postnatal week. Regeneration was rescued in Igf2-deficient neonates in three different contexts that elevate the percentage of mononuclear diploid cardiomyocytes beyond postnatal day 7. Thus, IGF2 is a paracrine-acting mitogen for heart regeneration during the early postnatal period, and IGF2-deficiency unmasks the dependence of this process on proliferation-competent mononuclear diploid cardiomyocytes.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>neonatal heart</kwd><kwd>heart regeneration</kwd><kwd>mononuclear diploid cardiomyocyte</kwd><kwd>IGF2</kwd><kwd>insulin-like growth factor 2</kwd><kwd>insulin receptor</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HL070123</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sucov</surname><given-names>Henry</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000968</institution-id><institution>American Heart Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>17SDG33400141</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tao</surname><given-names>Ge</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>OIA-1655740</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tao</surname><given-names>Ge</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000968</institution-id><institution>American Heart Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gan</surname><given-names>Peiheng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Neonatal mouse heart regeneration relies on the presence of mononuclear diploid cardiomyocytes, which unites this process with embryonic heart growth and adult heart regeneration.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In heart development, an initial pool of cardiomyocytes is derived by differentiation from early mesodermal progenitors. Once this early process has completed, in every later context in the embryo and throughout postnatal life, essentially all new cardiomyocytes are generated by proliferation of preexisting cardiomyocytes rather than by differentiation from a non-cardiomyocyte progenitor source (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sereti et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Li et al., 2019</xref>). In mammals, the rate of embryonic cardiomyocyte proliferation is high as growth of the heart keeps pace with overall embryo growth, but then tapers down by the end of gestation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Soonpaa et al., 1996</xref>). In normal heart biology, cardiomyocyte proliferation is minimal for the remainder of life; the heart grows considerably in size postnatally, but this is by the hypertrophic enlargement of existing cardiomyocytes rather than by generation of new cardiomyocytes. Nonetheless, in the context of an insufficient number of cardiomyocytes, the mammalian heart at late fetal and very early neonatal stages retains the ability to activate robust cardiomyocyte proliferation and to restore normal cardiomyocyte number. Although there have been some negative observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andersen et al., 2016</xref>), reactivation of cardiomyocyte proliferation to achieve efficient restoration of heart morphology has been observed in mouse genetic models that cause a non-lethal late-embryonic deficiency of cardiomyocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Drenckhahn et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Vincentz et al., 2017</xref>), and in surgical or congenital injury models that cause a neonatal loss of ventricular myocardium in rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Robledo, 1956</xref>), mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sadek et al., 2014</xref>), and swine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mahmoud and Porrello, 2018</xref>), and likely also occurs in human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Haubner et al., 2016</xref>). In mice, the plasticity to reactivate efficient cardiomyocyte proliferation is mostly lost by postnatal day P7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Porrello et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alkass et al., 2015</xref>), which is understood to mean that most ventricular cardiomyocytes have become postmitotic by this time. Consequently, heart injury in P7 pups or at any later time through adulthood is followed by insufficient cardiomyocyte proliferation and insufficient replacement of lost myocardium, i.e., by a failure to fully regenerate. In animals and humans, failure of regeneration after ventricular injury leads to a permanent diminishment of contractile function with possible further progression to heart failure.</p><p>A number of differences distinguish ventricular cardiomyocytes at the beginning and end of the first postnatal week, but one that may determine (rather than correlate with) proliferative ability is their total DNA content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gan et al., 2020</xref>). In mice and perhaps most mammals, essentially all fetal and early neonatal cardiomyocytes have one diploid nucleus (as is the case for most cells). During the first postnatal week (in mice), cardiomyocytes undergo a last round of DNA replication followed by cell cycle arrest either before or after karyokinesis but without cytokinesis, resulting in mononuclear polyploid or multinuclear cardiomyocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Soonpaa et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alkass et al., 2015</xref>). Typically, only a few percent of ventricular cardiomyocytes thereafter and through the remainder of life are mononuclear diploid, which correlates with the very low level of cellular and functional regeneration usually seen after adult heart injury. Adult zebrafish retain a very high percentage of mononuclear diploid cardiomyocytes throughout adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Patterson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">González-Rosa et al., 2018</xref>), and heart regeneration is robust in this species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Foglia and Poss, 2016</xref>). Thus, from a comparison of multiple species and life stages, there is a precise correlation between the abundance of mononuclear diploid cardiomyocytes and competence to support cardiomyocyte proliferation for embryonic heart growth or post-injury heart regeneration. Recent experimental results in both mouse and zebrafish explicitly demonstrated that polyploid cardiomyocytes are compromised in proliferation and regeneration, and thereby confirmed the relationship between mononuclear diploid cardiomyocytes and adult heart regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Patterson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">González-Rosa et al., 2018</xref>). Of particular relevance to this paper, we showed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Patterson et al., 2017</xref>) that some inbred mouse strains have a much higher percentage of adult ventricular mononuclear diploid cardiomyocytes (e.g., 10% in strain A/J, compared to 2% in C57BL/6J), and that such strains have a correspondingly higher degree of both cellular and functional regeneration after adult heart injury.</p><p>Organ regeneration following injury or tissue loss is generally thought to recapitulate at least some features of embryonic growth, including the redeployment of signaling pathways that had been active earlier in fetal development. The early embryonic heart consists of cardiomyocytes surrounding an inner layer of endocardium (the endothelial lining of the heart). Around embryonic day E10 in mouse, the epicardium, the noncontractile mesothelium of the heart, migrates from a nearby source onto the outer heart surface. In our past work, we showed that the epicardium is the source of secreted mitogenic factors that promote cardiomyocyte proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2002</xref>), and then identified IGF2 (insulin-like growth factor 2) as the major epicardial mitogen responsible for this activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Li et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Shen et al., 2015</xref>). <italic>Igf2</italic> is expressed in the embryonic epicardium and endocardium (but not myocardium). Mouse embryos deficient in <italic>Igf2</italic> expression in all heart mesoderm or specifically in the epicardium lineage were substantially compromised in cardiomyocyte proliferation during the E10-E13 period, which was morphologically manifest in a hypoplastic ventricle. Notably for the present study, conditional <italic>Igf2</italic> mutation in the endocardium and endothelium had no phenotypic consequence in the embryonic heart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Shen et al., 2015</xref>). Embryos lacking the two signaling-competent IGF2 receptors INSR (insulin receptor) and IGF1R (insulin-like growth factor one receptor) in heart mesoderm or specifically in cardiomyocytes were also compromised in cardiomyocyte proliferation and ventricular morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Li et al., 2011</xref>), which is predominantly a reflection of the importance of IGF1R rather than INSR in the embryonic heart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wang et al., 2019</xref>). Although the midgestation hypoplastic ventricular phenotypes of conditional <italic>Igf2</italic> or IGF receptor mutants were obvious, these were not so severe as to cause embryo lethality. Cardiomyocyte proliferation in mutants then recovered to normal levels at E14 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Li et al., 2011</xref>), likely in response to other factors distributed by coronary circulation that begins at that time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cavallero et al., 2015</xref>). Mutant pups were born in normal numbers and of normal size and health, and conditional <italic>Igf2</italic> mutants are viable and appear normal throughout a normal lifespan. Because conditional <italic>Igf1r/Insr</italic> mutants are also normal at birth, the other factors that restore cardiomyocyte proliferation in late gestation in <italic>Igf2</italic> mutants seemingly do not signal through IGF1R or INSR and thus are not likely to be IGF1 or insulin.</p><p>In this study, we address the reutilization of IGF signaling in neonatal heart regeneration. We find that IGF2 is a required factor for neonatal heart regeneration, although with mechanistic features that are distinct compared to its role in embryonic heart development. After neonatal heart injury, IGF2 is uniquely active during the early part of the first postnatal week when most cardiomyocytes are mononuclear and diploid. A later activity initiates cell cycle entry but is not able to support regeneration, at least under typical circumstances. Most significantly, several independent manipulations that elevate the percentage of mononuclear diploid cardiomyocytes allow rescue of regeneration in <italic>Igf2</italic>-deficient neonates.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Endocardial IGF2 is required for neonatal mouse heart regeneration</title><p>In the embryonic heart, <italic>Igf2</italic> mRNA is expressed in the epicardium and endocardium, although not in the myocardium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Li et al., 2011</xref>).

As noted above, <italic>Nkx2.5-Cre/Igf2</italic> mutants have a hypoplastic ventricle phenotype and reduced cardiomyocyte proliferation during embryonic days E10-13, although recover their level of cardiomyocyte proliferation at E14 and survive embryogenesis and have a normal adult lifespan. Other models with an early non-lethal cardiomyocyte deficiency have also demonstrated extension of cardiomyocyte proliferation in late gestation to fully reconstitute the cardiomyocyte population by birth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Drenckhahn et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Vincentz et al., 2017</xref>). We confirmed that <italic>Nkx2.5-Cre/Igf2</italic> mutants had normal heart morphology, heart size, and cardiomyocyte size both at birth and at P21 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–F</xref>). Because cardiomyocyte polyploidy is a prominent feature of postnatal heart biology and one that has a significant impact on proliferative and regenerative competence, we measured the percentage of ventricular mononuclear cardiomyocytes and the nuclear ploidy of the mononuclear cardiomyocyte subpopulation in C57BL/6J x A/J F1 strain background-matched control (<italic>Nkx2.5-Cre</italic> only) and <italic>Nkx2.5-Cre/Igf2</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G,H</xref>). We conducted this analysis at P3, which is just prior to the onset of the peak of DNA synthesis that results in polyploidy, and at P7, which is near (but not at) the end of the wave of polyploidization. At P3, control and <italic>Igf2</italic> mutant hearts were comparable in both mononuclear cardiomyocyte percentage and mononuclear cardiomyocyte nuclear ploidy, with calculated mononuclear diploid cardiomyocyte levels of 80.1 ± 6.4% (<italic>Cre</italic> only) and 85.1 ± 3.5% (<italic>Nkx2.5-Cre/Igf2</italic>). By P7, this had dropped dramatically in the hearts of both genotypes (to 14.7 ± 1.8% and 11.9 ± 1.1%, respectively). We measured a slight difference at P7 in the mononuclear cardiomyocyte percentage that reached statistical significance, although we suspect this to be more likely explained by incidental factors (e.g., the number of pups per litter and the exact ages of each litter; pups from several litters were combined for this analysis). Images of P3 and P7 cardiomyocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>) revealed the hypertrophic enlargement of cardiomyocytes at P7 in both genotypes, which continued to later times (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,F</xref>).

As in other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mahmoud et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wodsedalek et al., 2019</xref>), we distinguished regeneration failure by the presence of transmural scar at the resection point, a partial phenotype by the presence of interspersed scar with abundant myocardium also present, and full regeneration by the absence of scar (examples shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Because of experimental variability between animals in the amount of apex tissue resected, some variability in outcome is expected, as has been previously documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bryant et al., 2015</xref>). Control mice, all carrying either <italic>Nkx2.5-Cre</italic> or another <italic>Cre</italic> line described below but all wild-type for <italic>Igf2</italic>, predominantly had no scar or in a small number of cases had interspersed scar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).

The presence of scar per se demonstrates only that there is excess and abnormal deposition of matrix. The absence of restoration of the ventricular myocardium, coupled with observations described below of a cardiomyocyte-specific proliferative response, indicate that this phenotype is the manifestation of regeneration failure.

By immunofluorescence using antibodies specific for phospho-INSR and for phospho-IGF1R, at 3 and 7 days following sham surgery, there was no basal level of phosphorylation of either receptor, indicating that the activity of the IGF/insulin signaling axis in the normal uninjured neonatal heart is below detection using this method (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B,C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplements 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">2</xref>). IGF2 protein is present in the heart during this period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>), but seemingly in a manner that does not activate a substantial level of signaling (see below and Discussion). Resection caused prominent INSR phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplements 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">2</xref>), in a pattern that was somewhat heterogeneous even among nearby cardiomyocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>); the explanation for this heterogeneity is unknown. INSR phosphorylation was prominent in cardiomyocytes adjacent to the resection plane as well as distal to the injury (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplements 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">2</xref>), which is consistent with the observation that cardiomyocyte proliferation is activated throughout the myocardium after neonatal injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Porrello et al., 2011</xref>). Importantly, INSR phosphorylation was eliminated in <italic>Nkx2.5-Cre/Igf2</italic> conditional ligand mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>), confirming that IGF2 is the ligand that activates INSR during neonatal heart regeneration. Because IGF2 expression at the RNA and protein level is not changed by injury (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>), we assume that injury releases the block that prevents signaling in the uninjured heart. We observed no IGF1R phosphorylation in injured (or uninjured) neonatal hearts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>), which correlates with the absence of genetic requirement for this receptor in regeneration (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Absence of IGF1R phosphorylation in injured conditional <italic>Igf2</italic> mutants also demonstrates that IGF1 (which signals only through the IGF1R) does not compensate for loss of IGF2. As a positive control for reagent quality and specificity, we detected IGF1R phosphorylation but no activation of the INSR in embryonic heart (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3A</xref>), consistent with our previous observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wang et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>To confirm these results, we performed Western blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>) using ventricular lysates from 3dpr hearts from either control (<italic>Nkx2.5-Cre</italic> only) or from mutants in which the <italic>Insr</italic> gene was conditionally deleted by <italic>Nkx2.5-Cre</italic>. In this case, a phospho-specific antibody that equally recognizes the phosphorylated forms of INSR and IGF1R was used; the comparison of controls to conditional <italic>Insr</italic> mutants allowed us to infer the extent to which INSR vs. IGF1R are phosphorylated basally and in response to injury. We detected a very faint signal of phosphorylated receptor in uninjured control heart tissue that was absent from conditional <italic>Insr</italic> mutants; this indicates a low basal level of INSR phosphorylation even though this was not detected by immunofluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Injury at P1 resulted in a prominent increase in phosphorylated receptor in 3dpr controls that was absent in <italic>Nkx2.5-Cre/Insr</italic> mutants. This analysis confirms that P1 heart injury selectively induces INSR phosphorylation but not IGF1R activation (even though IGF1R protein is present).</p><p>The insulin receptor gene is transcribed into two isoforms that differ only by the inclusion or exclusion of a 36 bp alternatively spliced exon 11, resulting in proteins that differ by 12 amino acids in an extracellular domain of the receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Frasca et al., 1999</xref>). The shorter form, called INSR-A, mediates signals by both insulin and IGF2, whereas the longer form, called INSR-B, responds to only insulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Frasca et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Scalia et al., 2001</xref>). Throughout the neonatal period, the ratio of the A and B isoforms was roughly equal, and was not obviously altered after resection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3B,C</xref>). Although analyzed here only at the RNA level, it is unlikely that the two transcripts are differentially translated (because they differ only in one internal exon), and the two proteins have a similar stability when expressed in transfected cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Pandini et al., 2002</xref>). Thus, the insulin receptor A isoform that mediates IGF2 signals is present during the time when IGF2-INSR signaling is required for neonatal heart regeneration, and as demonstrated above is activated by IGF2 after neonatal heart injury.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title><italic>Igf2</italic> deficiency distinguishes cardiomyocyte cell cycle entry and cardiomyocyte proliferation</title><p>Neonatal heart apex resection induces cardiomyocyte proliferation as a key element of the regenerative response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Porrello et al., 2011</xref>).

Importantly, though, the percentage of pH3+ cardiomyocytes at 7dpr was also elevated in conditional <italic>Igf2</italic> mutants compared to sham-operated animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). This indicates the presence of an IGF2-independent activity that induces cardiomyocyte cell cycle entry at 7dpr, whereas IGF2 is required for all of the injury-induced pH3+ labeling at 3dpr. Approx. 60% of the injury-induced pH3+ labeling at 7dpr is IGF2-independent (red bar in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C’</xref>), and 40% attributable to IGF2 (green bar in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C’</xref>). It should be noted that the IGF2-independent activity at 7dpr is not necessarily in response to alternative mitogenic factors, as cardiomyocyte-intrinsic responses (recognition of strain or pressure, etc.) might also initiate cell cycle entry at this time.</p><p>Phospho-histone H3 is a marker of cells in early mitosis, and does not necessarily indicate that cytokinesis will ensue. It is well established that injury in the adult heart induces cell cycle entry, including S-phase DNA replication and induction of pH3+ staining, but followed mostly by a failure to complete cytokinesis, resulting in cardiomyocytes with increased ploidy rather than an increased number of cardiomyocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zebrowski et al., 2016</xref>). For the same reason, injury at P7 in wild-type pups is not followed by enough proliferation to support myocardial restoration, as observed in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Porrello et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Puente et al., 2014</xref>). Our data support an interpretation that neonatal heart regeneration requires cardiomyocyte proliferation, that proliferation occurs during the first few days after P1 resection when a high percentage of cardiomyocytes are still able to divide, and that IGF2 acting as a typical mitogen is required during these first few days to induce cell cycle entry that then culminates in proliferation. In contrast, even though there is abundant cell cycle activity (e.g., pH3+ staining) at later times (e.g., at 7dpr), this is not followed by enough cytokinesis (proliferation) to support myocardial restoration. Presumably, the main outcome of cell cycle activity at P7 is to increase the ploidy level of preexisting cardiomyocytes, rather than to increase the number of cardiomyocytes by proliferation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Delayed cardiomyocyte cell cycle arrest and increased mononuclear diploid cardiomyocyte percentage rescue neonatal heart regeneration in <italic>Igf2</italic> mutants</title><p>Several experimental manipulations that lower the level of reactive oxygen were previously shown to prolong the postnatal window during which cardiomyocytes remain proliferative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Puente et al., 2014</xref>).

This transition occurs concurrent with the loss of efficient regenerative ability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Soonpaa et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alkass et al., 2015</xref>).

We recently reported that ubiquitous expression of the <italic>mCAT</italic> transgene elevates the percentage of mononuclear cardiomyocytes and of mononuclear diploid cardiomyocytes in the adult mouse heart, with no effect on nuclear ploidy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gan et al., 2019</xref>). Measurements in the uninjured adult heart reflect the interruption or completion of mitosis during the first postnatal week, as there is so little cell cycle activity thereafter. We confirmed that <italic>mCAT</italic> expression resulted in a 2-fold increase in mononuclear cardiomyocyte level at P7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>) as also seen in the adult.</p><p>In our recent analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Patterson et al., 2017</xref>), we demonstrated that strain A/J mice have a particularly high level of mononuclear diploid cardiomyocytes in the adult heart. To relate this to neonatal heart regeneration, we first conducted a time course comparison of the polyploidization process in A/J and C57BL/6J neonates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Both strains reached their final adult level shortly after P7, with that of A/J mice being 3-fold higher than that of C57BL/6J mice. This is consistent with an understanding that the process of inducing polyploidy is primarily manifest during the first postnatal week, with genetic differences between strains responsible for determining the percentage of cardiomyocytes that become polyploid or remain mononuclear and diploid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Patterson et al., 2017</xref>). IGF2 is not relevant to this process, as absence of <italic>Igf2</italic> did not change the percentage of mononuclear diploid cardiomyocytes at P3 and at most only minimally at P7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p>We utilized the A/J strain background to further test the influence of mononuclear diploid cardiomyocyte frequency on neonatal heart regeneration. For this purpose, the <italic>Nkx2.5-Cre</italic> and conditional <italic>Igf2</italic> alleles (which are unlinked) were backcrossed for seven generations to the A/J background, which on theoretical grounds results in mice that are 98% homozygous for A/J alleles across the genome other than near the <italic>Nkx2.5-Cre</italic> and <italic>Igf2</italic> loci. Male mice heterozygous for the <italic>Nkx2.5-Cre</italic> and conditional <italic>Igf2</italic> alleles on the A/J background were crossed to wild-type female A/J mice, with heart resection performed on neonatal pups at P1 as above.

Importantly, all of 3 <italic>Nkx2.5-Cre/Igf2</italic> pups had also regenerated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C,D</xref>). Thus, even without environmental or transgenic manipulation, when the number of mononuclear diploid cardiomyocytes at P7 is elevated (e.g., here by strain background), the mitogenic (cell cycle entry) activity present around that time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>) is able to drive a sufficient degree of cardiomyocyte response to accomplish heart regeneration even in P1-injured <italic>Igf2</italic> mutants.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Myocardial infarction in the adult heart induces <italic>Igf2</italic> reexpression</title><p>Unlike the early neonatal heart, in which regenerative capacity is robust, injury to the adult mammalian heart is not followed by substantial cardiomyocyte proliferation and therefore is not effectively regenerated.

This outcome is understood to reflect an extremely limited regenerative capacity of the adult heart. In normal biology, hearts are proliferative during embryonic life and can reactivate proliferation following injury during the initial days following birth, but mostly lose regenerative capacity early in the neonatal period. This study adds several new conceptual elements to understanding the regenerative capacity of the heart.</p><p>First, our studies support the view that under normal circumstances, the window of heart regenerative competence in mice is limited to only the first few days of the first postnatal week. A similar temporal conclusion was reached by others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ikenishi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Notari et al., 2018</xref>), and is a further refinement of the observation that heart injury at P7 is not followed by effective regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Porrello et al., 2011</xref>). In our study, despite robust cell cycle activity at P7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), <italic>Igf2</italic> mutants failed in heart regeneration after P1 injury. <italic>Igf2</italic> deficiency therefore unmasks early and late first week cell cycle entry activity and distinguishes the necessity of the former for functional tissue regeneration.</p><p>Second, IGF2 appears to be the prime if not sole mitogenic factor that directly induces neonatal cardiomyocyte proliferation during the first few days after P1 injury. In <italic>Igf2</italic> mutants there was no indication of any further activity that even partially contributes to an increase in cell cycle entry after P1 injury (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B’</xref>). For this reason, effective regeneration does not occur in <italic>Igf2</italic> mutants despite robust cell cycle activity at 7dpr. Other secreted factors previously studied in the context of neonatal heart regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kawagishi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Singh et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Das et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wodsedalek et al., 2019</xref>) may indirectly influence cardiomyocyte proliferation through alternative cell types or mechanisms, although we cannot formally exclude the possibility that IGF2 and another secreted mitogen are required together to induce proliferation.</p><p>Third, it is notable that neonatal heart regeneration relies on paracrine signaling at all. In principle, changes in cardiac output or wall strain after injury might be detected directly by cardiomyocytes, either at myocyte-myocyte junctions or at the cell surface via interaction with extracellular matrix. Such processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bassat et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Notari et al., 2018</xref>) and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mahmoud et al., 2015</xref>) are clearly relevant but do not substitute for the requirement for IGF2-INSR paracrine signaling. Our conditional manipulation of <italic>Igf2</italic> in cardiac endothelium and cardiomyocyte-specific manipulation of <italic>Insr</italic> establish IGF2 signaling through INSR as the major paracrine pathway that underlies this process.</p><p>Fourth, certain circumstances can override the requirement for IGF2 signaling in neonatal regeneration. In this study, we found that mild hypoxia, <italic>mCAT</italic> expression, and an inbred A/J strain background were each individually sufficient to support efficient regeneration in the absence of IGF2. We interpret these outcomes (see model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>) to reflect a higher frequency of completed cell cycle events (i.e., proliferation) among the cardiomyocytes that are induced by P1 injury to enter cell cycle during the later part of the first week, when factors other than IGF2 are present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). We note a limitation of our analysis is that we have not directly measured proliferation, which for cardiomyocytes is recognized as very difficult to distinguish from polyploidization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Soonpaa et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zebrowski et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Leone et al., 2018</xref>). Because cardiomyocyte proliferation is necessary for heart regeneration, we infer that rescue of regeneration in <italic>Igf2</italic> mutants must have involved proliferation. Our observations also serve as a caution in interpretation of results when strain background or environment are not properly controlled.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>A model to explain neonatal heart regeneration.</title><p>At left is a schematic illustration of the percentage of mononuclear diploid cardiomyocytes (MNDCMs) in the ventricle from the high level at birth to the low level by P7 and later (e.g., as in C57BL/6 mice or in the mixed genetic backgrounds of mice used in most parts of this study; A, adult). IGF2 does not influence how many MNDCMs are present but rather acts on these to promote their proliferation. Consequently, early heart injury is regenerated because the MNDCM percentage is high and can sustain a high level of proliferation in response to IGF2. At right is a representation of the most common type of cell cycle outcome under different circumstances. In the normal postnatal heart in the absence of injury, cell cycle entry leads to polyploidy rather than completed mitosis. In typical hearts (environmentally and genetically normal), P1 injury induces IGF2 expression which induces proliferation at P3 by the high number of MNDCMs, whereas at P7 there are too few MNDCMs present to mount an effective regenerative response even in the presence of other growth factors (GFs) that induce cell cycle activity. With conditions that sustain a higher MNDCM level through and beyond P7, proliferation and regeneration ensue in response to other factors even without prior IGF2 signaling.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-53071-fig8-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Finally, our results implicate the necessity of proliferation-competent mononuclear diploid cardiomyocytes in order to support neonatal heart regeneration. At P1, most cardiomyocytes are mononuclear diploid, and proliferation and regeneration are robust following injury. By P7, under typical circumstances (such as the strain backgrounds and environmental conditions used in most studies), most cardiomyocytes have become polyploid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>), and despite the robust cell cycle entry activity that occurs at this time following P1 injury (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C’</xref>), most cardiomyocytes are not able to complete the cell cycle with cytokinesis. By increasing mononuclear diploid cardiomyocyte percentage through P7, regeneration after P1 injury in <italic>Igf2</italic> mutants was rescued, presumably via the non-IGF2 activity that is evident at 7dpr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). The presence of this later activity, which is still not defined, was only possible to detect when the earlier and continuing influence of IGF2 was removed genetically. This interpretation for neonatal heart regeneration is consistent with the importance of cardiomyocyte ploidy in adult heart regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Patterson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">González-Rosa et al., 2018</xref>). We note the possibility of two variant interpretations of our results. First, mild hypoxia, <italic>mCAT</italic> expression, and the A/J strain background might influence cardiomyocyte proliferation after neonatal heart injury through other mechanisms, with the increase in mononuclear diploid cardiomyocytes associated with these manipulations being a tangential effect not directly related to regeneration. Second, in addition to serving as a mitogenic signal, IGF2-INSR signaling might also modify the components of cardiomyocyte mitosis to promote proliferation rather than polyploidization. If so, then mild hypoxia, <italic>mCAT</italic> expression, and the A/J strain background must all do the same.</p><p>A premise of our interpretations is that the conditional mutant mice used in this study are normal prior to neonatal injury; if this were not true, then their failure to regenerate after injury could reflect a preexisting deficiency rather than an injury-induced requirement for IGF2-INSR signaling. The fact that <italic>Nkx2.5-Cre/Igf2</italic> mutants have a transient embryonic hypoplastic heart phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Li et al., 2011</xref>) perhaps supports this scenario. We counter this possibility with several observations. First, the embryonic role for <italic>Igf2</italic> is a manifestation of expression in the epicardium, yet epicardium-specific <italic>Tbx18-Cre/Igf2</italic> mutants with the exact same embryonic heart phenotype as <italic>Nkx2.5-Cre/Igf2</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Shen et al., 2015</xref>) were able to regenerate after P1 injury while <italic>Nkx2.5-Cre/Igf2</italic> mutants were not. Second, both <italic>Tek-Cre/Igf2</italic> and <italic>Nfatc1-Cre/Igf2</italic> mutants have no embryonic heart phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Shen et al., 2015</xref>) and yet were unable to regenerate after P1 injury. Third, the INSR has no observable role in heart development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wang et al., 2019</xref>) and yet is required for neonatal heart regeneration. These results clearly segregate the consequences of IGF2 signaling in embryonic heart development from its independent role in postnatal heart regeneration. We do note that there is a low level of INSR phosphorylation in uninjured neonatal heart (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), which may have some role or consequence. We evaluated several aspects of postnatal heart biology in uninjured <italic>Nkx2.5-Cre/Igf2</italic> mutants and all were found to be normal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), with the possible exception of a small difference in the percentage of mononuclear cardiomyocytes at P7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). As commented above, we suspect this to be more likely related to the exact circumstances of the pups that were used for this analysis (their exact ages and number of pups per litter; both parameters have a prominent impact on polyploidy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brodsky et al., 1985</xref>]), rather than an indication of a biologically meaningful difference at P7, although we have not formally disproven the latter. Clearly though, the observation that IGF2 signaling through the INSR is typically required for heart regeneration, and that this requirement can be circumvented by several different manipulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) that are unlikely to be relevant to embryonic heart development, supports the interpretation of a unique program of IGF2 signaling that is activated by early postnatal heart injury to promote heart regeneration.</p><p>IGF2 is involved in midgestation mouse heart development, so perhaps it is not surprising that it is also involved in neonatal heart regeneration. Nonetheless, with closer examination, there are several features related to its role in neonatal heart regeneration that indicate this to be a unique process and not simply a reiteration of developmental events. First, the lineage sources of IGF2 in heart development and neonatal regeneration are distinct: as shown by genetic manipulation, IGF2 originates from the epicardium (or epicardium-derived mesenchymal cells) in embryonic heart growth, whereas in neonatal heart regeneration, IGF2 derives from the cardiac endothelium (which could include endocardium, coronary endothelium, hematopoietic cells derived from hemogenic endocardium, or endocardium-derived mesenchymal cells). <italic>Igf2</italic> is expressed in both epicardium and endocardium in the embryo and neonate, so the completely opposite lineage source of IGF2 in each context implies unique posttranscriptional modes of signaling regulation. Second, the receptors that mediate IGF2 signaling also differ in the embryo and injured neonate: embryonic development requires IGF1R, whereas neonatal regeneration exclusively uses INSR. The mechanisms that account for this distinction in receptor activity are unknown. Clearly though, when looking at IGF signaling in the embryonic and neonatal heart, the oft-stated paradigm that regeneration is a recapitulation of development is superficially true, but each also has unique features that indicate a deeper complexity and subtlety.</p><p><italic>Igf2</italic> has been studied in the context of zebrafish heart development and adult heart regeneration, via the use of heat shock-regulated ubiquitous expression of an igf1r dominant negative construct and by treatment with an igf1r-specific antagonist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Choi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Huang et al., 2013</xref>). These studies do not provide insight on the lineage sources of IGF2 in the fish heart, but do implicate igf1r as the major receptor in both contexts. At the moment, it is not possible to reconcile the exclusive use of INSR in neonatal mouse heart regeneration with the apparent use of igf1r in zebrafish adult heart regeneration, and it is possible that regeneration in zebrafish has different genetic controls compared to the mouse. Nonetheless, the conservation of reliance on IGF signaling in heart development and regeneration in both species is striking.</p><p>It is intriguing that the IGF2-INSR signaling axis is inactive in the uninjured neonatal heart and only becomes active following injury. <italic>Igf2</italic> expression at the RNA and protein levels, and <italic>Insr</italic> expression at the RNA level, are all unchanged by injury, suggesting a posttranslational block to signaling in the normal heart and an alleviation of this block following injury. It is currently unknown what accounts for this block; possible mechanisms could include storage of IGF2 protein in vesicles prior to exocytosis from their source, sequestration after exocytosis by IGF binding proteins or by other components of the extracellular matrix, or some inhibitory feature in uninjured cardiomyocytes that prevents INSR from responding to IGF2. It is interesting that INSR activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">2</xref>), cardiomyocyte cell cycle activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) and cardiomyocyte proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Porrello et al., 2011</xref>) are all induced across the entire ventricle following apex resection; this suggests that the alleviation of IGF2 signaling after injury involves a broadly distributed mechanism rather than one localized to the site of injury. How this occurs is unknown, although because this involves IGF2-INSR, there are now molecular targets through which this process can be explored.</p><p>A major reason for interest in the very efficient process of neonatal heart regeneration is its contrast with the very limited regeneration seen in the adult heart after injury. Mouse cardiomyocytes transition from being mostly proliferative to mostly nonproliferative during the first postnatal week, although a small subset of cardiomyocytes remain mononuclear diploid and proliferative. Our analysis indicates that regeneration in the neonate requires both a mitogenic stimulus and an adequate population of proliferation-competent cardiomyocytes. It is notable that although <italic>Igf2</italic> is not basally expressed in the adult mouse heart, it is reexpressed following injury, albeit in an inactive manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), and possibly inactive through the same mechanisms that prevent IGF2 signaling in the neonate prior to injury.

For most experiments, alleles were maintained on a mixed and unspecified strain background. For convenience, mutant backgrounds are designated simply by the name of the <italic>Cre</italic> line and the conditional gene separated by a diagonal slash. Because the <italic>Igf2</italic> gene is imprinted, conditional <italic>Igf2</italic> mutants were always heterozygous with the conditional <italic>Igf2</italic> allele paternally inherited; all other mutant backgrounds were homozygous. Male mice heterozygous for both <italic>Nkx2.5-Cre</italic> and conditional <italic>Igf2</italic> alleles were mated for seven generations to A/J females (purchased from The Jackson Laboratory, stock number 000646) for studies involving the A/J strain background. <italic>Myh6-Cre</italic> and the <italic>mCAT</italic> transgenic line were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory (stock numbers 011038 and 016197, respectively) and were maintained on a C57BL/6J background unless crossed with alleles carried by mice on outbred backgrounds. Cardiomyocyte ploidy in A/J, C57BL/6J, and C57BL/6J-congenic <italic>mCAT</italic> transgenic mice was evaluated in neonatal mice maintained on these inbred backgrounds. Cardiomyocyte nucleation and nuclear ploidy status in P7 <italic>Nkx2.5-Cre</italic> vs <italic>Nkx2.5-Cre/Igf2</italic> neonates was performed on F1 mice derived by mating A/J-inbred <italic>Nkx2.5-Cre/Igf2</italic> males to wild-type C57BL/6J females.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Heart injury</title><p>The day when newborn pups were observed was defined as P0. The following day, P1 neonatal mice were anesthesized on a bed of ice for 3.5–5 min. After blunt dissection at the left fourth intercostal space, the heart was exposed by gentle squeezing on the body wall. The heart apex was then amputated using iridectomy scissors; sham-operated mice had their hearts exposed without amputation. After surgery, the heart was returned to the body cavity by gentle elevation of the body wall, which was then sutured with 7–0 prolene suture and the skin wound closed with tissue adhesive. Neonates were resuscitated on a warming water bed. In most studies, all neonates of a litter were resected, and genotypes were determined retrospectively at the time of analysis as there is no visible distinction for any of the genotypes studied in this project. In studies comparing sham vs. resected hearts, an equal number of pups within a litter were randomly chosen for either procedure, sham-operated pups were marked by snipping a small piece of tail, and genotypes were determined retrospectively at the time of analysis. For hypoxia treatment, pregnant females were put into a 15% oxygen chamber (BioSpherix) one day before delivery. P1 apical resection was performed in room air (normal oxygen), and pups were returned to the hypoxic chamber after recovery. Adult mice were injured by permanent left anterior descending coronary artery ligation exactly following procedures described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Patterson et al., 2017</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>In situ hybridization</title><p>Digoxygenin-labelled probes were made as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Shen et al., 2015</xref>). Heart samples were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS at 4°C overnight. After cryoprotection in 10% and 30% sucrose, hearts were embedded and frozen in OCT, and then cryosectioned frontally at 8µ thickness. Sections were fixed in 4%PFA in PBS, washed with PBS, and treated with proteinase K and then triethanolamine in acetic anhydride. Hybridization was performed at 65°C for at least 16 hr. Unhybridized probe was removed by RNaseA digestion. Signal was detected by POD-coupled anti-DIG primary antibody (Roche) and TSAplus Fluorescent Substrate Kit (PerkinElmer).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Histological studies</title><p>Heart samples were dehydrated through increasing ethanol concentrations and then embedded in paraffin. 10µ sections were used for histological studies. To visualize collagen, Picro Sirius red staining (Sigma-Aldrich 365548) or Masson trichrome stain kit (Richard-Allen Scientific) were used. Evaluation of scar at the P21 time of evaluation as transmural, interspersed, or no scar was made from serial sections of each heart; the section with the most extensive degree of Picro Sirius red staining at the injury site was used to define the degree of regeneration. Quantitation of scar was determined by summing the area of scar using ImageJ over complete serial sections through the injury area. Investigators were blinded to genotype at the time of surgery but not at the time of evaluation of extent of scar.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Immunofluorescence</title><p>Heart samples were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS at 4°C overnight. After cryoprotection in 10% and 30% sucrose, hearts were embedded and frozen in OCT. 8µ sections were used for IF. Slides were briefly fixed with 4% PFA, then washed and permeabilized with PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 at room temperature for three times, 5 min each. After blocking with 10% normal donkey serum and 1% BSA at room temperature for 1 hr, 0.03% Sudan black for 30 min at room temperature was used to block cardiomyocyte autofluorescence. Thereafter, sections were incubated in rabbit anti-phospho-IGF1R (Santa Cruz SC101703; 1:50) and goat anti-Troponin C (Abcam ab30807; 1:500), or goat anti-phospho-Insulin receptor (Santa Cruz SC25103; 1:50) and rabbit anti-MYL2 (Abcam ab79935; 1:200) in PBS containing 1% BSA and 10% donkey serum at 4°C overnight. The secondary antibodies (all used at 1:500) donkey anti-rabbit (Invitrogen Alexa Fluor 546) and donkey anti-goat (Invitrogen Alexa Fluor 488), or donkey anti-goat (Invitrogen Alexa Fluor 546) and donkey anti-rabbit (Invitrogen Alexa Fluor 488) were used to detect pIGF1R and Troponin C, or pINSR and MYL2 with 1 hr incubation at room temperature. For detecting proliferation, primary antibodies used were anti-pH3 (Upstate 06–570; 1:500) and anti-NKX2.5 (Santa Cruz, SC8697; 1:200). Secondary antibodies (1:500) were donkey anti-goat (Invitrogen Alexa Fluor 647) and donkey anti-rabbit (Invitrogen Alexa Fluor 546). Slides were mounted with mounting media containing DAPI. Fluorescent and confocal (1µ optical sections) images were captured at the same settings and at the same time for all sections of an experimental group.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Polymerase chain reaction</title><p>RNA was extracted from heart ventricle using Quick-RNA Mini Prep Kit (Zymo Research).

Membranes were blocked in PBS-Tween with 5% nonfat dry milk. Antibody against IGF2 was from R&amp;D (AF792) used at 1:1000 dilution. Bound primary antibodies were visualized using secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (1:2000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and chemiluminescent substrate (ECL Plus, Thermo Scientific). For quantitation, Western blot images were opened in Image J and using the plot lanes function. All IGF2 bands were normalized to the corresponding bands of beta-tubulin from same membrane. Normalized signal measurement values were analyzed by GraphPad Prism using one-way ANOVA (alpha = 0.05). For evaluation of INSR phosphorylation, <italic>Nkx2.5-Cre</italic> with conditional <italic>Insr</italic> (both alleles heterozygous) adults were mated to homozygous conditional <italic>Insr</italic> partners, and hearts from P4 pups were collected and frozen and then retrospectively genotyped. Western blots prepared as above were probed with anti-phospho-INSR/IGF1R (Invitrogen 700393, 1.5 µg/ml final), anti-INSR (Cell Signaling 3025S (4B8), 1:1000), anti-IGF1R (Cell Signaling 3027S, 1:1000), and beta-actin (Santa Cruz sc-47778, 1:1000), and visualized as above.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Cardiomyocyte isolation and mononuclear and mononuclear ploidy quantitation</title><p>Because strain background strongly influences both nuclear ploidy and mononuclear cardiomyocyte level, mice for this analysis were all on a uniform B6AF1 strain background (described above). P3 and P7 neonatal mouse hearts were rapidly excised after decapitation and gently cleaned to remove blood in ice-cold Kruftbrühe (KB) solution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Malliaras et al., 2013</xref>). Hearts were mounted to a Langendorff perfusion apparatus, perfused with 37°C oxygenated calcium‐free Tyrode's solution at 1 ml/min for 1 min, then digested with 37°C oxygenated calcium‐free Tyrode's solution containing 1 mg/ml collagenase type II (Gibco 17101–015) at 1 ml/min for 5 min. After digestion, atria and valves were removed and ventricular tissue alone was excised and triturated in KB solution. The resulting cell suspension was filtered through a 250 μm mesh, stained with LiveDead Fixable (ThermoFisher, L10120) for 20 min at room temperature, then fixed in 2% PFA at room temperature for 15 min. Fixed cell suspensions were stained for cTnT (1:1,000, Abcam ab8295) overnight at 4°C followed by goat anti-mouse secondary (1:500, ThermoFisher A11001) and DAPI. Cell suspensions were pipetted across a slide and coverslipped. Cardiomyocyte nucleation was quantified on an Olympus BX41 fluorescence microscope with a 20x objective. Only live cardiomyocytes were counted; at least 300 cells were counted per heart. For nuclear ploidy analysis, cell preparations prepared as above were also stained with anti-CD31 antibody (BD Pharmingen 553370; 1:250) to label endothelial cells and photographed. Using ImageJ software, nuclei were identified and outlined with a standard threshold requirement, and DAPI fluorescence intensity of individual nuclei in mononuclear cardiomyocytes and in endothelial cells was calculated. The median value of DAPI fluorescence intensity of CD31+ endothelial cell nuclei was used as a diploid nucleus standard, and cardiomyocyte nuclei were defined as being diploid if their normalized intensity values were within a 0.5–1.5x range of this standard. Investigators were blinded to genotype at the onset of and through the completion of this analysis.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This project was supported by NIH grant HL070123 to HMS, and by American Heart Association grant 17SDG33400141 and NSF (MADE in SC) OIA-1655740 to GT.

responses.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Mononuclear diploid cardiomyocytes support neonatal mouse heart regeneration in response to paracrine IGF2 signaling&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Edward Morrisey as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The reviewers agree that the results from the manuscript are interesting and potentially support an important regulatory mechanism in postnatal cardiac regenerative capacity. However, there were several concerns involving experimental design, rigor, and interpretation that must be addressed prior to further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Essential revisions are provided here.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The major events of postnatal heart composition and growth must be evaluated in <italic>Nkx2.5Cre</italic>/IGF2 mutants. While the developmental abnormalities are rescued, the composition of the heart prior to injury has not been rigorously assessed. In short, the reviewers were not convinced that hearts from <italic>Nkx2.5Cre</italic>/IGF2 postnatal animals were normal prior to injury. To address this concern, <italic>Nkx2.5Cre</italic>/IGF2 mutants must be compared to controls as follows: (1) percentages of mono and binucleated over the first week of postnatal life should be quantified with representative images of mono and binucleated cells shown; (2) nuclear ploidy in mono and binucleated cells should be quantified and compared between cohorts; (3) timing of cell cycle exit should be determined (can be extrapolated from data in (1); (4) hypertrophic growth should be assessed and compared.</p><p>2) A more detailed analysis of the rescued animals must be performed. In particular, sample sizes must be increased, scar size must be quantified, and all bullet points from reviewer 1 must be assessed. The rigor of data in Figure 6—figure supplement 1 should be improved (reviewer 1, bullet point 3; reviewer 3, comment 7).</p><p>3) The model should be refined in a revision. Specifically, it is unclear how more MNDCs arise in the rescued animals when IGF2 (the sole mitogen at P3) is missing. If the authors find that the percentage of MNDCs is statistically increased prior to injury in <italic>Nkx2.5Cre</italic>/IGF2 mutants under mild hypoxic conditions/mCat+ tg/A/J strain, then where do the authors think that the extra MNDCs are coming from? The authors should include a paragraph in the Discussion section with a much more explicit model that is consistent with their data.</p><p>4) Immunostainings must be improved. These data should be supported with Western blots and quantification that is subjected to statistical tests of significance.</p><p>5) Statistical tests should be improved by increasing sample sizes.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>In the manuscript, &quot;Mononuclear diploid cardiomyocytes support neonatal heart regeneration in response to paracrine IGF2 signaling&quot;, Shen et al. demonstrate that IGF2 is required in the endocardium to support cardiomyocyte proliferation during neonatal heart regeneration by signaling through the INSR receptor. They show that in the absence of IGF2 signaling, cardiomyocyte proliferation falls to</p><p>basal levels, suggesting that IGF2 is the sole mitogen at P3. At P7, IGF2 is responsible for ~40% of cardiomyocyte proliferation while ~60% is IGF2-independent. They then go to show that increasing the percentage of MNDCs through different experimental mechanisms rescues the IGF2-mediated</p><p>regeneration failure. While the data are of high quality and the text is easy to follow, there are concerns with the rescue data and how MNDC numbers influence IGF2-dependent cardiomyocyte proliferation.</p><p>1) It is inferred that higher percentages of MNDCs is the reason that the 3 experimental conditions rescues heart regeneration in the absence of <italic>Igf2</italic>. A more detailed analysis of these recused animals should be performed for this argument to be convincing:</p><p>• CM proliferation should be evaluated at P7 in all three types of rescued <italic>Igf2</italic> mutants. This should be performed and reported.</p><p>• The percentage of MNDCs should be quantified in the 3 experimental situations.</p><p>• It appears that only mononucleation was evaluated (Figure 6—figure supplement 1) in the absence of DNA content in only some of the experimental conditions. Since the message is focused on MNDCs, ploidy should also be determined.</p><p>• The conclusion that <italic>Igf2</italic> mutants have no difference in MNDC percentage is not convincing. The spread seems very large compared to mCAT+ and A/J-C57BL/6J.</p><p>2) Where do the authors think that the additional MNDCs come from in the <italic>Igf2</italic> mutant hearts under mild hypoxic conditions, in the presence of the mCAT transgene, or in the A/J background? There appears to be an internal inconsistency – if <italic>Igf2</italic> is the sole mitogen that supports MNDC proliferation, then how can there be additional MNDCs in its absence? While there is some loose speculation provided in the Discussion, a more refined model should be presented with increased clarity.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In mice the regenerative capacity is lost by seven days after birth. One contributing factor to the loss of regeneration is that the CMs become postmitotic at P7. The authors investigate the role of IGF2 in cardiac regeneration and find that IGF2 is required for neonatal mouse heart regeneration.</p><p>Interestingly, IGF2 originates from the endocardium/endothelium lineage and is transduced in cardiomyocytes by the insulin receptor.</p><p>1) The authors perform a careful analysis of the source of IGF2 and conclude that the source is endocardium and endothelium. These data are very convincing and rigorously performed.</p><p>2) The authors work out the receptor that mediates signaling to the myocardium. Again this is very convincing.</p><p>3) The connection to hypoxia and ploidy is fascinating and adds further impact to this manuscript. These are important observations for the field of tissue regeneration.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The study by Shen et al. uses multiple mouse genetic approaches to examine the requirements for <italic>Igf2</italic> in postnatal cardiac regeneration after injury. These studies built on previous reports from the same group that loss of <italic>Igf2</italic> causes defects in myocardial growth during development, but that mice recover to develop normally. These same mice are used in the current study to examine the requirements for <italic>Igf2</italic> in cardiac regeneration after injury. Additional conditional mutants are used as evidence for a paracrine IGF2 signal in postnatal cardiac regeneration.</p><p>The results are interesting and potentially support an important regulatory mechanism in postnatal cardiac regenerative capacity. However, there are several major concerns with the experimental design, rigor of data presentation, and interpretation that weaken the major conclusions of the study.</p><p>1) The authors conclude that IGF2 expressed in endothelial cells is signaling to the cardiomyocytes. However, it is not clear where IGF2 is lost using the <italic>Nkx2.5Cre</italic> mediated approach. This Cre driver is expressed in multiple tissues near the heart during embryogenesis and loss of IGF2 in proepicardial cells or pharyngeal structures could affect the alterations in cardiac regeneration observed. In addition there are no data showing specific loss of IGF2 expression in the endothelial cells. There are other Cre lines such as Cdh5CreER or Tcf21CreER that would be more appropriate for these studies. As presented in the current manuscript, the major conclusion of the study is not well supported.</p><p>2) The <italic>Nkx2.5Cre/Igf2</italic> mutants have developmental abnormalities in cardiac growth that are recovered by birth. It seems important to know if the major events of cardiomyocyte cell cycle arrest, binucleation, and transition to hypertrophic growth are normal in these animals in the postnatal period (P0-P15) in the absence of injury. If these parameters are affected in the mutants, it could alter the interpretation of the results.</p><p>3) In general, major findings are not quantified or subjected to statistical tests of significance. Sample sizes are small n=3 in most cases which would not be sufficient to determine significance of the results. This is especially a concern with conclusions regarding cardiac regenerative capacity in the different mutants. Scar sizes need to be quantified and compared to appropriate controls. &quot;Regenerative score&quot; is not really quantitative and individual data points are not shown.</p><p>4) Antibody stainings for pINSR and pIGF1R are not entirely convincing. MYL2 and TNC (troponin?) stainings also seem to be variable. These images should be improved and supported by Western blots with quantification and statistical tests of significance.</p><p>5) Western blots and qPCR data need to be quantified and subjected to statistical tests.</p><p>6) Is there any compensation for loss of <italic>Igf2</italic> by Igf1 which is expressed in the postnatal period? Is circulating <italic>Igf2</italic> affected?</p><p>7) Inclusion of images of mono and binucleated cardiomyocytes in Figure 6—figure supplement 1 would be informative. It looks like the <italic>CreIgf2</italic> hearts may be different from controls. Were binucleated cardiomyocyte percentages different?</p><p>8) Statistical tests used are not appropriate in many cases because the sample sizes are too small to determine parametric or nonparametric distribution.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.53071.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The major events of postnatal heart composition and growth must be evaluated in Nkx2.5Cre/IGF2 mutants.

These two time points bracket the P4-P6 period when most CMs become polyploid. It is not practical to conduct this analysis in the middle of this period (e.g., at P5) as the 1 in 4 yield of control and mutant pups necessitates their recovery from at least several litters, and the exact timing and litter sizes of different litters vary too much during this P4-P6 window to perform this evaluation in a consistent manner. Our new data at P3 and P7 show that controls and mutants become polyploid with comparable kinetics. Our numbers indicate a slight difference in the mononuclear CM level at P7 that had statistical significance. We suspect this is not a true difference in <italic>Igf2</italic> mutant hearts but rather a consequence of slightly different timing and litter sizes between the different litters of pups that were used at this time point. Because we had a predefined experimental procedure and endpoint, we elected to report the data as collected rather than obtain additional numbers that might “correct” this minor discrepancy; this is keeping with current standards of appropriate scientific conduct. We discuss this result in the revised text, and we also provide several additional comments and observations (in the Discussion) on why the general concern about heart composition in mutant neonates that was voiced in the decision letter is unlikely to be relevant. Regarding the subject of hypertrophic growth, we had already addressed this feature (see Figures 2C and F), but have added images (as requested by the reviewers) of P3 and P7 cell preparations to Figure 2I that show a large number of mononuclear and binucleated CMs so that readers can further evaluate this feature for themselves.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) A more detailed analysis of the rescued animals must be performed. In particular, sample sizes must be increased, scar size must be quantified, and all bullet points from reviewer 1 must be assessed. The rigor of data in Figure 6—figure supplement 1 should be improved (reviewer 1, bullet point 3; reviewer 3, comment 7).</p></disp-quote><p>We understand the perspective that a larger sample size would provide more assurance for the rescue results. Because of experimental limitations (whole litters can be lost after surgery if the mothers do not nurse the pups, many individual pups die after surgery either from hemorrhage or from lack of nursing, only one in four surviving pups has the appropriate genotype, and the generational time needed to expand the mouse colony to undertake the requested further evaluations), we cannot respond to this suggestion in the time available. However, the reviewer was appropriate in asking for quantitation of scar size, and this analysis (Figure 6D) clearly illustrates the degree of rescue with very high statistical significance even with small sample numbers. Of the four bullet points of reviewer 1, three have been addressed (mononuclear CM percent in A/J and mCAT mice is in Figure 6—figure supplement 1, nuclear ploidy is in Figure 2H, and better evaluation of <italic>Igf2</italic> mutants is in Figure 2G-I). The reviewer also asked for an evaluation of CM proliferation in rescued <italic>Igf2</italic> mutants, although did not specify what type of experimental demonstration would be appropriate. The field recognizes the difficulty in documenting CM proliferation (i.e., completed mitosis), which is distinct from cell cycle entry which we did show (e.g., Figure 5), and to confirm this specific point would require a substantial investment of time. Because CM proliferation is necessary for heart regeneration, we infer that rescue of regeneration in <italic>Igf2</italic> mutants must involve CM proliferation, but agree that this is a limitation of our analysis. We have therefore added discussion of this limitation to the revised text. Finally, the similar question from reviewers 1 and 3 about the data in Figure 6—figure supplement 1 has been addressed by the removal of a previous panel in this supplementary figure and the inclusion of new and more extensive data on the same point now provided in Figure 2G-I.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The model should be refined in a revision. Specifically, it is unclear how more MNDCs arise in the rescued animals when IGF2 (the sole mitogen at P3) is missing. If the authors find that the percentage of MNDCs is statistically increased prior to injury in Nkx2.5Cre/IGF2 mutants under mild hypoxic conditions/mCat+ tg/A/J strain, then where do the authors think that the extra MNDCs are coming from? The authors should include a paragraph in the Discussion section with a much more explicit model that is consistent with their data.</p></disp-quote><p>This comment was a misunderstanding of our model by the reviewer, which indicates that we did not explain this adequately in the original manuscript. We do not think that IGF2 influences how many mononuclear diploid CMs are present; rather, IGF2 (the only mitogen at P3) and other growth factors and IGF2 (at P7) act on these CMs to promote their proliferation. Under typical circumstances, the number of MNDCMs is too low at P7 to achieve sufficient regeneration, but this number is elevated by each of the three rescue conditions, thereby allowing regeneration via the other factors even when IGF2 is not present. The confusion may have arisen from the model diagram (in Figure 8) that in retrospect was originally drawn in a way that imposed IGF2 on how many MNDCMs are present. That diagram and the overall figure have been revised, and the text has also been revised in a way that we hope makes the model more clear.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Immunostainings must be improved. These data should be supported with Western blots and quantification that is subjected to statistical tests of significance.</p></disp-quote><p>This comment (extracted from a lengthier point made by reviewer 3) refers to the immunofluorescence data shown in Figure 4 and associated supplementary figures. We were surprised by this comment as we think the primary result – that there is no INSR phosphorylation before injury, that INSR phosphorylation occurs after injury in an IGF2-dependent manner, and that IGF1R is not activated by injury – is unambiguous. The concern perhaps arose because of variation in phospho-INSR signal intensity, although we pointed out that there is variation in response even in adjacent CMs (e.g., Figure 4—figure supplement 1B). Regardless, the reviewer requested that we support the immunofluorescence result with Western blot data, which we have now added (Figure 4D), which clearly confirms the induction of INSR phosphorylation by injury and the lack of IGF1R activation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Statistical tests should be improved by increasing sample sizes.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added new data with statistical validation in Figures 2G-H and Figure 6D. As noted above regarding evaluation of additional rescued pups (Essential revision 2), this was not practical to do in the time available, but the statistical evaluation of the pups already analyzed (Figure 6D) confirms a very high level of statistical significance.</p></body></sub-article></article>
