Here, we show that these fluctuations are largely responsible for the variability observed in cortical responses to sensory stimuli. Using widefield imaging of voltage and calcium signals, we measured activity in the cortex of mice performing a visual detection task. Bilateral fluctuations invested all areas, particularly those closest to the midline. Activity was less bilateral in the monocular region of primary visual cortex and, especially during task engagement, in secondary motor cortex. Ongoing bilateral fluctuations dominated unilateral visual responses, and interacted additively with them, explaining much of the variance in trial-by-trial activity.

When one region of cortex becomes active, this activity is often accompanied by activity in the symmetrical region in the opposite hemisphere. This bilateral symmetry has been documented both in awake mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Mohajerani et al., 2010</xref>) and in awake humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fox et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Tyszka et al., 2011</xref>). The degree of symmetry varies across cortical areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Mohajerani et al., 2010</xref>), but the rules behind the differences across areas remain unknown.</p><p>Bilateral ongoing activity coexists with event-related activity, which is not necessarily bilateral. For instance, when human subjects move their right hand, the movement-related BOLD (Blood-oxygen-level-dependent) response in left motor cortex coexists with bilateral ongoing fluctuations in both left and right motor cortices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fox et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>It is not clear, however, to what extent this bilateral ongoing activity can influence sensory-evoked activity. Similar to the activity associated with movements, the activity evoked by visual stimuli in cortex is not generally bilateral. For instance, a visual stimulus presented to the side of the animal would evoke unilateral responses in the contralateral visual cortex. It is not known whether the bilateral ongoing activity coexists with the visually evoked activity, or whether it is quenched by the onset of visual responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Churchland et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">He, 2013</xref>).</p><p>If bilateral ongoing activity persists during sensory responses, it could contribute to the large trial-by-trial variability seen in these responses. Even in response to an identical visual stimulus, neural responses in primary visual cortex are well-known to vary strongly from trial to trial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Tolhurst et al., 1983</xref>). This variability has been observed not only in the spike trains but also in intracellular recordings from single neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anderson et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Carandini, 2004</xref>) and in voltage imaging of neural populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arieli et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carandini et al., 2015</xref>). How much of this trial-by-trial variability is explained by bilateral ongoing activity?</p><p>If much of trial-by-trial variability is explained by bilateral ongoing activity, then bilateral measurements may become necessary to estimate true sensory responses. How would such a procedure compare to the standard method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arieli et al., 1996</xref>) of measuring activity before a stimulus and removing it from the subsequent activity? Moreover, it is not known how bilateral ongoing activity interacts with visual responses, for example whether the interaction can be described as simply additive or multiplicative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arieli et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ecker et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Goris et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">He, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Schölvinck et al., 2015</xref>). Likewise, it is not known whether the bilateral fluctuations impair stimulus coding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Averbeck et al., 2006</xref>) and therefore impact perception.</p><p>To address these questions, we performed widefield optical imaging from both cortical hemispheres of mice performing a visual detection task. Widefield imaging allowed us to monitor bilateral ongoing activity and visually evoked response across hemispheres. To observe these forms of activity both in membrane potential and in spiking activity, we measured both from mice expressing a voltage sensor and from mice expressing a calcium sensor. These measurements revealed that bilateral ongoing activity has a prominent impact on visually evoked responses. An additive model for the interaction of ongoing and evoked activities provided excellent fits to the data, explaining up to 60% of trial-by-trial variance in the observed imaging signal. On the other hand, bilateral ongoing activity did not seem to affect perceptual decisions, suggesting that it does not impact stimulus coding.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>We performed widefield imaging in the cerebral cortex of transgenic mice expressing voltage indicator VSFPB1.2 or calcium indicator GCaMP6 in excitatory neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).

Consistent with an additive interaction, the effect of the stimulus was to elevate this right-hemisphere activity by a constant amount, irrespective of left-hemisphere activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, <italic>black</italic> vs. <italic>gray curves</italic>).</p><p>To test whether the interaction between ongoing activity and visually evoked responses is additive, we examined the effects of variations in each factor’s amplitude: the contrast of the stimulus, and the simultaneous amplitude of the bilateral fluctuation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C–H</xref>). We divided trials into two groups according to fluorescence at the time of the responses (50–150 ms) in the unstimulated hemisphere (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>; <italic>blue</italic> vs. <italic>cyan</italic>). For all stimulus contrasts, the visual responses obtained when ongoing activity was high (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C,D</xref>, <italic>cyan</italic>) appeared additively shifted compared to those obtained when ongoing activity was low (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C,D</xref>, <italic>blue</italic>). To quantify this effect, we fitted the contrast responses with a curve with two free parameters: offset and scale. The offset parameter was significantly higher when ongoing activity was high (p = 0.0009, paired <italic>t</italic> test, n = 7 mice <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). The scale parameter was much less affected: it appeared to show a mild increase when bilateral activity was high, but this increase was not significant (p&gt;0.05, paired <italic>t</italic> test, n = 7 mice <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). This result held not only for PM but also for all other visual areas: bilateral ongoing activity changed offset but not scale (n = 7 in V1, n = 5 mice in AL, LM and RL, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G,H</xref>). Similar results were seen when we chose different criteria for distinguishing high vs. low ongoing activity.</p><p>The additive interaction between bilateral ongoing activity and visual responses held regardless of the degree to which ongoing activity resembled visual responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Ongoing activity sometimes resembles the responses evoked by visual stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kenet et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Mohajerani et al., 2013</xref>). To assess whether this similarity affects the interaction between ongoing activity and visually evoked responses, we created a template based on the average response to a visual stimulus, made it bilateral, and divided trials into two groups according to correlation with this template at the time of the stimulus onset. For all stimulus contrasts, the visual responses obtained when ongoing activity was positively or negatively correlated with the template differed by a single additive factor (Offset: p&gt;0.05 in V1 n = 7 mice, p&lt;0.05 in other visual areas n = 5 mice, paired <italic>t</italic> test; Scale: p&gt;0.05 in all areas, paired <italic>t</italic> test, n = 7 mice in V1, n = 5 mice in AL, LM, and RL, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1F,G</xref>).</p><p>Bilateral fluctuations are rapid and their effect is independent of arousal. These effects of bilateral ongoing activity were due to fast changes in cortical activation, not to slow changes in cortical state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). Slow state changes might in principle have been able to explain these results; for instance, there may be more opportunities for bilateral ongoing activity to be ‘high’ when the cortex is in a more synchronized state, and this state might be the fundamental factor that leads to elevated visual responses. To assess slow changes in cortical state, we computed the amplitude of 2–7 Hz fluctuations in bilateral activity before the stimulus, and thus divided trials in four groups, for all combinations of state (more desynchronized vs. more synchronized) and instantaneous activity (low vs. high, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A</xref>). The interaction between instantaneous ongoing activity and visually evoked responses was seen in synchronized and desynchronized states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2B,C</xref>). The offset associated with high bilateral activity seemed to be larger in the synchronized state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2C</xref>). However, this larger offset was explained by the fact that in the synchronized state, the bilateral ongoing activity tended to reach higher levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A,D</xref>). Similar results were seen across the other mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2E–G</xref>): fast fluctuations, rather than cortical state, determine the size of the additive interaction on visually evoked responses.</p><p>Similarly, the effects of bilateral ongoing activity were not related to slow changes in level of arousal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>). We gauged the level of arousal by measuring pupil diameter, and we divided the trials according to pupil diameter (small vs. large, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3A</xref>), and found that the effect of bilateral activity was present in both cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3B,C,E,F</xref>). Once again, responses could be explained based on fast ongoing fluctuations, with no need to include pupil dilation as a predictor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3D,G</xref>).</p><p>Because ongoing activity changed rapidly and was largely bilateral, its impact could not be estimated through the typical procedure of measuring unilateral activity before stimulus onset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4</xref>). Ongoing activity is often estimated from prestimulus measurements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arieli et al., 1996</xref>), and these estimates are often subtracted from the subsequent measurements. This procedure is likely to be less effective in the face of strong, fast bilateral ongoing activity. Indeed, the cross-correlation between corresponding regions on the two hemispheres typically decreased to 0 in ~100 ms, and in some mice became negative afterwards (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4A</xref>). As a result, estimates of bilateral ongoing activity obtained from the unstimulated hemisphere were superior to estimates obtained in the stimulated hemisphere before stimulus onset. This can be seen by dividing all trials into four groups, for all combinations of prestimulus activity in the stimulated hemisphere (down vs. up) and poststimulus activity in the unstimulated hemisphere (low vs. high <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4B</xref>). The strong effect of bilateral activity was present in both up and down groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4C,D,F,G</xref>), and responses could be explained based on fast bilateral fluctuations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4E,H</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Bilateral fluctuations do not affect perceptual reports</title><p>Do these fast fluctuations in bilateral ongoing activity result in percepts?

On the other hand, as the correlation structure of bilateral spontaneous activity differs from that of unilateral sensory responses, it may have little impact on information coding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Averbeck et al., 2006</xref>): interpreted naively, bilateral activations would constitute stimuli with a peculiar mirror symmetry across the vertical midline, which would be unlikely to be confused with actual images.</p><p>Bilateral ongoing fluctuations did not affect the behavior of the mouse in the task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).

As reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Mohajerani et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Shimaoka et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Vanni et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Vanni and Murphy, 2014</xref>), voltage and calcium signals exhibited strong bilateral fluctuations in ongoing activity. In both types of signal, the impact of these bilateral fluctuations varied across cortical areas, and was stronger in areas closer to the midline. Two exceptions were the monocular region of area V1, where activity was less bilateral in all conditions, and area M2, where activity was less bilateral during task engagement. Bilateral ongoing fluctuations continued following the onset of the visual stimulus, and typically swamped the resulting unilateral visual responses. Higher bilateral ongoing activity increased visual responses equally at all contrasts, regardless of response amplitude, indicating that the interaction between ongoing activity and visually evoked responses was additive. A simple additive model provided good estimates of trial-by-trial visual response in all visual areas, and revealed that bilateral ongoing fluctuations had a much larger effect on cortical activity than evoked visual responses.</p><p>Bilateral fluctuations have been observed in multiple circumstances, but in the absence of overt movements their functional significance is not clear. The cortex exhibits clear bilateral activity during motor behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Musall et al., 2018</xref>), which is understandable given the symmetry involved in many body movements. It is less clear, however, why there should be bilateral symmetry in sensory responses, and even less clear why there should be symmetry in ongoing activity, both in wakefulness and in anesthesia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Mohajerani et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Shimaoka et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Vanni and Murphy, 2014</xref>).</p><p>Regardless of their origin, it is likely that bilateral fluctuations are at least partially mediated by callosal connections. A number of brain structures connect the two cerebral hemispheres, including anterior commissure, cingulum, interhemispheric thalamic connections, and corpus callosum. Among these, the corpus callosum is the largest white matter tract connecting the cerebral hemispheres in placental mammalian brains. Ongoing activity is less correlated across hemispheres in mutant mice that lack the corpus callosum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Mohajerani et al., 2010</xref>) and in rats after surgical section of the corpus callosum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Magnuson et al., 2014</xref>). However, ongoing bilateral activity is also reported in humans born without a corpus callosum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Tyszka et al., 2011</xref>), suggesting that bilateral fluctuations can also be sustained by other brain structures.</p><p>Bilateral fluctuation represents shared activity across neurons, which impacts on response variability. Our widefield imaging result conforms to the previous electrophysiological report by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Schölvinck et al. (2015)</xref>, that ongoing activity is shared across large proportions of neurons and interacts additively with visually evoked responses, and that it accounts for a large fraction of trial-by-trial fluctuations in observed visually evoked activities. The present study extends this idea by demonstrating that such global fluctuation is actually shared across hemispheres, yet in an area-specific manner.</p><p>Our results indicate that a full understanding of activity in a population of neurons in one hemisphere may require recordings from the corresponding area of the other hemisphere. Because ongoing activity changed rapidly and was largely bilateral, its impact could not be estimated through the typical procedure of measuring unilateral activity before stimulus onset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arieli et al., 1996</xref>). Indeed, compared to bilateral activity, activity in the prestimulus period had a smaller impact on evoked responses than simultaneously measured activity in the contralateral hemisphere. Given the specificity that we have observed in bilateral fluctuations, the ideal placement of a sensor in the contralateral hemisphere would be one that monitored the symmetrical populations to the ones of interest. Experiments with this design are emerging in electrophysiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cohen and Maunsell, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Rabinowitz et al., 2015</xref>), and a promising strategy would be to pair them with simultaneous widefield imaging.</p><p>Even though bilateral fluctuations occurred in regions necessary for this visual task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Burgess et al., 2017</xref>), they did not impact choice behavior. Perhaps, a downstream readout mechanism removes the bilateral fluctuations by taking the difference of activity on left and right visual cortices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Zatka-Haas et al., 2019</xref>). It might thus be easy for the brain to ignore them during perceptual decisions based on vision, even though the fluctuations continue during visual stimulation and have a powerful additive impact on visual processing. One possible test of this hypothesis might be to perform optogenetic stimulation (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">O'Connor et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Sreenivasan et al., 2016</xref>) both unilaterally and bilaterally, and ask whether the animal finds it easier to ignore bilateral activations during behavior.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>Experimental procedures were conducted according to the UK Animals Scientific Procedures Act (1986), under personal and project licenses released by the Home Office following appropriate ethics review.</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Transgenic lines</title><p>To obtain mice-expressing GCaMP6s in selected neuronal populations, we used Snap25-GCaMP6s (B6.Cg-Snap25tm3.1Hze/J), Jax025111.

(2017)</xref>. The sequence of trial events was as follows. First, the mouse kept the wheel still (quiescent period) to initiate the trial. Second, a visual grating stimulus was presented, and, during an ‘open loop’ period, wheel movements were ignored. Third, a go tone was played, after which point the wheel turns resulted in movements of the visual stimuli (‘closed loop’). If the mouse turned the wheel such that the stimulus reached the center of the screen, the mouse received water reward (1–3 ml). If instead the mouse moved the stimulus by the same distance in the opposite direction, this incorrect decision was penalized with a timeout (typically, 2 s) signaled by auditory noise. In either case, the grating remained locked in its response position for 1 s and then disappeared. In this paper, we added slight modifications to the two-alternative task for GCaMP and VSFP animals. For GCaMP animals, we extended the two-alternative tasks by adding a ‘no-go’ response option when there was no stimulus. The result is the two-alternative unforced-choice (2AUC) task. Training started on the two-alternative forced-choice task, then we constrained the response window to 1.5 s and added the no-go condition: when the stimulus was absent (zero contrast), mice earned the reward by not turning the wheel (no-go; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) for 1.5 s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). For VSFP animals, we used the 2AFC version of the task, where the mice were trained to hold the wheel after the stimulus presentation at least for 800 ms. If the mice did not respond within 5 s, the trial was aborted. When the stimulus was absent (zero contrast), water reward was randomly assigned to either to the left or right wheel turning. We analyzed VSFP activity in all sessions (25 sessions in two mice) and GCaMP activity in 37/61 sessions in seven mice, selected to have &gt;100 trials and overall hit rate &gt;65%.</p><p>In subset of mice, we also acquired widefield data during a passive condition, in which the same visual stimuli were applied but the waterspout was retracted.

To identify areas six visual areas (V1, LM, AL, RL, AM, PM), we used vertical or horizontal bars sweeping across the visual field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Garrett et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kalatsky and Stryker, 2003</xref>). We built maps of retinotopy then parcellated the activated region into distinct visual areas by identifying changes in the sign of the retinotopic mapping between the screen and the cortical surface. This sign is positive if clockwise circles in the visual field map to clockwise circles on cortex and negative if they map to anti-clockwise circles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Sereno et al., 1994</xref>). Additionally in VSFP animals, train of auditory or somatosensory stimuli was used to identify these sensory areas. Somatosensory stimuli were air puffs delivered from a pressure injector (Toohey Company Pressure system IIe) towards the bulk of the whiskers at a pressure of 40 PSI via a silicone tube (0.5 mm open tip diameter). Auditory stimuli were 13 kHz tones at 80 dB SPL via a magnetic speaker (Tucker-Davis Technologies) placed 19 cm away from the animal. We obtained location of the S1 barrel cortex and auditory cortex, by calculating the response amplitude at the stimulation frequency.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Fitting contrast-response curves</title><p>To quantify the contrast sensitivity of the recorded signal, we fitted the contrast-response relationship with the Naka-Rushton function:<disp-formula id="equ3"><label>(3)</label><mml:math id="m3"><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mfenced separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>c</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>R</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>R</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>x</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>C</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>C</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>50</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>C</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:math></disp-formula>where <bold><italic>R</italic></bold> is the neuronal activity, <bold><italic>R<sub>0</sub></italic></bold> is the background discharge, <bold><italic>R<sub>max</sub></italic></bold> is maximal response, <bold><italic>C</italic></bold> is the contrast of grating stimuli, <bold><italic>n</italic></bold> is exponent of the power function, and <bold><italic>C<sub>50</sub></italic></bold> is contrast for half of <bold><italic>R<sub>max</sub></italic></bold>.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Joshua Gold as the Senior Editor.

The manuscript investigates bilaterally symmetrical cortical activation observed in mice during an awake resting state condition and during a visual discrimination task. The authors extend previous work by a number of labs defining bilaterally symmetrical activity dynamics in the mouse brain. Strikingly, these bilateral dynamics are preserved under conditions of spontaneous activity or even anesthesia states. The authors examine the interactions of this ongoing activity with task-evoked activity. They find that although ongoing activity is of greater amplitude than task-dependent signals, it does not interfere with the ability to perform the task. In addition, other significant findings are reported, such as the lack of a relationship between task-dependent and ongoing activity, and a linear interaction between the spontaneous activity and the evoked activity, with no impact on behavioral performance. The results are very surprising, as most studies have suggested that the ongoing activity will, at least to some degree, affect behavior and evoked responses (e.g. Mcginley et al., Neuron 2015). Mesoscopic imaging of these spontaneous neural activity patterns and its impact on a behavior is an important and novel advance for the field. The paper is well-written and it is relatively clear in its presentation and accessible to a wide range of readers.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Mesoscopic calcium/voltage imaging is becoming a very important tool in systems neuroscience, but it would be good to show some more details on the data processing pipeline, given the importance and impact of the results shown in this manuscript.</p><p>The pre-processing step in the data analysis presented in the paper needs to be more clearly described and discussed. There are concerns that the pre-processing, combined with subsequent band-pass filtering could amplify relatively small parts of the original signal. Could this artificially hide some non-linear interaction between the spontaneous and evoked activity? Does the linear relationship between the evoked and spontaneous activity persist in the raw data?</p><p>To address these concerns, particularly that the noise removal steps might remove most of the signal in the 0.5 – 7.0 Hz range, it is suggested that the authors:</p><p>– Show analyses both of the raw and &quot;denoised&quot; data, including some example traces before and after pre-processing and bandpass filtering, as well as the power spectra of these signals.</p><p>– Perform their denoising SVD in the space-frequency domain (rather than in the temporal domain) (see Prechtl et al., 1997 PNAS), and use the resulting components with substantial power in the 0.5-7 Hz band.</p><p>2) The manuscript needs to better define the behavioral state of the animal. Are there particular bilateral limb, whisker, or facial movements during sensory-motor bilateral activity? Videos of the animal body, if available, might help make this point a bit more clear to the reader.</p><p>3) The term &quot;ongoing activity&quot; should be more clearly defined.</p><p>4) Points made in Figure 3A such as ongoing activity dominating stimulus-dependent activity should be stated quantitatively. The current draft only states when &quot;acquiring a large number of trials could ongoing fluctuations be averaged out&quot;. Please state what a &quot;large number of trials&quot; is and exactly what the impact can be. Presumably, this effect is dependent on where ongoing spontaneous activity occurs and what particular spatial temporal characteristics it contains. One could imagine ongoing activity could have discreet motifs, as described in Mohajerani et al., 2013, which should also be referenced.</p><p>5) The authors elegantly show that bilateral activity adds linearly to stimulus trial evoked activity. While the authors have clearly defined this, it needs to also be stated that this conclusion only holds for a visual stimulus. In the experiments, sequences of activity were chosen where mice were attending to visual stimuli and not doing other tasks such a forelimb or whisker-dependent task. It is possible that most of the ongoing activity has origins outside the visual system, making it unlikely that ongoing activity would interfere with visual processing. In contrast, if the task were a whisker or forelimb-dependent one, and the mouse was also moving these body parts, very different results could be obtained. Please mention this caveat in the Abstract and also discuss it more in the manuscript.</p><p>5b) The authors should contrast their findings on ongoing visual-like activity and task success rate and response additivity with activity that features different sensory systems (perhaps forelimb and whisker). One way to do this is by using a template-matching or similar scheme as in, e.g. Mohajerani et al., 2013, to find the visual-system-like versus whisker-like ongoing activity and see whether these have any specific impact on a visual task. It would be good to see a quantification of the general composition of the ongoing activity: how much is whisker- versus visual-like, etc. These would be additional analyses, but require no new data collection.</p><p>To add to the Discussion section:</p><p>6) In other recent work, it has been shown that a form of ongoing activity derived from optogenetic stimulation can bias behavioral activity. Why does optogenetic stimulation have an impact, but not the forms of spontaneous ongoing activity monitored here? e.g. O'Connor et al., 2014 and Sreenivasan et al., 2016</p><p>7) Can one conclude that the ipsilateral hemisphere really is independent during the visual task? Perhaps, instead, it gets inhibited, potentially dampening its utility for reporting the impact of ongoing activity on evoked activity?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43533.027</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Mesoscopic calcium/voltage imaging is becoming a very important tool in systems neuroscience, but it would be good to show some more details on the data processing pipeline, given the importance and impact of the results shown in this manuscript.</p><p>The pre-processing step in the data analysis presented in the paper needs to be more clearly described and discussed.

We have now edited the Materials and methods to explain that we used SVD only to compress the data and speed up the analysis, not for denoising. Indeed, as we now explain, the 500 components that we use capture close to 100% of the variance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>). Had we wanted to denoise, we could have used a much smaller number of components (e.g. 20-50) with minimal loss. So, the compression we applied is essentially lossless, and its denoising effect is minimal.</p><fig id="respfig1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43533.021</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Singular Value Decomposition efficiently compresses calcium-imaging data.</title><p>A few tens of components are sufficient to capture close to 100% of the variance, both in the calcium-sensitive channel (blue) and in the calcium-independent channel (red).

It is better because it illustrates directly the result (i.e. that bilateral activity is independent of frequency), and is independent of whether we filter the data or not. Therefore, we updated Figure 1D,H in the paper, to show this quantity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The manuscript needs to better define the behavioral state of the animal. Are there particular bilateral limb, whisker, or facial movements during sensory-motor bilateral activity? Videos of the animal body, if available, might help make this point a bit more clear to the reader.</p></disp-quote><p>We completely agree, and we have now added two videos: one for the three example trials in Figure 1 (where the visual stimulus was absent, i.e. 0 contrast) and the other for the three example trials in Figure 3 (where the visual stimulus was present). The videos show not only the cortical activity but also the snout and the eye of the mouse, and traces for wheel movements and licks. These videos confirm that indeed in the intervals that we analyzed (up to 200 ms after stimulus onset) there is no overt movement.</p><p>It is possible, however, that with videos taken from other angles and with better lighting, we would have seen movement. In future studies, we hope to place more cameras around the mouse, although this is made difficult by the presence of the three screens.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The term &quot;ongoing activity&quot; should be more clearly defined.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now edited Abstract and Introduction to define “ongoing activity” as the patterns of activity exhibited by the awake cerebral cortex even in the absence of external stimuli or overt behavior.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Points made in Figure 3A such as ongoing activity dominating stimulus-dependent activity should be stated quantitatively.

One could imagine ongoing activity could have discreet motifs, as described in Mohajerani et al., 2013, which should also be referenced.</p></disp-quote><p>We have addressed this comment (and a later one in the same spirit) with a new analysis, shown in two new supplementary figures. In this analysis, we asked whether there were motifs in the ongoing activity that resembled the pattern of activity observed during stimulus responses. We found a continuum of correlations with this pattern of activity (Figure 5—figure supplement 1), and we divided trials in two groups: Those where bilateral activity had positive correlation with this pattern and those where bilateral activity had negative correlation this pattern. The difference in activity between these two conditions was again consistent with an additive interaction (Figure 5—figure supplement 1). Behavior was not significantly different in the two conditions (Figure 6—figure supplement 1). We also added a citation to the paper by Mohajerani and Murphy, 2013, which reported the existence of motifs in unilateral measurements, and to an earlier paper by Kenet et al. in cats.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The authors elegantly show that bilateral activity adds linearly to stimulus trial evoked activity.

To limit our claim we replaced “sensory” with “visual” in Abstract and throughout the last paragraph of Discussion, where we now explain that our conclusions apply to perceptual decisions based on vision.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5b) The authors should contrast their findings on ongoing visual-like activity and task success rate and response additivity with activity that features different sensory systems (perhaps forelimb and whisker).

The results are shown in the new supplementary figure (Figure 6—figure supplement 1).

We do not know if activity elicited by bilateral optogenetic stimulation might similarly be ignored during behavior. We now remark on this in Discussion, as suggested, and we cite the two papers that were suggested (O’Connor et al., 2013, Sreenivasan et al., 2016). However, optogenetic activation in these papers was unilateral.
