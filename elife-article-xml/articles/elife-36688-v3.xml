The success of CAR-T cell therapies highlights the promise of programmed immunity and suggests that applying CAR strategies to other immune cell lineages may be beneficial. Here, we engineered a family of Chimeric Antigen Receptors for Phagocytosis (CAR-Ps) that direct macrophages to engulf specific targets, including cancer cells. CAR-Ps consist of an extracellular antibody fragment, which can be modified to direct CAR-P activity towards specific antigens. By screening a panel of engulfment receptor intracellular domains, we found that the cytosolic domains from Megf10 and FcRɣ robustly triggered engulfment independently of their native extracellular domain. We show that CAR-Ps drive specific engulfment of antigen-coated synthetic particles and whole human cancer cells. Addition of a tandem PI3K recruitment domain increased cancer cell engulfment. Finally, we show that CAR-P expressing murine macrophages reduce cancer cell number in co-culture by over 40%.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36688.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Our immune system constantly patrols our body, looking to eliminate cancerous cells and harmful microbes.

The CAR-T receptor contains an extracellular single chain antibody fragment (scFv) that recognizes known tumor antigens, and intracellular signaling domains from the T Cell Receptor (TCR) and costimulatory molecules that trigger T cell activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fesnak et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kochenderfer et al., 2009</xref>). CAR-T cells recognizing CD19, a marker expressed at high levels on the surface of B cells and B cell-derived malignancies, have been used successfully to target hematological malignancies with 70–90% of patients showing measurable improvement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lim et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Engel et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Haso et al., 2013</xref>). The success of CAR-T suggests that programming immune cells to target cancer might be a broadly applicable approach.</p><p>Macrophages are critical effectors of the innate immune system, responsible for engulfing debris and pathogens. Harnessing macrophages to combat tumor growth is of longstanding interest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alvey and Discher, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lee et al., 2016</xref>). Macrophages are uniquely capable of penetrating solid tumors, while other immune cells, like T cells, are physically excluded or inactivated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lim et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lee et al., 2016</xref>). This suggests that engineered macrophages may augment existing T cell-based therapies. Early efforts transferring healthy macrophages into cancer patients failed to inhibit tumor growth, suggesting that macrophages require additional signals to direct their activity towards tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lacerna et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andreesen et al., 1990</xref>). Antibody blockade of CD47, a negative regulator of phagocytosis, reduced tumor burden, indicating that shifting the balance in favor of macrophage activation and engulfment is a promising therapeutic avenue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Majeti et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chao et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jaiswal et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Tseng et al., 2013</xref>).

As an engulfment target, we used 5 µm diameter silica beads coated with a supported lipid bilayer. A His<sub>8</sub>-tagged extracellular domain of CD19 was bound to a NiNTA-lipid incorporated into the supported lipid bilayers. Macrophages expressing a CAR-P with the Megf10 (CAR-P<sup>Megf10</sup>) or FcRɣ (CAR-P<sup>FcRɣ</sup>) intracellular domain promoted significant engulfment of CD19 beads compared to macrophages with no CAR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b,c</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video1">Figure 1—video 1</xref>). Macrophages expressing CAR-P<sup>Bai1</sup>, CAR-P<sup>MerTK</sup>, and the adhesion-only CAR-P<sup>GFP</sup> did not bind the CD19 beads even though these CAR-Ps are present at the cell surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b,c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). To confirm that the CAR-P was a viable strategy for redirecting primary macrophages, we expressed the CAR-P<sup>FcRɣ</sup> in primary murine bone marrow derived macrophages and found that these transfected primary cells also were able to trigger engulfment of CD19 beads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>).</p><p>Next we asked if the CAR-P strategy could target a different antigen.

Consistent with our results using ɑCD19-based CARs, ɑCD22 CAR-P<sup>Megf10</sup> promoted engulfment of CD22 beads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). To confirm antigen specificity of CAR-P, we incubated ɑCD19 CAR-P<sup>Megf10</sup> macrophages with CD22 beads, and ɑCD22 CAR-P<sup>Megf10</sup> macrophages with CD19 beads. CD19 beads were not eaten by ɑCD22 CAR-P<sup>Megf10</sup> macrophages, and CD22 beads were not eaten by ɑCD19 CAR-P<sup>Megf10</sup> macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). These data indicate that CAR-P<sup>Megf10</sup> specifically triggers engulfment in response to the target ligand and that the CAR-P strategy is able to target multiple cancer antigens.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36688.006</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>CAR-P expression drives specific engulfment of diverse beads.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Macrophages infected with the ɑCD19 (purple) or ɑCD22 (blue) CAR-P<sup>Megf10</sup> or mCherry-CAAX control were fed 5 µm beads ligated with either CD19 (left) or CD22 (right).

We found that CAR-P<sup>Megf10</sup> was able to trigger specific engulfment of beads ranging from 2.5 µm to 20 µm in diameter, with higher specificity above background engulfment being demonstrated for the larger beads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). The high background in this assay is due to heterogeneity in the bilayers on beads purchased from a different manufacturer (Corpuscular) than previous assays. For the 10 µm bead condition, we also tested the phagocytic efficiency of beads containing the endogenous Megf10 ligand, phosphatidylserine. We found that CAR-P<sup>Megf10</sup> macrophages engulfed CD19 beads and beads containing 10% phosphatidylserine and the adhesion molecule ICAM-1 at a similar frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). This indicates that the CAR-P is comparably efficient to the endogenous system.</p><p>To determine if the CAR-P<sup>Megf10</sup> initiates active signaling at the synapse between the macrophage and target, we stained for phosphotyrosine. Macrophages expressing CAR-P<sup>Megf10</sup> exhibited an increase in phosphotyrosine at the synapse, while macrophages expressing CAR-P<sup>GFP</sup> did not show this enrichment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>).

Based on this observation, we hypothesized that the expression of an alternate ITAM-containing receptor might initiate phagocytosis when expressed in macrophages. The CD3ζ subunit of the T cell receptor contains three ITAM motifs. To test if the CD3ζ chain was able to activate phagocytic signaling, we transduced macrophages with the first generation CAR-T (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). The CAR-T was able to trigger engulfment of CD19 beads to a comparable extent as CAR-P<sup>Megf10</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>). In T cells, phosphorylated ITAMs in CD3ζ bind to tandem SH2 domains (tSH2) in the kinase ZAP70. Zap70 is not expressed in macrophages, but Syk, a phagocytic signaling effector and tSH2 domain containing protein, is expressed at high levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Andreu et al., 2017</xref>). Previous work suggested that Syk kinase can also bind to the CD3ζ ITAMs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bu et al., 1995</xref>), indicating that the CAR-T may promote engulfment through a similar mechanism as CAR-P<sup>FcRɣ</sup>. To quantitatively compare the interaction between Syk<sup>tSH2</sup> and CD3ζ or FcRɣ in a membrane proximal system recapitulating physiological geometry, we a used liposome-based assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hui and Vale, 2014</xref>]). In this system, His<sub>10</sub>-CD3ζ and His<sub>10</sub>-Lck (the kinase that phosphorylates CD3ζ) are bound to a liposome via NiNTA-lipids and the binding of labeled tandem SH2 domains to phosphorylated CD3ζ was measured using fluorescence quenching. Our results show that Syk-tSH2 binds the CD3ζ and FcRɣ with comparable affinity (~15 nM and ~30 nM respectively, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>). Collectively, these results demonstrate that the TCR CD3ζ chain can promote phagocytosis in a CAR-P, likely through the recruitment of Syk kinase.</p><p>We next sought to program engulfment towards a cellular target. We incubated the CAR-P<sup>Megf10</sup> and CAR-P<sup>FcRɣ</sup> macrophages with cancerous Raji B cells that express high levels of endogenous CD19. Strikingly, the majority of CAR-P-expressing macrophages internalized bites of the target cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig4video1">Figure 4—video 1</xref>, 78% of CAR-P<sup>Megf10</sup> and 85% of CAR-P<sup>FcRɣ</sup> macrophages internalized bites within 90 min). The biting phenotype resembles trogocytosis, or nibbling of live cells, which has been reported previously in immune cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Joly and Hudrisier, 2003</xref>). This process was dependent on the ITAM-bearing intracellular signaling domain, as removing the signaling domain (CAR-P<sup>GFP</sup>) dramatically reduced trogocytosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>). Enrichment of phosphotyrosine at the cell-cell synapse further supports active signaling initiating trogocytosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). The CAR-P module also was able to induce trogocytosis in non-professional phagocytes, human NIH 3T3 fibroblast cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). This suggests that the CAR-P can promote cancer antigen-dependent engulfment by both professional and non-professional phagocytes.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36688.009</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>CAR-P promotes trogocytosis and whole cell eating.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) J774A.1 macrophages expressing the ɑCD19 CAR-P<sup>Megf10</sup> (top panel, green in merge, left; greyscale, center) engulf pieces of CD19 +Raji B cells (labeled with mCherry-CAAX; magenta in merge, left; greyscale, right).

We observed that macrophages expressing the CAR-P<sup>Megf10</sup> or CAR-P<sup>FcRɣ</sup> were capable of engulfing whole Raji B cells (2 cancer cells eaten per 100 macrophages in a 4–8 hr window for both CAR-P<sup>Megf10</sup> or CAR-P<sup>FcRɣ</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b,e</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig4video2">Figure 4—video 2</xref>). Whole cell engulfment was infrequent but trogocytosis was robust, suggesting that productive macrophage target interactions were frequently insufficient to trigger whole cell engulfment. To determine if whole cell eating could be enhanced by further opsonization of CD19, we opsonized Raji B cells with a mouse IgG2a anti-CD19 antibody. While addition of this antibody did not trigger additional whole cell internalization, blockade of the ‘don’t eat me’ signal CD47 using the mouse IgG1 anti-human B6H12 clone resulted in a 2.5 fold increase of whole cell eating of opsonized Raji B cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). Both endogenous FcR recognition of the anti-CD47 antibody and blockade of CD47 signaling may contribute to this effect.</p><p>To develop a receptor to enhance whole cell eating, we hypothesized that combining signaling motifs in a tandem array might increase the frequency of whole cell engulfment by specifically recruiting effectors required for the engulfment of large targets. Previous work demonstrated that PI3K signaling is important for internalization of large targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Schlam et al., 2015</xref>). To increase PI3K recruitment to the CAR-P, we fused the portion of the CD19 cytoplasmic domain (amino acids 500 to 534) that recruits the p85 subunit of PI3K to the CAR-P<sup>FcRɣ</sup> creating a ‘tandem’ CAR (CAR-P<sup>tandem</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Tuveson et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brooks et al., 2004</xref>). A CAR-P containing the p85 recruitment motif alone (CAR-P<sup>PI3K</sup>) was able to induce some whole cell engulfment, comparable to the CAR-P<sup>FcRɣ</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e</xref>). Expression of CAR-P<sup>tandem</sup> tripled the ability of macrophages to ingest whole cells compared to CAR-P<sup>GFP</sup> (6 cancer cells eaten per 100 macrophages, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d,e</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig4video3">Figure 4—video 3</xref>). These data indicate that assembling an array of motifs designed to recruit distinct phagocytic effectors can increase CAR-P activity towards whole cells.</p><p>To determine if the combination of whole cell eating and trogocytosis was sufficient to drive a noticeable reduction in cancer cell number, we incubated CAR-P macrophages with Raji B cells for two days. After 44 hr of co-culture, we found that CAR-P macrophages significantly reduced the number of Raji cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4f</xref>). Although the CAR-P<sup>tandem</sup> was much more efficient at whole cell eating, the CAR-P<sup>FcRɣ</sup> performed nearly as well at eliminating Rajis. Importantly, our assay does not distinguish between whole cell engulfment or death following trogocytosis, so it is possible both CAR-P activities are contributing to Raji death rates. Overall, these data suggest that the CAR-P is a successful strategy for directing macrophages towards cancer targets, and can initiate whole cell eating and trogocytosis leading to cancer cell elimination.</p><p>In summary, we engineered phagocytes that recognize and ingest targets through specific antibody-mediated interactions. This strategy can be directed towards multiple extracellular ligands (CD19 and CD22) and can be used with several intracellular signaling domains that contain ITAM motifs (Megf10, FcRɣ, and CD3ζ). Previous work has suggested that spatial segregation between Src-family kinases and an inhibitory phosphatase, driven by receptor ligation, is sufficient to trigger signaling by the T cell receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Davis and van der Merwe, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">James and Vale, 2012</xref>) and FcR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Freeman et al., 2016</xref>). The CAR-Ps that we have developed may similarly convert receptor-ligand binding into receptor phosphorylation of ITAM domains through partitioning of kinases and phosphatases at the membrane-membrane interface.</p><p>Further development of CAR-Ps could be useful on several therapeutic fronts. Targeting of tumor cells by macrophages has been suggested to cause tumor cell killing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jaiswal et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Majeti et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chao et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jadus et al., 1996</xref>), either through directly engulfing cancer cells or by stimulating antigen presentation and a T cell-mediated response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Liu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Tseng et al., 2013</xref>). Inhibition of the CD47-SIRPA ‘Don’t eat me’ signaling pathway has also been shown to result in engulfment of cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gardai et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jaiswal et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Majeti et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chao et al., 2010</xref>). A recent study suggests that CD47 inhibition is most effective when combined with a positive signal to promote target engulfment, which raises the possibility of combining CAR-P expression with CD47 or SIRPA inhibition for an additive effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alvey et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Although we were able to increase whole cell engulfment by recruiting the activating subunit of PI3K to the phagocytic synapse, the engulfment of larger 20 micron beads was more frequent than the engulfment of whole cells. We hypothesize that this is due to differing physical properties of the engulfment target. Specifically, increased target stiffness has been shown to promote engulfment, suggesting that manipulating the physical properties of the engulfment target could also be a potential strategy for increasing CAR-P efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Beningo and Wang, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cross et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>While the CAR-P can engulf whole, viable cancer cells, the ingestion of a piece of the target cell is more common. Trogocytosis, or nibbling of living cells, has also been described in immune cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Harshyne et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Harshyne et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kao et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Joly and Hudrisier, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Batista et al., 2001</xref>) and brain-eating amoebae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ralston et al., 2014</xref>). In vivo studies also have shown that endogenous dendritic cell populations ingest bites of live tumor cells, contributing to presentation of cancer neo-antigen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Harshyne et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Harshyne et al., 2003</xref>). Although we were able to use the CAR-P to induce trogocytosis in dendritic cells, we were not able to detect robust cross presentation of the model antigen ovalbumin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>). Thus, although using CAR-Ps to enhance cross presentation of cancer antigen is an intriguing future avenue, such a strategy would likely require more optimization of the dendritic cell subset employed or the CAR-P receptor itself.</p><p>Overall, our study demonstrates that the CAR approach is transferrable to biological processes beyond T cell activation and that the expression of an engineered receptor in phagocytic cells is sufficient to promote specific engulfment and elimination of cancer cells.</p></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) <break/>or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Cell line <break/>(<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td>J774A.1 Macrophages</td><td>UCSF Cell Culture <break/>Facility</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Cell line <break/>(<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td>Raji B Cells</td><td>Other</td><td/><td>Obtained from M.

Lentivirus was produced by HEK293T cells transfected with pMD2.G (a gift from Didier Tronon, Addgene plasmid # 12259 containing the VSV-G envelope protein), pCMV-dR8.91 (since replaced by second generation compatible pCMV-dR8.2, Addgene plasmid #8455), and a lentiviral backbone vector containing the construct of interest (derived from pHRSIN-CSGW) using lipofectamine LTX (Invitrogen, Catalog # 15338–100). The media on the HEK293T cells was replaced with fresh media 8–16 hr post transfection to remove transfection reagent. At 50–72 hr post-transfection, the lentiviral media was filtered with a 0.45 µm filter and concentrated by centrifugation at 8000 x g for 4 hr or overnight. The concentrated supernatant was applied directly to ~0.5×10<sup>6</sup> NIH 3T3 cells in 2 ml of fresh media. For J77A4.1 macrophages and Raji B cells, the concentrated supernatant was mixed with 2 mls of media and 2 µg lipofectamine (Invitrogen, Catalog # 18324–012) and added to the cells. The cells were spun at 2200 x g for 45 min at 37°C. Cells were analyzed a minimum of 72 hr later.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Preparation of CD19 and CD22 5 µm silica beads</title><p>Chloroform-suspended lipids were mixed in the following molar ratio using clean glasstight Hamilton syringes (Hamilton, Catalog #8 1100): 97% POPC (Avanti, Catalog # 850457), 2% Ni2+-DGS-NTA (Avanti, Catalog # 790404), 0.5% PEG5000-PE (Avanti, Catalog # 880230, and 0.5% atto390-DOPE (ATTO-TEC GmbH, Catalog # AD 390–161). Lipid mixes were dried under argon and desiccated overnight under foil. Dried lipids were resuspended in 1 ml tissue-culture grade PBS, pH7.2 (Gibco, Catalog # 20012050), and stored under argon gas. Small unilamellar vesicles were formed by five freeze-thaw cycles followed by 2 × 5 min of bath sonication (Bioruptor Pico, Diagenode), and cleared by ultracentrifugation (TLA120.1 rotor, 35,000 rpm / 53,227 x g, 35 min, 4°C) or by 33 freeze thaw cycles. Lipid mixes were used immediately for form bilayers or shock frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored under argon at −80°C. To form bilayers on silica beads, 6 × 10<sup>8</sup> 5 µm silica microspheres (10% solids, Bangs Labs, Catalog # SS05N) were washed 2x in water, and 2x in PBS by sequential suspension in water and spinning at 800 rcf, followed by decanting. Cleaned beads were resuspended in 150 µl tissue-culture grade PBS, pH7.2 (Gibco, Catalog # 20012050) and briefly vortexed. 30 µl cleared SUVs prepared as above as a 10 mM stock were added to bead suspension for a 2 mM final SUV concentration. Beads were vortexed for 10 s, covered in foil, and rotated for 30 min at room temperature to form bilayers. Bilayer-coated beads were washed 3x in PBS by sequential centrifugation at 800 rcf and decanting. Beads were resuspended in PBS + 0.1% w/v BSA for blocking for 15 min rotating at room temperature under foil. 10 nM final concentration of CD19<sub>his8</sub> (Sino Biological, Catalog # 11880H08H50) or CD22<sub>his8</sub> (Sino Biological, Catalog # 11958H08H50) protein were added to blocked beads and proteins were allowed to bind during a 45 min incubation rotating under foil at room temperature.

Resuspended beads were sonicated for 60 min in a bath sonicator. Rinse and sonication were repeated in ethanol. Finally, rinse and sonication were repeated in water. Beads were then washed 2x in water to remove all traces of ethanol and left in a small volume after decanting. All further steps were performed in a 70–80°C water bath prepared in a fume hood. Proper Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) was worn throughout the RCA cleaning protocol. Washed beads were added to 3 ml of hot 1.5 M KOH in a clean glass vial suspended in the water bath described above. 1 ml 30% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> to bead solution and allowed to react for 10 min. Washed beads were cooled on ice, pelleted at 2000xg and rinsed 5x in ultrapure water. Used cleaning solution was saved for disposal by Environmental Health and Safety (EH and S). Cleaned beads were resuspended in 240 µl tissue-culture grade PBS, pH7.2 (Gibco, Catalog # 20012050) and briefly vortexed. The lipid mix used in this assay differed slightly from above. Here a mix of 93.5% POPC (Avanti, Catalog # 850457), 5% Ni<sup>2+-</sup>DGS-NTA (Avanti, Catalog # 790404), 1% PEG5000-PE (Avanti, Catalog # 880230, and 0.5% atto390-DOPE (ATTO-TEC GmbH, Catalog # AD 390–161.

Dendritic cells were produced as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mayordomo et al., 1995</xref>) by culturing bone marrow cells for 8–11 days with GMCSF. IL-4 was added 2–3 days before use. Efficient differentiation into CD11c + dendritic cells was verified by FACS, revealing ≥95% APC-CD11c + cells (Biolegend, Catalog #N418).</p></sec><sec id="s3-10"><title>Antigen cross-presentation assay</title><p>The ability of CAR-P to stimulate OTI T cell proliferation was tested using the co-culture assay shown as a schematic in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref> and described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Roberts et al., 2016</xref>). 10,000 CAR-P transduced CD11c + dendritic cells transduced and differentiated as above were plated in U bottom 96 well dishes (Falcon, Catalog #353077) and stimulated with 1 ug/ml LPS. 12 hr after LPS stimulation, 40,000 Raji B cells expressing soluble cytosolic ovalbumin (Raji B-OVA) were added to the culture. 24 hr after Raji B-OVA cell addition, 50,000 OTI CD8 + T cells isolated from lymph nodes of OTI TCR transgenic mice using a CD8 +T cell purification kit (Stemcell, Catalog #19853) and labeled with e670 proliferation dye (Thermo, Catalog #65-0840-85) were added. 72 hr after OTI addition the percent of OTI cells divided was measured by eFluor670 signal using flow cytometry.</p></sec><sec id="s3-11"><title>Confocal imaging</title><p>All imaging in this study was performed using a spinning disk confocal microscope with environmental control (Nikon Ti-Eclipse inverted microscope with a Yokogawa spinning disk unit). For bead internalization assays, images were acquired using a 40 × 0.95 N/A air objective and unbiased live image acquisition was performed using the High Content Screening (HCS) Site Generator plugin in µManager<sup>3</sup>. Other images were acquired using either a 100 × 1.49 N/A oil immersion objective. All images were acquired using an Andor iXon EM-CCD camera. The open source µManager software package was used to control the microscope and acquire all images<sup>3</sup>.</p></sec><sec id="s3-12"><title>Quantification of whole cell internalization</title><p>20,000 J774A.1 macrophages were plated into 96-well glass bottom MatriPlate (Brooks, Catalog # MGB096-1-2-LG-L). Four hours prior to imaging, the macrophages were stimulated with 500 ng/ml LPS (Sigma, Catalog # L4516). Immediately prior to imaging the LPS-containing media was replaced with Fluobrite DMEM (ThermoFisher Scientific, Catalog # A1896701) containing 10% FBS. 40,000 Raji cells were added to the macrophages and the co-culture was imaged at 5 min intervals for 12 hr. For the antibody experiments, macrophages were washed into DMEM minus phenol red (A14430-01) containing 10% FBS just prior to addition of 40,000 Raji cells. Where indicated antibody was added to a final concentration of 20 µg/ml immediately after Raji cell addition and prior to imaging to limit antibody internalization. Because cells moved in and out of the field of view, we selected the cells present after 8 hr of imaging and quantified their B cell eating if they could be followed for four hours or more. Time-lapse analysis was essential to ensure that the B cell appeared viable prior to engulfment by the macrophage. Engulfment of B cells with an apoptotic morphology was not counted as a whole cell eating event.</p></sec><sec id="s3-13"><title>Quantification of bites internalization</title><p>During live cell image acquisition GFP-positive J774A.1 macrophages or NIH 3T3 cells were selected by the presence of GFP signal. A full z-stack comprising the entire cell was captured using 1 µm steps. All z sections were then manually inspected for internalized Raji B cell material. Cells containing one or more bites of fully internalized Raji B cell material &gt;1 µm in diameter were scored as positive.</p></sec><sec id="s3-14"><title>Liposome FRET assay</title><p>Experiments were carried out as previously described<sup>2</sup>. Briefly, proteins were purified using a bacterial expression system. All protein components (1 mg/ml BSA, 100 nM tSH2-Syk SNAP-505, 0 to 500 nM His10-CD3ζ or His10-FcRɣ intracellular chain, and 7.2 nM His10-Lck Y505F) were mixed into kinase buffer (50 mM HEPES-NaOH pH 6.8, 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, and 1 mM TCEP). Liposomes prepared at the following molar ratios: 74.5% POPC (Avanti, Catalog # 850457C), 10% DOGS-NTA (Nickel) (Avanti, Catalog # 790404C, 0.5% Rhodamine PE (Avanti, Catalog # 810150C), and 15% DOPS (Avanti, Catalog # 840035C) were added and the mixture was incubated for 40–60 min at room temperature, during which the SNAP-505 fluorescence was monitored at 8 s intervals with 504 nm excitation and 540 nm emission. 1 mM ATP was then injected to trigger Lck mediated phosphorylation of CD3ζ or FcRɣ. Injection was followed by 5 s of automatic shaking of the plate, and the fluorescence was further monitored at 8 s intervals for at least 1 hr. Data were normalized by setting the average fluorescence value of the last 10 data points before ATP addition as 100% and background fluorescence as 0%. The final extent of fluorescence quenching (% fluorescence change) at each concentration of receptor was determined using the average of the last 20 data points after ensuring fully equilibrated binding. Nine reactions containing increasing concentrations of CD3ζ and nine reactions containing increasing concentrations of FcRɣ were run in parallel. The final % fluorescence change was plotted against FcRɣ or CD3ζ concentration. The apparent dissociation constants (Kd) of tSH2-Syk to FcRɣ and CD3ζ were calculated by fitting the data with Graphpad Prism 6.0, using the ‘one site specific binding’ model.</p></sec><sec id="s3-15"><title>Protein expression, purification, and labeling</title><p>The intracellular portion of the FcR γ-chain (aa 45–85, Human FcRɣ, Uniprot FCERG_HUMAN) was cloned into a modified pET28a vector containing a His10 upstream to the multiple cloning site using BamHI and EcoRI. The intracellular portion of CD3ζ (aa 52–164, Human CD3ζ, Uniprot CD3Z_HUMAN) was also cloned into the His10 modified pET28a vector. A Lys-Cys-Lys-Lys sequence, originally present for fluorescent labeling, is also present between His10 and CD3ζ in this construct. SNAP-tSH2Syk (aa 1–262) was cloned into a pGEX6 vector using BamHI and EcoRI. His10-CD3ζ, His<sub>10</sub>-FcR γ-chain, and GST-SNAP-tSH2Syk were bacterially expressed in BL21 (DE3) RIPL strain of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> as described previously<sup>2</sup>. His<sub>10</sub>-Lck Y505F was expressed in SF9 cells using the Bac-to-Bac baculovirus system as described previously<sup>2</sup>. All cells were lysed in an Avestin Emulsiflex system. His<sub>10</sub> proteins were purified by using Ni-NTA agarose (Qiagen, Catalog # 30230) and GST-SNAP-tSH2Syk was purified by using glutathione-Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare, Catalog # 17075601) as described previously<sup>2</sup>. Soluble SNAP-tSH2 Syk was generated by cleaving the GST moiety via the PreScission Protease at 4°C overnight. All proteins were subjected to gel-filtration chromatography using a Superdex 200 10/300 GL column (GE Healthcare, Catalog # 17517501) in HEPES-buffered saline (HBS) containing 50 mM HEPES-NaOH (pH 6.8 for His<sub>10</sub>-CD3ζ, His<sub>10</sub>-FcR γ-chain, and GST-SNAP-tSH2Syk and pH 7.4 for His<sub>10</sub>-Lck Y505F), 150 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol, and 1 mM TCEP. The monomer fractions were pooled, frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C. All gel-filtered proteins were quantified by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining, using BSA as a standard. To prepare fluorescently labeled tSH2 Syk, 10 uM SNAP-tSH2 Syk was incubated at a 1:2 ratio with SNAP-Cell 505-Star (NEB, Catalog # S9103S) overnight at 4°C and run over a PD MiniTrap G-25 (GE Healthcare, Catalog # 28-9225-29 AB) column to eliminate excess dye.</p></sec><sec id="s3-16"><title>Phosphotyrosine and phalloidin staining</title><p>To fix and stain preparations described above in bead and bites assays for quantifying enrichment of phosphotyrosine staining, half the media (~150 µl) was gently removed from the imaging well and replaced with 150 µl 6.4% paraformaldehyde solution (prepared from 32% stock, Electron Microscopy Sciences, Catalog # 50980495) in tissue culture grade PBS, pH7.2 (Gibco, Catalog # 20012050).

After permeabilization, cells were washed 2 × 3 min with PFS solution. Following block, cells were incubated with 1:100 dilution of mouse anti-phosphotyrosine (pTyr) antibody to stain pan-pTyr (Santa Cruz, Catalog # PY20) diluted in PFS solution in the dark for 60 min at room temperature then washed 3 × 5 min in PFS solution. Washed cells were incubated with a 1:500 dilution of goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 647 antibody (Thermo/Molecular Probes, Catalog # A21236) in PFS solution in the dark for 60 min at room temperature. Wells were then washed 3 × 5 min in PFS solution. Cells were covered in 200 µl PBS. If not imaged immediately samples were wrapped in parafilm and foil and stored at 4°C prior to microscopy. Phosphotyrosine enrichment at the synapse was calculated by dividing the mean Alexa Fluor 647 signal of a 5 pixel linescan at the synapse with bead or cell by a 5 pixel linescan on the cortex. For phalloidin staining, cells were fixed with 4% PFA for 15 min at room temperature, blocked and permeabilized with 5% BSA in TBS with 0.5% triton X overnight, and incubated with AlexaFluor 647 Phalloidin (Thermo/Molecular Probes, Catalog # A22284) for 20 min.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Chimeric antigen receptors that trigger phagocytosis&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Jonathan Cooper as the Senior/Reviewing Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Dennis Discher (Reviewer #1); Adam Hoppe (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript describes engineering of chimeric receptors that when expressed in macrophages can enable target recognition of the CD19 or CD22 antigens and mediate phagocytosis and trogocytosis. The study works as a proof of principle showing a new effector function (phagocytosis) for chimeric antigen receptors in a new cell type (macrophages). Given the strong interest in cell-based immunotherapies such as chimeric antigen receptor-T cells this work will likely be of broad interest to the readership of <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The work is timely as it suggests a connection between adoptive transfer therapies using engineered immune cells (such as CAR-T therapy) and immunotherapy approaches using macrophages (as cited studies using blockade of the CD47-SIRPalpha axis). However, whether such a connection can be realized remains unclear as only macrophage cell lines were engineered and phagocytosis assays were all conducted in vitro. A possible route forward is suggested by the engineering of CAR-P bone marrow-derived dendritic cells in Figure 4—figure supplement 4, but bone marrow-derived macrophages or other primary sourced MPS cells should be considered. It should be relatively easy for the authors to obtain such cell types, engineer them, and test them.</p><p>2) The phagocytic response to B-cell targets appears relatively weak (e.g. 2-6 macrophage having internalized B-cells) and seems to strongly favor a trogocytic response (nearly 100% of the macrophages having internalized B-cell membrane). Perhaps this is unique to the cell lines (macrophages and B-cells) used in the study, but it raises the question how of how similar would these results be to ADCP mediated by IgG2a (murine) or IgG1 (human) anti-CD19 antibodies under the same conditions? To this end, the authors should compare the CAR-P response to that stimulated by antibody-opsonized particles and/or cell. CD19-coated particles should be treated with anti-CD19 antibodies and incubated with cells for phagocytosis. While the specificity of CAR-Ps could be advantageous, true specificity for the CAR-P target is unlikely since Fc-receptor mediated pathways remain in place. For example, in the authors' system, CD22-coated particles would likely be phagocytosed by anti-CD19 CAR-P cells in the presence of an anti-CD22 antibody.</p><p>3) (Optional) The work would be more impactful if the authors demonstrated successful phagocytosis with different CAR extracellular domains that target antigens on solid tumors. As stated in the Introduction, macrophages might offer the benefit of trafficking into solid tumors better than T cells, yet the examples in this manuscript are the standard B cell targets CD19 and CD22. Adding such studies would be beneficial, but may be best left for a follow up paper.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36688.022</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The work is timely as it suggests a connection between adoptive transfer therapies using engineered immune cells (such as CAR-T therapy) and immunotherapy approaches using macrophages (as cited studies using blockade of the CD47-SIRPalpha axis).

At the suggestion of the reviewers, we expressed the CAR-P<sup>FcRɣ</sup> in murine Bone Marrow Derived Macrophages (BMDMs). The BMDMs robustly engulfed CD19 beads and these data are now included in Figure 1. We feel that the discovery that CAR-P is transferrable to primary cells is a key new addition to the paper and we thank the reviewers for their suggestion to pursue this experiment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The phagocytic response to B-cell targets appears relatively weak (e.g. 2-6 macrophage having internalized B-cells) and seems to strongly favor a trogocytic response (nearly 100% of the macrophages having internalized B-cell membrane).

When we performed the bead size analysis presented in Figure 2B, we also included 10 µm beads coated in phosphatidylserine, the ligand for the endogenous Megf10, as a positive control. The phosphatidylserine beads also contained an integrin ligand, ICAM-1, to the beads to promote adhesion. We found that CAR-P macrophages internalized CD19-coated beads and phosphatidylserine beads to a similar degree. This data has been added to Figure 2B.</p><p>To address the reviewers’ question about whether opsonizing whole Raji cells with anti-CD19 antibodies would enhance whole cell eating we added a mouse anti-human CD19 IgG2a at a final concentration of 20 µg/ml. We found that this did not enhance whole cell internalization, indicating that the CAR-P system is not less efficient than the endogenous IgG system (Figure 4—figure supplement 3).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) (Optional) The work would be more impactful if the authors demonstrated successful phagocytosis with different CAR extracellular domains that target antigens on solid tumors.

However, because of the time required to develop and characterize new CARs and assay platforms we consider these experiments beyond the scope of the current work.</p></body></sub-article></article>
