Here, we show that in a yeast lineage (the <italic>Wickerhamiella</italic>/<italic>Starmerella</italic>, W/S clade) comprised of fructophilic species thriving in the high-sugar floral niche, the acquisition of fructophily is concurrent with a wider remodeling of central carbon metabolism. Coupling comparative genomics with biochemical and genetic approaches, we gathered ample evidence for the loss of alcoholic fermentation in an ancestor of the W/S clade and subsequent reinstatement through either horizontal acquisition of homologous bacterial genes or modification of a pre-existing yeast gene. An enzyme required for sucrose assimilation was also acquired from bacteria, suggesting that the genetic novelties identified in the W/S clade may be related to adaptation to the high-sugar environment. This work shows how even central carbon metabolism can be remodeled by a surge of HGT events.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33034.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cells build their components, such as the molecular machinery that helps them obtain energy from their environment, by following the instructions contained in genes. This genetic information is usually transferred from parents to offspring. Over the course of several generations, genes can accumulate small changes and the molecules they code for can acquire new roles: yet, this process is normally slow. However, certain organisms can also obtain completely new genes by ‘stealing’ them from other species. For example, yeasts, such as the ones used to make bread and beer, can take genes from nearby bacteria. This ‘horizontal gene transfer’ helps organisms to rapidly gain new characteristics, which is particularly useful if the environment changes quickly.</p><p>One way that yeasts get the energy they need is by breaking down sugars through a process called alcoholic fermentation. To do this, most yeast species prefer to use a sugar called glucose, but a small group of ‘fructophilic’ species instead favors a type of sugar known as fructose. Scientists do not know exactly how fructophilic yeasts came to be, but there is some evidence horizontal gene transfers may have been involved in the process.</p><p>Now, Gonçalves et al. have compared the genetic material of fructophilic yeasts with that of other groups of yeasts . Comparing genetic material helps scientists identify similarities and differences between species, and gives clues about why specific genetic features first evolved.</p><p>The experiments show that, early in their history, fructophilic yeasts lost the genes that allowed them to do alcoholic fermentation, probably since they could obtain energy in a different way. However, at a later point in time, these yeasts had to adapt to survive in flower nectar, an environment rich in sugar. They then favored fructose as their source of energy, possibly because this sugar can compensate more effectively for the absence of alcoholic fermentation. Later, the yeasts acquired a gene from nearby bacteria, which allowed them to do alcoholic fermentation again: this improved their ability to use the other sugars present in flower nectars.</p><p>When obtaining energy, yeasts and other organisms produce substances that are relevant to industry. Studying natural processes of evolution can help scientists understand how organisms can change the way they get their energy and adapt to new challenges. In turn, this helps to engineer yeasts into ‘cell factories’ that produce valuable chemicals in environmentally friendly and cost-effective ways.</p></abstract><kwd-group

genomics is a powerful tool for discovering links between phenotypes and genotypes within an evolutionary framework. While extraordinary progress in this respect has been observed in all domains of life, analyses of the rapidly increasing number of fungal genomes available has been particularly useful to highlight important aspects of eukaryotic genomes, including a broader scope of evolutionary mechanisms than was thus far deemed likely. For example, horizontal gene transfers (HGT) are thought to have played a very important role in domestication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gibbons et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Marsit et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Ropars et al., 2015</xref>) and in the evolution of metabolism in fungi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alexander et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Wisecaver and Rokas, 2015</xref>). Instances of the latter are best showcased by the high frequency of HGT events involving gene clusters related to fungal primary and secondary metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Campbell et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Khaldi and Wolfe, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Slot and Rokas, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Wisecaver and Rokas, 2015</xref>). When considering the horizontal transfer of single genes, those encoding nutrient transporters seem to be among the most frequently transferred (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Coelho et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gonçalves et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Richards, 2011</xref>). While the identification of HGT events can be straightforward given sufficient sampling of the lineages under study, inferences concerning the evolutionary driving forces behind HGT are often difficult and uncertain, because most HGT events identified are ancient. However, available evidence suggests that HGTs are often associated with rapid adaptation to new environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cheeseman et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gojković et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Qiu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Richards et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Richards and Talbot, 2013</xref>).</p><p>In line with these findings, we recently reported on the evolutionary history of a unique, high-capacity, specific fructose transporter, Ffz1, which is intimately associated with fructophilic metabolism in ascomycetous budding yeasts (subphylum Saccharomycotina) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gonçalves et al., 2016</xref>). Fructophily is a relatively rare trait that consists in the preference for fructose over other carbon sources, including glucose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Cabral et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gonçalves et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Sousa-Dias et al., 1996</xref>). The evolution of <italic>FFZ1</italic> involved the likely horizontal acquisition of the gene from filamentous fungi (subphylum Pezizomycotina) by the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of a lineage in the Saccharomycotina, composed so far entirely of fructophilic yeasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gonçalves et al., 2016</xref>). Most of the approximately one hundred species forming this clade (<italic>Wickerhamiella</italic> and <italic>Starmerella</italic> genera, as well as closely related <italic>Candida</italic> species), are associated with the floral niche and are often isolated from fructose-rich nectar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Canto et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">de Vega et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lachance et al., 2001</xref>). Interestingly, fructophilic lactic acid bacteria, whose metabolism has been dissected in detail, also populate the floral niche (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Endo et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Endo and Salminen, 2013</xref>). These bacteria have been shown to grow poorly on glucose, which can be at least partly explained by their lack of respiratory chain enzymes and alcohol dehydrogenase activity, deficiencies that hinder NAD<sup>+</sup> regeneration during growth on this sugar, as shown for <italic>Lactobacillus kunkei</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Maeno et al., 2016</xref>). In contrast to glucose, fructose can be used both as a carbon source and as an electron acceptor for the re-oxidation of NAD(P)H (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Zaunmüller et al., 2006</xref>), providing an explanation of why it is favored over glucose. Hence, fructophily in lactic acid bacteria seems to be linked to redox homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Endo et al., 2014</xref>). In yeasts, it is still unclear how preferential consumption of fructose may be beneficial, partly because unlike fructophilic bacteria, fructophilic yeasts grow vigorously on glucose when it is the only carbon and energy source available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Sousa-Dias et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Tofalo et al., 2012</xref>).

Our results suggest that the evolution of fructophily may have been part of a process of adaptation to sugar-rich environments, which included a profound remodeling of alcoholic fermentation involving the acquisition of bacterial alcohol dehydrogenases, which turned out to be particularly important for glucose metabolism, and an invertase, which is essential for sucrose assimilation. In general, we found a surge of bacterial-derived HGT events in the W/S clade when compared with other lineages in the Saccharomycotina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Marcet-Houben and Gabaldón, 2010</xref>), many of which seem to impact redox homeostasis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The horizontally transferred Ffz1 transporter is essential for fructophily in <italic>St. bombicola</italic></title><p>We previously reported the acquisition of a high-capacity fructose transporter (Ffz1) through HGT by the MRCA of W/S-clade species.

To help elucidate this and also taking into account the link found between Adh activity and fructophily in bacteria, we set out to expound putative functional differences between Adh xenologs found in the W/S clade and ‘native’ Adh enzymes. Specifically, we compared alcohol dehydrogenase (Adh) activity in three W/S-clade species, in the closely related yeast <italic>B. adeninivorans</italic>, and in the model species <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, as well as in a distantly related fructophilic yeast species <italic>Zygosaccharomyces kombuchaensis</italic>. All W/S-clade species tested were capable of using ethanol as carbon and energy source and have a Crabtree-negative behavior when growing on sugars, meaning that ethanol production in aerated batch cultures starts only when cell densities are very high,limiting oxygen availability (typically OD640 nm 30,~5–10 g/L ethanol in <italic>St. bombicola</italic>).</p><p>In all non-W/S-clade species tested, the characteristic NADH-dependent Adh activity was readily observed, but no NADPH-dependent Adh activity was detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A</xref>), in line with available information concerning yeast enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cho and Jeffries, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dashko et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ganzhorn et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Leskovac et al., 2002</xref>). Conversely, all W/S-clade species tested (<italic>St. bombicola</italic>, C. <italic>magnoliae</italic>, and <italic>St. bacillaris</italic>) exhibited Adh activity when either NADH or NADPH was added to the reaction mixture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2B</xref>). In fact, although both cofactors could be used for conversion of acetaldehyde into ethanol, there was a lower affinity for the substrate (higher K<sub>m</sub>) for NADPH-dependent activity in <italic>St. bombicola</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2C</xref>). Interestingly, in <italic>Acetobacter pasteurianus</italic> a bacterial species in the Acetobacteraceae, the same family as the likely donor of W/S-clade Adh1, alcohol dehydrogenase activity was found to be NADH-dependent, although it is unclear whether NADPH was also tested as a cofactor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Masud et al., 2011</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Genetic dissection of alcoholic fermentation in <italic>Starmerella bombicola</italic></title><p>In <italic>S. cerevisiae,</italic> the paralogous enzymes Adh1, Adh2, Adh3, and Adh5 were all shown to contribute to different degrees to the inter-conversion of ethanol and acetaldehyde in a NADH-dependent manner. Although their participation in alcoholic fermentation is not substantial, as may be inferred from the lack of detectable (NADP<sup>+</sup> dependent) activity in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> crude cell extracts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A</xref>), Adh6 and Adh7 can, in principle, also catalyze this type of reaction, using NADPH instead of NADH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">de Smidt et al., 2008</xref>). Since both <italic>ADH1-</italic> and <italic>ADH6-</italic>like genes are present in the genomes of all W/S-clade species studied, it was not clear which enzyme (Adh1-type or Adh6-type) was responsible for the NADPH-dependent inter-conversion of ethanol and acetaldehyde observed in W/S-clade species. To elucidate this, and to evaluate the impact of alcohol dehydrogenases on metabolism, three deletion mutants were constructed in <italic>St. bombicola (adh1∆</italic>, <italic>adh6a∆</italic>, and <italic>adh6b∆</italic>). During aerated growth, deletion of <italic>ADH1 (adh1∆</italic>) did not seem to significantly affect specific growth rates in glucose or fructose when compared to the wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3A</xref>). However, we noted a five-fold decrease in ethanol production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>) and the absence of growth on ethanol as sole carbon and energy source in the <italic>adh1</italic>∆ mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). Although some ethanol was produced, no Adh activity was detected in cell-free extracts of the <italic>adh1∆</italic> mutant when either NADH or NADPH was used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2E</xref>). These results suggest that Adh1 is the main enzyme used in alcoholic fermentation in <italic>St. bombicola</italic> and that it therefore likely accepts both NADH and NADPH as cofactors. We predicted that, if W/S-clade Adh1 enzymes were mainly used in the recycling of NADPH, which does not normally occur in yeasts, in its absence, compensation would be expected to occur in other NADP<sup>+</sup> regenerating reactions. If on the contrary, W/S-clade Adh1 enzymes were mainly used in the recycling of NADH, the compensatory increase of a NAD<sup>+</sup> producing reaction would be observed. In line with the cofactor preference measured in cell extracts, the significant decrease in ethanol yield seems to be counterbalanced by a concomitant increase in glycerol production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>), similarly to what has been observed in the <italic>S. cerevisiae adh1∆</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">de Smidt et al., 2012</xref>). Moreover, growth of the <italic>adh1∆</italic> mutant cultivated on identical growth medium but under limited aeration was severely affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3B</xref>). Taken together, these observations strongly suggest that Adh1 plays an important role in redox homeostasis, namely in NAD<sup>+</sup> regeneration in the absence of oxygen because, similarly to <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, glycerol formation in <italic>St. bombicola</italic> is probably a NAD<sup>+</sup> regenerating reaction. Consistent with this hypothesis, we did not detect NADP<sup>+</sup> dependent glycerol dehydrogenase activity in cell-free extracts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2D</xref>), and in at least one W/S-clade species, this reaction was shown to be NADH-dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Van Bogaert et al., 2008</xref>).

This means that, although some of the enzymes encoded by these genes might be involved in the production of ethanol in the absence of Adh1, when Adh1 is functional, they are not essential for ethanol metabolism and are probably mainly involved in other metabolic reactions. Finally, to ascertain how perturbations in alcoholic fermentation might affect the relative preference of <italic>St. bombicola</italic> for fructose over glucose, we monitored the consumption of both sugars in aerated cultures over time in the <italic>adh1∆, adh6a∆</italic>, and <italic>adh6b∆</italic> mutants. There was a significant decrease in sugar consumption rates in the <italic>adh1∆</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>), but fructophily was still observed in all mutants and became even more pronounced as the lack of Adh1 affected glucose consumption more than it did fructose consumption.</p><p>Orthologs of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Pdc1, which catalyzes the first step in the fermentative pathway, appeared to be absent in W/S-clade genomes. Since all W/S-clade species investigated produce ethanol, which requires prior decarboxylation of pyruvate to acetaldehyde, it follows that the role normally fulfilled by Pdc1 in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> must have been taken over by a different enzyme in W/S-clade yeasts. According to our phylogenetic analysis, the only candidate likely to assume this function would be the product of the <italic>ARO10</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). However, and although it displays some amino acid sequence similarity with Pdc1, <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Aro10 displayed extremely low affinity for pyruvate as a substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kneen et al., 2011</xref>). Therefore, to ascertain whether Aro10 is fulfilling a role in alcoholic fermentation in W/S-clade yeasts, an <italic>ARO10</italic> deletion mutant (<italic>aro10Δ</italic>) was constructed in <italic>St. bombicola</italic>. This mutant failed to produce ethanol, as might be expected in the complete absence of pyruvate decarboxylase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Similarly to the <italic>adh1Δ</italic> mutant, it exhibited increased glycerol production, but unlike the former, it grew considerably slower than the wild type strain in aerated conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). This decrease was probably mainly due to the fact that the absence of pyruvate decarboxylase activity affects other metabolic routes in addition to alcoholic fermentation, such as the production of acetate and acetoin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Flikweert et al., 1996</xref>). The phenotype observed in this mutant confirmed that Aro10 is the only decarboxylase involved in alcoholic fermentation in <italic>St. bombicola</italic> and that, therefore, the modification of enzymatic specificities was also involved in remodeling alcoholic fermentation in W/S-clade yeasts. Importantly, in the <italic>aro10</italic>∆ mutant, glucose consumption seems to be even more seriously affected than in the <italic>adh1Δ</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>) and, in fact, glucose was left all but untouched even after 120 hr of growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>), while fructose was almost totally consumed.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Identification of a yeast lineage devoid of an <italic>ADH1</italic> gene</title><p>The present study describes a series of evolutionary events affecting the genes involved in alcoholic fermentation in all the species studied so far in the W/S clade, a lineage of more than 100 species that is very distantly related to <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>.

More recently, we reported that fructophily was an important common trait that unified these species and others belonging to the W/S clade, and we also consubstantiated a strict correlation between the presence of the transporter Ffz1 and fructophily.

The stronger emphasis on the production of sugar alcohols as byproducts of metabolism at the expense of ethanol seemed also to be a common trait between the species examined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lee et al., 2003b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Ryu et al., 2000</xref>), which led us to hypothesize that the preference of these yeasts for fructose was likely to be part of a broader remodeling of metabolism connected to the adaptation to the high-sugar environments where these yeasts thrive. The present work reflects our effort to uncover other aspects of this adaptation using comparative genomics as a starting point.</p><p>Our examination of genes acquired from bacteria showed that the number of HGT events from bacteria into the W/S clade and its neighbor lineage (represented by the species <italic>C. infanticola</italic>), far exceeded the number of events reported for other Saccharomycotina lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Marcet-Houben and Gabaldón, 2010</xref>) and was also considerably higher than those we identified in two species closely related to, but phylogenetically clearly outside the W/S clade (<italic>Su. lignohabitans</italic> and <italic>B. adeninivorans</italic>). The largest number of HGT events was detected in the earliest-diverging species in the W/S clade, <italic>C. versatilis</italic>, which together with the phylogenetic signal in the genes that were acquired through HGT, suggests that a large surge of acquisitions probably occurred in the MRCA of the clade (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Under this model, most extant lineages subsequently discarded a large portion of the xenologs originally present in the common ancestor. In line with this hypothesis, it was possible to identify 52 xenolog ortholog groups that were present in at least two W/S-clade species. It seems likely that, in addition to HGT events common only to W/S-clade species, additional HGT events took place in the MRCA of <italic>C. infanticola</italic> and the W/S clade because, from the inspection of the phylogenies constructed for <italic>C. infanticola</italic>, at least six genes of apparent bacterial origin in this species also have bacterial origin in the W/S clade. While the bacterial donor lineage seems to be quite different between <italic>C. infanticola</italic> and the W/S clade for one gene (<italic>ADH1</italic>), strongly suggesting that they were acquired in separate events, the other five genes share a common ancestor, possibly pointing to a single event. As far as can be presently assessed from the output of our AI pipeline, the remaining HGT-derived genes seem to be specific to <italic>C. infanticola</italic>. In addition, we noted that the set of 52 xenologs present in at least two extant W/S-clade species is enriched for genes encoding proteins that affect redox balance in the cell. In fact, changes in fluxes through main metabolic pathways were previously shown to impact redox balance and oxidative stress in yeasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">González-Siso et al., 2009</xref>), which is consistent with our hypothesis that associates the acquisition of bacterial genes with adaptive changes in metabolism.</p><p>The most striking finding concerning the function of the transferred genes is the profound remodeling of the ubiquitous alcoholic fermentation pathway used by yeasts to convert pyruvate into ethanol with concomitant regeneration of NAD<sup>+</sup>. The first step of the pathway, consisting of the conversion of pyruvate to acetaldehyde, is normally catalyzed by the enzyme Pdc1. However, in most W/S-clade yeasts, Pdc1 is absent. Here, we provided genetic evidence for one W/S-clade species, <italic>St. bombicola,</italic> that the role of Pdc1 was taken over by a related decarboxylase encoded in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> by the <italic>ARO10</italic> gene. In <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, phenylpyruvate is the primary substrate of Aro10, which links this enzyme to amino acid catabolism, rather than alcoholic fermentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Romagnoli et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Vuralhan et al., 2005</xref>). However, it has been shown that site-directed mutagenesis of a few selected sites was capable of considerably increasing the affinity of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Aro10 for pyruvate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kneen et al., 2011</xref>), which supports the notion that this shift in substrate specificity may have occurred naturally in the course of evolution of W/S-clade yeasts. Intriguingly, <italic>C. versatilis</italic>, also lacks a native <italic>PDC1</italic> gene but possesses two genes of bacterial origin encoding <italic>PDC1</italic> orthologs, which coexist with <italic>ARO10.</italic> In this species, it is possible that the xenologs, and not <italic>ARO10</italic>, carry out the conversion of pyruvate into acetaldehyde.</p><p>The second step in alcoholic fermentation is the conversion of acetaldehyde into ethanol, which is conducted in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> mainly by Adh1. Again, ‘native’ <italic>ADH1</italic> genes were absent from all W/S-clade genomes examined, and it seems that the MRCA of the W/S clade acquired a bacterial <italic>ADH1</italic> gene, from which extant <italic>ADH1</italic> xenologs found in all extant W/S-clade species examined were derived. A similar occurrence was detected involving the loss of the ‘native’ <italic>ADH6</italic> ortholog, encoding a NADPH-dependent branched chain alcohol dehydrogenase and the acquisition of bacterial orthologs, although the bacterial donor lineages of the <italic>ADH1</italic> and <italic>ADH6</italic> xenologs seem to be distinct. We showed that, in <italic>St. bombicola</italic>, the <italic>ADH1</italic> xenolog is absolutely required for growth on ethanol and is also mainly responsible for alcoholic fermentation, thereby performing the functions fulfilled by two different enzymes in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (where Adh2 catalyzes ethanol assimilation). The two <italic>ADH6</italic> xenologs played a minor role, if any, in alcoholic fermentation, similarly to what happens in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>.</p><p>All our results are consistent with the hypothesis that alcoholic fermentation was first lost in an ancestral lineage and was subsequently reacquired by W/S-clade yeasts through horizontal acquisition of genes. In one instance, a pre-existing yeast gene (<italic>ARO10)</italic> also modified its enzymatic specificities to become involved in alcoholic fermentation. On the other hand, no evidence was found for the alternative hypothesis stating that acquisition preceded loss, such as the co-occurrence in the same genome of ‘native’ and bacterial Adh1 or a distinctive role for the bacterial enzyme in yeast metabolism, which might have driven the fixation of the bacterial version of Adh1. Loss and subsequent reacquisition of a metabolic pathway through multiple HGT events was reported previously for the unicellular red algae <italic>Galdieria phlegrea</italic> where massive gene loss occurred concomitantly with adaptation to a specialized niche in the common ancestor of Cyanidiophytina red algae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Qiu et al., 2013</xref>). The lines of evidence supporting a similar event for alcoholic fermentation in the W/S clade are threefold, as follows.</p><p>First, one key aspect backing the ‘loss followed by reacquisition’ hypothesis is the identification of a yeast lineage, here represented by <italic>C. galacta</italic>, which lacks an <italic>ADH1</italic> ortholog, either ‘native’ or bacterial. The species phylogeny presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> places this species close to <italic>C. infanticola,</italic> in a position consistent with our prediction for an extant representative of an Adh1- lineage pre-dating the acquisition of bacterial <italic>ADH1</italic> genes. In addition, the two genes forming the alcoholic fermentation pathway seem to have been lost in quick succession because no genome was found that possessed only ‘native ‘<italic>ADH1</italic> or only ‘native’ <italic>PDC1</italic> genes. This also strongly suggests that loss of the entire pathway pre-dated acquisition of new genes or functions.</p><p>While <italic>ADH1</italic> and <italic>ADH6</italic> xenologs persist in all extant W/S-clade species examined, bacterial <italic>PDC1</italic> xenologs, if they were indeed also acquired by the MRCA of the clade, were subsequently lost in most species. These hypothesized losses may have occurred as Aro10 evolved to fulfill the function of Pdc1. <italic>C. versatilis</italic>, which is the earliest-diverging species in the W/S clade, is a notable exception that possesses two <italic>PDC1</italic> xenologs in addition to <italic>ARO10</italic>. Hence, <italic>C. versatilis</italic> on the one hand, and the remaining W/S clade species on the other hand, seem to represent two distinct solutions restoring pyruvate decarboxylase activity, which is a second observation in line with gene loss being the ancestral event.</p><p>Our assessment of the performance of the Adh1 enzymes in W/S-clade species constitutes a third argument in favor of the ‘loss followed by reacquisition’ hypothesis. We showed that W/S-clade enzymes of bacterial origin possess a potentially advantageous characteristic when compared to their yeast counterparts; they are capable of regenerating both NAD<sup>+</sup> and NADP<sup>+</sup>, while the yeast enzymes accept only NADH as a cofactor. However, at least in <italic>St. bombicola</italic>, elimination of Adh1 was compensated by an increase in glycerol formation, which is very likely a NAD<sup>+</sup> regenerating reaction, and not of mannitol formation, which regenerates NADP<sup>+</sup>. It is therefore reasonable to infer that the Adh xenologs are playing a similar role to that normally fulfilled by the native Adh enzymes. Morever, complete elimination of alcoholic fermentation, as observed in the <italic>aro10Δ</italic> mutant, resulted in an even more pronounced compensation at the level of glycerol production.</p><p>In conclusion, given the evidence presented here, the presence of xenologs involved in alcoholic fermentation in extant W/S-clade yeasts can be best explained by the need to restore alcoholic fermentation in a lineage that had previously lost it. In this case, the involvement of bacterial genes seems to have been circumstantial and possibly a consequence of the availability of the donor in the same environment. The ecological opportunity for the horizontal exchange of genetic material underlying the acquisition of bacterial <italic>ADH1</italic> seems to have existed for a long time, since W/S-clade Adh1 proteins are most closely related to those of a bacterial lineage that is also frequently associated with the floral niche (Acetobacteraceae) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Iino et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Suzuki et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Tucker and Fukami, 2014</xref>).</p><p><italic>SUC2</italic> is also among the genes acquired by the MRCA of the W/S clade. Unlike the ‘native’ version of <italic>ADH1</italic>, which is ubiquitous in the Saccharomycotina except in the W/S clade, evolution of ‘native’ <italic>SUC2</italic> seems to be punctuated by multiple loss events resulting in a patchy extant distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carlson et al., 1985</xref>), which is probably linked to its role as a ‘social’ gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Sanchez and Gore, 2013</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, our results suggest the enticing hypothesis that the basis for fructophily arose in yeasts in a lineage devoid of alcoholic fermentation, but probably well equipped to use fructose as electron acceptor with concomitant production of mannitol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baek et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lee et al., 2003a</xref>), through the horizontal acquisition of the Ffz1 transporter that enabled the efficient utilization of fructose as carbon and energy source. Such a lineage would resemble the <italic>aro10∆</italic> mutant in that it would be unable to use glucose in high-sugar conditions. This putative ancestor might subsequently have acquired fermentative capacity to enable efficient glucose consumption and <italic>SUC2</italic> to permit the utilization of sucrose, thereby completing the set of tools required to use the sugars abundant in the floral niche.</p><p>In conclusion, our previous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gonçalves et al., 2016</xref>) and present results uncovered, to our knowledge for the first time, an instance of major remodeling of central carbon metabolism in fungi involving the horizontal acquisition of a multitude of genes mostly from bacteria. Thereby, fructophilic yeasts seem to have been able to overcome the inability to use glucose efficiently, as observed in extant fructophilic bacteria. As progress in the Y1000+ Project provides additional genomic information concerning species within and in the vicinity of the W/S clade, the improved phylogenetic resolution will hopefully help further extricate the complex pattern of acquisitions of genes.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type (species) <break/>or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Strain, strain background</td><td><italic>Starmerella bombicola</italic> PYCC 5882</td><td>Portuguese Yeast Culture Collection</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background</td><td><italic>Candida magnoliae</italic> PYCC 2903</td><td>Portuguese Yeast Culture Collection</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background</td><td><italic>Starmerella bacillaris</italic> PYCC 3044</td><td>Portuguese Yeast Culture Collection</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background</td><td><italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> PYCC 7186 (S288C)</td><td>Portuguese Yeast Culture Collection</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent (<italic>Starmerella bombicola</italic>)</td><td><italic>adh1</italic>∆ (<italic>adh1</italic>∆::<italic>HYG</italic>)</td><td>This paper</td><td/><td>Constructed as described in the materials and methods section; primers used are described in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig7sdata2">Figure 7—source data 2</xref></td></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent (<italic>Starmerella bombicola</italic>)</td><td><italic>aro10</italic>∆ (aro10∆::HYG)</td><td>This paper</td><td/><td>Constructed as described in the materials and methods section; primers used are described in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig7sdata2">Figure 7—source data 2</xref></td></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent (<italic>Starmerella bombicola</italic>)</td><td><italic>adh6a</italic>∆ (<italic>adh6a</italic>∆::<italic>HYG</italic>)</td><td>This paper</td><td/><td>Constructed as described in the materials and methods section; primers used are described in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig7sdata2">Figure 7—source data 2</xref></td></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent (<italic>Starmerella bombicola</italic>)</td><td><italic>adh6b</italic>∆ (<italic>adh6b</italic>∆::<italic>HYG</italic>)</td><td>This paper</td><td/><td>Constructed as described in the materials and methods section; primers used are described in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig7sdata2">Figure 7—source data 2</xref></td></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent (<italic>Starmerella bombicola</italic>)</td><td><italic>ffz1</italic>∆ (<italic>ffz1</italic>∆::<italic>HYG</italic>)</td><td>This paper</td><td/><td>Constructed as described in the materials and methods section; primers used are described in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig7sdata2">Figure 7—source data 2</xref></td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Strains</title><p>Yeast strains were obtained from PYCC (Portuguese Yeast Culture Collection, Caparica, Portugal) or NRRL (USDA ARS Culture Collection).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Patricia Wittkopp (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Bernard Dujon (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The importance of horizontal gene transfer to the evolution of eukaryotes is both underexplored and underappreciated. Here Gonçalves et al. show that components of carbon acquisition and utilization pathways have been replaced, in both sequence and function, by bacterial orthologs in fructophilic yeasts. The results described are an exciting contribution to the field.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers identified two significant matters requiring attention.</p><p>1) The title and the Abstract oversell the paper: this over-promising leaves the reader disappointed, rather than appreciative of the work. For example, the Abstract states that &quot;genes required for alcoholic fermentation were lost and subsequently re-acquired from bacteria through horizontal gene transfer&quot; and later indicates that the fermentation pathway was &quot;reinstated&quot;, implying that it was lost initially. However, the order of events cannot be established from the results presented. The authors make this clear in the Discussion, writing that &quot;the events leading to the observed profound remodeling of the alcoholic fermentation pathway in W/S-clade yeasts are impossible to trace with certainty because of their antiquity&quot;. The evidence required to establish this order – such as a genome without any version ADH1 – is not currently available. This is a shame, since had the authors been able to establish the order of events, the work would be of exceptional interest. Additionally, more evidence would be required to support the conclusion that the observed changes constitute adaptations to a sugar-rich environment as opposed to some other shared feature of the environments occupied by W/S-clade yeasts and not by their close relatives.</p><p>2) The narrative. The description of the results is difficult to follow and disorderly (different data sets, different comparisons, and with little guidance to the reader as to where the investigation is going). It would be helpful to lay out from the outset a plausible scenario for the evolution of fructophilic yeast and guide the reader so that s/he engages with the central hypothesis. Next, focus on lateral gene transfer of abilities associated with acquisition of fructose degradation. Report the candidates. Report the evolutionary analyses and the experimental data. Finally, having dealt with gain of new function, it would be appropriate to ask about the ancestral function. Avoid presenting the Results in chronological order: present the strongest results first followed by the secondary findings.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33034.033</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers identified two significant matters requiring attention.</p><p>1) The title and the Abstract oversell the paper: this over-promising leaves the reader disappointed, rather than appreciative of the work.

This pertinent criticism spurred us to review all aspects of the text. It also encouraged us to inspect genomic data concerning species close to the W/S clade generated very recently in the context of the Y1000+ project (https://y1000plus.wei.wisc.edu), and we were fortunate to find a species, <italic>Candida galacta</italic> that lacks any version of <italic>ADH1</italic>. As stated in the review report, this is very important evidence that further strengthens the “loss before acquisition” hypothesis. The finding of this genome was therefore included in the revised version and implied the inclusion of new authors.</p><p>In addition, we constructed a new <italic>St. bombicola</italic> mutant in which the <italic>ARO10</italic> gene was deleted. The inability of this mutant to produce ethanol provided experimental confirmation that <italic>PDC1</italic> was lost and that <italic>ARO10</italic> currently fulfills its role in alcoholic fermentation. Since our data also suggests that <italic>ADH1</italic> and <italic>PDC1</italic> were lost in quick succession, because no genome was found possessing either only “native” <italic>ADH1</italic> or only “native” <italic>PDC1</italic> alone, the case for an ancestral loss event is presently soundly supported.</p><p>The statement in the previous version quoted in the review report was modified to convey the message that the reconstruction of these kind of ancient events always carries some uncertainty, which was the original intention.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Additionally, more evidence would be required to support the conclusion that the observed changes constitute adaptations to a sugar-rich environment as opposed to some other shared feature of the environments occupied by W/S-clade yeasts and not by their close relatives.</p></disp-quote><p>We changed the title and Abstract accordingly. In the remainder of the text we do pinpoint the results consistent with adaptation to a sugar-rich environment, which we still consider to be the most likely driver of the unusual evolutionary events reported. The strong and clear phenotype observed for the <italic>aro10</italic> mutant allowed us to put forward an hypothesis stating how the various events may have contributed to improve sugar metabolism, which is now presented at the end of the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The narrative.

The order in which the results are presented and the titles within the Results section were also changed. In the revised version we used as a thread the comparison with fructophilic bacteria, to which we return throughout the entire manuscript, including a discussion on differences and similarities between the fructophilic bacteria and fructophilic yeasts.</p></body></sub-article></article>
