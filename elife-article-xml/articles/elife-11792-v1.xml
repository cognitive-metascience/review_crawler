prone to form inclusion bodies (IB). We report that in yeast, such IB formation is a factor-dependent process subjected to age-related decline. A genome-wide, high-content imaging approach, identified the E3 ubiquitin ligase, Ltn1 of the ribosome quality control complex (RQC) as a key factor required for IB formation, ubiquitination, and detoxification of model mHtt. The failure of <italic>ltn1∆</italic> cells to manage mHtt was traced to another RQC component, Tae2, and inappropriate control of heat shock transcription factor, Hsf1, activity. Moreover, super-resolution microscopy revealed that mHtt toxicity in RQC-deficient cells was accompanied by multiple mHtt aggregates altering actin cytoskeletal structures and retarding endocytosis. The data demonstrates that spatial sequestration of mHtt into IBs is policed by the RQC-Hsf1 regulatory system and that such compartmentalization, rather than ubiquitination, is key to mHtt detoxification.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.11792.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.11792.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11792.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Huntington’s disease is a neurological disease that is caused by mutations in the gene that encodes a protein called Htt. Individuals with this mutation gradually lose neurons as they age, resulting in declines in muscle coordination and mental abilities. The mutant Htt proteins tend to form clumps inside cells, but it is not clear if these clumps are the cause of the disease symptoms or whether they have a protective effect.</p><p>Yang et al. used yeast as a model to investigate whether the mutant Htt proteins need other molecules to allow them to form clumps. The experiments identified several new molecules that are required for mutated Htt to form clumps. Some of these are components of a system called the Ribosome Quality Control (RQC) complex, which monitors newly made proteins and labels abnormal ones for destruction. However, Yang et al.’s findings suggest that the RQC complex regulates the formation of Htt clumps through a different pathway involving a protein called heat shock factor 1. In this case, cells would need to fine-tune heat shock factor 1 activity to make mutant Htt proteins clump together to protect cells from damage.</p><p>Future experiments should expand Yang et al.’s findings to animal models of Huntington’s disease and identify which other molecules contribute to the formation of Htt clumps. One challenge will be to find out why older neurons fail to form clumps of Htt proteins, and whether this can be overcome by drugs that boost the activity of the molecules that Yang et al. identified.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.11792.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.11792.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>Huntington's disease</kwd><kwd>protein aggregation</kwd><kwd>Genome-wide screen</kwd><kwd>ribosome quality control complex</kwd><kwd>Hsf1</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Vetenskapsrådet</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2010-4609</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nyström</surname><given-names>Thomas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Vetenskapsrådet</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2015-04984</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Beidong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004063</institution-id><institution>Knut och Alice Wallenbergs Stiftelse</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Wallenberg Scholar</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nyström</surname><given-names>Thomas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Advanced Grant; QualiAge</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nyström</surname><given-names>Thomas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002794</institution-id><institution>Cancerfonden</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CAN 2015/406</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Beidong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Stiftelsen Olle Engkvist Byggmästare</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Beidong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Carl Tryggers Stiftelse för Vetenskaplig Forskning</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CTS 14: 295</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Beidong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000780</institution-id><institution>European Commission</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FP7/2007-2013</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Beidong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A genome-wide screen in yeast reveals that key proteins in ribosome quality control also regulate mutant Huntingtin aggregation and toxicity.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The Huntington disease (HD) is predominantly inherited, with a single gene, <italic>HTT</italic>, encoding the Huntingtin protein, at its origin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">MacDonald, 1993</xref>).

This approach was prompted also by our finding that the ability to form large and single mHtt103QP IBs was lost upon mother cell aging and the mHtt proteins accumulated instead in multiple, three or more smaller aggregates per cell, referred to as Class 3 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>; Class 1 cells contain one aggregate and Class 2 cells contain two aggregates). To identify trans-acting factors required for IB formation in an unbiased genome-wide manner, we used high content microscopy (HCM) and a galactose-regulated version of mHtt103QP, which we introduced into the ordered yeast deletion library (SGA-V2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tong, 2001</xref>) of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). Upon galactose-induction, mHtt103QP formed aggregates in about 50% of the cells within 180 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>) and 70% of these cells contain one large IB. HCM was used to identify mutants that formed multiple aggregates/oligomers rather than a big IB (Class 3 mutants; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>), which revealed that IB formation requires proteasome/chaperone and ubiquitination functions, Golgi-vesicle trafficking, mRNA transport/metabolism, and cell cycle control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f&amp;g</xref>, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref> for a list of confirmed mutants). Among these factors, Ltn1 and Rqc1 are especially interesting as they are both partners of the ribosome quality control complex (RQC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brandman et al., 2012</xref>) and Ltn1 is the yeast homologue of the E3 RING ubiquitin ligase Listerin of mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bengtson and Joazeiro, 2010</xref>), which reduced activity causes premature neurodegeneration in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chu et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Complementation analysis revealed that the ubiquitin E3 ligase activity of Ltn1 was required for both mHtt103QP IB formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>) and ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). It’s been reported that the absence of Ltn1, but not Rqc1, results in the failure to tag non-stop protein with ubiquitin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brandman et al., 2012</xref>). Contrasting such data on non-stop proteins, both Ltn1 and Rqc1-deficieny resulted in a failure of cells to tag also full-length mHtt103QP properly with ubiquitin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>) and to form IBs, even though the effect of <italic>rqc1∆</italic> was markedly smaller than <italic>ltn1∆</italic> on IB formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). Moreover, both soluble and aggregated mHtt103QP was stable in the absence and presence of Ltn1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>), and the levels of soluble and aggregated mHtt103QP was somewhat lower in <italic>ltn1∆</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplements 2 &amp; 4</xref>).

Moreover, overproducing a hyperactive Hsf1 (<italic>HSF1-R206S </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hou et al., 2013</xref>]) alone was sufficient to reduce IB formation, as was reducing Hsf1 activity using the <italic>hsf1-848</italic>(ts) allele (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>). demonstrating that maintaining a proper, intermediate, range of Hsf1 activity is required to efficiently sequester mHtt103QP into IBs. In support of this notion, a deletion in the C-terminal trans-activation domain of Hsf1 resulted in defects in IB formation that could not be further abrogated by an <italic>ltn1</italic> deletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>).</p><p>The mHtt103QP protein displays no obvious toxicity in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dehay and Bertolotti, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Duennwald et al., 2006</xref>) but we found that it became detrimental in the absence of Ltn1, and to a somewhat lesser extent, Rqc1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>), supporting the idea that IB formation protects the cell against Huntingtin toxicity.

Since the <italic>TAE2</italic> deletion did not restore mHtt103QP ubiquitination, we conclude that IB formation is more important than ubiquitination for the detoxification of mHtt103QP, at least in the yeast model system.

Consistent with small mHtt103QP aggregates/conformers being toxic, both overactive and diminished Hsf1 activity rendered mHtt103QP toxic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f&amp;g</xref>). Since the proline-less, intrinsically noxious, mHtt103Q protein requires the presence of the prion-forming protein Rnq1 to display cytotoxicity in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Meriin et al., 2002</xref>), we tested whether the toxicity of mHtt103QP in Ltn1-deficient also required the presence of Rnq1 and found that this was not the case (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>).</p><p>The small cytotoxic mHtt103Q aggregates have been shown to associate with the actin cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Song et al., 2014</xref>), and we, therefore, investigated if mHtt103QP in wild type and <italic>ltn1∆</italic> cells likewise interacted with and affected actin cytoskeletal structures. First, using co-staining with the misfolded protein Ubc9<sup>ts</sup>-mCherry, we confirmed that the mHtt103QP proteins of wild type cells were deposited in IBs adjacent to the Ubc9<sup>ts</sup>-associated insoluble-protein-deposit, IPOD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kaganovich et al., 2008</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>).

Moreover, the actin cytoskeleton appears to harness latent mHtt103QP toxicity as a screen for conditional <italic>ts</italic> mutations causing synthetic sickness/lethality with mHtt103QP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d&amp;e</xref>) revealed that cells carrying <italic>ts</italic> mutations in genes encoding actin itself (<italic>act1</italic>), profiling (<italic>pfy1</italic>) involved in actin polymerization, cofilin (<italic>cof1</italic>) regulating assembly/disassembly of actin filaments, Arp3 of the actin-nucleation center, Las17, an activator of Arp2/3 and actin assembly factors, and Mss4, a phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase involved in actin cytoskeleton organization, were drastically sensitized to mHtt103QP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d&amp;e</xref>, also see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 2</xref> for a list of alleles).

Both nascent chains and, for example, K12- and R12-arrested polypeptides are substrates for Ltn1-dependent ubiquitin tagging, which signal their destruction by the 26S proteasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bengtson and Joazeiro, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brandman et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Preissler et al., 2015</xref>). Herein, we report on another pivotal role of Ltn1 in protein quality control – detoxification of mutant Huntingtin through a Tae2/Hsf1-dependent sequestration of mHtt103QP into actin-associated inclusions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3h</xref>). As depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3h</xref>, the effect of Ltn1 on mHtt103QP aggregation appears to act through Tae2, which in turn is known to negatively control Hfs1 activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brandman et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, the presence of Tae2 is known to cause hyperactivation of Hsf1 when <italic>LTN1</italic> is deleted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brandman et al., 2012</xref>), which could be enough to inhibit IB formation. On the other hand, mutations reducing Hsf1 activity also inhibited IB formation suggesting that maintaining a proper, intermediate, range of Hsf1 activity is required to efficiently sequester mHtt103QP into IBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3h</xref>). In worms, elevated production of small heat shock proteins through Hsf1 activity has been shown to delay the onset of polyglutamine-expansion protein aggregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hsu, 2003</xref>) and reducing <italic>hsf-1</italic> activity accelerates aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hsu, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Morley and Morimoto, 2004</xref>).

The data presented here, however, demonstrate that both Hsf1 elevation and Hsf1 deficiency in cells expressing the Huntingtin disease protein is detrimental (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3h</xref>), suggesting, again, that a fine balance of Hsf1 activity has to be maintained to assuage proteotoxicity. This notion might explain why alterations in Hsf1 levels in mammalian cells have been shown to either inhibit mHtt IB formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fujimoto et al., 2005</xref>) or lower the concentration threshold at which HTT forms IB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bersuker et al., 2013</xref>). These results raise the question of whether age-dependent penetrance of HD could be due to a reduced Hsf1 activity in aging tissues or a malignant hyperactivation of Hsf1. The latter scenario could be the result of an age-dependent increase in translational processivity errors, which could titrate the RQC complex eliciting a Tae2-dependent activation of Hsf1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3h</xref>), possibly through Tae2-directed tagging of incomplete translation products with carboxyl-terminal Ala and Thr extensions. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shen et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>The exact mechanism behind Hsf1-dependent modulation of mHtt IB formation might be complex in that Hsf1 targets other genes than heat shock genes. It has been shown in worms that over-expression of hsf-1, with or without the C-terminal trans-activation domain, elevates the levels of pat-10, a troponin-like protein, that increase actin cytoskeleton integrity leading to lifespan extension and resistance to proteotoxic stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baird et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, it is possible that Hsf1 may regulate mHtt IB formation/toxicity in the yeast model system through the regulation of actin cytoskeleton dynamics since we found that mHtt103QP is associated with dense actin structures and that genes involved in actin dynamics are required to harness the latent toxicity of mHtt103QP. In addition, our data cannot rule out the possibility that the expression of mHtt in general raises proteostasis stress in the cell leading to Hsf1 activation and that such activation is epistatically affecting the effect of Ltn1-deficieny.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plasmids, yeast strains, and growth conditions</title><p>Plasmids and yeast strains used in each assay and figure were specified in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Supplementary file 3A and B</xref>.</p><p>Yeast cells were grown at 30°C if not specified, in YPD (BY4741 background), YPAD (W303 background) or corresponding synthetic drop-out media with antibiotics.

decision letter and accompanying author responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Spatial sequestration and detoxification of Huntingtin by the ribosome quality control complex&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been favorably evaluated by Naama Barkai (Senior editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Andrew Dillin, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>In this manuscript the authors investigate factors that influence the formation and toxicity of inclusion bodies (IB) formed upon expression of mutated Huntingtin protein (mHtt) with polyglutamine expansions in yeast. They identified components of the ribosome quality control complex (RQC), namely Ltn1, a ribosome-associated E3-ubiquitin ligase, together with Tae2 and the Hfs1, as key factors that affect IB formation and toxicity of mHtt. Loss of Ltn1 and Tae2 or a misregulation of Hsf1-activity provoked the formation of multiple mHtt aggregates instead of one large IB and a reduction in cell growth. In addition, using super-resolution microscopy, the authors showed that multiple and disperse mHtt aggregates alter the actin cytoskeleton and retard endocytosis processes.</p><p>While all three reviewers are excited about the work and its implications for the field, there are three major points that need to be addressed:</p><p>1) The ubiquitination experiments need to be performed with His-ubiquitin pull-down analysis from RQC deficient cells expressing mHtt.</p><p>2) Does Ltn1 deficiency cause abnormal actin cytoskeletal structures and reduced endocytosis independently of mHtt expression? How does their model fit with published data of Hsf1 and cytoskeletal dynamics?</p><p>3) The role of <italic>HSF1</italic> in this process could be direct as proposed, but also could be very indirect. It is suggested that the authors suggest alternative possibilities in their proposed models.</p><p>Finally, the idea that ribosomes could stall on repeat mRNAs, such as PolyQ containing, to elicit the RQC pathway is very interesting. All three reviewers feel that a direct demonstration of this stalling event on PolyQ mRNA would solidify the model, but we also felt that this might be a technically challenging experiment due to the repeat nature of the mRNA and alignment of the profile reads onto the correct message. Can the authors comment on the feasibility of this type of experiment?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>The dynamics and toxicity of PolyQ containing proteins is fascinating and not well understood. Here, the authors compare two forms of polyQ containing proteins (103Q) that differ by an internal proline region. The toxic form, lacking the P-rich region, forms small aggregates and the less toxic form, containing the P-rich domain forms a single large inclusion body. Asking if the IB formation is an active process, the group has screened for mutants that convert the IB into smaller bodies. The group focuses on Ltn1 and Rqc1 mutations, both of which have been identified for their role in ribosome associated protein quality control. Conversion of the smaller aggregates corresponds with increased toxicity and loss of Tae2, a downstream effector of Ltn1/Rqc1 suppresses both aggregate formation and toxicity.</p><p>One of the most interesting points of this work is the ability to accurately control toxic aggregate formation independent of ubiquitination of Htt. This is also the weakest point of the manuscript and few minor experiments will shore up the results. These include ubiquitin pull down experiments and probing for levels of Htt in the different mutant backgrounds.</p><p>Another interesting and unexpected finding is that loss of Tae2 in the Ltn1 mutant background restores IB formation and reduces toxicity. The main question to understand is whether the IB formed in the case is identical to the IB formed in the wild type setting (i.e. it is not ubiquitinated). It would excellent if solubility of the IBs could be measured (FRAP analysis for example). Also, are the IBs found in the ltn1 tae2 mutant also wrapped in actin cables?</p><p>Finally, the role of Hsf1 in this process is not fully detailed or alternative possibilities suggested. One thought to explain the dose dependency observed here could involve the idea that Hsf1 is a repressor of ltn1 or rqc1 expression. The analysis with the transactivation domain mutation of Hsf1 cannot address this possibility.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this interesting study the authors have identified components involved in inclusion body (IB) formation of polyglutamine expanded huntingtin fragments (mHtt) through a genome-wide screen in yeast. They find that the ribosomal quality control complex (RQC) proteins, Ltn1 and Rqc1, are associated with the spatial sequestration of mHtt proteins and proteotoxicity. RQC deficient cells no longer sequester mHtt into IBs and this is attributed to over-activation of the heat stress response.</p><p>General comments:</p><p>The authors have presented the surprising finding that RQC deficiency renders cells deficient in sequestering mHtt proteins into IBs. This effect correlates with toxicity. However, the current manuscript does not differentiate between a direct or indirect role of RQC components in IB formation. RQC deficient cells may have a general proteostasis impairment resulting in failure of the actin cytoskeleton to mediate IB formation. Such proteostasis impairment may not occur (or be less pronounced) in the <italic>TAE2</italic> deletion strain, consistent with the absence of <italic>HSF1</italic> activation in that strain (Brandman et al.). The finding that <italic>HSF1</italic> activation (or suppression) reduces IB formation independently of RQC deficiency could be merely correlative. These aspects should be discussed in more detail. Another important question relates to the interesting possibility that Ltn1 is directly involved in mHtt ubiquitination (also see below).</p><p>Specific comments:</p><p>1) Data quality of mHtt ubiquitination in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> should be improved.

Does synthesis of mHtt (103QP) cause an arrest in translation and thus activate the RQC? Do truncated mHtt products occur in the absence of Ltn1? Is Ltn1 perhaps recruited from the ribosome to the mHtt1 aggregates? Does expression of mHtt generally enhance stalling frequency? To address these points, the authors can investigate stalling of mHtt via Western Blotting by expressing an N-terminally tagged version of mHtt in the presence and absence of Ltn1.

In addition, using super-resolution microscopy, the authors showed that multiple and disperse mHtt aggregates alter the actin cytoskeleton and retard endocytosis processes. While all three reviewers are excited about the work and its implications for the field, there are three major points that need to be addressed: 1) The ubiquitination experiments need to be performed with His-ubiquitin pull-down analysis from RQC deficient cells expressing mHtt.</italic> </p><p>The pull-down experiment has been performed as suggested and the data further support our conclusions concerning mHtt103QP ubiquitination. Please see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>.</p><p><italic>2) Does Ltn1 deficiency cause abnormal actin cytoskeletal structures and reduced endocytosis independently of mHtt expression? How does their model fit with published data of Hsf1 and cytoskeletal dynamics?</italic> </p><p>We show that Ltn1 deficiency does not by itself cause abnormal actin cytoskeletal structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>) or reduce endocytosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>, the “vector” controls) but is rather epistatic to mHtt103QP expression.</p><p>We have added a discussion on, and reference to, the previously demonstrated role of Hsf1 in affecting actin cytoskeletal dynamics.</p><p><italic>3) The role of HSF1 in this process could be direct as proposed, but also could be very indirect. It is suggested that the authors suggest alternative possibilities in their proposed models.</italic> </p><p>We agree and have added a discussion on this as suggested.</p><p> <italic>Finally, the idea that ribosomes could stall on repeat mRNAs, such as PolyQ containing, to elicit the RQC pathway is very interesting. All three reviewers feel that a direct demonstration of this stalling event on PolyQ mRNA would solidify the model, but we also felt that this might be a technically challenging experiment due to the repeat nature of the mRNA and alignment of the profile reads onto the correct message. Can the authors comment on the feasibility of this type of experiment?</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewers on the technical difficulty of such experiments and even if possible, it would most likely take much too long to get working properly than would be possible for the revision time allotted. Note also that the data included show that normal-size mHtt103QP is ubiquitinated in an Ltn1-dependent manner suggesting that stalling and the generation of truncated mHtt104QP species is not an absolute requirement for Ub tagging of mHtt103QP.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1: One of the most interesting points of this work is the ability to accurately control toxic aggregate formation independent of ubiquitination of Htt. This is also the weakest point of the manuscript and few minor experiments will shore up the results. These include ubiquitin pull down experiments and probing for levels of Htt in the different mutant backgrounds.</italic> </p><p>We have now included this analysis and show that data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>. The data further supports our previous conclusion.</p><p><italic>Another interesting and unexpected finding is that loss of Tae2 in the Ltn1 mutant background restores IB formation and reduces toxicity. The main question to understand is whether the IB formed in the case is identical to the IB formed in the wild type setting (i.e. it is not ubiquitinated). It would excellent if solubility of the IBs could be measured (FRAP analysis for example). Also, are the IBs found in the ltn1 tae2 mutant also wrapped in actin cables?</italic> </p><p>We have performed this FRAP experiment as suggested and the data is included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>. We found that the dynamics/exchange within the IBs in <italic>ltn1Δtae2Δ</italic> double mutant (and the other mutants analyzed) are similar to those of Wt cells and that the IBs/aggregates co-localize with dense actin structure (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref>).</p><p><italic>Finally, the role of sf-1 in this process is not fully detailed or alternative possibilities suggested. One thought to explain the dose dependency observed here could involve the idea that hsf-1 is a repressor of lt.-1 or rqc1 expression. The analysis with the transactivation domain mutation of hsf-1 cannot address this possibility.</italic> We agree that the exact mechanistic role of Hsf1 in RQC-dependent IB formation is not clear and could include indirect effects and/or effects on regulating the levels and or activity of the RQC system. We have added comments related to this in the text. That Hsf1 would act as a repressor of <italic>LTN1</italic> cannot fully explain the results, however, as the suppression of the <italic>ltn1∆</italic> phenotype by a <italic>tae2</italic> deletion (reducing Hsf1 activity) occurs in cells lacking Ltn1.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2: General comments:</italic> </p><p> <italic>The authors have presented the surprising finding that RQC deficiency renders cells deficient in sequestering mHtt proteins into IBs. This effect correlates with toxicity. However, the current manuscript does not differentiate between a direct or indirect role of RQC components in IB formation. RQC deficient cells may have a general proteostasis impairment resulting in failure of the actin cytoskeleton to mediate IB formation. Such proteostasis impairment may not occur (or be less pronounced) in the TAE2 deletion strain, consistent with the absence of HSF1 activation in that strain (Brandman et al.). The finding that HSF1 activation (or suppression) reduces IB formation independently of RQC deficiency could be merely correlative. These aspects should be discussed in more detail. Another important question relates to the interesting possibility that Ltn1 is directly involved in mHtt ubiquitination (also see below). Specific comments:</italic> </p><p>1) Data quality of mHtt ubiquitination in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> should be improved.
