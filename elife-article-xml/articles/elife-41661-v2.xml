They reside in and interact with specialized tissue microenvironments (niches). Using murine hair follicle as a model, we show that when junctional perturbations in the niche disrupt barrier function, adjacent stem cells dramatically change their transcriptome independent of bacterial invasion and become capable of directly signaling to and recruiting immune cells. Additionally, these stem cells elevate cell cycle transcripts which reduce their quiescence threshold, enabling them to selectively proliferate within this microenvironment of immune distress cues. However, rather than mobilizing to fuel new tissue regeneration, these ectopically proliferative stem cells remain within their niche to contain the breach. Together, our findings expose a potential communication relay system that operates from the niche to the stem cells to the immune system and back. The repurposing of proliferation by these stem cells patch the breached barrier, stoke the immune response and restore niche integrity.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.41661.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Most, if not all, tissues of an adult animal contain stem cells.

For example, cells and molecules within these niches can signal stem cells to remain in a ‘dormant’ state, but upon injury, they can mobilize stem cells to form new tissue and repair the wound.

Every hair follicle contains a niche (the ‘bulge’), where these stem cells live and share their environment with cells that anchor the hair.

Lay et al. removed one of the adhesion molecules called E-cadherin, which caused a breach in the niche’s barrier.</p><p>The stem cells sensed their damaged niche, prepared to multiply, and sent out stress signals to the immune system. The immune cells then arrived at the niche and sent signals back to the stem cells, prodding them to multiply and patch the barrier, while at the same time, keeping the inflammation in check.

They are endowed with the ability to self-renew long-term and differentiate into specialized cell lineages in order to maintain, renew and repair tissues. In turn, stem cells are heavily influenced by the tissue microenvironment in which they reside. Together, the tight interaction and cooperativity between stem cells and their niche allow stem cells to perform their critical task of maintaining tissue homeostasis and function throughout the lifetime of the organism.</p><p>To date, most studies on the niche have focused on the various factors it secretes to control stem cell behavior during normal homeostasis. These factors include both positive and negative signals emanating from a diverse array of niche cells, including stromal cells, blood vessels, nerves and stem cell progeny (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Asada et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hsu et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yu and Scadden, 2016</xref>). Far less is known about how stem cells cope with perturbations in niche integrity and orchestrate responses to restore niche homeostasis. For epithelial tissue stem cells, this is particularly important, as they must respond quickly to and repair a breach in their epithelial barrier that excludes harmful microbes and retains essential fluids.</p><p>In the current study, we tackle this problem by taking advantage of the relatively simple architecture of the hair follicle (HF) bulge, the niche in which stem cells of the HF reside (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cotsarelis et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hsu et al., 2014a</xref>). The main part of the bulge is bilayered. It consists of a single concentric layer of stem cells that is sandwiched between a basement membrane on the outer side and a layer of terminally differentiated epithelial barrier ‘niche’ cells on the inner side. These ‘inner bulge’ niche cells are exposed to the external environment through an open channel that enables the hair to protrude from the skin surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The cells derive from the stem cells, but they do not do so directly within the bulge. Rather, the barrier cells are generated late in the terminal differentiation pathway of stem cell progeny that produce the new hair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hsu et al., 2011</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.41661.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Adherens junctions in the niche but not its stem cells are affected by E-cadherin depletion.</title><p>Images are from whole-mount immunofluorescence microscopy; DAPI (blue) marks chromatin.

In between episodic cycles of hair growth, the bulge exists in a resting state (‘telogen’), anchoring the hair made in the previous hair cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). At the bulge base (‘hair germ’), quiescent stem cells interact with a specialized underlying mesenchymal structure, called the dermal papilla (DP). This cross-talk is necessary to yield a threshold of activating factors (BMP inhibitors, WNTs) that launch a new hair cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hsu et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Stem cells tether to their inner bulge niche through cadherins, the core transmembrane components of adherens junctions (AJs), which coordinate intercellular adhesion, junctional integrity and proliferation in epithelial tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Stepniak et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Takeichi, 2014</xref>). AJs also stabilize tight junctions, which prevent passage of bacteria and other entities across an epithelial sheet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rübsam et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tunggal et al., 2005</xref>). While bulge stem cells express both E- and P-cadherin, we discovered that the inner bulge niche expresses only E-cadherin.</p><p>Here, we report that selective loss of E-cadherin within the inner bulge niche triggers a barrier breach that results in microbial invasion. We show that breached niche cells elevate an adhesive and cytoskeletal transcriptome. By contrast, the resident stem cells, which are normally quiescent, begin to proliferate in a fashion that we show is independent of microbial influence. Strikingly, they also activate a transcriptome that, when compared to proliferating anagen-phase stem cells in a normal niche, is similar in cell cycle genes, but differs in a cohort of immune-signaling genes. Moreover, although the cell cycle transcriptome lowers their threshold for quiescence, pushing them into proliferation requires this additional facet of the immune-signaling transcriptome. Indeed, the myriad of chemo-attractants, cytokines and growth factors induced by these stem cells when they experience a damaged niche is required to recruit immune cells into this otherwise purportedly ‘immune privileged’ site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Meyer et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Paus and Bertolini, 2013</xref>). The outcome of this atypical two-pronged path to stem cell proliferation, namely enhanced immune signaling and cell cycling, is a repurposing of new daughter stem cells from their normal task of tissue regeneration and towards patching the breached barrier.</p><p>Our findings have strong relevance to a breadth of human skin conditions where progenitor cell proliferation is coupled to barrier breach. Our data reveal that stem cells have the potential to sense defects in the integrity of their niche and respond by activating two branches of a transcriptional program, which together cope with the compromised tissue function surrounding them. Additionally and importantly, we show that the niche is not merely a source of secreted factors that control stem cell activity and tissue growth. Rather, it is a key structural entity whose integrity is closely monitored by its vigilant stem cell residents.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>E-cadherin is critical for adherens junction formation in the inner bulge niche but not in the stem cells</title><p>We became interested in the possibility that cadherins may function critically in HF stem cell niche integrity when we analyzed bulge cadherin expression during the extended, synchronized telogen phase of the second hair cycle in mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). E-cadherin localized to most epithelial cell-cell boundaries, displaying the strongest immuno-labeling at the interface between niche cells and stem cells. Conversely, P-cadherin specifically concentrated at stem cell intercellular junctions and was absent from niche cells. This was consistent with the ~20X higher <italic>Cdh3</italic> transcript level in the stem cells versus niche cells. Indeed, as judged by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) on protein lysates of bulge stem cells [purified by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) of skin cell suspensions], P-cadherin levels were even higher than E-cadherin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>). As expected from our expression data and the functional redundancy of these cadherins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tinkle et al., 2008</xref>), P-cadherin (<italic>Cdh3</italic>) null mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Radice et al., 1997</xref>) displayed a normal hair coat and hair cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). E-cadherin was maintained at all cell-cell junctions within the P-cadherin depleted bulge, and hair germ cells became proliferative on cue during early anagen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). To explore the functional consequences of E-cadherin loss of function (loss of function) in the bulge, we conditionally ablated its gene (<italic>Cdh1</italic>) in <italic>Cdh1<sup>fl/fl</sup>; Rosa26<sup>lox-STOP-lox-YFP</sup></italic> reporter mice by using a tamoxifen (TAM)-inducible CreER knocked into the endogenous locus of <italic>Sox9</italic>. By inducing <italic>Cdh1</italic> ablation near the beginning of 2<sup>nd</sup> telogen (postnatal day P50), E-cadherin was efficiently depleted throughout the bulge when analyzed 3 weeks later (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p><p><italic>Cdh1-</italic>null HF stem cells continued to display AJs along stem cell-stem cell borders, reflective of P-cadherin compensation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A and B</xref>). In fact, by immunoblot analyses and quantifications of proteins from FACS-purified α6<sup>+</sup>CD34<sup>+</sup> HF stem cells, P-cadherin levels in E-cadherin deficient HF stem cells were even higher than normal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>), a feature confirmed by knocking down <italic>Cdh1</italic> transcripts through shRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D</xref>).</p><p>By contrast, the <italic>Cdh1-</italic>null inner bulge layer lacked P-cadherin and in turn AJs on all cell-cell borders (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Since AJ formation requires intercellular cadherin-cadherin binding, this also left the stem cell-niche interface devoid of AJs. This was best exemplified by the paucity of p120-catenin at this interface (arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).

Indeed, closer inspection of individual genes within this and related immune cell categories of the niche transcriptome revealed that levels of these niche transcripts were often considerably lower and less significant than in their stem cell neighbors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). By contrast, of the cytokine and chemokine genes that were highly changed in the stem cell transcriptome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), most were substantially more highly expressed by these stem cells than their <italic>Cdh1</italic>-null niche neighbors, even when the stem cells surrounding a <italic>Cdh1</italic>-null inner bulge niche were wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>).</p><p><italic>Ccl1</italic> and <italic>Ccl2</italic> were the top two most highly upregulated genes in this stem cell cohort (184X, 38X; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), and like most of this transcriptome, were barely expressed by the neighboring breached niche. Notably, CCL1 and CCL2 are established chemokines for both DCs and macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cantor and Haskins, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gombert et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Li and Tai, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Moser et al., 2004</xref>). Importantly, not only were <italic>Ccl1, Ccl2</italic> and many other features of these signatures robustly expressed by the HF stem cells experiencing a breached niche, but this response still occurred even when microbial infiltration was repressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>). This suggested that the stem cells recruited immune cells in direct response to the damaged niche rather than the bacteria that infiltrated.</p><p>Since CCL2 is an established chemokine for the CCR2 receptor, expressed by both DCs and macrophages, we focused first on the potential interactions between stem cells and these immune cells. To mimic the damaged niche microenvironment in vitro, we used <italic>Cdh1</italic>-null HF stem cells, which retained elevated <italic>Ccl2</italic> in culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1H</xref>). We then tested their ability against WT HF stem cells to recruit bone marrow-derived DCs and macrophages in transwell migration assays. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I,</xref> a significant increase occurred in chemotaxis of bone marrow-derived DCs. Moreover, this difference was abolished when we used DCs that lacked CCR2. On the other hand, while the migration of macrophages in response to <italic>Cdh1</italic>-null HF stem cells followed a similar trend, the difference was highly variable and thus not statistically significant. Strikingly, these in vitro patterns of DC and macrophage migration were consistent with our in vivo immune cell profiling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), and revealed that <italic>Cdh1-</italic>null but not WT stem cells can directly attract DCs, and to a lesser extent macrophages, through a CCL2-CCR2-dependent mechanism.</p><p>Conversely, CCL1 stimulates CCR8 receptors, which are on the surface of DCs and macrophages. To test the significance of HF stem cell CCL1, we repeated the cell migration assays as above, this time using a CCR8 blocking antibody to disrupt a potential CCL1-CCR8 interaction. Interestingly, while the reduction in chemotactic response of DCs and macrophages was not as robust as blocking the CCL2-CCR2 axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J</xref>), treatment of <italic>CCR2</italic>-null DCs or macrophages with CCR8 blocking antibody to simultaneously block both CCL1 and CCL2-mediated chemotaxis further reduced their migration to statistically significant levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref>). These findings were important as they indicated that HF stem cells experiencing a barrier breach in their niche can activate chemokines and directly recruit the immune cells that we see elevated upon a barrier breach. Why DC recruitment in vivo appeared to be more consistent than macrophage recruitment is not clear. However, it is notable that DCs and macrophages respond to similar chemokines during recruitment, and depending upon the particular cytokine milieu, differentiation of inflammatory monocytes can be skewed to DCs or macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Geissmann et al., 2010</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Stem cell proliferation and bulge hyperthickening arise from immune cell stimulation</title><p>We next addressed whether immune cells are required to trigger the stem cell proliferation that generated a thickened bulge.

Significantly, Dex-treated <italic>Cdh1</italic> cKO HFs also displayed normal bulge architecture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Accordingly, both the telogen-phase proliferation displayed by stem cells in their deficient niche, and the concomitant increase in stem cell numbers, were now abolished. This was further reflected by the enhanced BMP-signaling effector phosphorylated-SMAD1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>), which in normal stem cells only diminishes in Anagen II/III when the natural activating cues override BMP quiescence signals from the inner bulge niche (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hsu et al., 2014b</xref>). That said, even in the absence of Dex, there were still signs that the normal telogen signals were intact in the <italic>Cdh1-</italic>null bulge. Thus, inner bulge-derived BMP6, a prerequisite for these pSMAD1 signaling dynamics, was still expressed by the <italic>Cdh1-</italic>null inner bulge cells, and correspondingly, the HF stem cells experiencing the breached niche still expressed BMP target genes, including <italic>Nfatc1</italic> and <italic>Foxc1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>).</p><p>Since ablating only one immune component can have a profound effect on the remaining immune cell repertoire, it was necessary to use total immune cell suppression, rather than genetic ablation of specific immune cell populations. Although Dex impacts full-anagen phase HFs by inducing their early entry into the destructive phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kwack et al., 2017</xref>), our study focused on telogen, where no adverse effects of Dex had been reported. However, it was important to assess whether it was suppression of the immune response or Dex itself that was impacting stem cell proliferation.</p><p>As shown in the growth curves in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, Dex alone did not inhibit HF stem cell proliferation directly. Moreover, bacteria were still present in immunosuppressed skin, arguing against their involvement in the proliferation dynamics observed here (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>). This finding also added to the evidence that the microbial infiltration arose from the loss of junctional integrity within the <italic>Cdh1-</italic>null niche, and not from the associated architectural disturbances caused by stem cell proliferation in the <italic>Cdh1-</italic>null niche.</p><p>Given these collective results, we focused on immune cell infiltration as the root of stem cell proliferation and expanded bulge structure. Thus far, our immune analyses indicated that DCs and Tregs were elevated prominently and specifically around the breached barrier (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Closer inspection revealed that DCs and Tregs were closely associated with each other when surrounding the breached niche, and Dex treatment markedly blocked their infiltration into the <italic>Cdh1-</italic>null bulge niche (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Moreover, the immunosuppressive effects of Dex appeared to be specific for the immune infiltration to the bulge, as immune cells elsewhere in the skin remained during the Dex treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). In this regard, the Dex-treated <italic>Cdh1-</italic>cKO pattern of CD3+ and MHCII+ immune cells resembled that of untreated control skin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p><p>Since Dex blocked immune infiltration into the breached niche, and since immune infiltration was essential for the specific proliferation of bulge stem cells that we observed, we turned to in vitro studies to address whether DCs or Tregs might directly affect HF stem cell proliferation. For this purpose, we purified and activated DCs as before (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I and J</xref>), and employed established protocols (see Materials and methods) to stimulate freshly isolated splenic naïve CD4+ T cells with CD3/CD28 antibodies (conventional T cells; Tconv). For Treg induction, we also added TGFβ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fantini et al., 2007</xref>). By compartmentalizing the immune cells, we then assessed the effects of their secreted factors on the proliferation of HF stem cells. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>, while DCs showed no appreciable effect on HF stem cells, Tregs appeared to be particularly robust in soliciting a proliferative response. In wild-type skin, resident Tregs, which are positive for NOTCH ligand JAG1, have been proposed to promote HF stem cell proliferation through direct engagement and activation of Notch target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ali et al., 2017</xref>). If so, we might have expected to see an elevation of Notch target genes in the stem cells of the <italic>Cdh1</italic> null bulge, given the marked elevation of Tregs within close proximity. That said, the most striking canonical NOTCH target gene showing sensitivity to dexamethasone was <italic>Hey1,</italic> and in this case, transcripts were up, rather than down when the Treg swarm was diminished (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A</xref>). We also examined the status of a cohort of HF stem cell genes reported to bind activated NOTCH in a ChIP-seq analysis of a muscle cell line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Castel et al., 2013</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Indeed, most of these and established NOTCH target genes were very lowly expressed in normal telogen phase HF stem cells, consistent with the well-documented role for NOTCH signaling in HF differentiation, rather than bulge stem cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Demehri and Kopan, 2009</xref>). Importantly, NOTCH target genes were not elevated appreciably in HF stem cells when the niche barrier was altered and swarmed with Tregs. Rather, we surmise that Tregs’ proliferative effects that we observed on HF stem cells here are more likely to be rooted in amphiregulin and/or keratinocyte growth factor, known to be robustly expressed by Tregs in an inflammatory setting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arpaia et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dial et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Similarly, in some contexts, the tension sensor YAP, is retained by α-catenin in the cytoplasm and becomes nuclear upon a loss of adherens junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Li et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Neto et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Schlegelmilch et al., 2011</xref>), leading to a marked increase in target genes of the YAP/TEAD transcription factor complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Liu and Wang, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zanconato et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zhang et al., 2011</xref>). Since the telogen-phase HF stem cells in a <italic>Cdh1-</italic>mutant niche were proliferative, and YAP is known to influence proliferation, the elevation in <italic>Ccne1</italic> and other YAP target genes governing proliferation seemed at first glance to suggest altered YAP activity. However, Dex treatment largely normalized these cell cycle-related differences, and most other YAP target genes showed no major changes in expression irrespective of immune suppression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2C</xref>). In the absence of expression changes attributable to <italic>Cdh1</italic> status, and given the multiple alternative and possibly confounding means by which YAP is known to be regulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Deng et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Totaro et al., 2018</xref>), we did not pursue this further.</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>The stem cell signature depends upon the breached barrier</title><p>Finally, to identify the portion of the stem cell transcriptome signature that is independent of immune cell infiltration, we performed RNA-seq on stem cells isolated from Dex-treated <italic>Cdh1-</italic>null and control bulges of telogen-phase HFs and compared their transcriptomes to their non-treated counterparts.

Previously, we showed that when p120-catenin (<italic>Ctnnd1</italic>) is conditionally ablated in skin epithelia, IkB kinase (IKK) activity is elevated, resulting in the phosphorylation of IkBα and the release of the transcription factor NFkB into the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Perez-Moreno et al., 2006</xref>). Intriguingly, by immunofluorescence, NFkB showed nuclear localization in telogen-phase <italic>Cdh1-</italic>null HF stem cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>), which also had reduced p120 levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>).

While further details are beyond the scope of the present study, our results suggest a mechanism whereby when the barrier is breached, reductions in adherens junctions impacts the activity of transcription factors such as NFkB, that can directly alter the transcriptional landscape of the HF stem cells in a way that promotes immune cell recruitment, and reduces, but does not overcome, the threshold for proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2D</xref>).</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.41661.018</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Model Summarizing How Stem Cells Respond to a Breach in Their Niche Barrier and Launch a Patch Process by Repurposing Stem Cell Proliferation.</title><p>During telogen, inner bulge niche cells express BMP6 and FGF18, which maintain stem cell quiescence. When the sole cadherin (ECAD) of the inner bulge is removed, the niche cannot make adherens junctions (AJs), leading to tight junction destabilization, a barrier breach and microbial infiltration. Even though stem cells have compensatory PCAD and maintain stem cell-stem cell AJs, they cannot form AJs along the niche-stem cell interface. This reduction in AJ components induces a cell cycle transcriptome which lowers the threshold for proliferation, but is kept in check by niche inhibitory signals. Within their breached niche, stem cells also induce a transcriptome geared towards recruiting immune cells to the bulge, independent of the increased bacterial load. The stem cells need this altered microenvironment to tip their proliferative balance. Without anagen cues, newly generated stem cells remain within the bulge, where they are repurposed to boost the output of distress signals to the immune system and contain the breached barrier by reinforcing the bulge with layers of immune cells and stem cells that display intact cellular junctions.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-41661-fig8-v2.tif"/></fig></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>The bulge niche functions as a barrier to protect its stem cells</title><p>The most important function of the skin epithelium is to provide the barrier that excludes harmful microbes and retains body fluids. When the barrier is breached, it must be repaired expeditiously to restore fitness to the animal. HFs extend deep into the skin, leaving an entry site for pathogens. The bulge niche of HF stem cells is strategically positioned at the base of this orifice that opens to the external environment. In our current study, we show that in addition to its role as a source of inhibitory signals for its stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hsu et al., 2011</xref>), the inner bulge provides the barrier that protects stem cells from microbial invasion.</p><p>In exploring how stem cells cope when their barrier is breached, we learned that by co-expressing P- and E-cadherin, the stem cells themselves are protected from the many situations where E-cadherin levels are naturally downregulated, which includes stem cell activation at the start of the hair cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lay et al., 2016</xref>). Our new data substantiates this further, as when E-cadherin is lost from HF stem cells, they markedly upregulate P-cadherin.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Stem cells respond to a breach in their niche’s integrity by communicating it to the immune system</title><p>Through their immediate proximity to the inner bulge layer, the HF stem cells are poised to sense a barrier breach. Remarkably, our studies revealed that neither bacteria nor immune cells were required for this sensing to occur. Although the precise details await further investigation, the roots are likely to reside in the inability of stem cells to form adherens junctions with their <italic>Cdh1-</italic>null niche neighbors, which lack a cadherin backup system. As our data revealed, intercellular cadherin-cadherin junctions are featured prominently at the stem cell-niche interface of healthy HF bulges. Such junctions are known to act as key signaling centers and integrators of proliferation, polarity and the actin cytoskeleton across an epithelial tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Padmanabhan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Stepniak et al., 2009</xref>), and our current findings add to the mounting evidence that these junctions also serve as key regulators of inflammatory sensors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Perez-Moreno et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>As we learned, once stem cells face a breach in their niche barrier, they trigger a distress transcriptional program that we show occurs even in the face of antibiotics or immune suppressive drugs and is strikingly different from the response elicited in the neighboring niche cells. Our findings are interesting in light of prior studies showing that under a number of different conditions, keratinocytes can express cytokines and chemokines that harbor potential to communicate with the immune system in normal homeostasis and in injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adachi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ali et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pasparakis et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zhang et al., 2004</xref>). Of additional relevance to our study are previous observations that hair plucking enhances hair cycling, an effect which has been postulated on the one hand to be triggered by the loss of the BMP-expressing inner bulge niche cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hsu et al., 2011</xref>) but on the other hand to an elevation of <italic>Ccl2</italic> and inflammatory macrophages in the skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>While intriguing, none of these prior studies have revealed whether stem cells are specifically capable of altering their transcriptional program in response to perturbations in their microenvironment and if they can, whether this endows them with the ability to adjust their behavior by directly recruiting immune cells. Notably, <italic>Ccl2</italic> was also at the top of our changed genes, along with related <italic>Ccl1,</italic> underscoring their sensitivity to skin perturbations, and tracing their expression to stem cells. However, in our system, when the entire immune repertoire was analyzed and quantified relative to bulge proximity, DCs were among the most consistently changed early immune respondents. Like M1 macrophages, DCs have surface receptors that respond to CCL1/2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gombert et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Moser et al., 2004</xref>). Moreover, by in vitro co-culture and genetic targeting of the corresponding DC-CCL receptors, we showed that DCs use this crosstalk with HF stem cells to specifically congregate around the bulge. In this case, however, recruitment of DCs and (more variably) macrophages did not trigger a new hair cycle, pointing to a major difference between disrupting the barrier function of the BMP6-expressing inner niche layer and removing this layer altogether as in hair plucking which does initiate a new hair cycle.</p><p>During normal epithelial homeostasis, resident DCs can dialogue with Tregs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Leventhal et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Seneschal et al., 2012</xref>), and thus may also be capable on their own to shape the adaptive immune response that swarmed the damaged niche. Although our co-localization data and accumulation of Tregs with DCs around the bulge are supportive of this mechanism, our transcriptomics revealed that independently of immune cells, stem cells within a damaged niche are also well-equipped with a complex arsenal of cytokines and chemokines to communicate with both the adaptive and innate immune systems. Such chemokines include CCL1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hoelzinger et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Scharschmidt et al., 2017</xref>) and CCL20, which are both potent stimuli for Tregs.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Talking back: immune cell participation in containing the barrier breach</title><p>Recently, it was shown that in normal homeostasis, Tregs come into close proximity of the bulge towards the telogen to anagen transition, where in addition to BMP-inhibitors, WNTs and other activating cues, they help to fuel hair regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ali et al., 2017</xref>). Although Treg ablation studies suggested a role for Tregs in hair cycling, it has remained unknown whether such effects are direct or indirect. Our findings here showed that proliferative effects of Tregs on HF stem cells can be direct.</p><p>It is curious that in homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ali et al., 2017</xref>) and hair plucking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2015</xref>), stem cells are stimulated to proliferate and launch new hair growth, while in the face of a barrier breach, stem cells direct their efforts towards containing the damage. Based upon the evidence at hand, this difference likely resides in the plethora of growth factors, cytokines, reactive oxygen species, and lipid mediators that are generated by immune cells under different conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Demehri et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yoon et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Although the precise nature of this complex communication between the stem cells and immune cells is beyond the scope of the current study, we have shown that it is considerably more robust and diverse than that which functions in normal hair cycling or transient injury response. That said, the collective evidence points to an important role for stem cells in sensing and responding to their local environment. Their ability to subsequently recruit distinct immune cell repertoires enables stem cells to receive new sets of instructions that deviate from their normal homeostatic state, thereby channeling their efforts in new directions. This intricate feedback mechanism enables the recruited immune cells to repurpose stem cells from their normal job of making hair to instead participate in curbing the breached barrier.</p><p>This diversion of HF stem cells away from their normal regenerative function had two important outcomes. First, it added a new layer of AJ-competent cells to line/reinforce the damaged bulge. Second, because the activated stem cells transcribed an array of immune signaling genes, their amplification within the niche bolstered the local production of distress signals. Altogether, this captivating communication network appeared to be aimed at patching the breached barrier and limiting tissue damage that would otherwise be caused by chronic inflammation. Indeed, the ensuing immune cell-associated ‘hyperthickening’ phenotype was locally restricted to the site of the barrier breach (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2D</xref>).</p><p>Since our breached HF barrier model was a genetic one, it was not surprising that the efforts of the HF stem cells to patch the barrier were futile, as evidenced by the bacterial infiltration seen in the <italic>Cdh1</italic>-null HFs and their surrounding tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Indeed, there are a number of genetic disorders involving breached skin barriers in which stem cells hyper-proliferate and yet are unable to repair the barrier. In this regard, it is intriguing to consider epidermolytic hyperkeratosis patients and mice, which harbor suprabasal epidermal keratin one and/or keratin 10 mutations. In this case, the healthy epidermal stem cells respond to the barrier breach, but they maintain a single layer of proliferative progenitors, while dramatically expanding the (defective) layers of terminally differentiating cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fuchs et al., 1992</xref>). By contrast, the proliferative <italic>Cdh1</italic> null HF stem cells cannot directly generate the terminally differentiated barrier cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hsu et al., 2011</xref>), and instead generate multiple layers of stem cells. While neither of these responses are successful, they likely reflect a general, evolutionarily conserved mechanism intrinsic within epithelial stem cells to respond to and repair barrier defects wherever they emerge.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Interplay between stem cell adhesion, proliferation and immune response</title><p>Studies in <italic>Drosophila</italic> testis and ovary have long established a role for E-cadherin in adhering germline stem cells to their niche, a process critical to balancing stem cell self-renewal and differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Song et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yamashita et al., 2003</xref>). Although the roles of AJs in mammalian stem cell niches have not been studied extensively, the increased HF stem cell proliferation could reflect a direct response to the reduced AJ levels that appeared to emanate from the perturbed inner bulge:stem cell interface. Thus it was surprising that immune suppression kept the ectopic proliferation of telogen HF stem cells largely in check. These findings expose an additional layer of complexity in the proliferative control of HF stem cells not seen in the invertebrate stem cell systems studied to date.</p><p>Previous reports have described immune, hyperproliferative responses of mammalian epithelial tissues following genetic perturbations in various AJ components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Perez-Moreno et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Vasioukhin et al., 2001</xref>). However, the responses documented occur directly at the level of genetic alterations and are thus largely cell-autonomous. The specific roles for α-catenin and p120-catenin in signaling also appear to be independent of barrier function. Notably, as we have shown here, the stem cells displaying a hyperproliferative response can themselves be wild-type and depend upon their border with damaged niche neighbors to trigger the subsequent cascade of events we identified.</p><p>Despite the critical role that the immune response plays to induce stem cell proliferation, the telogen-phase stem cells within the damaged niche still maintained in part a transcriptome reflective of cell proliferation even when the immune response was repressed. This aspect of their transcriptome paralleled that of their natural proliferative state in the hair cycle. However, in early anagen, the levels of hair cycle stimulatory factors outweigh the quiescence factors emanating from the bulge niche. By contrast, within a damaged telogen-phase niche, the quiescence factors still remained high, and in the absence of anagen-stimulating factors, the reduction in AJs and elevation in cell cycle transcriptome were not sufficient on their own to activate these stem cells. In this way, the proliferative trigger for repurposing the stem cells became contingent upon the unleashing of immune distress signals upon the failure of their niche neighbors to provide a proper barrier.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our studies exposed a fascinating interplay between the terminally differentiated cells that provide the niche barrier, and its neighboring stem cells that fuel regenerative processes in hair cycling and wound repair. Through their ability to respond to their damaged niche, stem cells are able to alter their program of gene expression in a way that both primes the stem cells for proliferation and enables them to recruit immune cells. In turn, the immune cells bestow new keratinocyte growth factors and cytokines on the local niche microenvironment. The strong presence of Tregs may also enable stem cell niches to limit tissue damage that might otherwise be caused by massive inflammation.</p><p>Our findings suggest that through their elevated cell cycle transcriptome, the primed stem cells within the damaged niche have a reduced threshold for proliferation and therefore selectively respond to recruited immune cells, even though normal homeostatic quiescent controls are still sufficient to keep other nearby cells (e.g. the hair germ) in check. This selective self-renewal behavior by stem cells sustains the immune response and also reinforces the damaged barrier with layers of cells whose intercellular junctions are intact. Our findings explain a number of pathological conditions involving perturbations in terminally differentiating cells that are manifested in healthy stem/progenitor cells.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice and procedures</title><p><italic>Cdh3<sup>null</sup></italic>, <italic>Cdh1<sup>Flox</sup></italic>, <italic>Rosa26<sup>lox-STOP-lox-YFP</sup></italic>, <italic>Sox9-CreER</italic>, <italic>Krt15-CrePGR</italic> and <italic>Krt14-rtTA</italic> were described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boussadia et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mao et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Morris et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nguyen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Radice et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Soeda et al., 2010</xref>). <italic>Sox9-CreER</italic> was activated by tamoxifen (Sigma) administered either by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection (75 μg/g body weight in corn oil) once a day for 3 days or by single topical application (1.5 mg in ethanol) on hair coat of mice. <italic>Krt15-CrePGR</italic> was activated by mifepristone (RU486, TCI America) administered by i.p. injection (75 μg/g body weight in sesame oil) and topically (12 mg in ethanol) on shaved dorsal back of mice once a day for 7 days.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for sending your article entitled &quot;Stem cells repurpose proliferation to contain a breach in their niche barrier&quot; for peer review at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been evaluated by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Marianne Bronner as the Senior Editor.</p><p>As you can see below, the reviewers had several concerns including the link between the loss of E-cadherin and the immune system, the mechanisms by which CCL ligands are elevated and function, and whether other transcriptional pathways are altered in the E-cadherin cKO mice.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>This manuscript addresses the role of cellular junctions on stem cell dynamics using the hair follicle (HF) as a model system. The authors show that disruptions in junctions through genetic loss of E-cadherin in hair follicle stem cells leads to activation of immune cells and proliferation. Interestingly, the stem cells do not differentiate but remain in the niche to reinstate the barrier. The manuscript contains several interesting points but the experiments that point to a role of the immune system are not specific and will likely require additional experiments that are beyond the shortened revision time for <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>1) Figure 4. The graph of Tregs is not labelled on the figure or the legend. What is the difference between the open circles and the triangles?</p><p>2) Figure 5. Which cKO mouse is used for the expression analysis? The legend and/or figure should reflect the genetic model used for this experiment.</p><p>3) The difference between macrophage vs. DC cell numbers in the cKO is confusing. Since CCR2 recruits macrophages and DCs, the upregulation of these genes should elevate macrophages in the cKO mice. These seemingly disparate results should be clarified in the manuscript.</p><p>4) The experiments using dexamethasone (Dex) are quite non-specific for inhibiting immune cells. It is known that Dex can alter DP cells (Kwack et al., 2017) and other cell types in the skin. The authors do show that direct interaction of Tregs and bulge cells induces their proliferation, but this was shown recently (Ali et al., 2017) using careful genetic models of cellular depletion. The authors should perform specific experiments that implicate the immune cells and/or specific immune cells.</p><p>5) The authors do not perform functional analysis of BMP/FGF signaling in proliferation in their model.</p><p>6) Does the proliferation that is induced in the bulge regenerate the barrier function in the cKO mice?</p><p>7) In the figure legends the authors mention n=4 mice. Is that 4 mice per genotype or 2 mice per genotype?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>In the manuscript Lay et al. discover an important interplay between HFSC and immune cells following breaches in the inner bulge niche. Using several strategies, they demonstrate that E-cadherin is important for maintaining adherens junctions, tight junctions, and integrity of the niche, but does not affect niche cell numbers in the bulge. Ablation of <italic>Cdh1</italic> specifically in bulge stem cells did not cause the stem cell proliferation phenotype indicating that niche signaling is responsible for stem cell proliferation and expansion of bulge layers in <italic>Cdh1</italic> KO mice. Treating <italic>Cdh1</italic> KO mice with various antibiotics did not prevent stem cell proliferation, demonstrating that bacterial infiltration is not responsible for stem cell proliferation following niche breach. Dendritic cells (DCs) and αβ T cells, but not macrophages or γδTCR, showed marked and significant recruitment to breached stem cell niches. Immune cell recruitment was mediated by an upregulation of chemokines in <italic>Cdh1</italic> KO HFSC and WT HFSC near <italic>Cdh1</italic> KO inner bulge niche, revealed with RNA-Seq using FACS sorted populations and validated with in vitro migration assays. <italic>Ccl1</italic> and <italic>Ccl2</italic>, established chemokines for DCs, were the top two most highly upregulated genes in the stem cell cohort. Increases in <italic>Ccl1</italic> and <italic>Ccl2</italic> occurred in <italic>Cdh1</italic> KO HFSC in the presence of antibiotics, demonstrating again that the breached niche response is independent of bacterial infiltration. Furthermore, DC recruitment by HFSC is dependent on DC CCR2 expression, the receptor to <italic>Ccl2</italic>. Lastly, immunosuppression prevented the HF hyper thickened bulge phenotype and HFSC proliferation, revealing a role for immune cell infiltration in breached niche protection independent of bacterial infiltration. The experiments are controlled well, observations validated using several strategies, and conclusions strongly supported by the data. The manuscript will be of interest to a general audience and is highly novel. I have a few remaining questions.</p><p>1) Does <italic>Ccl1</italic> and <italic>Ccl2</italic> expression increase in WT HSFC surrounding <italic>Cdh1</italic> KO inner bulge in antibiotic conditions?</p><p>2) Why is an increase in HFSC <italic>Ccl1</italic> important? <italic>Ccl1</italic> interacts with CCR8, expressed by DCs, T cells and monocytes.

Using sophisticated mouse models to delete E-cadherin in the stem cells and niche either collectively or separately, they have made fascinating observations that hair follicle stem cells can sense the barrier breach and engage in a hyper-proliferative state without triggering hair follicle growth. They have further delineated the role of bacterial infiltration and immune cell accumulation followed by the barrier breach and demonstrated that only immune cell accumulation but not bacterial infiltration leads to abnormal stem cell division. The data are of very high quality and convincing.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.41661.026</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>As you can see below, the reviewers had several concerns including the link between the loss of E-cadherin and the immune system, the mechanisms by which CCL ligands are elevated and function, and whether other transcriptional pathways are altered in the E-cadherin cKO mice.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>This manuscript addresses the role of cellular junctions on stem cell dynamics using the hair follicle (HF) as a model system. The authors show that disruptions in junctions through genetic loss of E-cadherin in hair follicle stem cells leads to activation of immune cells and proliferation. Interestingly, the stem cells do not differentiate but remain in the niche to reinstate the barrier. The manuscript contains several interesting points but the experiments that point to a role of the immune system are not specific and will likely require additional experiments that are beyond the shortened revision time for eLife.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s comments and also recognized in reading some of their remarks that there were experiments/data presented that needed clarification. In fact, our studies underscoring a role for the immune system <italic>are</italic> specific for the particular question we try to address, as we explain in response to several of the reviewer’s concerns raised below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) Figure 4. The graph of Tregs is not labelled on the figure or the legend. What is the difference between the open circles and the triangles?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out this inadvertent omission. The open-circle dataset included an outlier that was consistent with our findings (an increase in Tregs upon barrier breach) but made the difference statistically insignificant. The triangle dataset excluded the outlier, in which case the difference between cKO and control was statistically significant. Since the outlier is part of the experimental data, and yet our conclusions are clear, we felt this was the fairest way to present these data. We have now indicated this in the legend for Figure 4D-F.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Figure 5. Which cKO mouse is used for the expression analysis? The legend and/or figure should reflect the genetic model used for this experiment.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out this poorly explained point, which we now clarify in the legend/Materials and methods. In all cases, our “controls” are always matched littermate heterozygous animals. For Figure 5A, we use low dose Tam and <italic>SOX9CreER</italic> during mid-telogen to analyze the difference between the inner bulge cells lacking <italic>Cdh1</italic> and their heterozygous WT counterparts. For Figure 5B and C, we use high dose Tam and <italic>SOX9CreER</italic> during mid-telogen and determine the HFSC signature in HFs whose bulge is either WT (heterozygous) or mutant for <italic>Cdh1</italic>. For Figure 5D, top Venn Diagram, we use low dose tamoxifen with SOX9CreER and compare how WT HFSCs differ in gene expression when they experience a WT versus a mutant niche. Principle component analyses in Figure 5E reveal that the signature is very different from simply WT HFSCs during their natural phase of proliferation (Anagen II/III). For Venn Diagram in Figure 5D (bottom), we show that the inner bulge and HFSCs respond very differently to the breached barrier.</p><p>In Figure 5F, we are taking the top genes from the inner bulge “immune crosstalk” signature (cKO inner bulge signature vs. control inner bulge) and then comparing their expression levels to the HFSC expression levels. From these data, it is clear that the levels of even these genes are higher in the HFSCs than the inner bulge niche.</p><p>In Figure 5G, we take the top genes from the HFSC “immune crosstalk” signature (<italic>Cdh1</italic>-null HFSCs vs. control HFSCs) and then compare their levels to those of the inner bulge whose <italic>Cdh1</italic> gene is ablated. Again, the gene expression levels are higher, substantially so, over the inner bulge expression levels. In Figure 5G, for comparative purposes, we also add an analysis of how these top HFSC “immune crosstalk” genes differ when the HFSCs are either <italic>Cdh1</italic> null (red bars) or WT (green bars).</p><p>The importance of performing the experiments in this way was to maintain the same genetic background throughout and analyze every possible combination. From the collective analyses, we could clearly demonstrate that the “immune crosstalk” signature was seen irrespective of whether the HFSCs were WT or <italic>Cdh1</italic> null, but that it was in all cases dependent upon the status of the inner bulge niche (either breached or WT).</p><p>We have now revised the Figure 5 legend to indicate the mouse models used for the various RNA-seq analyses.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The difference between macrophage vs. DC cell numbers in the cKO is confusing. Since CCR2 recruits macrophages and DCs, the upregulation of these genes should elevate macrophages in the cKO mice. These seemingly disparate results should be clarified in the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>I presume the reviewer meant to say “...since CCL2 recruits macrophages and DCs...”. Since we discovered CCL2 specifically expressed by HFSCs within a breached barrier niche, indeed, we could have expected to see either an increase in macrophages or DCs or both.</p><p>In contrast to many studies that have been performed on the skin (such as the Cheng-Ming Chuong study reporting elevated CCL2 (location unknown) and macrophages in skin following hair plucking, which induces mechanical damage and removes the BMP6/FGF18-expressing niche cells), we performed a complete immune cell analyses, and carefully quantified by FACS to identify which of the immune cell types infiltrate the skin soon after a breach of the HFSC niche. We also then used immunofluorescence to localize which of these immune cells were specifically localized to the HFSCs, which in our case was the direct source of CCL2. In so doing, it was clear that the main immune cell differences in our breached barrier model were in DCs and Tregs.</p><p>Although macrophages and DCs share many markers in common, we define DCs by CD45+CD11b+ CD64-Mertk-Ly6C-Ly6G-MHCII+CD11c+ cells, and CD45+CD11b+MHCII+CD64+MertK+ cells as Macrophages. We have now added these distinguishing markers to our FACS plot analyses so that readers can see the full regalia of our analyses. There are several studies that report that cytokine milieu can skew the populations of Macs vs. DCs, and we cite these papers, as they have relevance to our study. Additionally, we added a sentence to make sure that we don’t give the reader the misimpression that macrophages are irrelevant, since they are certainly present in normal skin, and we did see some signs of macrophage increases in the breached niche (data in Figure 4—figure supplement 1E and F). It is just that in our experiments, the levels of macrophage increases were quite variable and analyses indicated no significant differences (see Figure 5D)(note that we did analyze multiple mice – 6 by FACS and more by immunofluorescence – and this difference remained variable, whereas DC increases were significant). We’ve now expanded our FACS profiles in Figure 4—figure supplement 1E and adjusted the text (subsection “Immune cells are recruited to the breached niche independently of bacteria”, fourth paragraph) to point out that macrophages were seen as we show in Figure 4—figure supplement 1 immunofluorescence images, but the numbers were not sufficiently consistent to be statistically significant.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The experiments using dexamethasone (Dex) are quite non-specific for inhibiting immune cells. It is known that Dex can alter DP cells (Kwack et al., 2017) and other cell types in the skin. The authors do show that direct interaction of Tregs and bulge cells induces their proliferation, but this was shown recently (Ali et al., 2017) using careful genetic models of cellular depletion. The authors should perform specific experiments that implicate the immune cells and/or specific immune cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their comments.</p><p>Indeed, we did carefully weigh the options to use dexamethasone versus genetic targeting of specific immune cell populations. The rationale we chose will be clearer having better clarified the text. Here are the two questions we asked and addressed with dexamethasone:</p><p>1) Do the infiltrating immune cells cause the transcriptome changes that we see in stem cells that experience a breached niche or is this rooted in the breached niche? Total immune suppression was needed to address this question, and we show that the aberrant cell cycle and inflammatory transcriptome of the telogen-phase stem cells occurs independently of the immune cell infiltration (Figure 6E-G). Since total immune ablation did not impact the HFSC transcriptome, specific immune ablation experiments were not relevant in addressing this point.</p><p>2) Is the proliferation that we see in telogen phase stem cells that experience a barrier breach due to the immune infiltration or the barrier breach? Total immune suppression was necessary to demonstrate this and we show that the immune cell infiltration was necessary (Figure 6B).</p><p>The reviewer raises an important point, namely that dexamethasone not only suppresses the immune system, but can affect other cell types. Regarding the Experimental Dermatology paper that the reviewer refers to, and which picks up on an earlier Paus paper, it has been reported that Dex can affect full anagen-phase mouse follicles, where it can lead to early entry into catagen. In our case, however, we focus on mid-telogen, where no adverse effects of Dex have been previously described, and critically for our study here, we do not see overt changes in the effects of Dex on our control WT mice. Of equal importance, we always use matched littermate controls in our experiments, and our focus is on differences that are exclusive to the skin whose niche barrier has been breached.</p><p>In this context, since both immune infiltration and aberrant telogen phase proliferation were eliminated by Dex, it was important to show that Dex alone does not impair HFSC proliferation. We did this experiment by culturing HFSCs under conditions where they proliferate and demonstrating that Dex does not affect proliferation status of HFSCs (Figure 6B). We explain this rationale more clearly in the text, and have added the Experimental Dermatology reference suggested by this reviewer.</p><p>We also weighed the options to use genetic targeting of specific immune cell populations versus coculturing of specific types of immune cells with HF stem cells. The reviewer highlights the Ali Cell paper, demonstrating that resident Tregs are present in normal skin and that they have a positive effect on normal anagen. However, our question was whether there is direct crosstalk between Tregs and stem cells and/or between DCs and stem cells, and since Tregs are known to impact other cell types, including other immune cells and since they could be mediating their effects indirectly through action on other skin populations, we felt this strategy may not be optimal. Rather, to address whether the immune component is directly involved in cross-talk with stem cells, it is essential to examine the effects of specific immune cells on HFSCs and the effects of the HFSCs on the specific immune cells in isolation. In this case, because DCs and Tregs are the major immune cells that swarm the breached niche, we purified and prepared DCs and Tregs, and then performed co-culture assays with HFSCs, purified from the breached niche. The outcome of these data are clear: DCs can be recruited by HFSCs in a transwell migration assay, but only if they have the CCR2 receptor to sense CCL2 (Figure 5I). By contrast, Tregs affect HFSC proliferation (Figure 6D). While our findings on Tregs are consistent with those of Ali et al., our experiments show for the first time that the effects are direct (conditionally knocking out Notch ligand in Tregs in vivo similarly did not address whether the effect the authors saw was directly between Tregs and HFSCs).</p><p>Since the co-culture experiments were definitive, and since they were the best way to achieve our goal here, i.e. to demonstrate direct cross-talk between HFSCs and immune cells, we did not pursue immune cell ablation studies. However, it is important to consider that the proposed experiments cannot simply be added as supplementary data providing ‘supportive evidence’ – they are neither trivial nor cheap. We already have 4 genetically targeted alleles (Sox9CreER, R26YFP, <italic>Cdh1</italic>fl/fl) and DCs would add at least another two alleles, while Tregs would add another allele. We do discuss the Ali et al. Cell paper and emphasize better in the text the virtues of the co-culture experiments versus the immune ablation experiments. As a final note, we also make certain to point out that, in skin whose HF barrier is breached, there is an even more robust and also highly niche-focused elevation in Tregs that is not seen in normal skin.</p><p>We have now revised the Results section entitled “Stem cell proliferation and bulge hyper-thickening arise from immune cell stimulation” to clarify our rationale for using Dex rather than ablating specific immune cells to address whether the transcriptomic changes and altered proliferation in HFSCs were rooted in the breached niche or in immune cell infiltration into the breached niche. We have also included the Experimental Dermatology reference, making it clear to the reader that we recognize the potential caveats of Dex but that these are not applicable to our study which focuses on a HF stage that is not known to be affected by Dex.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The authors do not perform functional analysis of BMP/FGF signaling in proliferation in their model.</p></disp-quote><p>We and others have previously performed functional analyses underscoring the importance of BMP/FGF signaling for stem cell quiescence in the hair follicle, and the importance of inner bulge BMP expression in raising the threshold for stem cell proliferation (Hsu et al., 2011). Figure 6—figure supplement 2A shows the FPKM and qPCR analyses showing that BMP and FGF18 levels are not significantly changed when the inner bulge niche is present, but lacks <italic>Cdh1</italic>. We also show that upon elimination of the immune cell infiltration, pSMAD1, downstream of BMP-signaling still occurs in the HFSCs surrounding a <italic>Cdh1</italic> null niche (Figure 6B). This verifies that the inner bulge niche is still capable of not only expressing <italic>Bmp</italic> genes but also in impacting BMP-signaling in the HFSCs. This differs distinctly from hair plucking, where the inner bulge niche is absent and telogen-phase BMP-signaling is lost (Hsu et al., 2011). That said, the reviewer raises a good point, and we have now added relative expression of the BMP targets <italic>Id1, Id2, Nfatc1</italic> and <italic>Foxc1</italic> in HFSCs and inner bulge cells as revealed by our RNA-seq analysis in Figure 6—figure supplement 2A. Despite the reduction in <italic>Id1</italic> and <italic>Id2</italic> in <italic>Cdh1</italic>-null HFSCs, which is not surprising given their proliferative nature, these cells still maintained expression of the critical HFSC quiescence transcription factors <italic>Nfatc1</italic> and <italic>Foxc1</italic>. Finally, we show that <italic>Id1</italic> and <italic>Id2</italic> are restored in the dexamethasone-treated condition, concomitant with BMP/pSMAD1 signaling, further substantiating that the telogen signals imposed by the inner bulge niche are still operative in the <italic>Cdh1</italic> null niche (Figures 6B and Figure 6—figure supplement 2A).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Does the proliferation that is induced in the bulge regenerate the barrier function in the cKO mice?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer raises an excellent question. Our model is a genetic one, and hence the stem cell’s efforts to patch the barrier are futile. In this regard, it is intriguing that in genetic mutations that affect the suprabasal epidermis, e.g. K10/K1 mutations, for instance, so too is the effort futile, although there the basal progenitors hyper-proliferate too (Fuchs et al., 1992). There is also a fascinating difference between the two stem cell responses: in epidermolytic hyperkeratosis patients/mice (K1/K10 mutations), the proliferative epidermal stem cells generate excessive layers of differentiating cells. In the HF, the proliferative stem cells generate excess stem cell layers but do not add to the defective inner bulge layers. There is an interesting reason for this: in contrast to the epidermis, whose basal progenitors give rise directly to the terminal differentiating cells, in the HF, the stem cells don’t directly differentiate into inner bulge cells; rather the inner bulge layer forms at the end of the hair cycle (Hsu et al., 2011). We have now discussed this intriguing point in the Discussion section entitled “Talking back: immune cell participation in containing the barrier breach”.</p><p>As a final note, we planned to perform Lucifer yellow experiments on WT skin after its hairs have been plucked. In this situation, we expected to create a barrier breach under conditions when the HFSCs are only one layer. However, we encountered difficulties in handling plucked HFs and accurately assaying for Lucifer yellow penetration because of their highly distorted morphology upon plucking. Given the caveat introduced by this distortion, the comparison is not a fair one against <italic>Cdh1</italic>-null HFs, whose morphology, besides their hyper-thickened bulge and altered actin network, is still intact.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) In the figure legends the authors mention n=4 mice. Is that 4 mice per genotype or 2 mice per genotype?</p></disp-quote><p>4 mice per genotype – we have revised all figure legends to clarify this point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>In the manuscript Lay et al. discover an important interplay between HFSC and immune cells following breaches in the inner bulge niche. Using several strategies, they demonstrate that E-cadherin is important for maintaining adherens junctions, tight junctions, and integrity of the niche, but does not affect niche cell numbers in the bulge. Ablation of Cdh1 specifically in bulge stem cells did not cause the stem cell proliferation phenotype indicating that niche signaling is responsible for stem cell proliferation and expansion of bulge layers in Cdh1 KO mice. Treating Cdh1 KO mice with various antibiotics did not prevent stem cell proliferation, demonstrating that bacterial infiltration is not responsible for stem cell proliferation following niche breach. Dendritic cells (DCs) and αβ T cells, but not macrophages or γδTCR, showed marked and significant recruitment to breached stem cell niches. Immune cell recruitment was mediated by an upregulation of chemokines in Cdh1 KO HFSC and WT HFSC near Cdh1 KO inner bulge niche, revealed with RNA-Seq using FACS sorted populations and validated with in vitro migration assays. Ccl1 and Ccl2, established chemokines for DCs, were the top two most highly upregulated genes in the stem cell cohort. Increases in Ccl1 and Ccl2 occurred in Cdh1 KO HFSC in the presence of antibiotics, demonstrating again that the breached niche response is independent of bacterial infiltration. Furthermore, DC recruitment by HFSC is dependent on DC CCR2 expression, the receptor to Ccl2. Lastly, immunosuppression prevented the HF hyper thickened bulge phenotype and HFSC proliferation, revealing a role for immune cell infiltration in breached niche protection independent of bacterial infiltration. The experiments are controlled well, observations validated using several strategies, and conclusions strongly supported by the data. The manuscript will be of interest to a general audience and is highly novel. I have a few remaining questions.</p><p>1) Does Ccl1 and Ccl2 expression increase in WT HSFC surrounding Cdh1 KO inner bulge in antibiotic conditions?</p></disp-quote><p>In reading this comment as well as the reviewer’s summary statement above, “Increases in <italic>Ccl1</italic> and <italic>Ccl2</italic> occurred in <italic>Cdh1</italic> KO HFSC in the presence of antibiotics, demonstrating again that the breached niche response is independent of bacterial infiltration,” we realized that we have presented our data in a way that is confusing. In fact, <italic>Ccl1</italic> and <italic>Ccl2</italic> are increased both in the WT and in <italic>Cdh1</italic> KO HFSCs that surround a breached niche. These data are shown in Figure 5G. Antibiotics do not abrogate this increase, as we show for the high tamoxifen situation (Figure 5H). The confusion arose from the way we presented the data in Figure 5H. The key point is not the comparison between control HFSCs + antibiotics and <italic>Cdh1</italic> null HFSCs + antibiotics (i.e. purple vs. orange bars), but rather <italic>Cdh1</italic> null HFSCs (in a breached niche) whose skins were either treated (orange bars) or not (red bars) with antibiotics. The conclusion is that in the presence of antibiotics under conditions that prevent the bacterial invasion, the stem cells still express <italic>Ccl1</italic> and <italic>Ccl2</italic> when they experience an inner niche defect and not when they don’t.</p><p>We now clarify that (1) the <italic>Cdh1</italic>-null HFSCs in Figure 5H were in a mutant niche and (2) reorganized the bars in a way that guides the reader, i.e. red and orange, followed by blue and purple. Although we cannot combine the <italic>Ccl1</italic> and <italic>Ccl2</italic> data into Figure 5G and H, as one is transcriptome and the other qPCR, we have made it clear to readers that the two sets of data complement each other. The readers will then be able to readily see that irrespective of whether mutant or wild-type, HFSCs that experience a mutant niche specifically upregulate <italic>Ccl1</italic> and <italic>Ccl2</italic>, and that barring bacterial infiltration does not abrogate their expression. We are grateful to the reviewer for their careful analyses of our data and are thankful for the comment.</p><p>We have now revised Figure 5H and its accompanying legend to show that <italic>Ccl1</italic> and <italic>Ccl2</italic> are still highly upregulated independent of antibiotics (and hence bacterial infiltration) as there is no statistically significant difference between the red (<italic>Cdh1</italic>-null HFSCs) and red candy-striped (<italic>Cdh1</italic>-null HFSCs with antibiotics) bars.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Why is an increase in HFSC Ccl1 important? Ccl1 interacts with CCR8, expressed by DCs, T cells and monocytes. Were in vitro migration assays using CCR8 KO DCs or T cells performed?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer raises an interesting point. The reason why we pursued only CCL2 and not also CCL1 is because the CCR8 mice are not commercially available in contrast to CCL2 null mice. When we performed the tests on DC migrations in WT versus CCR2 mutant backgrounds, we saw that the migratory effect was diminished, underscoring CCR2-CCL2’s role. That said, CCL1-CCR8 interactions could still play a role as the migration was compromised but not completely blocked. We have now performed in vitro migration assays using CCR8 blocking antibody. We found that blocking the CCL1-CCR8 axis had a less profound effect on DC and macrophage migration (new Figure 5J). However, treating CCR2-KO DCs and macrophages with CCR8 blocking antibody to block both CCL2-CCR2 and CCL1-CCR8 signaling had an additive effect, dampening DC and macrophage migration more than blocking either pathway alone (updated Figure 5I). As the reviewer suggested, we have also performed migration assay for Tregs. However, we did not observe a significant difference in Treg migration induced by <italic>Cdh1</italic> cKO HFSCs compared to WT HFSCs. Therefore, we did not perform additional treatment of Tregs with CCR8 blocking antibody.</p><p>Note that we contemplated but do not think it is a valid approach to try performing CCL1 and CCL2 shRNA knockdown experiments on our purified HFSCs, since we are isolating HFSCs fresh from a breached niche, and the time for us to carry out and confirm efficient shRNA knockdown could pose a new caveat.</p></body></sub-article></article>
