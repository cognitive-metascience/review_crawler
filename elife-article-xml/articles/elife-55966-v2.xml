protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is poorly understood, limiting our understanding of PP2A-regulated signaling. Recently, the first PP2A:B56 consensus binding motif, LxxIxE, was identified. However, most validated LxxIxE motifs bind PP2A:B56 with micromolar affinities, suggesting that additional motifs exist to enhance PP2A:B56 binding. Here, we report the requirement of a positively charged motif in a subset of PP2A:B56 interactors, including KIF4A, to facilitate B56 binding via dynamic, electrostatic interactions. Using molecular and cellular experiments, we show that a conserved, negatively charged groove on B56 mediates dynamic binding. We also discovered that this positively charged motif, in addition to facilitating KIF4A dephosphorylation, is essential for condensin I binding, a function distinct and exclusive from PP2A-B56 binding. Together, these results reveal how dynamic, charge-charge interactions fine-tune the interactions mediated by specific motifs, providing a new framework for understanding how PP2A regulation drives cellular signaling.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>protein phosphatase</kwd><kwd>PP2A-B56</kwd><kwd>intrinsically disordered protein</kwd><kwd>dynamic, charge-charge interactions</kwd><kwd>KIF4A</kwd><kwd>structural and cell biology</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35GM119455</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kettenbach</surname><given-names>Arminja N</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P20GM113132</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kettenbach</surname><given-names>Arminja N</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM098482</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Page</surname><given-names>Rebecca</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01NS091336</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Peti</surname><given-names>Wolfgang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM134683</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Peti</surname><given-names>Wolfgang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004191</institution-id><institution>Novo Nordisk</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NNF14CC0001</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nilsson</surname><given-names>Jakob</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100011958</institution-id><institution>Independent Research Fund Denmark</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DFF-7016-00086</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nilsson</surname><given-names>Jakob</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A novel dynamic charge-charge interaction between B56 and a subset of PP2A-B56 substrates is essential for substrate specificity, dephosphorylation and, for KIF4A, binding condensin I.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Protein serine/threonine phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is one of the defining members of the ser/thr phosphoprotein phosphatase (PPP) family that, together with protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), regulates over 90% of all ser/thr dephosphorylation events in eukaryotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Eichhorn et al., 2009</xref>). PP2A is also recognized as a tumor suppressor because its inactivation by small molecules, viral proteins or endogenous inhibitors leads to tumor formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bialojan and Takai, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pallas et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ruvolo, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Williams et al., 2019</xref>). Cellular and biochemical studies further confirmed this by demonstrating the role of PP2A in orchestrating mitotic events, cell apoptosis, metabolism and many other fundamental cellular signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nilsson, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Reid et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Reynhout and Janssens, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wlodarchak and Xing, 2016</xref>). In spite of our advances in understanding PP2A signaling, there is a comparative lack of information about how substrates are specifically recruited to PP2A.</p><p>The PP2A holoenzyme is a heterotrimer, composed of a scaffolding subunit A (PPP2R1), a regulatory subunit B (PPP2R2-PPP2R5) and a catalytic subunit C (PPP2C) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cho and Xu, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Xu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Xu et al., 2006</xref>). The A and C subunits form the PP2A core enzyme. Although this core enzyme is relatively invariant, the variable and interchangeable regulatory B subunits result in a diversity of distinct PP2A holoenzymes. There are four known families of B subunits, B55 (B’), B56 (B’, PR61), PR72 (B’’), and PR93 (B’’’), that differ in both their primary sequences and tertiary structures. Moreover, within each B subunit family, the existence of multiple isoforms and splicing variants further increases the overall number of potential PP2A holoenzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Eichhorn et al., 2009</xref>). Thus, it is the highly variable B subunits that determine PP2A holoenzyme substrate specificity. However, how the B subunits mediate substrate binding at a molecular level is only now beginning to become clear.</p><p>Recent structural and biochemical studies showed that PP2A, like other PPPs (i.e., PP1, PP2B/Calcineurin (CN)) bind conserved short linear motifs (SLiMs) found within the intrinsically disordered region (IDR) of its substrates and regulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tompa et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Van Roey and Davey, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wang et al., 2016</xref>). These SLiMs are disordered in their free form but typically become ordered upon binding structured domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dyson and Wright, 2002</xref>). Crystal structures of ordered SLiMs in complex with PPPs show that these recognition events are, in most cases, driven by the interaction of hydrophobic SLiM residues that bind deep hydrophobic pockets on the PPPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Peti et al., 2013</xref>). Single SLiMs typically bind to their cognate PPPs with moderate affinities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Li et al., 2007</xref>). However, the existence of multiple SLiMs within a single regulator/substrate, coupled with post-translational modifications like phosphorylation, can greatly alter their affinity for their respective PPP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bajaj et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Grigoriu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kumar et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nasa et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>More recently, it has been discovered that IDPs can also form high affinity complexes that are dynamic; that is, in which the IDPs simultaneously retain their intrinsic structural disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Borgia et al., 2018</xref>). In these cases, binding is typically driven by electrostatics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Borgia et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hendus-Altenburger et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Luo et al., 2016</xref>). That is, multiple residues of opposite charge facilitate binding while the lack of a requirement for deep pockets allows the IDPs to retain their inherent dynamics. This emerging paradigm for biomolecular interactions may explain, in part, why hundreds of IDPs have long stretches of positive (lys, arg) and and/or negative (asp, glu) residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Borgia et al., 2018</xref>). Namely, that they dynamically contribute to intermolecular interactions.</p><p>Recently, the first PP2A:B56 specific SLiM, the LxxIxE motif, was identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hertz et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wu et al., 2017</xref>). Proteins containing validated LxxIxE motifs bind B56, an all α-helical heat repeat protein, in a deep, highly conserved hydrophobic pocket. Most LxxIxE motifs bind PP2A:B56 with moderate affinities (low micromolar K<sub>D</sub>), similar to those observed for other PPP-specific SLiMs. However, for PP1 and CN, enhanced affinities are achieved by exploiting avidity; namely, regulators and substrates contain two or more distinct SLiMs which, together, result in tight affinities for their cognate PPP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Choy et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Grigoriu et al., 2013</xref>). Thus far, no such enhancement has been identified for PP2A:B56 as only the LxxIxE motif has been identified. Whether PP2A:B56 uses a similar mechanism to enhance and or modulate the affinities of LxxIxE containing regulators/substrates is thus a major outstanding question.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A subset of PP2A:B56 specific substrates depend on a conserved acidic patch in B56 for PP2A:B56 binding</title><p>An analysis of the amino acid conservation among 150 distinct B56 sequences shows that the residues that comprise the concave surface of B56 are exceptionally conserved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). This conserved region includes the deep, hydrophobic binding pocket that specifically binds the LxxIxE SLiM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hertz et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wang et al., 2016</xref>). However, the conserved region is much larger, suggesting that regions adjacent to the LxxIxE pocket might also contribute to regulator/substrate binding. An examination of the electrostatic potential of the same region led to the identification of a surface adjacent to the LxxIxE pocket that is not hydrophobic, but instead is highly negatively charged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). This surface is defined by multiple acidic residues that are perfectly conserved in B56, both among its various isoforms and throughout evolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The PP2A:B56 holoenzyme uses a conserved acidic patch to bind to B56-specific interactors.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) PP2A:B56γ holoenzyme (PDBID 2NPP): scaffolding subunit A (beige) and catalytic subunit C (grey; bound metals shown as pink spheres) illustrated as cartoons with transparent surfaces.

While the perturbation of these interactions is not sufficient to perturb B56 function in supporting mitotic timing in HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A,B,C</xref>), it does reveal that the B56 acidic patch is a key binding determinant for a subset of LxxIxE containing PP2A-B56 interactors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,E</xref>).</p><p>To delineate the contribution of the acidic patch, we investigated the molecular site in KIF4A, RepoMan, NHS and AIM1 that is responsible for binding the B56 acidic patch. We reasoned that the B56 acidic patch interacts with a complementary basic patch in B56 interactors. Analysis of the primary sequences of these regulators highlighted the presence of a conserved basic charged rich region within ~15 amino acid N-terminal to an established LxxIxE motif, which we defined as a basic patch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).

The peaks corresponding to the residues between the two motifs (residues 1213 to 1224) were also broadened beyond detection, indicating this region either is involved in binding or that the conformational freedom of the linker is limited, due to the anchoring of the basic patch and the LxxIxE motifs to B56γ.

Together, these data, coupled with the ITC results, show that the KIF4A basic patch interaction with B56 belongs to an emerging class of biomolecular complexes in which one or more partners of the complex retains their structural disorder upon complex binding.

The NMR data showed that the peaks corresponding to the KIF4A basic patch residues are present only with B56 variants with mutated acidic patch residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B,C</xref>). That is, they no longer interact with these variants of B56 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Consistent with these results, ITC showed that KIF4A binds the B56γ acidic patch variants more weakly (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2L,M</xref>). Interestingly, mutating only E310R/D313R was sufficient to reduce the binding affinity to the same extent as mutating the basic patch in KIF4A (K<sub>D</sub>: 0.19 ± 0.01 μM and 0.21 ± 0.01 μM for B56γ<sub>2R</sub>:KIF4A<sub>LEPE</sub>, and B56γ:KIF4A<sub>LEPE,bpm</sub>, respectively, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2L</xref>); additional mutations (i.e., E276R/E310R/D313R) did not further affect the binding (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2M</xref>). In agreement with this result, we found that the binding of KIF4A and other bp-containing B56 interactors to B56 in cells was dependent on both an intact acidic patch in B56 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>) and an intact basic patch in KIF4A, as even single amino acid substitutions in the KIF4A basic patch lowered binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). This requirement of the acidic patch for binding is consistent with a charge-charge interaction where KIF4A interacts with B56 in a dynamic manner and each amino acid contributes similarly to the overall K<sub>D</sub>. Together, these data show that the KIF4A basic patch interacts directly with the B56 conserved acidic patch and this interaction is critical for KIF4A binding.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>KIF4A dephosphorylation by PP2A:B56 requires the KIF4A basic patch</title><p>To determine if the basic charge motif in KIF4A affects dephosphorylation of KIF4A T799, a residue phosphorylated by Aurora B kinase during cytokinesis, we generated a T799 phospho-specific antibody (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bastos et al., 2014</xref>). Strikingly, the observed phosphorylation level of T799 was inversely correlated with affinities of PP2A-B56 for the different KIF4A variants in mitotic cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Specifically, mutating either the LxxIxE motif (I1227A) or the basic patch (<sup>1209</sup>KKK<sup>1211</sup> to AAA) resulted in an increase of phosphorylation of T799, as less PP2A-B56 was recruited to counteract the activity of Aurora B kinase.

To determine if the KIF4A basic patch has a mitotic function, we performed RNAi complementation assays in cells where we depleted KIF4A and hKid and then induced the expression of the different YFP-tagged KIF4A variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B,C,D</xref>; KIF4A and hKid are simultaneously depleted because they have nearly fully redundant functions during mitosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wandke et al., 2012</xref>). Depleting both KIF4A and hKid resulted in a strong mitotic delay, with multiple unaligned chromosomes. As expected, this phenotype was fully rescued by complementation with WT YFP-KIF4A. However, mutating the basic patch (bpm) resulted in a non-functional KIF4A and this variant failed to localize to mitotic chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, bottom panel). Further analysis revealed that this defect in KIF4A function due to the bpm was not due to a lack of PP2A-B56 binding, as evidenced by the observation that the I1127A variant fully rescued both the mitotic timing and the chromosome alignment phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, middle panel, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). This demonstrates that the KIF4A basic patch has a function in mitosis, which is distinct from its role in PP2A-B56 binding.</p><p>To determine if additional proteins bind specifically to the KIF4A basic patch, we purified the different KIF4A mutants from mitotic arrested cells and identified the interacting proteins using MS. These data showed that the abundance of all components of the condensin I complex were strongly reduced in the KIF4A bpm variant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata1">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>), data that are consistent with the observation that this variant does not localize to chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, bottom panel). In contrast, the abundance of the components of the condensin I complex with the I1227A variant was unaffected, consistent with the ability of this variant to properly target chromosomes during mitosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, middle panel). These data confirm that the basic patch has a second, independent function; namely, it targets KIF4A to chromosomes by binding condensin I. Because we show that both condensin I and PP2A-B56 binding strictly require the basic patch, KIF4A cannot bind both proteins simultaneously, that is, condensin I and PP2A-B56 binding by KIF4A is mutually exclusive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). These data reveal how additional motifs in PP2A-B56 substrates can modulate PP2A-B56 binding to control phospho-dependent signaling in cells.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The traditional view of protein binding is one in which the interacting proteins have well-defined, complementary interfaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lee and Richards, 1971</xref>). However, an emerging mode of binding is that in which one or both proteins exhibit different degrees of disorder in the bound complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berlow et al., 2015</xref>). In particular, the role of highly dynamic, charge-charge interactions that lack well-defined complementary interfaces are becoming increasingly recognized for their central roles in biomolecular interactions and, in turn, a diversity of biological processes like signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Borgia et al., 2018</xref>). The advantage of such a dynamic interaction is that it facilitates fast and responsive regulation. Further, the associated conformational fluctuations also provide ready access for enzymes that mediate post-translational modifications. Because IDPs are not only widely prevalent in eukaryotic genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brown et al., 2002</xref>), but also unusually enriched in charged amino acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Habchi et al., 2014</xref>), the emerging view is that electrostatically-driven dynamic protein:protein interactions are critical for many biological functions.</p><p>Here we describe a novel dynamic, charge-charge interaction for a major protein phosphatase, PP2A-B56, which significantly contributes to our understanding of the diversity of mechanisms used by this phosphatase to select its substrates. This novel interaction is mediated by a patch of basic residues that dynamically bind a highly conserved acidic surface present on all B56 isoforms and therefore constitutes a novel pan PP2A-B56 binding motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Charge-charge interactions are generally weak (low µM to mM), yet are becoming increasingly recognized for their importance in increasing the binding affinity of protein:protein interactions, in part by lowering entropy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bertran et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Borgia et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Luo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sharma et al., 2015</xref>). Further, their emerging role in regulating the protein:protein interactions of PPPs with their substrates and regulators is only now beginning to be fully understood. For example, the unrelated B55 subunit also recognizes basic stretches of residues in substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cundell et al., 2016</xref>) but clearly the substrates for PP2A-B55 and PP2A-B56 are distinct. Thus, additional interactions confer specificity. In the case of PP2A-B56 the binding affinity provided by the basic patch motif is insufficient for B56 binding and requires the presence of an LxxIxE motif, which is specific for B56, in the interactor as well. Thus, the function of the dynamic basic patch is to modulate and enhance the interactions mediated by the LxxIxE motif. It may also facilitate LxxIxE binding by providing an initial docking interaction after which the stronger LxxIxE stabilizes substrate binding; this is consistent with the view that long-range dynamic electrostatic interactions may function as an initial ‘tether’, after which the specific hydrophobic interactions that, in this case, define the LxxIxE-B56 complex, stabilize binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Borgia et al., 2018</xref>). Finally, we show that the presence and contribution of the basic patch is important for a number of interaction partners to bind PP2A-B56 underscoring its relevance and generality.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Model of the dynamic interaction between the KIF4A basic patch (BP) and the B56 acidic patch.</title><p>B56 is shown as an electrostatic surface with KIF4A and NHS shown as cartoons. The LxxIxE sequences of KIF4A and NHS bind B56 in a single conformation in the LxxIxE binding pocket (NHS sequence in this pocket modeled using the KIF4A structure, PDBID). As can be seen by these models (generated using COOT and PYMOL), the KIF4A (KKKKR) and NHS (RCR) basic patches (bp, colored dark blue) are optimally positioned to interact dynamically with the B56 acidic patch (ap, red). The dots reflect that these sequences do not adopt a single conformation, but instead retain their intrinsic disorder when bound to the acidic patch.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-55966-fig5-v2.tif"/></fig><p>In the case of KIF4A, we also show that the basic patch motif has a second function. Namely, it is strictly required for KIF4A association with chromatin via condensin I binding;see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Poser et al. (2019)</xref>. Because both KIF4A functions, binding to PP2A-B56 and condensin, strictly require the basic patch, the binding of both proteins to KIF4A is mutually exclusive. This implies that KIF4A only binds PP2A-B56 upon dissociation from chromosomes, consistent with the reported function of the KIF4A-PP2A-B56 complex in regulating the anaphase central spindle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bastos et al., 2014</xref>). Since basic patch motifs resemble nuclear localization motifs (NLSs) recognized by importin α/β, the basic patch motifs would also be inaccessible for PP2A-B56 binding during nuclear transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lange et al., 2007</xref>). Thus, the accessibility of basic patch motifs provide an additional layer of regulation that shapes the PP2A-B56 interaction and dephosphorylation landscape in cells. Together, these discoveries are advancing our understanding of how, at a molecular level, PP2A-B56 engages its substrates and how these interactions are subject to additional regulation via competition for other binding interactions, which has broad implications for understanding cellular signaling.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Sequence alignment</title><p>The ConSurf server (using 150 unique B56 sequences with the lowest E values) was used to calculate the conservation scores illustrate in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ashkenazy et al., 2016</xref>).

protein kinases and phosphatases is gaining traction. It was already known that the B56 regulatory subunit of the PP2A phosphatase ternary complex can recognize substrates for dephosphorylation through binding to an LXXIXE short motif in the substrate. Here the authors have defined a second substrate recognition mechanism acting in concert with the LXXIXE motif, which involves interaction between a negatively charged groove on the surface of B56 and a basic patch on the substrate protein. They demonstrated that a bidentate substrate interaction involving both the LXXIXE motif and the basic patch is important for PP2A-mediated dephosphorylation of the KIF4A mitotic kinesin and is functionally relevant in mitosis. These findings represent an important advance in our understanding of how PP2A can recognize its phosphoprotein substrates with high affinity and specificity.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>[Editors’ note: the authors submitted for reconsideration following the decision after peer review. What follows is the decision letter after the first round of review.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;A dynamic charge:charge interaction modulates PP2A:B56 interactions&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Tony Hunter as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Senior Editor.</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the three reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>The reviewers expressed interest in the possibility that the acidic surface patch adjacent to the LpSPIxE SLiM-binding groove in the B56 PP2A holoenzyme regulatory subunit might serve as an additional substrate recognition motif for PP2A/B56 protein phosphatase substrates possessing a basic patch adjacent to the SLiM. The structural and biochemical data you present are largely consistent with the idea that the B56 acidic patch promotes its interaction with KIF4A via its basic patch both in vitro and in vivo and thereby facilitates KIF4A dephosphorylation, although the proposed charge-charge interaction was not evident in the KIF4A/B56 structure you present. The main issue is that you provide no convincing evidence that the B56 acidic patch/KIF4A basic patch interaction is essential for PP2A/B56's or KIF4A biological function in vivo, and this type of evidence would need to be presented for at least one PP2A/B56 substrate of this type. Thus, while the conserved nature of the B56 acidic patch suggests it could be important in PP2A/B56 substrate selection, a stronger example where this is functionally important needs to be established. Whilst the reviewers recognise the potential importance of your findings they concur that as it presently stands your paper does not provide enough new biological insight into PP2A substrate selection to be considered further by <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The authors have previously defined LpSPIxE as short linear interacting motif (SLiM) through which the PP2A/B56 protein phosphatase complex targets a subset of its phosphoprotein substrates, such as RepoMan and BubR1. Here, they have extended their investigation of how PP2A-B56 recognizes its substrates. In their original report, three structures of B56 associated with SLiM phosphopeptides from RepoMan and BubR1 were solved to define the mode of LpSPIxE binding to B56. A study of these PP2A/B56/LpSPIxE structures combined with evolutionary analysis of B56 sequences revealed an acidic surface patch adjacent to the hydrophobic pocket that binds the LpSPIxE motif. To investigate a possible functional role of this acidic patch in PP2A/B56 substrate selection, they stably expressed WT and E335R/D338R acidic patch mutant B56α-YFP in HeLa cells, and used MS analysis to compare the repertoire of proteins pulled down with the WT and mutant B56α proteins from nocodazole-arrested mitotic cells. They found several proteins, including RepoMan and KIF4A, that were more weakly associated with the acidic patch B56α mutant. Both B56α and B56γ isoform acidic patch mutants, however, were able to support mitotic progression in HeLa cells depleted of B56α or B56γ, indicating that the mitotic function of PP2A/B56 was not severely perturbed. They then focused on the KIF4A mitotic kinesin as a PP2A/B56 substrate, and investigated the importance of the acidic patch in interaction and dephosphorylation of KIF4A. When KKK in the basic patch N-terminal to the LXXIXE motif was mutated to AAA, they found this reduced the affinity of recombinant KIF4A for recombinant B56 by ~4 fold in vitro. A parallel analysis carried out by mutating the basic patch upstream of the LXXIXE in RepoMan yielded a similar decline in binding to B56. By coexpression in HeLa cells, they observed that unlike basic patch or LXXIXE KIF4A mutants only WT KIF4A was efficiently coprecipitated with B56. By making mutations in the KIF4A LXXIXE motif, they showed that the affinity of the LXXIXE motif for B56 did not affect the contribution of the basic patch to the interaction of the substrate protein with B56 in vitro. Next, they investigated the consequences of mutating the KIF4A basic patch on its T799 phosphorylation status in cells, finding that mutation of either the LXXIXE motif or the basic patch increased pT799 levels, but did not affect the time taken for cells to move from NEBD to anaphase, consistent with the fact that KIF4A depletion also did not affect mitotic timing. However, they did note that KIF4A basic patch mutant failed to associate with mitotic chromosomes, while retaining the ability to localize to the spindle midzone. On this basis, they argue that the KIF4A basic patch will not be accessible to PP2A/B56 when it is associated with chromosomes. Finally, they investigated the dynamics of B56α-KIF4A interaction using NMR perturbation analysis, and found that the basic patch in KIF4A binds the acidic patch of B56 in a dynamic fashion via a charge-charge interaction between the acidic patch n B56 and the basic patch in KIF4A.</p><p>The evidence that the acidic patch on the surface of the PP2A B56 regulatory subunit is important for recognition of a subset of PP2A/B56 substrates is reasonably strong, and supported by the structural, biophysical and in vivo data. The disappointing aspect of these studies is that the activity of the single PP2A/B56 substrate they analyzed in depth, i.e. the KIF4A kinesin, that potentially requires the acidic patch for PP2A/B56 recognition, does not exhibit an obvious in vivo phenotype when its basic patch is mutated.</p><p>1) Figure 1A, B: The authors need to define the sequence(s) of the LXXIXE peptide(s) displayed in the structure in the figure legend (was this a pSer.Pro-containing peptide).</p><p>2) Figure 2C: The binding studies were done with bacterially-expressed MBP-KIF4A<sub>1192-1232</sub>. Presumably this protein was not phosphorylated at S1225 – what difference does the phosphate at S1225 make to binding affinity, and how does the affinity of a pSer-containing motif compare to the affinity when the Ser is changed to the phosphomimic Glu (this is relevant to the B56/KIF4A structure shown in Figure 4—figure supplement 1, where the LE,PE high affinity LXXIXE mutant version of KIF4A was used)?</p><p>3) Figure 3B: The myc-KIF4A pT799 bands need quantifying to demonstrate the magnitude of the effects of mutating either the basic patch or the LXXIXE motif on KIF4A dephosphorylation.</p><p>4) Figure 4—figure supplement 1: The authors show the crystal structure of the KIF4A basic patch-LEPIEEEPEE motif peptide bound to the B56 HEAT repeat region, where FSGLEPIEEEEPE residues are observed binding between heat repeats 3 and 4, but the atomic level interactions are not shown, and panel with these should be included. A surface representation of the complex like that in Figure 1A, B would also be helpful. Apparently, the KIF4A KKKKR basic patch did not make a stable enough interaction with the B56 acidic patch to be detected in the crystal structure. The NMR perturbation data in Figure 4—figure supplement 1 indicate that K1208 makes the strongest interaction, consistent with the effect of K2208A mutation on binding affinity, while K1209, K1210, K1211 and R1212 interactions are less prominent. Conversely, one would like to know which of the acidic patch residues in B56 are most important. For instance, what is the role of the E335 and D338 B56 residues that were mutated in interacting with the basic patch residues, and which of the five basic residues interact with the four acidic residues (four residues in the B56 acidic patch were mutated to Arg in Figure 4—figure supplement 1)? Can the authors model the basic patch residues into their structure, and, if so, what sort of turn would the intervening sequence between the LXXIXE motif and the basic motif have to make for both motifs to be bound simultaneously (also see point 8).</p><p>5) It is not always clear which isoform of B56 was used in different experiments, and this should be indicated e.g. B56γ was used for the crystal studies shown in Figure 4—figure supplement 1.</p><p>6) Did the authors try a charge reversal experiment in which they mutated the basic patch in KIF4A to an acidic patch based on their structural information, and test whether this restores KIF4A dephosphorylation mediated by the E335R/D338R acidic patch mutant B56α-YFP in HeLa cells.</p><p>7) Could the dynamic basic patch-acidic patch interaction be used as an initial docking interaction between a in a candidate substrate protein that collides with PP2A/B56 and PP2A/B56, which could then allow stabilization of substrate binding by the LXXIXE motif, if one is present adjacent to the basic patch?</p><p>8) The number of residues between the LXXIXE motif and the basic motif differs significantly between RepoMan and KIF4A, and this should be discussed. Based on analysis of other PP2A/B56 substrates that might use an analogous basic motif, can the authors deduce rules for how close and how far away the two motifs can be?</p><p>9) What does the basic patch of KIF4A interact with on chromosomes – is it an acidic patch on another chromosomal protein or perhaps DNA itself?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The manuscript from groups doing leading work in understanding how serine-threonine phosphatases interact with their substrates. A high affinity interaction site on the 'B56' family of PP2A subunits has previously been identified. Here, they demonstrate a highly conserved acidic patch on the surface of B56 subunits, and mutation of this patch affects the affinity of a few selected substrates of B56 containing PP2A holoenzymes. In the case of the most markedly modified interaction, with KIF4A, the effect of the mutation on affinity is 4-fold, with changes documented with several diverse techniques. The limitation of the impact of this result is that the mutation has biochemical consequences but no detectable effect of the mutants on mitotic timing. The binding affinity effect size is smaller with a second substrate, RepoMan, at only two-fold. A crystal structure of the B56 and KIF4A peptide apparently fails to identify the interaction, which they suggest might be due to the dynamic nature of the interaction. So in the end, there is a small quantitative effect of this acidic patch on the one best substrate, and no biological consequence detected. The findings will be of interest to PP2A aficionados but do not rise to the level of broad biological significance.</p><p>Figure 1: There is no table detailing the other proteins that were differentially affected in the pulldown in Figure 1C, D. Shouldn't this data be presented in the appendix? How many of these have SLiM domains and basic patches?</p><p>Also, how were the P values calculated and what method was used to correct for multiple comparisons?</p><p>There is no alignment of RepoMan identifying its basic patch. Did other interactions from the experiments in Figure 1C, D have basic patches?</p><p>The legend for Figure 1C states the 2R mutant B56α is E335R/D338R. Figure 1B shows neither of these as being labelled in the acidic patch. I found this confusing. Is this just a nomenclature/numbering issue? 2NPP and 5SW9 structures both are with B56γ – it would be helpful to label it as such in Figure 1A, and identify the specific amino acids mutated in Figure 1C, D instead of the non-obvious 2R.</p><p>The authors use an unconventional naming criteria for PP2A subunits, adding to the nomenclature confusion in the field. The Aa subunit is PPP2R1A, not 2AAA. 2AAA is meaningless. If they need shorthand, why not just use 2R1A? Similarly, PP2AA should be PPP2CA, and if they need 4 letter shorthand, why not use P2CA?</p><p>There is a 4-fold effect of mutating the KIF4A patch; there is a twofold effect of mutating the RepoMan patch. This twofold effect is not claimed by the authors to be significant, and I see no statistical test. Please explain.</p><p>Figure 3F: No indication of significance is given on the figure, just noted in legend. Please clarify. The text indicates there is no significant effect of the mutants on mitotic timing. Also, the labelling of the figure is out of register.</p><p>Figure 3E: The statement that mutating the basic patch on KIF4A abolishes chromosome association goes beyond the data presented here. Additional assays would be needed to show this was not just a problem with the assay or selection of specific images. And that it was due to the binding to B56 rather than to another chromatin binding partner. This section should temper its conclusions or provide additional data.</p><p>Figure 4: the text suggest the NMR data is with full length KIF4A. &quot;<sup>15</sup>N-labeled KIF4A in the presence and absence of B56&quot;. However, this may be misleading, as the figure legend and figure suggest a different experiment, a small fragment of KIF4A that is mutated to bind B56 with high affinity. Please be careful in the text to describe this accurately. Please explain in the text why the mutant KIF4A fragment was used, if this is indeed the case. Please help me understand why the results with mutant KIF4A should be applicable to non-mutant KIF4A? Does the dynamic interaction with the basic patch require the high-affinity mutation of KIF4A?</p><p>If I understand correctly, the crystal of the peptide of KIF4A with B56 did not resolve the interaction of the basic patch with the conserved acidic groove, thus not providing support for the model.</p><p>Results paragraph two: “These mutants were able to support normal mitotic timing in B56 RNAi…” So how biologically important can this patch be? It's confusing to me that they find the mutation alters binding of two mitotic regulators yet there is normal timing?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The manuscript by Wang et al., &quot;A dynamic charge:charge interaction modulates PP2A:B56 interactions&quot;, presents some novel observations, about substrate binding to PP2A:B56, with most of the experiments focusing on a single protein, KIF4A. Authors identify a conserved acidic groove on B56 (PPP2R5A-E) and show that it binds a basic patch in KIF4A through interaction studies with wild type proteins and mutants in both the B56 acidic groove and the KIF4A basic patch. NMR analyses further demonstrate the presence of this interaction. The experimental results presented are generally of high quality, and this paper will be of interest to anyone studying PP2A. Main weaknesses are the lack of biological impact of the B56 mutants with disruptions in the acidic groove, lack of in vitro dephosphorylation kinetics, and narrow focus on the KIF4A protein, which limits the authors' ability to make broad conclusions about the significance of this interaction. Also, much of the data presented in the manuscript is in the form of immunoblots which should be quantified, and presented with statistical analysis of the results.</p><p>Specific comments:</p><p>1) Figure 1: Authors provide very limited analysis/discussion of the interaction studies carried out with B56α and B56γ (WT vs. 2R mutant), mentioning only KIF4A and RepoMan. However, there are many orange dots in Figure 1C, D (proteins containing LxxIxE motifs), some of which also show significantly altered interactions. The story would be significantly strengthened by making this story more general: Are there basic patches present in LxxIxE containing proteins that are disrupted by the 2R mutations as compared to proteins that are not disrupted? For KIF4A the basic patch is 8 amino acids N terminal to LxxIxE. Is this spacing similar in RepoMan? If so, how many other candidates similarly display the presence of a basic patch close to LxxIxE (again vs. proteins whose interaction was not disrupted). Does addition of a strongly basic peptide selectively elute these interactors from B56?</p><p>– Furthermore, many proteins that do show significant changes with WT vs. 2R mutants do not have predicted LxxIxE motifs. Authors should comment on this. Are they indirect interactors? Do they have LxxIxE motifs not previously identified? Or another B56 binding motif?</p><p>– Authors state that the acidic patch in B56 is conserved, but Figure 1—figure supplement 1 shows an alignment of human sequences only. This should be modified to include a broader evolutionary distribution-is this acid groove conserved in lower eukaryotes? Plants?</p><p>2) In Figure 2E, F, Myc KIF4A FL containing the basic patch mutations (bpm) shows reduced interaction with B56. However, the KIF4A fragment (1001-1232) is expressed at much higher levels than full length in vivo, contains both basic patch and LxxIxE motifs, and shows complete loss of binding when the basic patch is mutated. Does this indicate the presence of additional interactions between KIF4A and B56 beyond the basic patch and LxxIxE motif? Authors should comment.</p><p>3) In Figure 3B a phospho-specific antibody is used to look at steady state phosphorylation levels in vivo, which could be due to altered phosphorylation and/or dephosphorylation. In vitro dephosphorylation assays should be included to determine if the basic patch influences dephosphorylation kinetics.</p><p>4) Figure 3E: Authors state that mutating the basic patch in KIF4A abolished chrosmosome association but not localization to the midzone, however the images shown are difficult to interpret as there is no co-staining with chromosomal or kinetochore proteins. There is clearly a bright blob that is present in all images except those for the KIF4A basic patch mutant. What does this blob represent? How many cells were analyzed?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.55966.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the authors resubmitted a revised version of the paper for consideration.

As described above, we have performed scores of additional experiments and also made key changes to the manuscript figures and text that reveal the broad relevance of this discovery not only for those interested in PP2A or the family of ser/thr phosphoprotein phosphatases specifically, but also phosphorylation signaling and IDP interactions, generally. Our data now show that the basic patch is critical for binding for multiple interactors, revealing the broad relevance of these interactions. Further, our molecular data (ITC, NMR and the crystal structure) demonstrate conclusively that this interaction between KIF4A and B56 is <italic>dynamic</italic>, in which the basic patch retains its structural disorder upon complex formation (this is further supported by a new crystal structure of the AIM1:B56γ complex, which, again, demonstrates that the basic patch retains its intrinsic disorder upon complex formation). Thus, this study of the molecular basis of the KIF4A-B56 interactions is one of the most thoroughly characterized for this novel paradigm of dynamic charge-charge based biomolecular binding. Finally, we also discovered that the KIF4A basic patch is strictly required for condensin binding. Because of this, the binding of KIF4A to condensin and B56 is mutually exclusive, and thus the requirement of this basic patch provides a novel mechanism for controlling KIF4A-B56 binding in both space and time.

First, as we described previously (1), the phosphorylation of S1225 increases the KIF4A affinity for B56 3-fold while changing the first position of the LxxIxE sequence from the native ‘C’ to ‘L’ increases the binding affinity 23-fold.

Conversely, one would like to know which of the acidic patch residues in B56 are most important. For instance, what is the role of the E335 and D338 B56 residues that were mutated in interacting with the basic patch residues, and which of the five basic residues interact with the four acidic residues (four residues in the B56 acidic patch were mutated to Arg in Figure 4—figure supplement 1)? Can the authors model the basic patch residues into their structure, and, if so, what sort of turn would the intervening sequence between the LXXIXE motif and the basic motif have to make for both motifs to be bound simultaneously (also see point 8).</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct that the basic patch does not interact with B56 in a manner that results in a <italic>single conformation</italic> that can be readily identified by X-ray crystallography. Rather, our data collectively show that this interaction is <italic>dynamic,</italic> a hallmark of a new paradigm of biomolecular interactions defined by IDP-based charge-charge electrostatic interactions in which the IDPs retain their intrinsic disorder. Namely, the ITC data show that both the B56 acidic and KIF4A basic patch contribute to binding affinity while the NMR spectroscopy data show that the basic residues engage directly with B56 acidic patch. However, the crystal structures show that this interaction is <italic>not</italic> achieved by forming a single stable structure (i.e., with a single KIF4A basic residue interacting exclusively with a single acidic residue on B56). Instead, our data describe a model in which the KIF4A basic residues interact <italic>dynamically</italic> with the B56 acidic residues. To further demonstrate this, we now include additional data in which increasing numbers of the basic residues in the KIF4A basic patch were mutated and the mutated KIF4A variants pulled down using a GFP-trap (Figure 3F). These new data show that even the loss of even a single lysine is sufficient to disrupt B56 binding. Finally, we also determined a second crystal structure: the AIM1:B56γ complex (mutation of the AIM1 basic patch results in an 18-fold reduction in affinity of AIM1 for B56). As observed for the KIF4A:B56γ complex, while the electron density of the AIM1 LxxIxE motif is well ordered, the AIM1 basic patch retains its structural disorder upon B56 binding.</p><p>As highlighted in the Discussion, while dynamic charge-charge interactions are generally moderate (low μM to mM), they are becoming increasingly recognized for their importance in increasing the binding affinity of protein:protein interactions, in part, by lowering entropy (2–4). One of the most extreme cases was recently reported in Nature (5), in which two IDPs (histone H1 and its nuclear chaperon prothymosin-α) bind with picomolar affinity while fully retaining their structural disorder; the exceptional binding affinity is due to the large opposite net charge of the two proteins. We also recently discovered that a dynamic charge-charge interaction between NHE1 and a second PPP, calcineurin (CN), determines dephosphorylation specificity for a specific NHE1 phosphosite (6). What we have discovered here is that a subset of B56 substrates also uses dynamic charge-charge interactions to facilitate B56 binding. Further, we show that the modest changes in affinity due the presence of loss of this electrostatic interaction has profound impacts on B56 binding in vivo. Why? Because of the hundreds of <italic>additional</italic> B56 interactors that contain LxxIxE sequences that are competing for the same binding site on B56. That is, in the absence of the electrostatic interaction, KIF4A is displaced from B56 by other LxxIxE-containing interactors and thus, KIF4A is no longer a PP2A-B56 substrate. This result in profound and significant for the PPP field specifically and the signaling field generally. Namely, that a subset of substrates exploit a dynamic charge-charge interaction to enhance PP2A-B56 binding.</p><p>We now include a model that illustrates how the dynamic basic patch of these regulators binds the B56 acidic patch (in which the bp retains its intrinsic disorder) and the LxIxxE sequences binds the B56 LxIxxI binding pocket. This is now included in Figure 5.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) It is not always clear which isoform of B56 was used in different experiments, and this should be indicated e.g. B56γ was used for the crystal studies shown in Figure 4—figure supplement 1.</p></disp-quote><p>This has been addressed by adding the isoform tested throughout the figures and text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Did the authors try a charge reversal experiment in which they mutated the basic patch in KIF4A to an acidic patch based on their structural information, and test whether this restores KIF4A dephosphorylation mediated by the E335R/D338R acidic patch mutant B56α-YFP in HeLa cells.</p></disp-quote><p>Although an interesting suggestion, we have not tried this.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Could the dynamic basic patch-acidic patch interaction be used as an initial docking interaction between a in a candidate substrate protein that collides with PP2A/B56 and PP2A/B56, which could then allow stabilization of substrate binding by the LXXIXE motif, if one is present adjacent to the basic patch?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, this is most certainly a possibility, which is consistent with the view that long-range dynamic electrostatic interactions may function as the initial ‘tether’, after which the specific hydrophobic interactions that define the LxxIxE-B56 complex stabilize binding. The potential role(s) of this newly discovered dynamic electrostatic interaction is now addressed in the Discussion.</p><p>“It may also facilitate LxxIxE binding by providing an initial docking interaction after which the stronger LxxIxE stabilizes substrate binding; this is consistent with the view that long-range dynamic electrostatic interactions may function as an initial ‘tether’, after which the specific hydrophobic interactions that, in this case, define the LxxIxE-B56 complex, stabilize binding (5).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) The number of residues between the LXXIXE motif and the basic motif differs significantly between RepoMan and KIF4A, and this should be discussed. Based on analysis of other PP2A/B56 substrates that might use an analogous basic motif, can the authors deduce rules for how close and how far away the two motifs can be?</p></disp-quote><p>The number of residues between the LxxIxE and basic patches varies depending on substrate. For example, in the substrates analyzed here, the number of residues between the motifs varies between 6 and 12 amino acids. Further, the change in binding affinity when the basic patch is mutated is not linearly correlated with the number of intervening residues Thus, while not exhaustive, our data suggests that the number of intervening residues is variable.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) What does the basic patch of KIF4A interact with on chromosomes – is it an acidic patch on another chromosomal protein or perhaps DNA itself?</p></disp-quote><p>We have performed a series of MS experiments to answer this question. The MS data now shows that KIF4A interacts directly with the chromosomally associated condensin complex and, further, that this interaction strictly requires the KIF4A basic patch. This MS data is now included as Figure 4—source data 2 and also included in Figure 4E. Our new results are consistent with and, more importantly, extend a recent publication from the Barr laboratory (7) that we cite (see also response to reviewer 2’s point 7).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>The manuscript from groups doing leading work in understanding how serine-threonine phosphatases interact with their substrates. A high affinity interaction site on the 'B56' family of PP2A subunits has previously been identified. Here, they demonstrate a highly conserved acidic patch on the surface of B56 subunits, and mutation of this patch affects the affinity of a few selected substrates of B56 containing PP2A holoenzymes. In the case of the most markedly modified interaction, with KIF4A, the effect of the mutation on affinity is 4-fold, with changes documented with several diverse techniques. The limitation of the impact of this result is that the mutation has biochemical consequences but no detectable effect of the mutants on mitotic timing. The binding affinity effect size is smaller with a second substrate, RepoMan, at only two-fold. A crystal structure of the B56 and KIF4A peptide apparently fails to identify the interaction, which they suggest might be due to the dynamic nature of the interaction. So in the end, there is a small quantitative effect of this acidic patch on the one best substrate, and no biological consequence detected. The findings will be of interest to PP2A aficionados but do not rise to the level of broad biological significance.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their positive comments on our research programs. As described in the Introduction, our previous and new experimental data show unequivocally that this basic patch is present in a subset of key PP2A-B56 substrates. Further, we show that these basic patches are critical for B56 binding both in vivo and in vitro for <italic>multiple</italic> substrates, including KIF4A, RepoMan, AIM1 and NHS. This demonstrates this is a general mechanism for modulating B56 substrate binding.</p><p>As we show, even though the in vitro affinity differences of the substrates for B56 with and without the basic patch are small, these differences have profound impacts on PP2A biology and PP2A-B56 recruitment, as evidenced by the loss of PP2A-B56 binding upon mutating the basic patch residues to alanines (see current Figure 3F). The observation that small affinity differences in vitro have significant effects in vivo is an emerging paradigm for all PPP interactions and thus these results are broadly relevant for multiple biological systems. Specifically, we reported one of the first examples in our <italic>eLife</italic> manuscript describing the interaction/regulation of KI-67 and RepoMan with PP1 (8). Specifically, we showed that the affinity of KI-67 for PP1α versus PP1γ differs only 5-fold in vitro. However, in vivo, this modest change in affinity results in absolutely no binding between PP1α and KI-67 (or RepoMan). Rather, it binds exclusively to PP1γ. Why? Because KI-67 is competing with 100s of other regulators for PP1α and this small difference in affinity in vitro allows all other PP1α-specific regulators to ‘outcompete’ KI-67 for PP1α.</p><p>It is also critical to also emphasize how important the PPP family of proteins are for understanding how IDPs engage and direct the activity of key signaling proteins. Our collective work over the last nearly two decades are revealing how these key signaling proteins recognize their regulators and substrates via SLiM interactions, how IDP <italic>dynamics</italic> direct PPP dephosphorylation specificity and, as also described here for the first time for PP2A-B56, the role of <italic>dynamic charge-charge</italic> interactions in modulating substrate binding and substrate function (KIF4A). These discoveries are not only relevant for the PPP family, specifically, but for IDP interactions, generally, which is why we believe that this work rises to the level of broad biological significance. We now also make these points explicitly in the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 1: There is no table detailing the other proteins that were differentially affected in the pulldown in Figure 1C, D.

Our data show that co-depletion results in robust and statistically significant mitotic delay, with multiple unaligned chromosomes. Further, both phenotypes were fully rescued by WT KIF4A. In this background, we then expressed the different KIF4A variants. The data revealed a clear function for the basic patch in supporting KIF4A activity. This is an important new result as, together, our data not only reveal the importance of this motif for PP2A-B56 binding and activity (via KIF4A T799 dephosphorylation) but also for chromosome targeting. Further, because both activities strictly required the basic patch, our data provides the molecular explanation for the inability PP2A-B56 to co-localize with KIF4A along chromosomes; i.e., they cannot bind KIF4A simultaneously. These data are now reported in Figure 4C, D. In particular, Figure 4D replaces the original Figure 3F.</p><p>We have confirmed that there are no panels in any current figure that are out of register.

We have now included a chromosome marker in or live cell assays to make this clearer. To further support these data, we have now also performed mass spectrometry analysis of the different KIF4A variants. These data also show that the basic patch of KIF4A is strictly required for binding to condensin, which are consistent with results from a recent paper from the Barr laboratory (7). These data provides the molecular mechanism for why KIF4A BPM variant is not localizing to chromosomes. More importantly however, our results now explain why condensin and PP2A-B56 binding is mutually exclusive, an observation that has remained an unexplained conundrum in the field; namely, both strictly require the BPM for binding. Thus, accessibility to the basic patch provide an additional layer of regulation that shapes the PP2A-B56 interaction and dephosphorylation landscape in cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 4: the text suggest the NMR data is with full length KIF4A. &quot;<sup>15</sup>N-labeled KIF4A in the presence and absence of B56&quot;.

The need for the higher affinity KIF4A variant is a consequence of the binding regime that is accurately monitored using both ITC and NMR. Here, we are comparing affinities with and without the basic patch. Critically, as we show in the manuscript, the affinity of the KIF4A basic patch for the B56 acidic patch is not altered by changing the affinity of the KIF4A SLiM for B56 (Results section: The binding contribution of the basic patch motif is independent of the strength of the LxxIxE motif). This demonstrates conclusively that the dynamic interaction with the basic patch does <italic>not</italic> require the high affinity mutation.

Namely, that the charge-charge interaction is dynamic and does not adopt a single, stable conformation (i.e., as one observes for interactions involving deep hydrophobic pockets such as that of the LxxIxE motif with B56). Rather, the IDP basic residues retain their dynamics (adopt multiple, interchangeable conformations) when interacting with the B56 acidic patch. The importance of dynamic charge-charge interactions between IDPs and their targets is emerging as a key mechanism by which these IDPs, which represent ~30% of the human proteome, engage and direct the activity of their interacting proteins. What we have discovered is that this is used by a subset of PP2A-B56 substrates and peptides to enhance their ability to bind B56 and, in turn, the biological processes they regulate.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Results paragraph two: “These mutants were able to support normal mitotic timing in B56 RNAi…” So how biologically important can this patch be? It's confusing to me that they find the mutation alters binding of two mitotic regulators yet there is normal timing?</p></disp-quote><p>We have not observed an effect on mitotic timing (NEBD-Anaphase) with the B56 mutants despite the fact that the interaction with KIF4A and RepoMan is strongly reduced. However depletion of KIF4A has no major impact on mitotic timing (data in original Figure 3F and consistent with reported literature) and abolishing the interaction of RepoMan and PP2A-B56 by mutating the LxxIxE motif does not affect the kinetics of chromosome targeting at anaphase (12). Given this data, we do not anticipate that weakening the interaction between PP2A-B56 and KIF4A/RepoMan would affect mitotic timing (NEBD-Anaphase) consistent with what we observe. Our data thus show that the acidic patch on B56 subunits is not required for mitotic timing in HeLa cells but this does not allow one to conclude that the acidic patch is not biological important. Given the exceptional conservation and the fact that other non-mitotic regulators (AIM1, NHS) depend on the acidic patch for binding it is likely that in a model organism mutation of the acidic patch would result in a phenotype but this is beyond the current scope of this manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>The manuscript by Wang et al., &quot;A dynamic charge:charge interaction modulates PP2A:B56 interactions&quot;, presents some novel observations, about substrate binding to PP2A:B56, with most of the experiments focusing on a single protein, KIF4A.

NMR analyses further demonstrate the presence of this interaction. The experimental results presented are generally of high quality, and this paper will be of interest to anyone studying PP2A. Main weaknesses are the lack of biological impact of the B56 mutants with disruptions in the acidic groove, lack of in vitro dephosphorylation kinetics, and narrow focus on the KIF4A protein, which limits the authors' ability to make broad conclusions about the significance of this interaction.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s view that our work is of “high quality” and will be of interest to anyone studying PP2A.

However, there are many orange dots in Figure 1C, D (proteins containing LxxIxE motifs), some of which also show significantly altered interactions. The story would be significantly strengthened by making this story more general: Are there basic patches present in LxxIxE containing proteins that are disrupted by the 2R mutations as compared to proteins that are not disrupted? For KIF4A the basic patch is 8 amino acids N terminal to LxxIxE. Is this spacing similar in RepoMan? If so, how many other candidates similarly display the presence of a basic patch close to LxxIxE (again vs. proteins whose interaction was not disrupted).</p></disp-quote><p>These are very important points and we now address this directly in the text. First, it is important to note that not all proteins that show a difference interact <italic>directly</italic> with PP2A-B56. The proteins known to interact with PP2A-B56 directly (KIF4A, RepoMan, NHS, AIM1, among others) are typically 100s-1000s of amino acids long. Thus, in cells, these proteins that bind PP2A-B56 directly are also bound to a host of additional proteins. Thus, some of the observed changes are due to this indirect interaction.</p><p>However, there are also multiple proteins already demonstrated to bind PP2A-B56 directly via LxxIxE motifs (1, 9).
