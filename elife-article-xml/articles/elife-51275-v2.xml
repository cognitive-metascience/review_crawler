To circumvent this drawback, we generated an eye-specific <italic>Dcc</italic> mutant. To study the organization of the retina and visual projections in these mice, we also established EyeDISCO, a novel tissue clearing protocol that removes melanin allowing 3D imaging of whole eyes and visual pathways. We show that in the absence of <italic>Dcc</italic>, some ganglion cell axons stalled at the optic disc, whereas others perforated the retina, separating photoreceptors from the retinal pigment epithelium. A subset of visual axons entered the CNS, but these projections are perturbed. Moreover, <italic>Dcc</italic>-deficient retinas displayed a massive postnatal loss of retinal ganglion cells and a large fraction of photoreceptors. Thus, Dcc is essential for the development and maintenance of the retina.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>retinal development</kwd><kwd>retinal degeneration</kwd><kwd>visual development</kwd><kwd>axon guidance</kwd><kwd>light sheet microscopy</kwd><kwd>tissue clearing</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004097</institution-id><institution>Fondation ARC pour la Recherche sur le Cancer</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DOC20190508735</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vigouroux</surname><given-names>Robin J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-11-IDEX-0004-02</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chédotal</surname><given-names>Alain</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-10-LABX-65</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chédotal</surname><given-names>Alain</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A new eye-specific Dcc mutant combined with an improved clearing protocol for the eye and brain (EyeDISCO) reveals the requirement of the receptor Dcc for retinal development and maintenance.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Deleted in Colorectal Carcinoma (Dcc) is a transmembrane receptor discovered as a potential tumor suppressor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Pierceall et al., 1994</xref>). Dcc binds the extracellular matrix protein Netrin-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Keino-Masu et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Serafini et al., 1994</xref>). When bound to Netrin-1, Dcc activates downstream signaling partners such as MAP kinase, focal adhesion kinase (FAK) or Src kinases which ultimately influence cytoskeleton dynamics and cell motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Mehlen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Ren et al., 2004</xref>). However, Dcc is also a dependence receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Mehlen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Mehlen et al., 1998</xref>) which triggers cell death in absence of Netrin-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Llambi et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Mehlen et al., 2011</xref>). Although direct evidence linking Dcc to tumorigenesis was obtained in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Castets et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Krimpenfort et al., 2012</xref>), mutations in <italic>DCC</italic> were also identified in patients suffering from rare neurodevelopmental disorders including congenital mirror movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Depienne et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Srour et al., 2010</xref>) and corpus callosum dysgenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Jamuar et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Marsh et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Dcc is present in the developing central nervous system (CNS) and controls axon guidance and cell migration in the spinal cord, as well as in multiple brain areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Belle et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fazeli et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Fothergill et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Laumonnerie et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Schmidt et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Srivatsa et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Yee et al., 1999</xref>). Dcc expression persists in the postnatal and adult CNS where it is involved in synaptogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Horn et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Manitt et al., 2013</xref>) and myelination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Jarjour et al., 2008</xref>). In vivo evidence supporting Dcc function in CNS development was primarily obtained using <italic>Dcc</italic> knockout (KO) mice (a null allele) which lack Dcc in all cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fazeli et al., 1997</xref>). One of the most striking phenotype, a hypoplasia of the optic nerve, was reported in the visual system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Deiner et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Shi et al., 2010</xref>). In <italic>Dcc</italic> KO embryos, a large fraction of the retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axons which connects the eye to the brain via the optic nerve is unable to exit the retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Deiner et al., 1997</xref>). The presence of its ligand Netrin-1 at the optic disc, the exit point of the retina, together with the presence of hypoplasic optic nerves in <italic>Ntn1</italic> hypomorph mutant embryos suggested that Netrin-1 acts as a long range cue attracting Dcc-expressing RGC axons towards the optic nerve head (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Deiner et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Shi et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Dcc expression persists in RGC axons after they exit the retina and even postnatally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Shi et al., 2010</xref>) but as <italic>Dcc</italic> null mice die at birth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fazeli et al., 1997</xref>), its function at later stages of visual system development is unknown. In <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> tadpoles, Netrin-1 attracts RGC axons toward the optic disc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Shewan et al., 2002</xref>) and promotes RGC axon arborization and synapse formation within the tectum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Manitt et al., 2009</xref>). Importantly, recent studies using conditional knockout strategies have revisited the role of Netrin-1 in axon guidance at the CNS midline and suggested that Netrin-1 does not act as a long-range attractive cue for axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dominici et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Moreno-Bravo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Varadarajan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Wu et al., 2019</xref>). Although the conditional ablation of <italic>Dcc</italic> in specific neuronal classes recapitulates the axon guidance defects found in <italic>Dcc</italic> KO embryos in some systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">da Silva et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Peng et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Zelina et al., 2014</xref>), there is also evidence for a non-cell autonomous role in cortical projection neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Welniarz et al., 2017</xref>). Here, we have generated eye-specific <italic>Dcc</italic> mutants which are fully viable. We found that these mutant mice display severe optic nerve hypoplasia as well as axon pathfinding defects in visual centers that persist postnatally. These defects are accompanied by a massive elimination of RGCs and the death of a large subset of photoreceptors. We also describe EyeDISCO, a novel tissue-clearing method allowing whole-eye immunostaining that could open novel perspectives in vision research.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Dcc is broadly expressed in the developing retina</title><p>The presence of Dcc in RGCs had been previously shown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Deiner et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Shi et al., 2010</xref>). Here, we first studied the temporal and spatial expression pattern of Dcc in the developing mouse retina using an antibody recognizing the C-terminal region of Dcc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Mazelin et al., 2004</xref>). The first Dcc-immunoreactive cells were detected at embryonic day 11 (E11) in the dorsal half of the retina and co-localized with the early RGC marker, Islet1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–B</xref>; n = 3)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Austin et al., 1995</xref>). The specificity of the antibody was supported by the absence of staining in retinas from <italic>Dcc</italic> KO embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–D</xref>; n = 3). To get a better understanding of the spatial distribution of Dcc-expressing cells, we carried out whole-mount immunohistochemistry of Dcc and Islet1 at E11 followed by iDISCO+ clearing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Renier et al., 2016</xref>) and confocal microscopy for three-dimensional (3D) rendering. This confirmed that the early expression of Dcc at E11 is restricted to the medio-dorsal retina (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–D</xref>; n = 4). By E12, Dcc expression expanded and still co-localized with Islet1-positive cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E–H</xref>; n = 3) but not with the transcription factor Sox2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E–G</xref>; n = 3), a retinal progenitor cell (RPC) marker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kamachi et al., 1998</xref>). Thus, Dcc is only present in post-mitotic cells in the early retina. By E15, Dcc expression was broader and spanned both the apical and basal retina.

This is primarily due to the difficulty of inferring complex axon trajectories from simple retinal sections or retinal flat-mounts. In recent years, several tissue clearing protocols have been implemented to study the 3D cellular organization of complex organs such as the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Klingberg et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Renier et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Richardson and Lichtman, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Tainaka et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Tomer et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Vigouroux et al., 2017</xref>).

Different axon guidance molecules are critical for the proper targeting of RGC projections to the thalamus and to the superior colliculus. In the absence of reelin, RGC axons fail to target the vLGN and the IGL correctly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Su et al., 2011</xref>). Once RGC axons have reached their target they then refine between ipsi- and contra-lateral territories. During this process, EphB or ephrinBs are required for RGCs to dictate their final position in the superior colliculus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hindges et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Thakar et al., 2011</xref>). In the <italic>Dcc</italic> cKO, RGCs target the LGN and superior colliculus normally but we observe an expansion of the ipsilateral territory, thus hinting at a possible refinement defect.

Here, we show for the first time that intra-retinal loss of Dcc leads to an expansion in ipsilateral territory in the murine SC. Nevertheless, we cannot rule out that the expansion in ipsilateral projections within the SC may be a result of the significant death of RGCs observed in <italic>Dcc</italic> cKO retinas.</p><p>The organization of the accessory optic system (AOS) projections to the MTN, the NOT, and the OPT is altered in <italic>Dcc</italic> mutants. These defects were constant and reproducible. Moreover, AlexaFluor-CTB is fluorescent enough to label isolated axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Li et al., 2015</xref>) and therefore it is unlikely that a significant fraction of visual axons could not be traced. Although the major input to the AOS is constituted of ON Direction Selective Ganglion Cells (DSGC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dhande et al., 2013</xref>), ON-OFF DSGCs also project to AOS nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kay et al., 2011</xref>). The MTN is innervated by ON-OFF DSGCs which control eye movement and give information for upward motion (dMTN) or downward motion (vMTN) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Borst and Euler, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Yonehara et al., 2009</xref>). However, RGCs projecting to the MTN are homogeneously spread across the retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Sun et al., 2015</xref>). Little is known about the cues guiding DSGC axons to the MTN besides the transmembrane semaphorin Sema6A and its receptors PlexinA2/A4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Sun et al., 2015</xref>). Contactin-4 and the amyloid precursor protein are necessary for DSGC’s axons to project in the NOT, but not the MTN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Osterhout et al., 2015</xref>). As Dcc protein is homogeneously expressed in embryonic RGCs, one could wonder why we observe a specific guidance defect in the MTN. One hypothesis could be that co-receptors of Dcc, such as Unc5d could potentiate the MTN defect observed in our <italic>Dcc</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Murcia-Belmonte et al., 2019</xref>). Furthermore, the differential distribution of Netrin-1 protein within the visual nuclei could be another area of study to explain the heterogeneous defects observed in our Dcc mutants. Still, we cannot rule out that the loss of RGCs in our Dcc mutants could impact axonal arborization due to a reduced competition between neighboring RGC axons. Further investigations should be performed to test whether DSGCs may be specifically impacted by Dcc perturbation using MTN-specific mouse lines such as the SPIG1:GFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Yonehara et al., 2008</xref>) and Hoxd10:GFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dhande et al., 2013</xref>) knock-in mouse lines. Overall, we uncover a new role for Dcc in the innervation of the MTN, the NOT and the OPT.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Why do RGCs die in eye-specific <italic>Dcc</italic> mutants?</title><p>Although the overall death of RGCs is homogeneous, only a portion aberrantly invade the subretinal space. This suggests that the death of RGCs is not merely correlated to the misprojection phenotype. To survive, RGCs require trophic factors such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), neurotrophin 4 (NT4), and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) secreted by the superior colliculus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Meyer-Franke et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Raff et al., 1993</xref>). A possibility is that too few RGC axons make it to the superior colliculus to provide sufficient trophic support. This massive RGC death could also result from the elimination of the misrouted RGCs axons as previously demonstrated in the zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Poulain and Chien, 2013</xref>). Netrin-1 through Dcc has been shown to promote synaptogenesis of cortical neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Goldman et al., 2013</xref>). Therefore, an abnormal synaptogenesis of <italic>Dcc</italic>-deficient RGC axons with their target neurons could also induce their degeneration.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Photoreceptor cell degeneration</title><p>In addition to RGCs death <italic>Dcc</italic> cKO mutants display major retinal dysplasia, limited to the retinal outer nuclear layer. These undulations in the ONL often referred as rosettes in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Mears et al., 2001</xref>), are among the most prominent features of retinal degeneration along with photoreceptor cell death and underdeveloped outer segments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Genové et al., 2014</xref>). In <italic>Dkk3:cre;Dcc<sup>lox/lox</sup></italic> mice, the rosettes are only present in the inferior half of the retina but span from the nasal to the temporal sides. To our knowledge, localized rosettes have only been described in <italic>Crb1</italic> mutant mice. <italic>Crb1<sup>rd8</sup>/Crb1<sup>rd8</sup></italic> mice display rosettes in the inferior nasal quadrant of the retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Mehalow et al., 2003</xref>) whereas in <italic>Crb1<sup>–/–</sup></italic> mice retinal degeneration occurs in the inferior temporal quadrant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">van de Pavert et al., 2004</xref>).

What could explain the degeneration of a subset of photoreceptors? Based on our results, it is more likely that this phenotype is related to the intra-retinal pathfinding defects. First, rosettes were observed as early as E15, concomitantly with the first misrouted axons in the retina. Therefore, misguided RGC axons invading the subretinal space could separate photoreceptors from RPE. Indeed, interactions between the RPE and presumptive photoreceptor outer segments are crucial for their proper development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Marmorstein, 2001</xref>). Early ablation (E10–11) of RPE in mouse retina also results in a disorganization of retinal layers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Raymond and Jackson, 1995</xref>). Moreover, rats with dysfunctioning RPE cells show photoreceptor death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">D'Cruz et al., 2000</xref>). Second, several studies have linked rosette formation with outer limiting membrane defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Mehalow et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Rich et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Stuck et al., 2012</xref>). It is thus likely that misguided RGC axons in our <italic>Dcc</italic> cKO mice alter the outer limiting membrane leading to photoreceptor degeneration. Third, we show that Dcc is expressed homogeneously in Crx<sup>+</sup> cells at E15. Using the <italic>Dkk3</italic> promoter leads to a complete removal of <italic>Dcc</italic> in all retinal progenitors. If Dcc played a role in proper photoreceptor development we would expect that all photoreceptor cells would degenerate. Finally, we observe that M- and S-cones as well as rods are all present within rosettes. These results support the idea that in <italic>Dcc</italic> cKO mice, photoreceptor cell death is not limited to a specific cell type but rather triggered by RGC axons. Nonetheless, retinal physiology in our Dcc mutants is globally perturbed, indicating either that rosettes (which account for ~20% of the retina) are sufficient to impact the ERG or that photoreceptor defects may not only be restricted to rosette territories. Quantification of the ONL outside of rosettes in Dcc cKO mice shows a dramatic thinning compared to control littermates. It would be of interest to investigate whether Dcc plays a cell autonomous role in photoreceptors.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Dcc’s mechanism of action</title><p>Here, we show that Dcc acts cell autonomously in RGCs to confine their axons to the retina but that the phenotype is heterogeneous. In <italic>Dkk3:cre;Dcc<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice, some RGC axons exit the retina and even project to the CNS, suggesting that they are still properly guided in the absence of Dcc. On the other hand, other RGC axons aberrantly project apically into the subretinal space. These results suggest that the long-range guidance of RGC axons to the optic disc is not mediated by Dcc. It rather acts as a short range guidance receptor preventing RGC axons from escaping the neural retina and staying in the OFL, as shown for hindbrain commissural axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Moreno-Bravo et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Yung et al., 2018</xref>).

Why the phenotype is heterogeneous is unclear as the expression levels of Dcc (based on immunocytochemistry) in embryonic RGCs appear similar across the retina. This could be explained by a differential expression of co-receptors or downstream partners in different subclasses of RGCs. Evidence for this phenotypic heterogeneity is also found at a later stage and further suggests that specific populations of RGCs are differentially affected by the loss of Dcc.</p><p>Most of Dcc’s known functions such as growth cone attraction are mediated by its P3 intracellular domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Finger et al., 2002</xref>). The <italic>Dcc</italic><sup>Kanga</sup> mice lacking the exon encoding the P3 intracellular domain present the same phenotype as the <italic>Dcc</italic> KO mice, with a missing corpus callosum and an aberrantly projecting corticospinal tract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Finger et al., 2002</xref>). The observation that <italic>Dcc</italic><sup>Kanga</sup> mice share many of the phenotypes observed in <italic>Dcc</italic> cKO mice suggests that they are indeed directly dependent on Dcc signaling and not the signaling of a Dcc co-receptor. Moreover, we show that deletion of Netrin-1 phenocopies the defects observed in the embryonic retina. Thus, we demonstrate that Dcc/Netrin-1 signaling is critical for the proper targeting of RGCs.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>EyeDISCO is a powerful technique to study the eye</title><p>In the past decade, there have been significant developments in tissue clearing protocols. However, none have addressed the challenge of clearing densely pigmented tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Susaki and Ueda, 2016</xref>). Recent protocols allowing for whole-mouse visualization are still hindered by densely pigmented tissues such as the eyes or the skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cai et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Pan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Tainaka et al., 2018</xref>). Efforts to remove densely pigmented tissues such as the melanophores of the RPE of the eye have almost entirely been carried out on tissue sections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alexander et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Orchard, 2007</xref>). For instance, using potassium permanganate and oxalic acid in aqueous conditions Iwai-Takekoshi and colleagues were able to remove RPE pigments in embryonic sections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Iwai-Takekoshi et al., 2016</xref>). This depigmentation protocol has however been shown to reduce the compatibility/efficacy of immunolabelling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alexander et al., 1996</xref>). Recently, a de-pigmentation protocol of postnatal eyes amenable to tissue clearing has been published (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Henning et al., 2019</xref>). This protocol carries out an H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment in aqueous conditions which favors the generation of microbubbles that damage the retina and result in retinal detachment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Henning et al., 2019</xref>). In addition, the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment is done at 55°C, further deteriorating as well as reducing antigenicity of the tissue. Only 2 antibodies were validated using this protocol. Here, we report an amenable tissue clearing protocol for whole-embryo and whole adult eye clearing compatible with immunolabeling. The immunolabeling protocol is carried out at RT and requires passive diffusion of low titer antibodies. Thus far, 17 antibodies have been validated, encompassing transcription factors, transmembrane and cytoplasmic proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>).</p><p>A current limitation of our method is the cellular resolution at which we are able to carry out whole-eye imaging using LSFM, as our setup is composed of a macroscope with a 2X objective coupled to a 6.3X numerical zoom (12.6X) giving a maximum x/y resolution of 5.16 μm/pixel. However, the recent development of higher magnification objectives compatible with DBE will allow for more resolved images, equivalent to confocal microscopes, that enable whole-eye cell-counting approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Pan et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Altogether, EyeDISCO provides a novel opportunity to image the visual system like never achieved before. This protocol allows the study of visual projections from the eye to the brain, thereby constituting a powerful tool for the screening of mutants. This protocol could also prove extremely useful to study the eye as a whole for better understanding eye disorders.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>All experiments were designed using the 3R rule: to reduce, refine, and replace the use of animals.

re-assessing the function of DCC during retinal development using a new eye-specific Dcc mutant mouse (Dkk-Cre) that removes Dcc specifically in retinal progenitors, thereby bypassing lethality at birth. The authors confirm previous reports that the absence of Dcc produces severe intra-retinal misguidance of RGC axons, and in postnatal brains, that some RGCs still leave the retina and project to visual nuclei with multiple targeting defects. Postnatal loss of RGCs also ensues and the photoreceptor layer does not develop properly, with rosette-like structures forming in the outer retina and reduced photoreceptor function. Both the projection and targeting defects and the photoreceptor results are apparent with a tissue clearing protocol the authors named &quot;EyeDISCO&quot; that provides striking view of the entire visual system and retina in whole mount. The approach overall constitutes a powerful mutant screen for eye and visual pathway perturbations.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Revisiting the role of Dcc in visual system development with a novel eye clearing method&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by Marianne Bronner as the Senior Editor, a Reviewing Editor, and three reviewers. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Anand Swaroop (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The reviewers were overall enthusiastic about your study, in which you generate an eye-specific DCC mutant mouse to more completely characterize the role of DCC in visual system development, especially at postnatal stages. Given that the total knockout dies at birth, you nicely demonstrate that DCC removal not only affects the exit of axons from the eye, as assumed for years, but severe intra-retinal misguidance of RGC axons occurs, unusually, some axons extending within the retina in between the RPE and photoreceptor layers. Further, even with the ensuing optic nerve hypoplasia, a subset of RGCs innervate retinorecipient regions in apparently display normal innervation patterns. The conditional loss of DCC in the eye also results in the novel phenotype of RGC loss and photoreceptor dysplasia in adult mice.</p><p>Your paper also includes a welcome optimization of a clearing protocol, EyeDISCO, that allows total removal of RPE pigment by bleaching and therefore a better visualization of the clarified retina and the eye-to-brain. The study thus expands our view of the role of DCC during axon pathway development and maintenance, and a bonus of an important methodology. The paper is a hybrid data presentation and tools and resources, and both aspects will be of high interest to the vision community.</p><p>However, even though the reviewers thought your paper suitable for <italic>eLife</italic>, they had numerous comments on the organization of the data and narrative, and encourage you to make the text more concise and better organized to highlight the main points.</p><p>They further thought that the clearing protocol, however useful, is too long and disrupts the flow of the paper, making the Results section a bit incoherent. We suggest putting the clearing methods in the Materials and methods section. In addition, the novelty of the new clearing/bleaching methods is diluted by presenting a greater proportion of the data using traditional flatmount/sectioning techniques.</p><p>Other comments to be addressed include clarifying the RGC projection phenotype to the MTN, explanations for why only certain RGCs make it to targets, and better resolution on photoreceptor loss, i.e., rods vs cones.</p><p>Finally, while the quantitative analyses are much appreciated, presenting the numbers within the Results section is distracting; these data could be presented in the figure legends.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>We have included the reviews at the end of this email so that you can better amend the text. All of the listed points are deemed essential but are in the main textual.<italic>Reviewer #1:</italic>Vigouroux et al. here generate an eye-specific DCC mutant mouse to more completely characterize the role of DCC in visual system development. First, they analyze DCC expression during early development of the eye. Using their conditional DCC strategy, they find that RGCs lacking DCC display altered axonal trajectories, with a significant percentage extending toward the apical surface of the retina. As previously appreciated, these mice also have severe hypoplasia of the optic nerve. The authors note that not every RGC axon trajectory is altered, as some retinorecipient regions apparently display normal innervation patterns. Novel findings include the observation of severe retinal thinning, RGC loss, and photoreceptor dysplasia in adult mutant mice. In addition, they also present a novel whole eye tissue clearing method which they use to draw several of the conclusions made in this paper.</p><p>This study describes in great detail a role for DCC in the developing visual system, providing important data which complements that obtained previously by others using null DCC alleles. Though it was previously known that DCC interactions with netrin-1 are required for a large percentage of RGC axons to exit the eye early in development, it was unclear how DCC functions postnatally and into adulthood. Additionally, the presentation of a novel eye clearing model that allows visualization of axon trajectories in 3D space strengthens the conclusions drawn about DCC function in this paper. This clearing method will certainly aid in future studies of this type and will become a valuable resource for the field. For all of these reasons, this paper is appears to be suitable for publication <italic>eLife</italic>, following attention to points raised below.</p><p>1) Please comment as to why one side has a higher innervation density as indicated by CTB labeling in Figure 6B? One would expect that both projection patterns would be equally affected in this genetic background. Is this just animal to animal variability?</p><p>2) The point is made that there are apparently differential degrees of retinorecipient innervation defects in the eye-specific DCC mutant, however this seems to be based on the intensity CTB labeled projections (AOS targets (not only the MTN), which are not as densely innervated, appear weaker, as one might expect). The authors should provide more explanation to rule out issues relating to saturation of signaling in more densely innervated targets as opposed to those that receive innervation from many few RGCs. If there are is no additional evidence to support RGC subtype-specific effects resulting from the loss of DCC then this conclusion must be qualified.</p><p>3) Please speculate as to why different classes of RGCs and their projection patterns are thought to be differentially affected in these mutants? MTN vs. SC vs. LGN vs. SCN?</p><p>4) Please comment on whether, and to what degree, shrinkage is observed of the tissue using this novel clearing approach?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic>Vigouroux et al. have re-assessed the function of DCC during retinal development using a new eye-specific Dcc mutant mouse (by Dkk-Cre) to bypass lethality and by introducing a new tissue clearing protocol called &quot;EyeDISCO&quot; to remove melanin. Previously reported Dcc-knockout mice die a few hrs after birth, making it difficult to study DCC function in postnatal stages of visual system development. Using the new Dcc mutant that removes Dcc specifically in retinal progenitors, the authors are able to demonstrate that the absence of DCC results in RGC guidance defects (made possible for EyeDISCO) and postnatal loss of RGCs. The authors also describe the phenotype of kanga/- mutant mouse. Finally, the eye-specific Dcc mutant also shows rosette like structures in the outer retina and reduced rod function.</p><p>Overall, the results are significant. The data justify the conclusions. A major focus appears to be on eye-clearing methodology, which seems to be better than another published recently by Hennings et al., 2019, and demonstrating its use in elucidating the mutant phenotype that was previously difficult to observe. The phenotypes being described for the Dcc eye mutant provide new clues about its function. This is an appropriate article for Tools and Resources.</p><p>However, the story seemed to lack coherence and finesse. The main points could be better highlighted/organized. The novelty of the new clearing/bleaching methods is diluted by much of the data obtained via tradition flatmount/sectioning techniques.</p><p>Overall, the text is too long. The manuscript, especially Results section, requires tightening and can be made concise. While the quantitative analyses are much appreciated, too many numbers within the Results section create distraction. Similarly, too much of background and methodological detail within Results make it incoherent. Some of these could be shifted to Introduction or Methods section. The quantification numbers could be presented in the figure legends.</p><p>It's not clear what value the Dcc(kanga) model had for the study. Even if there was more of a difference, a direct comparison with the Dcc-cKO would be more useful than comparison to control only.</p><p>The photoreceptor part is quite interesting but not much explored. The rosettes are seen in a few other retinal mutants (such as Nrl-knockout and rd7). The authors should expand more in Discussion section on DCC function in photoreceptors and on how its loss leads to rosettes and loss of rods. The authors suggest that the defect is somewhat limited to s-cones but the authors should stain for m-cones.</p><p>It's not clear why cones would be affected more than rods, as it seems based on ERG data. The authors propose in the discussion that it could be a secondary defect resulting from misguided RGCs and potentially defective OLM. Why not co-stain for RGCs or OLM markers with PR markers? This would make a better case since the RGC defect is variable and we can't be sure that there are misguided RGCs in the same regions where the rosettes are. Why PRs are reduced in number? Seems to be developmental defect, not degeneration.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p></disp-quote><p>In this work the authors use cutting edge technologies to visualize all the defects produced as a consequence of removing Dcc specifically from the retina. They first confirm previous reports showing that the absence of Dcc produces severe intra-retinal misguidance of RGC axons. Then, they discover that a subset of RGCs are still able to leave the retina and reach the visual nuclei where they project showing multiple targeting defects. They further notice defects in the photoreceptors layer, a phenotype not previously reported in Dcc null mice. To perform many of these analyses they optimize a protocol that allows total removal of pigment and therefore a better visualization of the clarified retina.</p><p>There are several reasons that make this work potentially suitable for this journal. First, it reveals for the first time that the absence of retinal Dcc does not only affect the exit of visual axons from the eye, as it has been assumed for years. Second, they conclusively show that the function of Dcc in the retina is restricted to a subpopulation, not to all, RGCs and suggest that Dcc is important for the targeting of retinal axon projections to the medial terminal nucleus in the brain. They also discover that Dcc is expressed in photoreceptors and it is necessary for the proper formation of the photoreceptors layer.</p><p>There are however several aspects of the paper that need to be clarified:</p><p>1) As the authors point out, the rosettes observed in the ventral retina are likely a consequence of the intra-retinal misrouting of RGC axons. In Figure 5Q, the layer of photoreceptors looks much thinner than in the controls. Is this phenotype homogeneous across the retina or it is also only restricted to the ventral part? In Figure 1—figure supplement 1I is shown that Dcc is expressed in Crx cells (Crx is a cone-rod specific TF) and because the Dkk3-cre line also removes genes from photoreceptors, it is possible that photoreceptors are being intrinsically and homogeneously affected through the entire retina and not only in the ventral retina as a consequence of RGC misrouting.</p><p>2) Subsection “Dcc intracellular signaling is required for retinal projection targeting in the Brain”. The authors infer a novel role for Dcc signaling in RGC guidance to the MTN from the projection phenotype to the MTN in the Dcc kanga mutants. Why is this population particularly affected? From what retinal region do the RGC projecting to the MTN come from? It would be possible to perform retrograde labeling from this nucleus to answer this question. If they all come from a particular region perhaps these cells are more affected because they have higher levels of Dcc?</p><p>3) It exists also the possibility that the phenotypes observed in the visual nuclei of Dcc mutants are the consequence of having fewer RGCs. In the main visual nuclei it seems likely that rather than a role for Dcc in guidance or targeting, the remaining RGC axon terminals arborize in a different manner because there is less competition between neighboring RGC axons. As the authors state, there is not much information about the timing, guidance or targeting mechanisms of visual axons projecting to the MTN and therefore, this possibility should be at least discussed.</p><p>4) I believe is not a good idea to make such a big deal about the optimization of the protocol to remove melanin. What is described in this manuscript is basically an improvement of previous protocols. Therefore, I think that, although is a nice and important advance and it should be mentioned, the part dedicated to explain the protocol is too long and distracts from the main message of the paper. It would be better to make a detailed description of the protocol in a technical or more specialized journal.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Revisiting the role of Dcc in visual system development with a novel eye clearing method&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Marianne Bronner (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>All three of the reviewers are satisfied with your attempts to clarify the text and figures and with your explanations regarding the points raised in the reviews.</p><p>Your manuscript presents important data re-assessing the function of DCC during retinal development using a new eye-specific Dcc mutant mouse (Dkk-Cre) that removes Dcc specifically in retinal progenitors, thereby bypassing lethality at birth. First, you confirm previous reports showing that the absence of Dcc produces severe intra-retinal misguidance of RGC axons, and with the ability to examine postnatal brains, you demonstrate that some RGCs are still able to leave the retina and project to visual nuclei have multiple targeting defects. Second, the absence of DCC results in postnatal loss of RGCs, and because DCC is expressed in photoreceptors, you show that in its absence, the photoreceptor layer does not develop properly, with rosette-like structures forming in the outer retina and reduced photoreceptor function. Importantly, both the projection and targeting defects and the photoreceptor results were made apparent by a tissue clearing protocol you have developed called &quot;EyeDISCO&quot;, providing an overview of the entire visual system and retina. Overall the data on the visual projections and photoreceptors are valuable and the presentation properly detailed and quantified.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>1) Dcc defects: One reviewer had a remaining concern on how you envision that Dcc/Netrin signaling might act intraretinally in a short-range manner. Are you proposing that Netrin1 is secreted by optic disc cells and diffuses all across the retina? This should be more clearly discussed.</p><p>2) Materials and methods section, especially EyeDISCO: you improved the manuscript by moving the methods out of the Results section into the Materials and methods section. Nonethless,</p><p>a) Reviewer 2 (comment #1) points out, &quot;The novelty of the new clearing/bleaching methods is diluted by much of the data obtained via tradition flatmount/sectioning techniques.&quot; We understand that you do not currently have access to a higher resolution objective compatible with DBE and LSFM to allow for precise whole-eye retinal cell counting, and that you are working on this. In the Discussion section, it would be welcome if you could to comment on the current limitations of the technique/microscopy to view retinal cells.</p><p>b) From a positive angle, you could highlight the benefits of the clearing approach for future studies, especially for visualizing axon pathways, than you do currently. For example, subsection “EyeDISCO is a powerful technique to study the eye” read like you are promoting EyeDISCO resolution only for analysis of photoreceptor integrity, and do not cite the quite spectacular visualization of axon tracts and targeting.

All of the listed points are deemed essential but are in the main textual.Reviewer #1:Vigouroux et al. here generate an eye-specific DCC mutant mouse to more completely characterize the role of DCC in visual system development. First, they analyze DCC expression during early development of the eye. Using their conditional DCC strategy, they find that RGCs lacking DCC display altered axonal trajectories, with a significant percentage extending toward the apical surface of the retina. As previously appreciated, these mice also have severe hypoplasia of the optic nerve. The authors note that not every RGC axon trajectory is altered, as some retinorecipient regions apparently display normal innervation patterns. Novel findings include the observation of severe retinal thinning, RGC loss, and photoreceptor dysplasia in adult mutant mice. In addition, they also present a novel whole eye tissue clearing method which they use to draw several of the conclusions made in this paper.This study describes in great detail a role for DCC in the developing visual system, providing important data which complements that obtained previously by others using null DCC alleles. Though it was previously known that DCC interactions with netrin-1 are required for a large percentage of RGC axons to exit the eye early in development, it was unclear how DCC functions postnatally and into adulthood. Additionally, the presentation of a novel eye clearing model that allows visualization of axon trajectories in 3D space strengthens the conclusions drawn about DCC function in this paper. This clearing method will certainly aid in future studies of this type and will become a valuable resource for the field. For all of these reasons, this paper is appears to be suitable for publication eLife, following attention to relatively minor points raised below.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for his/her positive remarks on our study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) Please comment as to why one side has a higher innervation density as indicated by CTB labeling in figure 6B? One would expect that both projection patterns would be equally affected in this genetic background. Is this just animal to animal variability?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that the picture in Figure 6B shows a slight asymmetry in the retinal ganglion cell projections. However, this asymmetry is not significant and just reflects eye-to-eye variability in RGC in a given mouse. Indeed, quantifications of optic nerve volumes extracted from CTB-injected mutants does not show a higher variability than in control mice. For example, optic nerve volumes at P15 (SEM ±1.92x10<sup>6</sup>μm<sup>3</sup> compared to ±1.92x10<sup>6</sup>μm<sup>3</sup>) and at P30 (SEM ±2.48x10<sup>6</sup>μm<sup>3</sup> compared to ±2.51x10<sup>6</sup>μm<sup>3</sup>).</p><p>However, there may be a slight difference between left and right eye projections that we did not take into account in our quantifications.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The point is made that there are apparently differential degrees of retinorecipient innervation defects in the eye-specific DCC mutant, however this seems to be based on the intensity CTB labeled projections (AOS targets (not only the MTN), which are not as densely innervated, appear weaker, as one might expect). The authors should provide more explanation to rule out issues relating to saturation of signaling in more densely innervated targets as opposed to those that receive innervation from many few RGCs. If there are is no additional evidence to support RGC subtype-specific effects resulting from the loss of DCC then this conclusion must be qualified.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that there is still a slight possibility that we are missing some visual projections by injecting CTB in the eye. However, CTB tracing is currently the most common method used to study visual projections in mice and we are not aware that it only partially traces visual projections. In optic nerve regeneration experiments, single CTB+ axons could be reconstructed indicating that the tracer is fluorescent enough to label isolated axons (Li et al., 2015). Even if brightness is increased to the maximum, no additional labeling is seen. If staining was incomplete, it would also mean that there is a specific weak staining of AOS axons. However, we have added this possible point of discrepancy to the discussion in the revised text.</p><p>We agree with the reviewer that it would be interesting to further tease apart the mechanism responsible for RGC-specific guidance defects in <italic>Dcc</italic> cKO mice. A good strategy would be to cross the <italic>Dcc</italic> conditional mutants to MTN-specific knock in lines (SPIG1:GFP and Hoxd10:GFP). However, we do not currently have access to these lines in the lab and it would probably take a year to get the results.</p><p>In an attempt to begin probing at this question, we have purchased 2 commercial antibodies specific for direction-selective RGCs, Hoxd10 and SPIG1. Unfortunately, after testing multiple immunolabeling protocols, none of these antibodies worked in our hands.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Please speculate as to why different classes of RGCs and their projection patterns are thought to be differentially affected in these mutants? MTN vs. SC vs. LGN vs. SCN?</p></disp-quote><p>We observe that the intensity of Dcc immunolabelling is homogeneous across the entire retina. Thus, we do not believe that specific RGCs may express differential levels of the protein (based on immunostaining). We can only propose at this time that RGC-specific defects may either be due to co-receptors of Dcc which may be differentially expressed in RGCs of the retina (such as UNC5d)(Murcia-Belmonte et al., 2019). Another hypothesis could be that Dcc-specific ligands, in particular Netrin-1 may be differentially expressed in visual targets in the brain and that Dcc/Netrin-1 signaling does not act equally in all RGCs. This has been added to the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Please comment on whether, and to what degree, shrinkage is observed of the tissue using this novel clearing approach?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. To address this point, we have quantified the shrinkage of an adult mouse eye following EyeDISCO clearing. We observe a mild shrinkage of approximately 10%. This shrinkage was isotropic across rostro-caudal, dorso-medial, and medio-lateral axes. This was added to the results (Figure 7—figure supplement 1A-D).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:Vigouroux et al. have re-assessed the function of DCC during retinal development using a new eye-specific Dcc mutant mouse (by Dkk-Cre) to bypass lethality and by introducing a new tissue clearing protocol called &quot;EyeDISCO&quot; to remove melanin. Previously reported Dcc-knockout mice die a few hrs after birth, making it difficult to study DCC function in postnatal stages of visual system development. Using the new Dcc mutant that removes Dcc specifically in retinal progenitors, the authors are able to demonstrate that the absence of DCC results in RGC guidance defects (made possible for EyeDISCO) and postnatal loss of RGCs. The authors also describe the phenotype of kanga/- mutant mouse. Finally, the eye-specific Dcc mutant also shows rosette like structures in the outer retina and reduced rod function.Overall, the results are significant. The data justify the conclusions. A major focus appears to be on eye-clearing methodology, which seems to be better than another published recently by Hennings et al., 2019, and demonstrating its use in elucidating the mutant phenotype that was previously difficult to observe. The phenotypes being described for the Dcc eye mutant provide new clues about its function. This is an appropriate article for Tools and Resources.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for his constructive comments on our manuscript. We also agree that we devoted too much space to the eye clearing methods in the original version. The revised manuscript is more focused on the <italic>Dcc</italic> knockout data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>However, the story seemed to lack coherence and finesse. The main points could be better highlighted/organized. The novelty of the new clearing/bleaching methods is diluted by much of the data obtained via tradition flatmount/sectioning techniques.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that many of the quantifications were carried out on flat-mounted retinas. However, we do not currently have access to a well enough resolved objective compatible with DBE and LSFM to allow for precise whole-eye retinal cell counting. We are currently developing such tools to carry out this precise task. This however would not change the validity results of our quantifications performed on flat-mounted retinas.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Overall, the text is too long. The manuscript, especially Results section, requires tightening and can be made concise. While the quantitative analyses are much appreciated, too many numbers within the Results section create distraction. Similarly, too much of background and methodological detail within Results section make it incoherent. Some of these could be shifted to Introduction or Methods section. The quantification numbers could be presented in the figure legends.</p></disp-quote><p>To improve the readability of the paper, and as suggested by the reviewer, we have removed all quantifications from the main text and have moved them to figure legends. Furthermore, we have removed the methodological details of the clearing protocol from the Results section. Despite adding new data, the Results section has been shortened (-500 words).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It's not clear what value the Dcc(kanga) model had for the study. Even if there was more of a difference, a direct comparison with the Dcc-cKO would be more useful than comparison to control only.</p></disp-quote><p>We understand that we did not convey well enough the importance of the <italic>Dcc Kanga</italic> mutants. In order to better present the value of these mutants we have re-arranged the text.</p><p>Moreover, we agree with the reviewer that a direct comparison between our mutants would be more insightful. To that respect, we have added quantifications directly comparing visual nuclei volumes between <italic>Dcc Kanga</italic> mutants and <italic>Dcc</italic> cKO mice (Figure 8—figure supplement 1A-C).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The photoreceptor part is quite interesting but not much explored. The rosettes are seen in a few other retinal mutants (such as Nrl-knockout and rd7). The authors should expand more in Discussion section on DCC function in photoreceptors and on how its loss leads to rosettes and loss of rods. The authors suggest that the defect is somewhat limited to s-cones but the authors should stain for m-cones.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer. In order to better characterize the photoreceptors affected in <italic>Dcc</italic> mutant mice, we have carried out cryosections and whole-mount immunostaining for S- and M-cones as well as for Rods. We observe that both S- and M-cones are present in the vicinity and within the rosettes in both <italic>Dcc</italic> cKO (Figure 7—figure supplement 2A-L) and <italic>Dcc Kanga</italic> mice (Figure 8—figure supplement 1N-O). Furthermore, Rhodopsin is also expressed within rosette structures (Figure 7—figure supplement 2M-P).</p><p>Lastly, we have expanded on the function of Dcc in photoreceptor development/maintenance in the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It's not clear why cones would be affected more than rods, as it seems based on ERG data. The authors propose in the discussion that it could be a secondary defect resulting from misguided RGCs and potentially defective OLM. Why not co-stain for RGCs or OLM markers with PR markers? This would make a better case since the RGC defect is variable and we can't be sure that there are misguided RGCs in the same regions where the rosettes are. Why PRs are reduced in number? Seems to be developmental defect, not degeneration.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer. In order to emphasize the developmental defect of axon tracts separating the photoreceptors from the retinal pigment epithelium, we have carried out cryosections and labeled for RGC tracts (ßIII tubulin) and photoreceptors (Opn1sw)(Figure 4—figure supplement 1A-D).</p><p>We do not believe cones would be more affected than rods in our mutants. To target this, we have carried out immuno-labelling for cones (S and M) as well as rods (Figure 7—figure supplement 2A-P). All photoreceptors are impacted similarly. However, since the proportion of cones to rods in the murine retina is lower, it could explain why we have a stronger defect on the ERG data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:In this work the authors use cutting edge technologies to visualize all the defects produced as a consequence of removing Dcc specifically from the retina. They first confirm previous reports showing that the absence of Dcc produces severe intra-retinal misguidance of RGC axons. Then, they discover that a subset of RGCs are still able to leave the retina and reach the visual nuclei where they project showing multiple targeting defects. They further notice defects in the photoreceptors layer, a phenotype not previously reported in Dcc null mice. To perform many of these analyses they optimize a protocol that allows total removal of pigment and therefore a better visualization of the clarified retina.There are several reasons that make this work potentially suitable for this journal. First, it reveals for the first time that the absence of retinal Dcc does not only affect the exit of visual axons from the eye, as it has been assumed for years. Second, they conclusively show that the function of Dcc in the retina is restricted to a subpopulation, not to all, RGCs and suggest that Dcc is important for the targeting of retinal axon projections to the medial terminal nucleus in the brain. They also discover that Dcc is expressed in photoreceptors and it is necessary for the proper formation of the photoreceptors layer.There are however several aspects of the paper that need to be clarified:1) As the authors point out, the rosettes observed in the ventral retina are likely a consequence of the intra-retinal misrouting of RGC axons. In Figure 5Q, the layer of photoreceptors looks much thinner than in the controls. Is this phenotype homogeneous across the retina or it is also only restricted to the ventral part?</p></disp-quote><p>We observe that the retinal thinning is homogeneous across the retina. This information was added to the Results section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Figure 1—figure supplement 1I is shown that Dcc is expressed in Crx cells (Crx is a cone-rod specific TF) and because the Dkk3-cre line also removes genes from photoreceptors, it is possible that photoreceptors are being intrinsically and homogeneously affected through the entire retina and not only in the ventral retina as a consequence of RGC misrouting.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this valuable question. Indeed, the formation of rosettes is restricted to specific regions in the retina. However, this does not mean that photoreceptor function outside of rosettes is normal. Several observations allude to the possibility that Dcc may play a role in photoreceptor maintenance retina-wide. Firstly, Dcc is transiently expressed in Crx<sup>+</sup> cells. Furthermore, our ERG data show that the overall physiological response of the retina is altered. Therefore, it is possible that loss of Dcc may impact photoreceptor function outside of rosettes. Lastly, we have carried out quantifications in our <italic>Dcc</italic> cKO mice of the ONL thickness from regions of the retina outside of rosettes. Indeed, we visualize a dramatic thinning of the ONL (Figure 7—figure supplement 2Q-U). However, the observation that rosette formations do not progress overtime may point to the opposite hypothesis that loss of Dcc does not induce degeneration of photoreceptors. These points were added to the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Subsection “Dcc intracellular signaling is required for retinal projection targeting in the Brain”. The authors infer a novel role for Dcc signaling in RGC guidance to the MTN from the projection phenotype to the MTN in the Dcc kanga mutants. Why is this population particularly affected? From what retinal region do the RGC projecting to the MTN come from?</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, we observe in the Dcc cKO and Dcc Kanga mice a specific defect in the MTN. RGCs projecting to the MTN are distributed homogeneously across the retina. However, several markers have been identified to specifically label these RGCs. Of note, SPIG1 and Hoxd10 label these cells. We have acquired these antibodies and have unfortunately not been able reveal a specific labelling. Both SPIG1:GFP and Hoxd10:GFP knock-in mouse lines exist. However, they are not available in the lab and would take us a long time to obtain. We have therefore included these points as perspectives in the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It would be possible to perform retrograde labeling from this nucleus to answer this question. If they all come from a particular region perhaps these cells are more affected because they have higher levels of Dcc?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this point. However, on whole-mount retinas, we observed a homogeneous expression of Dcc retina-wide. Furthermore, RGCs projecting to the MTN are spread across the retina, therefore simply carrying out a flat-mount or EyeDISCO of Dcc cKO retinas would not help us isolate this population. Indeed, retro-labelling the MTN with a tracer would allow us to track MTN-specific RGCs. However, whilst already quite technically challenging in wild type mice, carrying out these injections in the Dcc cKO mice would be very difficult since the volume of RGC projections to this nucleus is dramatically reduced.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) It exists also the possibility that the phenotypes observed in the visual nuclei of Dcc mutants are the consequence of having fewer RGCs. In the main visual nuclei it seems likely that rather than a role for Dcc in guidance or targeting, the remaining RGC axon terminals arborize in a different manner because there is less competition between neighboring RGC axons. As the authors state, there is not much information about the timing, guidance or targeting mechanisms of visual axons projecting to the MTN and therefore, this possibility should be at least discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer and have added this point to the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) I believe is not a good idea to make such a big deal about the optimization of the protocol to remove melanin. What is described in this manuscript is basically an improvement of previous protocols. Therefore, I think that, although is a nice and important advance and it should be mentioned, the part dedicated to explain the protocol is too long and distracts from the main message of the paper. It would be better to make a detailed description of the protocol in a technical or more specialized journal.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this point and suggestion. We have therefore removed all the unnecessary details of the EyeDISCO protocol.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:1) Dcc defects: One reviewer had a remaining concern on how you envision that Dcc/Netrin signaling might act intraretinally in a short-range manner. Are you proposing that Netrin1 is secreted by optic disc cells and diffuses all across the retina? This should be more clearly discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that the Dcc/Netrin-1 signaling should be more clearly discussed and therefore modified the Discussion section accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Materials and methods section, especially EyeDISCO: you improved the manuscript by moving the methods out of the Results section into the Materials and methods section. Nonethless,a) Reviewer 2 (comment #1) points out, &quot;The novelty of the new clearing/bleaching methods is diluted by much of the data obtained via tradition flatmount/sectioning techniques.&quot; We understand that you do not currently have access to a higher resolution objective compatible with DBE and LSFM to allow for precise whole-eye retinal cell counting, and that you are working on this. In the Discussion section, it would be welcome if you could to comment on the current limitations of the technique/microscopy to view retinal cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for his constructive remark and added comment on this topic in the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) From a positive angle, you could highlight the benefits of the clearing approach for future studies, especially for visualizing axon pathways, than. you do currently. For example, subsection “EyeDISCO is a powerful technique to study the eye” read like you are promoting EyeDISCO resolution only for analysis of photoreceptor integrity, and do not cite the quite spectacular visualization of axon tracts and targeting. The approach overall to view entire pathways is phenomenal and used together with visualizing eye defects constitutes a powerful screen for mutants; this message should be &quot;heard&quot; more clearly.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for his positive comment and changed the Discussion section correspondingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) More recent successes with pigment bleaching in the eye can be found in Iwai -Takekoshi et al., 2016 and 2018.</p></disp-quote><p>We added this method in the Discussion section and explained why we have not considered it.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Flow of the findings, and emphasis: In the reviewer consultation session, all three reviewers thought that the flow of the narrative, and the transitions between subsections in the Results section could be improved.a) To ameliorate this critique, you might consider changing the order of the subsections in the Results section, keeping the first three as is : subsection “Dcc is broadly expressed in the developing retina”, on Dcc expression, subsection “A novel eye-specific Dcc mutant”, on the novel mutant, subsection “Complexity of RGC guidance defects in Dcc KO revealed by a novel eye clearing method” on the novel clearing method, followed by subsection “Retinal projections in the brain, are altered in eye-specific Dcc mutants” on retinal projections in the brain and even move the last subsection “Dcc intracellular signaling is required for retinal projection targeting in the brain” after this section (thus keeping all the projection analysis together). You could end the Results section with subsection “Eye-specific deletion of Dcc alters retinal layer thickness” on retinal layer thickness and then with subsection “Dcc deletion leads to major retinal dysplasia and visual deficits” on Dcc deletion and retinal dysplasia. Admittedly you would have to alter figure numbers and citations, but you wouldn't have to change content of the figures and generally the Results section would read better.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this suggestion to improve the flow of the narrative. We changed the Results section accordingly. Nevertheless, these modifications introduced the retinal dysplasia phenotype in the Dcc Kanga mutants before the Dcc cKO.
