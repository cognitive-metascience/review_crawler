motor actions, can switch their activity to produce different behaviors. Both excitatory (E) and inhibitory (I) spinal neurons are necessary for motor behavior, but the influence of recruiting different ratios of E-to-I cells remains unclear. We constructed synthetic microphysical neural networks, called circuitoids, using precise combinations of spinal neuron subtypes derived from mouse stem cells. Circuitoids of purified excitatory interneurons were sufficient to generate oscillatory bursts with properties similar to in vivo central pattern generators. Inhibitory V1 neurons provided dual layers of regulation within excitatory rhythmogenic networks - they increased the rhythmic burst frequency of excitatory V3 neurons, and segmented excitatory motor neuron activity into sub-networks. Accordingly, the speed and pattern of spinal circuits that underlie complex motor behaviors may be regulated by quantitatively gating the intra-network cellular activity ratio of E-to-I neurons.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.21540.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.21540.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21540.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The nerve cells or neurons within an animal’s nervous system connect with one another like the wires in a complex circuit. Each neuron can send and receive signals and a major challenge in neuroscience is to understand how these circuits of neurons behave. To do this, researchers often use genetic tools and computer modeling to map the connections between the cells in a nervous system. However, it remains difficult to predict how an input signal will appear at the output after it passes through a network made of different types of neuron.</p><p>Brains contain many networks of interconnected neurons. Some of these networks send signals with a rhythmic pattern and typically drive repetitive movements such as breathing and walking. The networks are called central pattern generators (or CPGs for short). They contain both excitatory and inhibitory neurons and can generate rhythmic activity without any additional input. Nevertheless CPGs are not rigid, but can flexibly control when and how fast the muscles are activated to suit the animal's needs. It is thought the circuits are flexible because of the way excitatory and inhibitory neurons interact, but it is not known how these interactions define the behavior of the circuit.</p><p>Sternfeld et al. have now developed a new method to examine how the neurons that make up a circuit influence its activity. First, embryonic stem cells from mice were coaxed to develop into a number of subtypes of both excitatory and inhibitory neurons in the laboratory. These neurons were used to grow networks of neurons in a dish, named “circuitoids”. The precise combination of subtypes of neuron was deliberately varied between each circuitoid, and Sternfeld et al. then studied how the different circuitoids behaved.</p><p>Several subtypes of excitatory neurons showed rhythmic bursts of activity, just like simple CPGs. Moreover, the ratio of excitatory to inhibitory neurons in the circuitoids was critical for establishing how fast and synchronized the bursts of activity were across the network. It is possible that the brain also uses this simple strategy of varying the ratio of excitatory to inhibitory neurons in circuits of neurons to generate complex, yet highly flexible, circuits with rhythmic activity. Further work will be needed to test this idea.</p><p>Finally, other researchers will hopefully be able to use this new approach to construct circuitoids and learn more about how the brain generates and controls rhythmic activity. It might also be possible to one-day transplant similar circuitoids into people to repair injured or diseased parts of a nervous system, or use circuitoids that resemble specific neurological disorders to screen for new treatments.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.21540.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.21540.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>circuitoid</kwd><kwd>synthetic network</kwd><kwd>excitatory-inhibitory balance</kwd><kwd>embryonic stem cells</kwd><kwd>rhythmicity</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001305</institution-id><institution>Christopher and Dana Reeve Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sternfeld</surname><given-names>Matthew J</given-names></name><name><surname>Moore</surname><given-names>Niall J</given-names></name><name><surname>Pankratz</surname><given-names>Matthew T</given-names></name><name><surname>Pfaff</surname><given-names>Samuel L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001538</institution-id><institution>Mary K.

Although connectomes and functional roles for the neuronal subtypes that comprise circuits have begun to be defined, the output of large multicellular networks are difficult to predict from the input pattern because the mechanisms that coordinate and regulate these complex systems remain poorly understood. A remarkable attribute of many CNS networks with extensive interconnections among the cells is their ability to default into a sustained self-organized oscillatory activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Buzsaki, 2006</xref>). If only excitatory (E) neurons comprised these networks it is thought that inputs would trigger an avalanche of epileptic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Buzsaki, 2006</xref>). Thus, inhibitory (I) cells are considered important components of dynamic neural networks, because they can impose a regulated pattern on the system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Brown, 1911</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Buzsaki, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Goulding et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Grillner and Jessell, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Isaacson and Scanziani, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Marder and Bucher, 2001</xref>).</p><p>Within neuronal networks, inhibitory neurons can increase coding efficiency, sharpen contrasts, and specify the topography of active circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Arevian et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Buetfering et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Denève and Machens, 2016</xref>). While the physiological roles of rhythmic brain activity are not always apparent, oscillatory central pattern generator (CPG) networks underlie breathing, chewing, scratching, and locomotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Grillner and Jessell, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Marder and Bucher, 2001</xref>). Vertebrate CPGs associated with locomotion are distributed networks of interconnected excitatory and inhibitory neurons that represent autonomous units capable of generating precisely patterned rhythmic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Feldman and Smith, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Nishimaru et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Whelan et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cowley and Schmidt, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Grillner, 2006</xref>). Importantly, spinal CPGs have dynamic features that endow them with the ability to switch their frequency of rhythmicity in order to modulate locomotor speed and change the inter-coordination of motor pool firing patterns to drive different motor behaviors. The basis for producing flexible CPG activity remains unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Grillner, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">McCrea and Rybak, 2008</xref>), but it is likely founded in the differential recruitment of excitatory and inhibitory neurons comprising the CPG via selective inputs from descending and sensory systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cowley and Schmidt, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gosgnach et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Grillner, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Zhong et al., 2011</xref>). However, the contribution of a precisely controlled E/I cell ratio in the context of rhythmic circuit dynamics has been difficult to establish using cell ablation approaches that eliminate entire cell populations or pharmacological applications that silence entire types of synaptic transmission.</p><p>The molecular and functional characterization of spinal interneuron subtypes that contribute to vertebrate CPG activity has led to the identification of cells with local and long-range connections, with ipsilateral and contralateral projections, and with inhibitory and excitatory properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alaynick et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bikoff et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gabitto et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Garcia-Campmany et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Goulding and Pfaff, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Grillner and Jessell, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Stepien and Arber, 2008</xref>). A common trait among each class of spinal interneurons comprising the locomotor CPG is that they form an extensive network of interconnections within their subclass, between the interneuron subclasses, and onto motor neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alvarez et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Crone et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lanuza et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>). In addition to their connectivity, the functional role of interneuron subclasses has been investigated by genetic methods such as cell killing or silencing. Ablation of inhibitory V1 neurons slows the burst frequency of the CPG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gosgnach et al., 2006</xref>), whereas ablation of both V1 and V2b inhibitory neurons disrupts the coordination of flexor-extensor alternation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>). Removing the V2a or V3 excitatory neurons from the network results in more irregular CPG bursting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Crone et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>). These studies elegantly demonstrate that V1, V2b, V2a, and V3 interneurons each represent a necessary component of the CPG, but they do not address whether the cell types play instructive roles in gating the dynamic features of the circuitry. To begin to address this difficult issue, we used genetically labeled neurons to construct synthetic rhythmically active neuronal networks composed of defined cell subtypes. This approach allowed us to investigate whether quantitative differences in the cellular E/I ratio of specific neuronal subtypes are sufficient to alter the oscillatory speed and intra-network coordination of bursts.</p><p>Embryonic stem cells with genetic reporters for individual spinal cord interneuron subtypes and motor neurons were isolated and differentiated with inductive factors that mimic embryonic development of the spinal cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kutejova et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Peljto et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Wichterle and Peljto, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Wichterle et al., 2002</xref>). We found that synthetic networks comprised of only excitatory V2a or V3 interneurons were sufficient to produce stable rhythmic bursts of activity at a frequency similar to drug-evoked fictive locomotor CPG activity. In contrast, V1 inhibitory neurons lacked the ability to produce regular bursts in isolation, but they did affect the activity of other cells. The addition of increasing numbers of V1 (I) neurons to fixed V3 (E) networks quantitatively accelerated the burst frequency, demonstrating that the E/I cell ratio instructively sets the oscillation speed. Interestingly, we found that V1 (I) neurons influenced the activity of motor (E) neuron bursting differently. Motor neuron networks, whose interconnected cells fire in unison, were uncoupled into sub-networks by the addition of increasing numbers of V1 cells. The formation of subnetworks is a form of patterning we define as segmentation. Taken together, our data lead to a model in which input-specific shifts in E/I cellular activity can flexibly tune the speed and pattern of an autonomous oscillatory circuit. By extension, this simple strategy for controlling the oscillatory properties that naturally emerge from interconnected neuronal networks might serve as the basis for generating complex, yet highly flexible, motor behaviors.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>De novo generation of spinal cord neurons</title><p>We constructed circuits with neurons that were generated de novo from mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells rather than using neurons isolated from spinal cords that may have acquired functional properties through complex interactions with their environment.

This allowed us to accurately and sensitively monitor ES cell differentiation into spinal neuron subtypes in real time. We isolated four independent ES cell lines containing the V1 reporter En1:Cre/tdTomato, two lines with the V2a reporter Chx10:Cre/tdTomato, seven lines with the V3 reporter Sim1:Cre/tdTomato, and two lines with the motor neuron reporter tgHb9-GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

Second, the addition of V1 cells to V3 networks unlikely changes V3-activity by displacing cells or altering the connectome of the excitatory network because drug inhibitors of V1 interneurons restore normal V3-activity.

Equal numbers of motor neurons and excitatory V3 interneurons were combined with increasing numbers of V1 inhibitory cells.

Here, we have begun to bridge the two approaches by devising a system for modeling the control features of an oscillatory network using biological components. Specifically, we constructed oscillatory networks using defined neuronal subtypes generated from stem cells. We called these microphysical structures circuitoids, from which coordinated network oscillations emerged. To understand how flexible control might be imposed on the rhythmic networks, we studied the consequence of shifting the cellular E/I ratio on the bursting parameters. We found that inhibitory neurons act in a context-dependent manner to regulate the frequency of bursting and the pattern (i.e. segmentation) of the network activity. Our findings lead to a model whereby interconnected excitatory and inhibitory neurons can transition to different output based on cell-type-specific connection-strength hierarchies working in combination with controls that gate the relative activity-ratio of E-to-I cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21540.021</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Model of neuronal interactions in an oscillatory circuit.</title><p>(<bold>A–C</bold>) V3 interneurons form strong synaptic interactions, whereas motor neurons have weaker connections.

This activity pattern probably arises when irregular spikes randomly produced by interconnected excitatory neurons become integrated across dendritic trees, thereby converging into a regular oscillatory pattern of output shared by cells across the network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Softky and Koch, 1993</xref>). This raises the paradoxical issue of understanding how diverse patterns of activity necessary for driving complex behaviors are produced by networks that default into stable patterns of rhythmicity. Theoretical considerations of this problem argue that inhibitory neurons are necessary in such systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Buzsaki, 2006</xref>).</p><p>Although prevalent, the function of neural oscillations remains obscure in many cases. A wide range of frequency bands are observed in cortical structures ranging from 1 to 70 Hz and have been considered as possible substrates for binding information through synchronization and providing a time parameter to neural codes. Rhythmic neural activity likely plays roles in cognition and memory, and when unregulated produces tremors and seizures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Buzsaki and Draguhn, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fries, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wang, 2010</xref>). Aside from neural development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Katz and Shatz, 1996</xref>), the circuits where rhythmic activity plays the clearest role have central pattern generator attributes such as those that control repetitive movements linked to respiration, chewing, scratching, and walking for example.</p><p>The cellular components of the mouse spinal cord CPG have been investigated through functional studies using pharmacological agents and molecular tools to target distinct neuronal subclasses. Despite the extensive characterization of this circuit, it has remained unclear what drives the pacemaker system within the CPG. Several studies have found that perturbing the function of excitatory interneurons such as V2a or V3 cells degrades the rhythm. Likewise, we found that V3 interneurons are necessary for well-coordinated rhythmicity in heterogeneous networks. In addition, we found that V3 cells, V2a interneurons, and to a limited degree motor neurons were sufficient as isolated cell populations to establish rhythmic networks. These homogenous networks displayed somewhat regular spontaneous bursting patterns, but fired with increased frequency and higher regularity in drugs that evoke central pattern generator activity. It has been suggested that the pacemaker is an emergent property of interconnected excitatory neurons within the CPG, and that the default frequency is defined by the biophysical properties of the membrane, which cyclically convert cells from on-fire to off-fire states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Grillner, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Harris-Warrick, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kiehn et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Marder and Bucher, 2001</xref>). The inherent ability of a network to integrate neural properties across the cell population may represent one mechanism for helping to control for the intrinsic biophysical variability among neurons and thereby ensure a reliable and consistent output (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Marder et al., 2015</xref>). Our findings support this view of pacemaker control and further suggest that robustness in the system is derived from the ability of multiple excitatory spinal cord cell types to default into regular oscillatory patterns.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Circuitoids and central pattern generators</title><p>We generated subclasses of spinal-like neurons from ES cells harboring genetic reporters for specific neuronal types functionally implicated as components of the mouse spinal cord central pattern generator. Although the ES-cell-derived neuron subtypes used in this analysis without exception displayed features similar to their in vivo counterparts, we cannot exclude that there are differences between the in vitro and in vivo cells. The de novo generated neurons were either cultured as spheres or plated and allowed to form interconnections. Remarkably, after culturing we found that these synthetic networks produced rhythmic bursts of activity that resembled the activity of the spinal cord central pattern generator. Because these ES-cell-derived neural networks produced a behaviorally relevant activity pattern, we termed these microphysical systems circuitoids to distinguish them from neurospheres defined solely by their cellular composition. Pharmacological experiments and recordings of EPSCs indicated that circuitoid activity is synaptically driven, and that the synchronized bursting of the neurons comprising each circuitoid is likely a byproduct of the extensive interconnections among the cells. In addition to synaptic connections, gap junctions may also form among neurons in circuitoids. Nevertheless, antagonists of glutamatergic synapses disrupted bursting, indicating that gap junctions alone are insufficient to produce the oscillatory patterns of activity we observed. We found no evidence for migration of neurons into particular groupings or layers within the oscillatory-circuitoids in either aggregated or plated conditions; nor did we find evidence for a specific connectome among cells, other than cell-type-specific differences in network binding strength revealed in mEPSC recordings. Instead, the oscillatory activity we observed under a variety of conditions seemed to emerge simply from the intrinsic synaptic and membrane channel characteristics of the neuron subtypes and their ability to form extensive synaptic connections with one another. Our findings indicate that the coordinated oscillatory behavior of a rhythmic network can arise without a stringent requirement for a particular circuit architecture that relies upon a specific physical arrangement of pre- and post-synaptic cells. Interestingly, motor neurons acquire rhythmic activity even when ectopically located within the spinal cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hinckley et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Machado et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Can circuitoids comprised of spinal-like neurons be compared to spinal cord central pattern generators?

Rather, the oscillatory activity of circuitoid networks was more akin to a half-center CPG or respiratory CPG, which produce regular on-off bursts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Garcia-Campmany et al., 2010</xref>). The similarities between circuitoids and simple CPGs were several fold.

(4) The frequency of bursts produced by circuitoids was in a similar range to those produced by the spinal CPG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Talpalar and Kiehn, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Whelan et al., 2000</xref>). (5) The ablation of V3 interneurons from circuitoids degraded the rhythmicity analogous to the phenotype caused by ablating V3 cells in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>). (6) Like spinal CPGs, circuitoid rhythms could occur in the absence of inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bracci et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cowley and Schmidt, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kremer and Lev-Tov, 1997</xref>). (7) In both circuitoids and CPGs blocking inhibitory V1 interneuron function reduced the burst speed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cowley and Schmidt, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gosgnach et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Although there are likely important differences between circuitoids produced in vitro from ES cells and CPGs, the ability to create networks with defined cell types and numbers represents a unique approach for testing the sufficiency and instructive qualities of cell types for particular activity patterns. Functional studies of neurons within oscillatory circuits have been performed by titrating pharmacological agents; however, this global alteration of synaptic signaling strength may not be comparable to the way different cell combinations are dynamically selected for activity within a network by higher control centers. Consequently, we designed our experiments around using defined cell mixtures to study network dynamics, rather than using drug titrations, allowing us to have tight control over the cellular E/I makeup of networks, an aspect that cannot currently be controlled as precisely with in vivo manipulation.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>A cellular E/I model to produce flexible motor behaviors</title><p>While the underpinnings of circuit-switches are poorly understood, rhythmic networks within the spinal cord are clearly capable of dynamically changing the speed and pattern of motor neuron activation to produce an elaborate repertoire of motor actions. Functional studies have established inhibitory neurons as necessary components of the circuitry that patterns motor output (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cowley and Schmidt, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gosgnach et al., 2006</xref>); however, it is not possible to determine if particular neuron subtypes are instructive components involved in CPG flexibility by eliminating a cell type from the system. To explore the consequences of changing the E/I ratio within oscillatory circuits, we made synthetic networks with identified neuronal subtypes mixed in controlled numbers. Base networks of purified excitatory neurons with strong interconnections, such as those comprised of V3 interneurons, reliably produced regular rhythmic bursts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). Networks of weakly interconnected excitatory neurons, such as motor neurons, burst with more irregular patterns, but adopted a regular synchronized activity-pattern in the presence of interneurons with strong connections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B and C</xref>). Thus, under the cell mixing conditions we tested, neurons with the intrinsic ability to form strong connections establish dominance in the network.</p><p>One manner in which different behaviors might emerge from a highly interconnected network like the spinal cord, is by descending inputs recruiting different proportions of inhibitory and excitatory neurons within the network and thereby changing the E/I balance. Although we could not mimic the structured recruitment of cell types by descending inputs, we could investigate the consequence of changing the E/I balance of networks by mixing different combinations of excitatory and inhibitory neuron subtypes. V1 interneurons increased the burst frequency of strongly interconnected V3 networks in proportion to the E/I cell ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>), suggesting V1 interneuron influence on network speed can occur upstream of motor neurons. When V1 inhibitory neurons were combined with weakly connected motor neurons they had little influence on burst frequency, but they caused sub-networks to emerge in proportion to the E/I cell ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>). Although our findings do not explain how the activity of different motor pools is coordinated, our results support the possibility that the selective recruitment of increasing numbers of V1 cells could switch motor pools from a coupled (synchronous) to an uncoupled (segmented) state in order to facilitate the differential recruitment of muscles during complex behaviors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>). In tripartite circuits with weakly- and strongly-connected excitatory neurons in combination with inhibitory neurons, we found that the entire network adopted a synchronous pattern of activity whose frequency increased as the number of inhibitory neurons increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref>). The selective recruitment of V1 cells into the CPG may be facilitated by the large genetic diversity that has been uncovered within this cell group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bikoff et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Francius et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Our observations suggest that flexibility within rhythmic circuits can be achieved by constructing networks with neurons that have unequal synaptic interactions, and by regulating the activity-ratio of excitatory and inhibitory neurons. Together these features are sufficient to control the speed and segmentation of bursting.

FACS sheath was removed without disrupting the loose pellet at the bottom of the well and neuronal media was added back. two more washes were conducted, combining wells if necessary (some experiments would have caused wells to overflow during FACS if neurons for one network were not split between multiple wells). For sphere assays, the neurons were resuspended and transferred into a well of a u-bottomed 96-well plate that was already filled with an astrosphere. These plates were now spun to increase contact of neurons and astrosphere. The following day, light trituration was used to remove any debris from the main reaggregated sphere. A few smaller satellite spheres may have also formed, so the plate was spun once more. 24 hr later, all the neurons and astrocytes formed one coherent sphere. All the media were carefully removed from the cells and new media was added. Unless otherwise noted, the circuitoids were incubated for 3 weeks after FACS before their network activity was imaged, with half of their media being exchanged three times a week. For plated networks, the AGM from the 35 mm dish was aspirated sufficiently to dry the plastic surrounding the 10 mm coverslip, and then media on the coverslip was aspirated. Neurons for each network were resuspended in 100–200 µl of neuronal media and plated onto the confluent astrocyte layer. After 2 hr the neurons had adhered and 2 ml of neuronal media were added to the 35 mm dish. The plated networks were incubated for 2 weeks after FACS before their network activity was imaged, with half of their media being exchanged three times a week.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Optical and electrical recordings</title><p>During recordings, samples were perfused in ACSF (128 mM NaCl; 4 mM KCl; 21 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>; 0.5 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>; 1 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>; 30 mM D-glucose; and 2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>) bubbled with a 95/5/% O2/CO2 mixture. Calcium signal was recorded using either a ubiquitously expressed GCaMP3 (tgCAG:GCaMP3) or Oregon Green 488 BAPTA-1-AM (Life Technologies). For dye application, Oregon Green 488 BAPTA-1-AM (Life Technologies) was applied at 10 μM in ACSF for 1 hr in a 37°C incubator.

After 45 min, tissue was triturated and centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 5 min. Dissociated cells were resuspended in 1:1 Neurobasal:DMEM/F12 (without phenol red) with 3% Horse Serum (Invitrogen) and DNase (Worthingon Biochemical). Before sorting, cells were passed through a 35-µm cell strainer (08-771-23, BD Falcon). Sorting was conducted on a Becton Dickinson FACS Vantage SE DiVa using Coherent Sapphire 488 nm and 568 nm solid state lasers (200 mW). Cells were collected directly into miRvana RNA lysis buffer and stored at −80C. RNA was isolated using the miRvana miRNA isolation kit (Ambion AM1560) or RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). Each in vivo sample is a pool of isolated cells from one to three spinal cords, as necessary, to obtain sufficient RNA (quantified by Agilent TapeStation) for RNA sequencing.</p><p>mRNA sequencing libraries were prepared using the Illumina TruSeq RNA Library Preparation Kit (v2) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, RNA with polyA+ tails was selected using oligo-dT beads. Then, mRNA was fragmented and reverse-transcribed into cDNA. cDNA was end-repaired, index adapter-ligated and PCR amplified. Nucleic acids were purified with AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter) after each step. Libraries were then quantified, pooled, and sequenced using either the Illumina HiSeq 2500 or Illumina HiSeq 2000 platforms at the Salk NGS Core and Beijing Genomics Institute. Sequencing libraries were either 50 bp single-end or 100 bp paired-end.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Gene expression quantification</title><p>To help control library type bias in the quantifications, raw FASTQ reads were trimmed to 50 bp and processed as single-end.

Gene level TPM expression values were obtained by summing isoform level TPM at each gene loci.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Data analysis</title><p>Data were exported from ImageJ (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_003070">SCR_003070</ext-link>) using the ROI manager after manually drawing regions of interest around spheres, or for plated networks, ROIs were drawn around individual neurons (cellular analysis), or the full or partial field of view (network analysis). Burst detection was carried out in Igor Pro (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_000325">SCR_000325</ext-link>) with TaroTools, Dr Taro Ishikawa, (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sites.google.com/site/tarotoolsregister">https://sites.google.com/site/tarotoolsregister</ext-link>) or a custom pipeline generated in R.</p><p>To analyze network complexity, movies were converted to 8 bit grey-scale and resized to 128 × 128 pixels and exported as TIFF stacks from ImageJ. TIFF stacks were imported into R for analysis. Stacks were transformed into 196 ‘signals’ where each signal is the averaged intensity vs time from an 11 × 11 pixel oval shaped ROI. ROIs were taken at nine pixel spacing to allow for a small amount of overlap between adjacent ROIs. The size of the ROIs was selected manually based on training data to maintain good detail while still averaging out imaging noise. Signals were smoothed with a 1 s wide running mean filter and delta-f / f transformed. The full set of ROIs from a movie was then PCA transformed. The principal components were separated into ‘signal’ and ‘noise’ using the scree-plot method of significant component estimation (finding the component number at the elbow of the plot). Based on training data, we occasionally found that information was lost by selecting the component at the elbow of the scree-plot so, instead, selected two past the elbow. The significant components were recombined to form the signal matrix and all non-significant components were recombined to form the noise matrix. The sum of these two matrices is equal to the original input to PCA. For each signal, the standard deviation of the noise version was used to threshold the signal version for burst location calling. Burst locations were identified as rising edges in the signal version of an ROI with change in intensity greater than approximately 1.96 times the standard deviation of the noise version of the same ROI. This threshold was selected manually based on training data and gave a good balance between false-positive and false-negative burst calling. Change in intensity was measured from the base to peak of the rising edge of the burst.</p><p>Burst positions from all ROIs within a movie were cataloged to create a set of distinct burst positions within ±1 s windows (the burst catalog). Each ROI was then re-described as a sequence of the cataloged bursts. We then filtered out bursts from the catalog that appeared in less than 4% of the ROIs. This threshold was set manually based on training data to balance out Type I and Type II error as fair as possible and then used for all primary analysis. After filtering, the ROIs were re-described again. This re-described set of ROIs represents all robust bursting activity within a single movie. To quantify the complexity, taken as a deviation from the state of all ROIs having identical activity, we built a directed graph of the burst sequences within a movie. Briefly, a graph is a type of data structure with one or more nodes connected by edges. They are often used to describe networks. If the edges are assigned a direction then the graph is a directed graph. In our case, the nodes are the cataloged bursts. Edges were added to the graph between any two bursts that occurred adjacently in time in any ROI. The direction of the edge is in the direction of occurrence in time. If, in one ROI, burst Y followed burst X and was adjacent to burst X (no bursts occurred between them) then an edge would be added connecting from X to Y. From the point of view of a node in the graph, edges may be incoming or outgoing. The foregoing connection of X to Y has a single edge. From the point of view of node X it is an outgoing edge while from the point of view of Y it is an incoming edge. Complexity of a movie was then defined as the average of both the ratio of nodes with more than one outgoing edge and ratio of nodes with more than one incoming edge. If all ROIs in a movie have the same burst sequence then, in terms of the graph, each node would only be connected to one other node resulting in a baseline score of 1 for the movie. When the ROIs share some bursts, but not all, then the nodes of the graph begin to have more than one incoming or outgoing edge, which increases the final complexity score. We did not consider a case for ROIs that do not share any bursts because we did not observe any such cases in our data. The complexity statistic was found to be non-normal across the different testing groups and to have unequal variances so the two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used to perform statistical tests between groups. All other data were compared using a student t-test.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>C Dowling and N Allen provided valuable guidance on astrocyte preparations.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior Editor and three reviewers, one of whom, Ronald L Calabrese (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors and another one is Jeremy Dasen (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Title and Abstract: Please make the title more descriptive to conform to <italic>eLife</italic> standards. Synthetic is not sufficient: cultured and differentiated mouse embryonic stem cells should be mentioned. Abstract should echo the title and implement the major points of the required revision.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This is a singular study in its approach. It uses embryonic stem cells that have cell type specific reporter genes and FACS to generate cultures of spinal interneurons and motor neurons of prescribed composition and then uses genetically expressed Ca indicators and electrophysiology to monitor activity and synaptic properties. It then creatively makes different circuitoids and dissects their circuit mechanisms for generating spontaneous bursting by pharmacological and genetic cell killing methods. The paper is brilliant in its concept and a great pleasure to read and think about. Its main conclusion is that strong excitatory connections lead to robust bursting and that when such strong interconnections are present then local inhibition promotes synchrony and decreasing the E/I ratio speeds bursting (decreases period). Conversely weak excitatory connections lead to less robust bursting and when such weak interconnections dominate the circuitoids then local inhibition disrupts synchrony and decreasing the E/I ratio leads to fractionation of the network into co-active subcircuits. The thoroughness and systematics of the approach are impressive and the results are nicely quantified and clearly presented in the figures. This paper should be read by all who are interested in brain circuits.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>There are some concerns that must be addressed, but overall this appears to be a strong study of general significance.</p><p>1) The authors completely ignore structured inhibition in their Discussion, indeed throughout the paper. This is perhaps understandable because in the circuitoids inhibition is unstructured – random. You must redirect the entire paper's conceptual framework to embrace the concept that basic antagonisms that are so characteristic of CPGs require a structured pattern inhibitory connectivity. The authors produce something akin to Pearson's flexor burst generator or the PreBotz complex of the respiratory CPG, i.e., a neuronal oscillator, rather than a CPG which has both rhythm and patterning components. We would also argue that some antagonisms are probably hard wired and not that plastic to descending selection. Some of course are easily selected in/out but still are dependent on a structured pattern of inhibitory connectivity. The network fractionation that the authors observe when adding V1 interneurons to MN cultures is not equivalent to building basic antagonisms such as flexor extensor antagonisms or, in axial locomotion, side-to-side antagonisms. Both in Introduction and in Discussion this limitation of the approach should be forthrightly dealt with. The authors have not built a CPG in a dish and they can recognize this limitation without losing the inherent interest of the paper.</p><p>2) The actual synaptic connectivity and electrical activity of the 'circuitoids' are not demonstrated. We are concerned that there are real synapses present and that the neurons are spiking and transmitting signals down axons to release sites. At the beginning of Results the authors state &quot;To investigate whether matured neurospheres likewise produce spontaneous bursts we monitored network output using both an extracellular suction recording electrode and calcium imaging.&quot; We would like to see some of these extracellular suction electrode recordings, particularly in conjunction with Ca-imaging, so that we can judge what the electrical activity of the circuitoids is like. The whole cell patch recordings of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H-J</xref> give some confidence that there are synapses – concomitant suction electrode recordings of the bursts would certainly increase that confidence – but some anatomical corroboration seems necessary. This could be done at the LM level with, e.g., with immunocytochemistry to show vGluT2 boutons in apposition to glutamatergic receptors, or at minimum in apposition to post-synaptic neurons.</p><p>3) Figure legends are overwhelming.

Beginning in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> (subsection “Inhibition decouples motor neuron networks into separate units”, second paragraph), the authors switch to expressing their cultures as ratios of different neuronal types. This is likely a more appropriate way to tell us what's going on, and should be done throughout. It is more specific and quantitative.</p><p>5) The authors mention performing RNAseq on the ES lines they purified and comparing to in vivo gene profiles (subsection “de novo generation of spinal cord neurons”, last paragraph).

Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor, a Reviewing editor, and two reviewers.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>The authors have made a strong revision and the expert reviewers' previous concerns are largely met. The major remaining issue, which should be addressed is that of patterning. Because in CPG networks patterning and rhythm generation are often done by different circuit elements and are often conceptualized differently it is best not to confuse the issue by referring to the segmentation of activity in different cells in a circuitoid as patterning because coordinated stable phase relations are not established. The authors should not refer to pattern in their title and should precisely define what they mean by pattern: segmentation of circuitoid activity without fixed coordination. Reviewer #3's comments should all be addressed in the further revision, which will not require his re-review.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>1) Throughout the manuscript, from the title on, the authors refer not only to speed/rhythm but also to pattern. In the locomotor field, to which the authors are directing their study, the word &quot;pattern&quot; refers to the coordination of muscle groups or motoneuron pools. There is no evidence presented in this manuscript that supports such coordination. The authors do show data related to &quot;sub-networks&quot; in which they show that when one group of MNs burst, another group may not. But this is far from any pattern per se, and could have many explanations (threshold effect, synaptic failure in a sparsely innervated system, as 2 examples). My view is that the word and concept of &quot;pattern&quot; should be eliminated from this manuscript, and especially from title.</p><p>2) The authors are very focused throughout the manuscript on the &quot;excitatory to inhibitory ratio&quot; (or E/I ratio). This disregards the potential importance of neural types, i.e. any characteristic other than neurotransmitter. If the effects were simply E/I ratio, then adding more of any type of inhibitory cell (e.g. V2b, cortical inhibitory interneurons) would have the same effect as adding V1's. Do they really think that the identity of the cells has nothing to do with the findings?</p><p>3) The authors use the term &quot;behaviorally relevant&quot; – e.g. in the first paragraph of the subsection “Circuitoids produce coordinated bursts of activity” – why? Is a burst every 25s behaviorally relevant? This comes up again in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, which illustrates a burst every ~7 seconds – this is not &quot;similar in frequency to fictive locomotor preparations&quot; (see last paragraph of the aforementioned subsection, and subsection “Circuitoids and Central Pattern Generators”, third paragraph), which would be about 4 times faster (based on a perusal of Kiehn's work). There is no need to overstate the results, which are interesting enough on their own.</p><p>4) The term &quot;synaptic strength&quot; is not used properly. This term is not non-specific, and should refer to the size (not frequency, subsection “Inhibitory V1 interneurons control motor neuron burst rate via V3 interneurons”, last paragraph) of a PSC in response to stimulation of a presynaptic neuron. This has not been systematically quantified/analyzed. Usage includes: Discussion, first paragraph, where it is hyphenated; subsection “Circuitoids and Central Pattern Generators”, first paragraph (which also refers to EPSPs instead of EPSCs); <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>; and subsection “A cellular E/I model to produce flexible motor behaviors”, first paragraph. Also, is it that the connections are weak, or that the cell types are not able to support rhythmicity autonomously? For example, the MNs don't have SK currents (Miles et al., 2006), which could be needed for the response.</p><p>5) On a related note, what does &quot;without exception displayed features similar to their in vivo counterparts&quot; mean? This is not sufficient. The cells have some molecular markers in common with their in vivo counterparts, but who knows about their electrical properties that form the basis of the findings here?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21540.023</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Title and Abstract: Please make the title more descriptive to conform to eLife standards.

The reviewer is correct, that we have not constructed a CPG that has control features for left-right and flexor-extensor coordination based on reciprocal inhibition (i.e. structured inhibition). To be clear, we have generated a rhythmic oscillatory network (emphasized by stating in the new title) that has operational similarities to a half center CPG in the lumbar spinal cord or a PreBotz CPG for respiration in the brainstem as recognized by the reviewer.</p><p><italic>2) The actual synaptic connectivity and electrical activity of the 'circuitoids' are not demonstrated.

The evidence for synaptic signaling within circuitoids is now demonstrated in three ways: (1) glutamatergic antagonists prevent bursting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B-T</xref>), (2) functional recordings of EPSPs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H-J</xref>, and (3) anatomical evidence of synaptic structures (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3C</xref>).</p><p>As requested, we have also added more examples of electrical recordings in conjunction with Ca-imaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, and new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A, B</xref>).</p><p><italic>3) Figure legends are overwhelming.

In general, sample sizes and recording periods are very large, particularly in comparison to typical in vivo experiments. The results with purified and inter-mixed neuron types begin in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>.

To avoid confusion, we have simplified <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref> to include only the data from RNAseq of motor neurons and V2a interneurons. The evidence that V1 and V3 neurons are specified correctly is two fold: (1) they express the canonical marker for these neurons (En1 and Sim1, respectively) and (2) they display the correct pharmacological properties (glycinergic and glutamatergic, respectively). The text has been revised accordingly (subsection “De novo generation of spinal cord neurons”, last paragraph).</p><p><italic>6) Much of the data in the paper relies on calcium imaging to measure the firing properties of circuitoids.

To further emphasize this point, we added a statement about gap junctions in the Discussion (subsection “Circuitoids and Central Pattern Generators”, first paragraph).</p><p><italic>8) In the Discussion, the caveat that the cells differentiated in culture may not have all the same features as the same cells in vivo should be mentioned.</italic> </p><p>We added this caveat to the Discussion in the first paragraph of the subsection “Circuitoids and Central Pattern Generators”.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p><italic>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</italic> </p><p><italic>The authors have made a strong revision and the expert reviewers' previous concerns are largely met.

We changed the title, Abstract, Introduction (last paragraph), Results (subsection “Inhibition decouples motor neuron networks into separate units”, second paragraph), and Discussion (subsection “Networks that produce rhythmic activity”, first paragraph and subsection “A cellular E/I model to produce flexible motor behaviors”, last paragraph).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) Throughout the manuscript, from the title on, the authors refer not only to speed/rhythm but also to pattern.

Please note that we have been careful to define V1 interneurons as inhibitory (I) and V3 interneurons and motor neurons as excitatory (E), and do not imply or speculate that other cell types are equivalent.</p><p><italic>3) The authors use the term &quot;behaviorally relevant&quot; – e.g. in the first paragraph of the subsection “Circuitoids produce coordinated bursts of activity” – why?

This comes up again in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, which illustrates a burst every ~7 seconds – this is not &quot;similar in frequency to fictive locomotor preparations&quot; (see last paragraph of the aforementioned subsection, and subsection “Circuitoids and Central Pattern Generators”, third paragraph), which would be about 4 times faster (based on a perusal of Kiehn's work). There is no need to overstate the results, which are interesting enough on their own.</italic> </p><p>In the first case the data refers to the spontaneous activity of circuitoids, which is consistent with the frequency of spontaneous ventral root depolarizations of a P2 mouse pup (Whelan et al. 2000: found spontaneous bursts to occur every 2.6 ± 1 (SD) episodes/min= 1 burst every 23s).</p><p>Additionally, referencing <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, one has to remember that there are very few V1 inhibitory neurons present in these circuitoids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>), making them similar to En1:Cre;LSL:DTA spinal cords that have burst durations of about 10 seconds (Gosgnach et al. 2006). When we mixed V1 interneurons with V3 cells the burst rate dramatically increased. We recorded frequencies up to 0.45 Hz in V3/V1 networks in the presence of 100,000 V3 interneurons and 100,000 V1 interneurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and data not shown). Therefore, the fact that circuitoids are (1) spontaneously active at a slow frequency comparable to the spinal cord, (2) become highly rhythmic in CPG-evoking drugs like the spinal cord, and (3) have burst frequencies around 0.5 Hz when inhibition is present which is not dissimilar to fictive spinal cord preps suggests circuitoid activity is relevant to locomotor behavior and not random.</p><p><italic>4) The term &quot;synaptic strength&quot; is not used properly. This term is not non-specific, and should refer to the size (not frequency, subsection “Inhibitory V1 interneurons control motor neuron burst rate via V3 interneurons”, last paragraph) of a PSC in response to stimulation of a presynaptic neuron. This has not been systematically quantified/analyzed. Usage includes: Discussion, first paragraph, where it is hyphenated; subsection “Circuitoids and Central Pattern Generators”, first paragraph (which also refers to EPSPs instead of EPSCs); <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>; and subsection “A cellular E/I model to produce flexible motor behaviors”, first paragraph. Also, is it that the connections are weak, or that the cell types are not able to support rhythmicity autonomously? For example, the MNs don't have SK currents (Miles et al., 2006), which could be needed for the response.</italic> </p><p>We revised the description of the miniature post synaptic current data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H-L</xref>) as requested. We replaced the term “synaptic strength” with “network connection strength” to better describe the observation that mEPSC frequencies are higher among V3 interneurons and increase when V3 cells are added to motor neuron networks (subsection “Inhibitory V1 interneurons control motor neuron burst rate via V3 interneurons”, last paragraph, Discussion, first paragraph and subsection “Circuitoids and Central Pattern Generators”, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> legend). The data is quantified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7K-L</xref>. As noted by the reviewer the reduced “network connection strength” we detect with motor neurons may be due to either weaker synaptic inputs or different channel properties intrinsic to motor neurons. We do not speculate on the mechanism. Thank you for helping us to correct this point.</p><p><italic>5) On a related note, what does &quot;without exception displayed features similar to their in vivo counterparts&quot; mean? This is not sufficient. The cells have some molecular markers in common with their in vivo counterparts, but who knows about their electrical properties that form the basis of the findings here?</italic> </p><p>The reviewer is referring to the genetic profiling, cardinal marker expression, and neurotransmitter expression of the ES-derived neurons: &quot;Although the ES cell-derived neuron subtypes used in this analysis without exception displayed features similar to their in vivo counterparts, we cannot exclude that there are differences between the in vitro and in vivo cells&quot;. In other words, we found no differences between the in vivo and in vitro cell types using these assays, but recognize that the ES-derived cells may not be identical in every regard to their in vivo counterparts.</p></body></sub-article></article>
