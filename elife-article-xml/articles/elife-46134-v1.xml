co-receptors including LRP5/6. The hydrophobicity of Wnt proteins has complicated their purification and limited their use in basic research and as therapeutics. We describe modular tetravalent antibodies that can recruit Frizzled and LRP5/6 in a manner that phenocopies the activities of Wnts both in vitro and in vivo. The modular nature of these synthetic Frizzled and LRP5/6 Agonists, called FLAgs, enables tailored engineering of specificity for one, two or multiple members of the Frizzled family. We show that FLAgs underlie differentiation of pluripotent stem cells, sustain organoid growth, and activate stem cells in vivo. Activation of Wnt signaling circuits with tailored FLAgs will enable precise delineation of functional outcomes directed by distinct receptor combinations and could provide a new class of therapeutics to unlock the promise of regenerative medicine.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>antibody</kwd><kwd>Wnt</kwd><kwd>frizzled</kwd><kwd>regenerative

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Wnt proteins are secreted glycoproteins that regulate stem and progenitor cells, and thus play fundamental roles in development and adult tissue homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Steinhart and Angers, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Wiese et al., 2018</xref>). In humans, 19 Wnt proteins interact with a receptor complex composed of one of ten Frizzled (FZD) receptors and one of several co-receptors that guide the selective engagement of different intracellular signaling branches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Angers and Moon, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Wodarz and Nusse, 1998</xref>). In the best characterized pathway, Wnt interacts with a FZD and a single transmembrane LRP5 or LRP6 co-receptor to stabilize intracellular Î²catenin and regulate genes involved in tissue stem cell proliferation and differentiation. Wnt binds to the cysteine rich domain (CRD) of FZD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Janda et al., 2012</xref>) and to either the first two or last two propeller domains of LRP5/6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bourhis et al., 2010</xref>), and these interactions are thought to allosterically modulate the FZD seven-transmembrane domain to enable recruitment of Disheveled and allow phosphorylation of the LRP5/6 intracellular domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Davidson et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Zeng et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>Wnts require lipidation for function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Janda et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kadowaki et al., 1996</xref>) and their hydrophobic nature complicates biochemical manipulation; consequently, only a few Wnts have been purified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Willert et al., 2003</xref>). Furthermore, Wnts are inherently cross-reactive for multiple receptors, especially when overexpressed or applied at high dose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dijksterhuis et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">He et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Holmen et al., 2002</xref>). As a result, it has been impossible to activate Frizzled receptor complexes selectively to determine the specific functions of each in different contexts or to evaluate their therapeutic potential for degenerative conditions. Thus, water-soluble synthetic Wnt analogs with tailored specificities would have great significance for both basic research and regenerative medicine.</p><p>Recently, bivalent Wnt surrogates have been developed by fusing an LRP5/6-binding fragment from the natural protein DKK1 to an engineered ligand for FZD CRDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Janda et al., 2017</xref>). These Wnt surrogates activated Î²catenin signaling in vitro and in vivo when delivered using adenovirus. Herein, we report modular and engineerable FZD/LRP agonists (FLAgs): tetravalent synthetic antibodies (Abs) that enable selective and robust activation of any FZD receptor in vitro and in vivo. Leveraging a panel of hundreds of synthetic Abs targeting FZDs and their co-receptors, we built FLAgs for selective and rational activation of one, two or multiple FZD receptors. FLAgs are composed of human antibody domains, and consequently, they are highly stable, amenable to large-scale production and facile purification, have predictable pharmacokinetics, and are likely to exhibit low immunogenicity. We thus anticipate that tailored FLAgs will improve directed differentiation and cell therapy endeavors, sustain tissue organoid growth, and enable therapeutic mobilization of endogenous stem cells in vivo to promote tissue repair after injury and restore function following tissue degeneration.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Synthetic antibodies targeting FZD and LRP6</title><p>We previously applied phage display to derive synthetic Abs using recombinant FZD CRDs as antigens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Pavlovic et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Steinhart et al., 2017</xref>).

None of these Abs were able to activate Î²catenin signaling, but rather, they all acted as Wnt signaling antagonists (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1DâE</xref>). We thus concluded that bivalent recruitment of FZD/LRP6 heterodimers by bispecific Abs, using these configurations, failed to recapitulate the stoichiometric, geometric or conformational properties of FZD/LRP6 complexes induced by natural Wnt ligands to stimulate signaling.</p><p>Recent reports showed that Wnt induces dimerization of FZD CRD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hirai et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Nile et al., 2017</xref>) and that FZD and LRP6 clustering may be required for signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Carron et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gong et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hua et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, we hypothesized that polyvalent binding to FZD and LRP6 may be required for effective signaling, and we developed a novel tetravalent antibody format to explore this concept (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1F-H</xref>). The format consisted of a homodimeric or heterodimeric Fc with a diabody at either end, and thus contained four Ab paratopes that could be engineered individually for any specificity. We built three tetravalent molecules that all contained two pan-FZD paratopes at the N-termini of the Fc but differed in the nature of the anti-LRP6 paratopes at their C-termini: one targeted two WNT1 binding sites (F<sup>P+P</sup>-L6<sup>1+1</sup>), another targeted two WNT3A binding sites (F<sup>P+P</sup>-L6<sup>3+3</sup>), and the third contained one paratope each for the WNT1 and WNT3A binding sites (F<sup>P+P</sup>-L6<sup>1+3</sup>). F<sup>P+P</sup>-L6<sup>3+3</sup> and F<sup>P+P</sup>-L6<sup>1+1</sup> both activated Î²catenin signaling but the former wasÂ ~10 fold more efficacious (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Somewhat surprisingly, F<sup>P+P</sup>-L6<sup>1+3</sup> was~2 fold more efficacious than even F<sup>P+P</sup>-L6<sup>3+3</sup>, indicating that engagement of a strong WNT3A site and a weak WNT1 site together is more effective than engagement of two strong WNT3A sites. The two best FLAgs had single-digit nanomolar potency (EC<sub>50</sub>Â ~5 nM), which was virtually identical to the potency of purified WNT3A, and displayed a bell-shaped dose response profile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1IâJ</xref>). We interpret this as indicating that maximal stimulation requires multivalent binding of the FLAg and that decreased efficacy at higher concentrations is likely attributable to monovalent binding to either FZD or LRP6. Treatment of RKO cells, which express low levels of Î²catenin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Major et al., 2007</xref>), with F<sup>P+P</sup>-L6<sup>1+3</sup> caused dose- and time-dependent increases in Î²catenin protein levels and phosphorylation of DVL2, a hallmark of Wnt-FZD pathway activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E and F</xref>). Thus, tetravalent FLAgs are modular, engineerable, human Ab modalities that function as synthetic agonists of FZD and LRP6.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Characterization and dissection of FLAg binding and activity</title><p>To confirm the engineered affinity and specificity of the optimal FLAg F<sup>P+P</sup>-L6<sup>1+3</sup>, we used Bio-Layer Interferometry (BLI) to measure its binding kinetics to nine of the 10 human FZD CRDs and to human LRP6 ECD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). As anticipated, the FLAg bound with affinities in the picomolar range (<italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub>Â =Â 10â800 pM) to the six FZDs recognized by the FZD diabodies derived from the parent pan-FZD paratope (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Pavlovic et al., 2018</xref>) but did not bind detectably to the other three FZDs. Moreover, affinity for LRP6 was in the nanomolar range (<italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub>Â =Â 12 nM). We then used BLI to assess FLAg binding to various Fc receptors. The FLAg behaved similarly to a conventional IgG and interacted with FcRn in a dose and pH dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Natural IgGs bind to FcRn at pH 6.0 but not at pH 7.4, and this enables recycling during pinocytosis and consequent long half-life in vivo. The FLAg also behaved similarly to the IgG for interaction with other Fc effectors including complement (C1q), the natural killer cell marker CD16a, the B cell marker CD32a, and the monocyte and macrophage marker CD64 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1B</xref>).

Î²catenin signaling assays showed that maximal stimulation was reduced significantly by disabling one anti-FZD paratope or the anti-LRP6 paratope for the WNT1 binding site and was completely ablated by disabling the anti-LRP6 paratope for the WNT3A binding site or by simultaneously disabling one anti-FZD paratope and either of the anti-LRP6 paratopes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). We also substituted an anti-LRP5 paratope targeting the WNT3A binding site for the anti-LRP6 paratope targeting the WNT1 binding site to generate a molecule (F<sup>P+P</sup>-L5/6<sup>3</sup>) that could recruit both co-receptors and observed activity similar to that of F<sup>P+P</sup>-L6<sup>1+3</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, EC<sub>50</sub>Â =Â 4 nM). Taken together, these data showed that optimal agonist activity is achieved with a molecule capable of recruiting two FZDs through a common epitope and LRP6 through two distinct epitopes, but activity can be modulated to intermediate levels by disabling one of the anti-FZD or anti-LRP6 paratopes. Moreover, molecules that could recruit FZD and two different co-receptors were generated by combining two anti-FZD paratopes with one paratope each for LRP5 and LRP6.</p><p>We also explored the requirements for geometric and spatial constraints imposed by the intermolecular diabody format by substituting diabody pairs with pairs of less constrained intramolecular single-chain variable fragments (scFvs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Compared with F<sup>P+P</sup>-L6<sup>1+3</sup>, a FLAg that contained anti-FZD scFvs (F<sup>P*+P*</sup>-L6<sup>1+3</sup>) exhibited similar activity, whereas activity was significantly reduced for FLAgs that contained anti-LRP6 scFvs (F<sup>P+P</sup>-L6<sup>1*+3*</sup>) or scFvs at both ends (F<sup>P*+P*</sup>-L6<sup>1*+3*</sup>). These differences in activity were not due to differences in affinity, as BLI measurements showed comparable, high-affinity binding to LRP6 and FZD isoforms regardless of whether paratopes were presented in the diabody or scFv format (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1CâD</xref>). Taken together, these results showed that particular stoichiometries and geometries are required for the assembly of optimal FZD/LRP6 signaling complexes, and constraints are especially precise for LRP6, which requires engagement of two distinct epitopes in a specific geometry dictated by the diabody format. Notably, the looser constraints for FZD engagement enabled significant activation with a single anti-FZD paratope (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), which opens the door for further enhancing specificity or altering signaling by recruiting a different cell surface protein through an additional paratope in conjunction with an anti-FZD paratope at the N-termini of the heterodimeric Fc.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Assembly and activity of FLAgs with tailored specificities</title><p>We next investigated whether highly specific anti-FZD Abs could be used as building blocks to assemble FLAgs with tailored specificities. To explore this concept, we took advantage of four monospecific anti-FZD Abs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1A</xref>) and built a panel of FLAgs, each of which contained the anti-FZD5 paratope and a second monospecific paratope. A FLAg containing two identical anti-FZD5 paratopes exhibited monospecificity for FZD5. Moreover, when paired with one of the other monospecific anti-FZD paratopes, the anti-FZD5 paratope acted in an additive manner, enabling the facile assembly of bispecific FLAgs in a predictable manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Importantly, bispecific FLAgs maintain high affinities for the respective targeted Frizzled (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1B and 1C</xref>). Recent genetic and functional data support the idea that each Wnt protein may be endowed with a particular function determined by its FZD specificity profile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dijksterhuis et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Voloshanenko et al., 2017</xref>), and thus, FLAgs that mimic the specificities of particular Wnts would be useful analogs of those Wnt isoforms. We have shown that it is possible to engineer anti-FZD Abs covering numerous specificity profiles ranging from monospecific to pan-specific. Thus, given the modular and the additive nature of the FLAg architecture, we anticipate that it will be possible to build synthetic agonists with diverse and tailored specificities, including mimics of known Wnt specificity profiles.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46134.012</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>FLAgs with tailored specificities and activities.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Anti-FZD Fab specificity.

Addition of either WNT3A conditioned media or F<sup>P+P</sup>-L6<sup>1+3</sup> completely rescued the growth defects caused by LGK974 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C and D</xref>). Contrary to mouse small intestine organoids, human colorectal organoids do not have paneth cells and thus require exogenous source of Wnt growth factors. Incorporation of WNT3A conditioned media or F<sup>P+P</sup>-L6<sup>1+3</sup> was sufficient to propagate these organoids for multiple passages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E and F</xref>). We conclude that a pan-FZD FLAg can substitute for Wnt proteins to support growth of tissue organoids, and thus, the FLAg is a defined component that could alleviate limitations associated with the use of conditioned media or purified Wnt proteins.</p><p>F<sup>P+P</sup>-L6<sup>1+3</sup> recognizes mouse FZDs and LRP6, and it contains an Fc that interacts with the FcRn and should endow it with a long, Ab-like, half-life in vivo. Thus, we tested in mice whether F<sup>P+P</sup>-L6<sup>1+3</sup> could accumulate to levels that would be sufficient to activate Î²catenin signaling and mobilize endogenous stem cell activity. Within the intestinal stem cell niche, Wnt proteins secreted by mesenchymal cells induce expression of Î²catenin target genes in stem cells at the bottom of the crypt to direct their self-renewal, and the target gene <italic>LGR5</italic> is frequently used as a marker of stem cells in various tissues. Treatment of <italic>LGR5</italic>-GFP mice with C59 ablated Wnt production and caused rapid extinction of <italic>LGR5</italic> expression and the linked GFP signal in crypt stem cells. Strikingly, GFP expression was rescued upon co-treatment with F<sup>P+P</sup>-L6<sup>1+3</sup> by intraperitoneal injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G and H</xref>). We conclude that F<sup>P+P</sup>-L6<sup>1+3</sup> has a sufficient half-life and bioavailability to enable Î²catenin activation at levels that promote self-renewal of intestinal stem cells in the absence of endogenous Wnt.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Modular tetravalent agonists for tailored activation of FZD and its co-receptors will enable precise interrogation and control of Wnt signaling circuits in vitro and in vivo. Indeed, full control over specificities, achieved by rationally combining paratopes within the four targeting sites of FLAgs, makes possible the functional mimicry of the signaling properties intrinsic to each Wnt. Moreover, monospecific and bispecific FLAgs can be engineered to activate signals with greater precision than is possible with natural Wnts. Because significant activity can be achieved with only one FZD binding site, the fourth site within the tetravalent FLAg represents an opportunity for additional engineering with tissue-specific paratopes to confer localized activity. We also envision that paratopes for other Wnt co-receptors, such as ROR1/2, RYK and PTK7, may be used to build FZD agonists to activate alternate Î²catenin-independent Wnt pathways that remain under-explored due to a lack of specific tools.</p><p>In terms of mechanism of action, the requirement for tetravalency in optimal FLAgs likely indicates that maximal activity requires assembly of FZD and LRP5/6 in higher order complexes. Also, the fact that F<sup>P+P</sup>-L6<sup>1+3</sup> was more active than F<sup>P+P</sup>-L6<sup>3+3</sup> suggests that engagement of both Wnt binding sites within LRP6 may result in intramolecular rearrangements that stabilize conformations that are more favorable for signaling activity. Intriguingly, recent structural work reported a 2:2 stoichiometry of Wnt ligand and FZD CRD that could be modeled to recruit two LRP5/6 molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hirai et al., 2019</xref>). Our results suggest that bivalent recruitment of one FZD and one LRP5/6 molecule is sufficient for signaling activity but engagement of an oligomeric complex, composed of two FZD and one or two LRP5/6 molecules, is required for maximal activation. Therefore, tetravalent FLAg molecules may be better than bivalent agonists for recapitulating mechanisms employed by Wnt proteins to engage FZD-LRP5/6 receptor complexes. Additional work to probe the structural basis for FLAg activity may shed light on the molecular mechanisms underlying Wnt receptor activation.</p><p>Practically, we foresee that the defined composition, high specific activity, and modular design of FLAgs will aid the derivatization and maintenance of three-dimensional tissue organoids and will profoundly impact the directed differentiation of progenitor stem cells, paving the way for disease modeling and cell therapy. Ultimately, the Ab-like character and bioavailability of FLAgs opens up new therapeutic possibilities for the mobilization of stem cells to promote tissue regeneration and to activate FZD complexes in human disease contexts where their activity is deficient.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Ab selections and screens</title><p>The phage-displayed synthetic library F was used to select for Fabs that bound to Wnt receptors, as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Persson et al., 2013</xref>).

Although the work is of interest, we regret to inform you that the findings at this stage are too preliminary for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Specifically, we appreciate the importance of this new set of tools that could enable ground-breaking studies by many groups to better understand the specificity and combinatorial complexity of Wnt:Receptor binding and signaling (at least the first, early steps). On the other hand, it was felt that creating a fusion protein to aggregate two signaling entities is not a new strategy. The in vivo experiments seem quite limited and need further quantification and statistics. The paper could be expanded to show how their &quot;FLAg&quot; reagent provides higher resolution insight into activity and/or delineates a specific activity via a specific FZD. Given these concerns, on balance, we feel that you should come back with a new paper with further controls and more in vivo and in vitro experiments that are well quantified. This new submission could then be considered as a Tools and Resource and every effort would be made to return the paper to the same reviewers. The full reviews are listed below for your information.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>Tao et al. present a new type of Wnt mimic called FLAg (for Frizzled Lrp Agonist). FLAgs are tetravalent antibodies engineered to simultaneously engage a Frizzled receptor and LRP5/6 co-receptor in ways that aggregate them to activate downstream Wnt signals. The specificities of the Flags were developed through phage display screening and this study shows that specific FZD receptors can be engaged, allowing one to interrogate downstream events specific to one type of Wnt and one type of FZD receptor. The authors show activity of these reagents through in vitro reporter assays (via Î²-catenin levels and/or phosphorylated dishevelled), small intestinal organoid cultures, and in an in vivo reporter mouse where intestinal stem cells are labeled by LGR5-GFP. While the latter two assays do not necessarily report on receptor specificity, they do demonstrate viable FLAg activity in a more complex environment. Given that it is difficult to purify active Wnt ligands, FLAgs represent new tools that can interrogate the Wnt:FZD space much better than any reagent developed so far. The manuscript is mainly focused on development and validation of these intriguing reagents, with some mechanistic insight (albeit minor). Overall this study is an important advance that will be of interest to i) research groups using organoids to study normal and diseased tissue, ii) developmental biologists that find specific Wnts or Frizzleds important in their system and iii) protein engineers in the therapeutics community â a community interested in developing reagents that either inhibit or activate Wnt signaling.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>In this study, the authors reported the newly synthesized tetravalent antibodies 'FLAgs', which are water soluble, modular and engineerable FZD/LRP agonists, and could activate Wnt-Î²-catenin signaling via formation of a complex with specific FZD and LRP5/6 to control the differentiation of PSCs, sustain mouse small intestinal organoids in vitro, and maintain the mouse small intestinal stem cell functions in vivo. Although the present results contain interest findings, but as the authors cited (Nature, 2017 May 11;545(7653):234-237), it has been already reported that the bivalent FZD/LRP agonists, which are also water soluble, easily produced, modular and engineerable, bind simultaneously various FZD and LRP6, and activate the Wnt-Î²-catenin pathway to direct the differentiation of MSCs, support the growth of various human tissue organoids in vitro, and regulate the metabolic zonation of liver in mouse model. It seems to this reviewer that the present study lacks novelty.</p><p>The authors proposed some advances of their FLAgs compared with the bivalent FZD/LRP agonists. For example, due to their tetravalent structure, FLAgs could recognize the more diverse targets in specific signaling contexts by the replacement of one FZD binding site with a module targeting another paratope. However, as shown in Figure 2D, FP+0 exhibited only about 1/10 Luciferase activity when compared with FP+P. Therefore, the authors' proposal seems not to be promising. In addition, the authors also proposed that since FLAgs contain the IgG-Fc component in their structure, they would show the antibody-like characters in vivo, that is, good bioavailability, long half-life time, and low immunogenicity. However, the presented data were only in-vitro binding assay. It is hard to emphasize the Ab-like character of FLAgs as an advantage.</p><p>Other detailed comments are as follows.</p><p>1) Figures 1E and F and 2D: The authors should add the positive- and negative-control experiments. Treatment with purified Wnt3a proteins as positive control and that with purified DKK1 proteins as negative control assay would be appropriate.</p><p>2) Figure 3A and B: The actual measured values of Kd of BLI assay should be presented to directly compare to the binding affinity of each Fx to FZD paratopes. There is possibility that F2 shows little binding affinity to FZD2 when compared with F5 to FZD5 in Figure 3A and that F2+5 shows little binding affinity to FZD5 when compared with F5+5 to FZD5 in Figure 3B.</p><p>3) Figure 3C: The authors should use other cell lines, such as L cells (expressing FZD7), A375 and SH-SY5Y cells (expressing Fzd2), and A549 cells (expressing Fzd2, 4, 6, and 8) to validate FLAgs other than F5+5 or FP+P.</p><p>4) Figure 4C: Results are not convincing. Quantification and statistical analyses are absolutely required.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>Sidhu and colleagues describe a platform to create selective FZD agonists by combining different FZD and LRP6 binders selected by phage display into tetravalent complexes that potently activate Wnt signaling pathways. They characterized &gt;160 different FZD binders for their binding affinities for all ten FZD receptors. They further combined multiple FZD binders, together with binders of LRP5/6 into tetravalent complexes (&quot;FLAgs&quot;) that showed similar affinity and activity as 'native' Wnt proteins. By combining different FZD binders, FLAgs can activate different FZD/co-receptor complexed and have the potential to selectively mimic the activity of different Wnt proteins. They further demonstrate the potency of FLAgs ex vivo and in vivo.</p><p>This is an important study that describes a platform for rational design of Wnt signaling agonists with broad applicability for mechanistic studies, as well as for regenerative medicine. While 'artificial' Wnt agonists have been described before, the contribution of this study is the rational design of Wnt agonists, with the potential for further extension due to the tetravalent design of the FLAgs.</p><p>I have a few comments that I feel the authors should address prior to publication:</p><p>1) FLAgs show a bell-shaped activity curve (Figure 1D), similar to previous Wnt agonists. It would be helpful for the reader to know whether a similar activity curve can be observed in other assays, e.g. for organoid growth</p><p>2) Figure 3C consists of low quality images, these should be replaced with better images.</p><p>3) I might have missed it, but I could not find the epitope sequences of Fabs used in this study.

We are also excited with the overall positive reviews of all three reviewers and their recognition that this will change our ability to study Wnt signalling. Admittedly, as you pointed out, bivalent molecules and soluble âsurrogateâ Wnt ligands have been reported by the Garcia group. However, there is several very important distinctions between the âGarciaâ molecule and the FLAgs reported in our manuscript. First, the FLAgs are all antibody based and as such are long-lived in vivo and as we demonstrate can be injected as proteins and maintain activity to activate endogenous signaling in the mouse. In order to perform in vivo studies, Garcia et al. had to deliver the Wnt surrogate using adenoviral vectors, presumably because of the instability and the lack of bioactivity of their molecule (PMID: 28467818). Second, we show clearly that tetravalent engagement of Wnt/Fzd is required for optimal activity and to accurately mimic the natural signalling complex. The Garcia molecules are bivalent, and thus, the tetravalent FLAgs provide higher activity. Third, the tetravalent and modular nature of the FLAgs provides a facile means to build virtually any FZD monospecific or bispecific agonist by simple engineering, and thus, the FLAg approach opens up vast possibilities for mimicking natural Wnt ligands and extending to specificities beyond what is achieved by nature. We believe that in addition to providing powerful new research tools, FLAg will form first-in-class novel medicine that will promote Wnt signaling for regenerative medicine applications.</p><p>We are thankful to Reviewer #1, who recognizes that our study is an important and exciting advance that will impact not only researchers in the Wnt community but also more broadly the expanding number of researchers interested/using tissue organoids and the protein engineering community.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><italic>In this study, the authors reported the newly synthesized tetravalent antibodies 'FLAgs', which are water soluble, modular and engineerable FZD/LRP agonists, and could activate Wnt-Î²-catenin signaling via formation of a complex with specific FZD and LRP5/6 to control the differentiation of PSCs, sustain mouse small intestinal organoids</italic> in vitro<italic>, and maintain the mouse small intestinal stem cell functions</italic> in vivo<italic>.

We understand that the tetravalent FLAg are similar in principle to the reported âsurrogateâ Wnt molecule described by Garcia, however we believe that the reviewer missed the most important difference in that the FLAg are active âin vivoâ when injected as proteins whereas the Garcia surrogate needs to be delivered with adenovirus. We believe this bioactivity is provided by the antibody design of the FLAg, which confers stability and long half lives in vivo.</p><p>With respect to the advantage of the tetravalent modality of the FLAg, we foresee that the principal advantage will be the modularity that this is providing. Indeed, any of the Frizzled antibody can easily be subcloned into the two Frizzled binding sites thereby providing the ability to tailor the desired specificity using the available Frizzled antibodies. For example, combining selective FZD2 and FZD5 antibodies in one FLAg would lead to a bispecific FLAg specifically activating both of these FZD receptors. In addition, since the F<sup>P+0</sup>-L6<sup>1+3</sup> molecule still exhibited 35-40 folds activation (admittedly 1/10 of the parent molecule) we suggested that using this binding site to target the molecule to a specific cellular context or tissue using another antibody could provide more specificity and limit toxicity when delivered in vivo. Off course this remains to be seen but it demonstrates the modularity and versatility of the tetravalent FLAg.</p><p>Another aspect that we did not discuss in the manuscript is that by disabling one of the FZD targeting paratopes in the F<sup>P+0</sup>-L6<sup>1+3</sup> molecule, we in essence generates a bivalent molecule similar to the Wnt surrogate reported by Garcia. As pointed out by the reviewer, this molecule only exhibit 10% of the maximal activity obtained with the tetravalent FLAg, suggesting that engagement of a higher order FZD:LRP5/6 oligomers may provide higher signalling activity. Interestingly, a recent study (PMID: 31036956) suggests that Wnt proteins may be favoring the formation of a Frizzled and LRP5/6 oligomeric complex containing 2 Frizzled and 2 LRP5/6 proteins. The tetravalent FLAg molecule may therefore better mimic Wnt proteins and provide higher signaling activity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Other detailed comments are as follows.</p><p>1) Figures 1E and F and 2D: The authors should add the positive- and negative-control experiments.

Since the pathway is not active in the absence of ligand we donât see how the addition of the inhibitor DKK1 would add anything.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Figure 3A and B: The actual measured values of Kd of BLI assay should be presented to directly compare to the binding affinity of each Fx to FZD paratopes. There is possibility that F2 shows little binding affinity to FZD2 when compared with F5 to FZD5 in Figure 3A and that F2+5 shows little binding affinity to FZD5 when compared with F5+5 to FZD5 in Figure 3B.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting point raised by the reviewer. We now provide in Figure 3âfigure supplement 1B and C the BLI data and the measured Kd for the FZD5 specific FLAg and all the bispecific FZD5 FLAg presented in Figure 3B.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Figure 3C: The authors should use other cell lines, such as L cells (expressing FZD7), A375 and SH-SY5Y cells (expressing Fzd2), and A549 cells (expressing Fzd2, 4, 6, and 8) to validate FLAgs other than F5+5 or FP+P.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a good point raised by reviewer #2. To extend our findings to other FLAgs we used HEK293 cells for which systematic CRISPR knockout of Frizzled receptors was conducted and revealed that FZD1, FZD2 and FZD7 were redundantly required for activation of Î²catenin signalling in response to WNT3/WNT3A (PMID: 28733458). Supporting this data, we demonstrate that FZD2 and FZD7 but not FZD4 and FZD5 specific FLAg molecules activate Î²-catenin signalling in these cells (Figure 3D).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Figure 4C: Results are not convincing. Quantification and statistical analyses are absolutely required.</p></disp-quote><p>For Figure 4C, we provided a quantification of the cell viability in Figure 4D using CellTiter-glo. There is very little signal upon treatment of the organoids with LGK974 confirming previous results that the viability and growth of mouse small intestinal organoids depend on Wnt secreted by the paneth cells. Addition of WNT3A conditioned media or the pan-FLAg completely rescued the growth of organoids in the presence of LGK974. We feel that the celltiter-glo viability quantification is adequate and the results are black and white. Perhaps the reviewer was referring to the quality of the pictures, which admittedly are not by themselves convincing, but we feel that with the viability quantification this is very clear. We have added the statistics on the cell viability quantification and are now providing zoom-in inset pictures to showcase the viability.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[â¦] I have a few comments that I feel the authors should address prior to publication:</p><p>1) FLAgs show a bell-shaped activity curve (Figure 1D), similar to previous Wnt agonists. It would be helpful for the reader to know whether a similar activity curve can be observed in other assays, e.g. for organoid growth</p></disp-quote><p>We performed a dose response curve for the FLAg for growth of mouse intestinal organoids and show no difference in growth rate between 0.1nM and 100nM suggesting that these doses are saturated and that even if there is a âbell shapeâ relationship in the dose response, the residual signaling activity at the highest dose of FLAg is likely more than enough to sustain growth (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>). Of note, we only observe a 30-45% reduction of maximal signaling activity with large amount of FLAg (Figure 1D), so the remaining activity with high concentration of FLAg is likely more than enough to sustain organoid growth. Another consideration is the presence of Rspondin in the conditioned media that amplify Wnt-Î²catenin signaling activity and suggesting that very little exogenous Wnt is needed. In fact, in the dose response for the pan-FLAg in the mouse intestinal organoids assay, as little as 100pM seems to be sufficient to maximally sustain the growth.</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-46134-resp-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Figure 3C consists of low quality images, these should be replaced with better images.</p></disp-quote><p>Reviewer #3 probably referred to Figure 4C.
