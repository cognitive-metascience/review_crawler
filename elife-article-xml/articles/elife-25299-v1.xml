stability. How SUV39 enzymes localize to their target genomic loci remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that chromatin-associated RNA contributes to the stable association of SUV39H1 with constitutive heterochromatin in human cells. We find that RNA associated with mitotic chromosomes is concentrated at pericentric heterochromatin, and is encoded, in part, by repetitive α-satellite sequences, which are retained in cis at their transcription sites. Purified SUV39H1 directly binds nucleic acids through its chromodomain; and in cells, SUV39H1 associates with α-satellite RNA transcripts. Furthermore, nucleic acid binding mutants destabilize the association of SUV39H1 with chromatin in mitotic and interphase cells – effects that can be recapitulated by RNase treatment or RNA polymerase inhibition – and cause defects in heterochromatin function. Collectively, our findings uncover a previously unrealized function for chromatin-associated RNA in regulating constitutive heterochromatin in human cells.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.25299.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.25299.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25299.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Each cell in a human body contains the same DNA sequence, which serves as a set of instructions for how the body should develop and operate. However, only certain sections of DNA are “active” at any particular time and in any given type of cell. When a section of DNA is active, cells make many copies of it using a molecule called RNA. When a section of DNA in inactive, very little RNA is made. Some sections of DNA must always be kept inactive to avoid damaging the cell.</p><p>DNA is packaged around proteins called histones, and enzymes that modify histones control which sections of DNA are switched on or off. One such modifying enzyme, called SUV39H1, is important for inactivating sections of DNA that could cause harm to the cell if they are active. Previous studies showed that the loss of SUV39H1 and related proteins cause abnormalities and cancer in mice. However, it is not clear how this enzyme identifies and inactivates the DNA it needs to target.</p><p>Johnson, Yewdell et al. studied SUV39H1 in human cells. The experiments show that RNA binds to the SUV39H1 enzyme and controls how it interacts with DNA. Specifically, Johnson, Yewdell et al. found that sections of DNA that are inactive can still make a small amount of RNA, and that this RNA tethers SUV39H1 to the DNA to keep the DNA switched off. Mutant forms of SUV39H1 that are unable to interact with RNA fall off the DNA, which allows DNA sequences that are normally switched off to become active.</p><p>The findings of Johnson, Yewdell et al. reveal a new role for RNAs in regulating whether DNA is switched on or off. The next step is to determine whether other enzymes that can also modify histones use the same mechanism to activate or inactivate DNA. Differences in how the activity of DNA is regulated between individuals plays a crucial role in generating the diversity we see in nature. Therefore, this work helps us to understand our basic biology and may provide new opportunities for treating disease.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi"

identified in forward genetic screens as a suppressor of position effect variegation in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Tschiersch et al., 1994</xref>). Previous studies identified important functions for the evolutionarily conserved SUV39 proteins in the silencing of heterochromatin, as well as in chromosome segregation and cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ekwall et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Melcher et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Peters et al., 2001</xref>). This family of chromatin-modifying enzymes includes Clr4 in fission yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Nakayama et al., 2001</xref>), as well as SUV39H1 and SUV39H2 in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Rea et al., 2000</xref>). SUV39 proteins catalyze the di- and tri-methylation of lysine 9 of histone H3 (H3K9me2/3), and these histone modifications are bound by chromodomain-containing proteins, including the SUV39 enzymes themselves and the HP1 family of proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Al-Sady et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bannister et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lachner et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Müller et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wang et al., 2012</xref>). HP1 protein binding to H3K9me2/3 chromatin is then thought to drive chromatin compaction and transcriptional repression through oligomerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Canzio et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fan et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Grewal and Jia, 2007</xref>).</p><p>SUV39H1 and H3K9me3 are predominately associated with constitutive heterochromatin, which represses ‘selfish’ genetic elements and repetitive DNA to promote genomic stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bulut-Karslioglu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Peters et al., 2001</xref>). In many eukaryotes, constitutive heterochromatin is concentrated at the repetitive sequences flanking centromeres, and is termed pericentric heterochromatin. In fission yeast, disruption of pericentric heterochromatin causes chromosome cohesion defects and chromosome missegregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bernard et al., 2001</xref>); and in mammals, defective pericentric heterochromatin and aberrant transcription of pericentric repeats are associated with genomic instability and cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Peters et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Ting et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Zhu et al., 2011</xref>). These defects in constitutive heterochromatin are most evident in SUV39H1 and SUV39H2 double knockout mice, which exhibit reduced embryonic viability, small stature, chromosome instability, an increased risk of tumor formation, and male infertility owing to defective spermatogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Peters et al., 2001</xref>). Human SUV39H1 has been implicated in a variety of complex biological processes such as DNA damage repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Alagoz et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Ayrapetov et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Zheng et al., 2014</xref>), telomere maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">García-Cao et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Porro et al., 2014</xref>), cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Allan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Scarola et al., 2015</xref>), and aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Despite the fundamental role of SUV39H1 and SUV39H2 in heterochromatin formation, it is largely unclear how these enzymes are localized at specific genomic sites to generate heterochromatin. Other chromatin modifiers – in addition to binding DNA, post-translationally modified histones, and other chromatin-associated proteins – depend on interactions with noncoding RNAs for their proper localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Margueron and Reinberg, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Rinn and Chang, 2012</xref>). In fission yeast, the localization of pericentric heterochromatin proteins, including the SUV39 homolog Clr4, relies on the RNAi machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bühler and Moazed, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Grewal and Jia, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Moazed, 2011</xref>), and RNAi has also been implicated in heterochromatin formation in other eukaryotic systems as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fukagawa et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Pal-Bhadra et al., 2004</xref>). Recent studies reported that RNA is involved in targeting SUV39H1 to telomeres and to the <italic>Oct4</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Porro et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Scarola et al., 2015</xref>); however, it is unclear whether RNA plays a broader role in SUV39H1-dependent heterochromatin formation, and if direct RNA binding regulates the association of SUV39H1 with pericentric heterochromatin.</p><p>In this study, we establish that chromatin-associated RNA contributes to the localization of SUV39H1 at constitutive heterochromatin in humans. We find that RNA associates with the pericentric heterochromatin of human mitotic chromosomes in primary and immortalized cell lines, and that a portion of this RNA is encoded by pericentric α-satellite sequences. We show that SUV39H1 binds without any observed sequence preference to both DNA and RNA in vitro, and that SUV39H1 binds RNA transcribed from pericentromeric repeats in human cells. Mutations that disrupt the nucleic acid binding function of SUV39H1 cause defects in its localization to pericentric heterochromatin, destabilize SUV39H1’s association with chromatin, and result in heterochromatin silencing defects. We propose a model in which the direct binding of SUV39H1 to RNA and to methylated histones ensures proper constitutive heterochromatin function in humans.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>RNA associates with the pericentric regions of human mitotic chromosomes</title><p>Chromatin-associated RNA has a well-studied role in the formation of pericentric heterochromatin in fission yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bühler and Moazed, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Grewal and Jia, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Moazed, 2011</xref>), but the role of RNA at human pericentric heterochromatin remains largely unexplored. To test if RNA is associated with pericentric heterochromatin in human cells, we used fluorescent pulse labeling of RNA to observe its localization on mitotic chromosomes. Because transcription is largely repressed in mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gottesfeld and Forbes, 1997</xref>), RNAs bound to mitotic chromosomes may be more likely to play regulatory roles than RNAs associated with chromatin during interphase. The morphology of condensed mitotic chromosomes also provides landmarks such as the primary centromere constriction and the telomere to facilitate the localization of RNAs.</p><p>We visualized chromosome-associated RNA by treating HeLa cells with the modified nucleoside ethynyl uridine (EU) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Jao and Salic, 2008</xref>), centrifuging mitotic chromosomes onto coverslips, and fluorescently labeling the RNA by coupling an azido-modified fluorophore to the alkyne group using copper-catalyzed cycloaddition (click chemistry). The EU-RNA signal we detected on human mitotic chromosomes, although distributed in distinct puncta along chromosome arms, was particularly concentrated around centromeres (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The RNA signal was sensitive to treatment with Ribonuclease (RNase) A, confirming that our EU treatment specifically labeled RNA; but not sensitive to RNase III or RNase H, indicating that this RNA possesses single-stranded (ssRNA) regions but not nuclease-accessible double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) or RNA-DNA hybrids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Four out of eight different cell lines showed RNA enrichment at pericentric regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B, C and D</xref>). Both primary fibroblasts and HeLa cells exhibited pericentric RNA localization, indicating that this phenomenon is not specific to immortalized cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25299.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>RNA associates with the pericentric regions of human mitotic chromosomes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) RNA localization on human mitotic chromosomes.

This RNA is presumably transcribed directly from the underlying centromeric DNA sequences, which in humans are composed of α-satellite repeats. α-satellite sequences, as well as other repeat classes – such as β-satellite and Satellite III – are also present at human pericentric regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Choo et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Greig and Willard, 1992</xref>). To determine which RNA sequences are localized at pericentric heterochromatin, we performed RNA FISH with different repeat-specific probes. We used DLD-1 cells for this analysis, as they have a more stable karyotype than HeLa cells and allow for more reliable chromosome identification. We saw no RNA FISH signal with β-satellite (chromosomes 13, 14, 15, 21, and 22) or Satellite III (chromosomes 14 and 22) probes despite observing clear DNA FISH signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>). However, we detected RNA FISH signal with two different α-satellite probes, one of which was specific for the pericentric α-satellite array D1Z5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Pironon et al., 2010</xref>). This signal was sensitive to RNase treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) and colocalized with H3K9me3 staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1G</xref>), but not with HEC1 staining that labels the core centromere/kinetochore (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). We also observed that α-satellite RNA was localized in cis (i.e. at the same site of its transcription), as we saw that the RNA FISH signal was constrained to only the chromosomes known to contain the specific α-satellite DNA sequences recognized by our probes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F and G</xref>). Interestingly, even though we detected EU-RNA signal enriched at pericentric regions on HeLa chromosomes and not on DLD-1 chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B and D</xref>), we detected α-satellite RNA by RNA FISH in both cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>), indicating that α-satellite RNA is localized at pericentric regions even in cells lines with low pericentric EU-RNA signal.</p><p>To determine which RNA polymerase transcribes the pericentric RNA, we added different polymerase inhibitors to cells during EU treatment. We measured a reduction of approximately 50% in pericentric RNA signal after treatment with α-amanitin or triptolide – which preferentially inhibit Pol II – but observed a complete loss of signal after treatment with actinomycin D or CX-5461 – which preferentially inhibit Pol I, and show no detectable Pol II inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A and B</xref>). Thus, most of the pericentric RNA signal we observe appears to be transcribed by Pol I. Total α-satellite RNA levels were not decreased by any RNA polymerase inhibition, suggesting that the amount of α-satellite transcribed in our 6 hr treatment window is likely a small percentage of the total α-satellite RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>).</p><p>Our data does not exclude the possibility that some Pol II-dependent transcription is also occurring at the core centromere, as has been previously reported in human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chan et al., 2012</xref>). In that study, incorporation of fluorescent nucleotides was only assayed on mitotic chromosomes, and because we label cells with EU for a longer time period (4–12 hr), we are likely observing a broader set of RNAs that are being transcribed before and during mitosis.</p><p>To investigate the cell cycle timing of pericentric RNA synthesis, we either labeled cells continuously prior to mitosis, or for a short pulse followed by washout prior to mitosis. We found that continuous EU labeling for 8 or 4 hr before mitosis led to pericentric EU-RNA signal, but a 4 hr EU pulse followed by a 4 hr chase resulted in no EU-RNA signal on mitotic chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C and D</xref>). This suggests that the pericentric RNA we observe on mitotic chromosomes is transcribed within the 4 hr before mitosis, or that it is transcribed earlier but dissociates from chromosomes in the 4 hr washout period after labeling.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>SUV39H1 localization depends on chromatin-associated RNA</title><p>The finding that RNA is bound to the pericentric regions of human mitotic chromosomes is intriguing in light of previous observations that direct RNA binding by the heterochromatin factors Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) and HP1α is important for their proper localization and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Muchardt et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Zhao et al., 2008</xref>). Because SUV39 enzymes are the primary H3K9 methyltransferases acting at pericentric regions, we tested if the association of SUV39H1 with pericentric heterochromatin also depends on RNA. We digested chromosomes with RNase A and assessed SUV39H1 localization. In a stable HeLa cell line expressing GFP-tagged SUV39H1 under doxycycline inducible control, we induced expression with a 6 hr pulse of doxycycline to avoid SUV39H1 mislocalization to chromosome arms caused by overexpression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Melcher et al., 2000</xref>). We found that RNase A treatment reduced the pericentric localization of SUV39H1 to 43 ± 4% of the untreated control, and that SUV39H1 localization could be completely rescued by adding specific RNase inhibitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>).

We also determined that total SUV39H1 protein levels are not affected by RNase A treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1M</xref>).

Because we were unable to purify full-length SUV39H1 protein free of degradation products, we purified truncations of SUV39H1 containing either the N-terminal extension alone (amino acids 1–41), the chromodomain alone (amino acids 42–106), the N-terminal extension plus the chromodomain (amino acids 1–106), or the C-terminus consisting of the pre-SET, SET, and post-SET domains (amino acids 107–412) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>). We found that the SUV39H1 truncations containing the chromodomain bound to RNA with the highest affinity, whereas the C-terminal fragment showed no detectable binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C and D</xref>). The addition of the N-terminal extension to the chromodomain of SUV39H1 (1–106) provided a 16-fold increase in affinity relative to the chromodomain alone (42-106), with dissociation constants (K<sub>d</sub>) of 0.15 ± 0.01 µM and 2.31 ± 0.17 µM, respectively.

However, SUV39H1 binds a variety of repetitive sequences in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bulut-Karslioglu et al., 2014</xref>) with no apparent DNA consensus sequence, making it unlikely that DNA recognition is the sole factor determining SUV39H1 targeting. In addition, the chromodomain of SUV39H1 has been shown previously to be important for its localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Melcher et al., 2000</xref>), but the relative contributions of binding to methylated H3K9 versus other interactions mediated by the chromodomain were not assessed.</p><p>Here, we identify both RNA and H3K9me2/3 as main determinants of SUV39H1 localization. Importantly, the RNA-dependent mechanism for SUV39 function appears to be present in both human and mouse cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Shirai et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Velazquez Camacho et al., 2017</xref>) suggesting a conserved role for RNA in regulating constitutive heterochromatin. A possible advantage to binding chromatin-associated RNA is that it provides direct feedback on the transcriptional state of the locus, ensuring that over-transcribed repeats retain more SUV39H1 to promote repression. Because SUV39H1 displays no apparent sequence preference for binding RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E and F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>), it is unlikely that RNA binding alone could confer selective binding for one genomic region over another. It is also unlikely that H3K9me3 binding alone targets SUV39H1, for many H3K9me3 sites exist in the mammalian genome, but not all recruit SUV39H1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bulut-Karslioglu et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>We propose a model in which SUV39H1 engages chromatin through several different interactions that in combination define its genomic distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1C</xref>). When direct binding to RNA is disrupted, SUV39H1 can still bind to H3K9me3; however, SUV39H1’s interaction with chromatin is destabilized, and its localization at heterochromatin is reduced. RNA binding may help SUV39H1 distinguish between target and non-target sites in the genome that both have H3K9me2/3. In addition to directly binding RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Porro et al., 2014</xref>), H3K9me3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E and F</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wang et al., 2012</xref>), and DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Müller et al., 2016</xref>), SUV39H1 also directly binds the deacetylase Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bosch-Presegué et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Vaquero et al., 2007</xref>), and associates with the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor (Rb) protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Nielsen et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Vandel et al., 2001</xref>). These and other interactions may influence SUV39H1 recruitment, stable association, and spread on chromatin – as well as its methyltransferase activity – to define its sites of action. Thus, a major question going forward is how the collective interactions between SUV39H1 and its binding partners give rise to locus specific targeting and heterochromatin formation. Towards this goal, we have demonstrated that H3K9me2/3 and chromatin-associated RNA are key determinants for SUV39H1 localization and are necessary for maintaining silenced constitutive heterochromatin in human cells.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture</title><p>HeLa, U2OS, HFF, HT1080, Huh-7, and primary fibroblasts were grown in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM), hTERT-RPE cells were grown in DMEM/F12 media, and DLD-1 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 media.

Cells were trypsinized, pelleted, and then resuspended in 30 mL PBS. To crosslink cells, formaldehyde was added to a final concentration of 0.1%, and cells were rotated at room temperature for 10 min. Crosslinking was stopped by adding 3 mL quenching buffer, then rotating cells for 5 min. Cells were pelleted and lysed in 3 mL denaturing lysis buffer (DLB) on ice for 10 min. Lysates were sonicated with a Branson Sonifier S-250A using a microtip (setting 4.5, 2 rounds of 10 pulses), diluted up to 8 mL with DLB, then cleared by spinning at 12,800 rpm then 33,000 rpm in a Type 70.1 Ti rotor for 10 min each at 4°C.

The following programs were used: α-satellite (98°C 30 s, then 40X cycles of 98°C 15 s, 60°C 15 s, 72°C 15 s), β-actin (98°C 30 s, then 40X cycles of 98°C 10 s, 72°C 30 s). qPCR was performed on a 7900HT Fast Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems), and the number of cycles to reach the automatically set threshold (C<sub>t</sub>) were determined using Sequence Detection Systems software. For each primer set, standard curves of diluted cDNA were used to assess the exponential amplification (expAmp) of the amplicon. The signal in each experimental sample was determined by signal = expAmp<sup>-Ct</sup>. For all α-satellite measurements, ‘-RT’ signal was subtracted from ‘+RT’ signal, as the repetitive nature of α-satellite DNA leads to high background. α-satellite signal was then divided by the β-actin or GAPDH signal to get final α-satellite normalized signal. For IP enrichment values, the α-satellite normalized signal for the IP was then divided by the α-satellite normalized signal of the input lysate.</p><p>To test inhibition of transcription after adding RNA polymerase inhibitors, RT-qPCR was performed essentially as described above with the following primers:</p><p>pre-tRNA(tyr) fwd (ASON 1991): CCTTCGATAGCTCAGCTGGTAGAG</p><p>pre-tRNA(tyr) rev (ASON 1990): AAAAAACCGCACTTGTCTCCTTCG</p><p>GAPDH pre-mRNA fwd (ASON 4619): CATGCCTTCTTGCCTCTTGT</p><p>GAPDH pre-mRNA rev (ASON 4620): TGAGGTCAATGAAGGGGTCA</p><p>45S pre-rRNA fwd (ASON 1891): CCTGCTGTTCTCTCGCGCGTCCGAG</p><p>45S pre-rRNA rev (ASON 1892): AACGCCTGACACGCACGGCACGGAG</p></sec><sec id="s4-19"><title>RNA-seq and analysis of repeat families</title><p>For total RNA-seq analysis of control and SUV39 DKO HeLa and DLD-1 cells, total RNA was purified using TriPure, then treated with 10 units of TURBO DNase (Life Technologies) at 37°C for 30 min per the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA was re-purified with TriPure, resuspended in DEPC-treated water, and quality checked by Bioanalyzer (Agilent). RNA was then analyzed either by RT-qPCR to measure α-satellite RNA levels as described above, or a cDNA library was generated for RNA-Seq analysis. For RNA-Seq, ribosomal RNAs were first depleted using a NEBnext rRNA depletion kit (New England Biolabs), RNA was purified using Agencourt Ampure XP beads (Beckman Coulter), then cDNAs were generated, amplified, and indexed with the ScriptSeq v2 RNA-Seq Library Preparation Kit (Epicentre) per the manufacturer’s instructions. Indexed libraries were quantified by Bioanalyzer and qPCR, pooled, and sequenced on a NextSeq 500 (Illumina).</p><p>For analysis of repetitive RNAs, raw fastq files were adapter trimmed and converted to fasta format. The fasta files were then split into smaller files of 1,000,000 sequences each. All smaller fasta files of each original fasta file were analyzed by RepeatMasker 4.0.3 using the human species database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bao et al., 2015</xref>). The RepeatMasker output file for each smaller fasta file was merged together to give the repeat content of the original fasta file. Repeat class and type was summarized using the buildSummary.pl script in the RepeatMasker utility script folder. The number of reads for each repeat in the RepeatMasker output file was normalized to the total number of repeats detected by RepeatMasker to obtain a frequency of detection for each repeat type. To calculate the fold enrichment for each repeat type, the frequency of each read in the SUV39 DKO cell line was divided by the frequency of the same read in the control cell line. A cutoff threshold for inclusion in the analysis was set at 300 reads per repeat type.</p><p>Analysis of non-repetitive RNA was performed by aligning reads (after PCR duplicate removal and adaptor trimming) to the UCSC hg38 build (downloaded Aug 14, 2015 and archived by Illumina iGenomes) using tophat2 (v 2.2.9).

SUV39H1-GFP expression was induced by adding 1 µg/mL doxycycline six hours before data collection. For drug treatment experiments, cells were treated with 1 μM CX-5461 (Millipore), 50 μg/mL α-amanitin (Santa Cruz Biotech), or 1 μM triptolide (Selleckchem) for 2 hr before image acquisition.

The authors perform a careful series of experiments showing that the stable association of a moderately overexpressed SUV39H1-EGFP protein with heterochromatic foci is RNase-sensitive. The authors further show that major satellite repeats are transcribed and give rise to RNAs that remain associated with mitotic chromosomes and are present in SUV39H1 immunoprecipitates. Using purified SUV39H1, the authors demonstrate that the enzyme binds to single stranded RNA of any sequence and identify specific mutations in the chromo domain of SUV39H1 that disrupt RNA binding without affecting its interaction with H3K9me3 peptides.</p><p>Finally, the authors demonstrate that the RNA binding mutations affect the stable binding of SUV39H1 to chromatin in vivo. Importantly, when the chromo domain RNA binding defective mutants are introduced into knockout cells, their weak association with centromeric heterochromatin is not further reduced by RNase treatment, providing strong support for the idea that specific interactions between the SUV39H1 chromo domain and RNA stabilize its association with heterochromatin. The experiments in the paper are straightforward and support the main conclusion of the paper. The model that the authors present, suggesting that non-specific RNA binding works alongside H3K9me3 to stabilize the association of SUV39h1 with chromatin, is reasonable and potentially important.</p><p>However, what is lacking in the study is any demonstration that the RNA binding activity described by authors contributes to the silencing function of SUV39H1 in vivo. This seems like a major shortcoming that needs to be addressed prior to publication.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) A demonstration of functional importance of the RNA binding needs to be performed. This should be tested by introducing wildtype versus RNA-binding mutant SUV39H1 into their SUV39H1/H2 DKO cells and seeing what happens to H3K9me levels and what happens to Silencing of major satellite repeats and other transposons?</p><p>2) The authors make the intriguing observation that transcription of α satellite RNA is not eliminated by inhibition of RNA pol II, but is eliminated by the inhibition of both RNA pol I and pol II (actinomycine D treatment). It would be very surprising if this were in fact the case. Does pol I localize to α repeats (by ChIP)? I think that the more likely explanation might be that their α-amanitin treatment is not inhibiting pol II completely. You need to show data that more convincingly clarify whether only PolII transcription is occurring, or better evidence for Pol I transcription at the α satellites.</p><p>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and C</xref> – you need to state the binding affinity of R55A &amp; R84A mutants for nucleic acid substrates used in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C-F</xref> to determine whether the decrease in binding is specific to RNA substrates. Without these data the assertion that R55A and R84A mutants are defective for binding to RNA only is untested in vitro, and would need to be removed from the text.</p><p>4) Comparing <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E, F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5C</xref>: Is the decrease in R55A's ability to bind to α-satellite RNA due to a decrease in H3K9me binding or interaction with RNA? The in vitro binding experiments (4E, F) reveal a decrease in H3K9me binding for R55A compared to the wild-type protein. This can contribute to the in vivo decrease in RIP signal in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>. This should be ruled out experimentally (see below).</p><p>5) A prediction of the proposed model is that loss of CD-mediated nucleic acid and H3K9me binding together should reduce SUV39H1 interaction with α-satellite RNAs more than either mutation alone. This can be done by creating a protein carrying a nucleic acid-binding mutation (R55A/R84A) with an H3K9me-binding mutation (W64/F43) (or a SET domain mutation in a Suv39H1/H2 mutant cell line). RIP experiments with these mutants will permit the authors to test this prediction directly. Either these experiments should be done or the model toned down.</p><p>6) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and 6.

To do this, we used CRISPR/Cas9 to make individual nucleic acid binding and H3K9me3 binding mutations in the endogenous SUV39H1 gene. We performed this gene editing in SUV39H2 knockout cells so that the activities of SUV39H2 did not obscure the analysis of mutant phenotypes. The results, shown in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, demonstrate that both nucleic acid binding and H3K9me3 binding by SUV39H1 contribute to α-satellite repression, and that ablating both interactions is largely equivalent to removing SUV39H1 altogether (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1J</xref>). The loss of repression of α-satellite sequences is accompanied by measurable decreases in H3K9me3 methylation. Interestingly, the R55A/F43A double mutant displays no additional defect in H3K9me3 compared to F43A alone, even though it shows a significant increase in α-satellite RNA levels – suggesting RNA binding of SUV39H1 may contribute to H3K9 methylation-independent roles for SUV39H1 in transcriptional repression. We believe this new data convincingly shows the functional importance of RNA binding by SUV39H1 and its importance in maintaining silencing of constitutive heterochromatin, and significantly strengthens the manuscript.</p><p><italic>2) The authors make the intriguing observation that transcription of α satellite RNA is not eliminated by inhibition of RNA pol II, but is eliminated by the inhibition of both RNA pol I and pol II (actinomycine D treatment). It would be very surprising if this were in fact the case. Does pol I localize to α repeats (by ChIP)? I think that the more likely explanation might be that their α-amanitin treatment is not inhibiting pol II completely. You need to show data that more convincingly clarify whether only PolII transcription is occurring, or better evidence for Pol I transcription at the α satellites.</italic> </p><p>We agree that incomplete Pol II inhibition could explain the EU-RNA signal on chromosomes after α-amanitin treatment. Because we were unable to find a Pol I antibody suitable for ChIP, we addressed this issue by performing a new set of experiments using a more diverse panel of RNA polymerase inhibitors – including triptolide, that exhibits much faster Pol II inhibition kinetics than α-amanitin (Bensaude, 2011) – and by providing a more quantitative assessment of EU-RNA levels and RNA polymerase inhibition specificity (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A, B</xref>). We find that both Pol II inhibitors (α-amanitin and triptolide) decrease EU-RNA levels by about 50%; however, our RT-qPCR analysis shows that EU-RNA levels largely correlate with Pol I inhibition, and although actinomycin D and CX-5461 show no inhibition of Pol II, they reduce EU-RNA down to background levels. This strongly indicates that the EU-RNA signal on mitotic chromosomes is predominantly transcribed by Pol I. The EU-RNA signal we observe likely includes other RNAs in addition to α- satellite. To examine α-satellite transcripts directly, we measured their levels by RT-qPCR and observed that none of our polymerase inhibition conditions led to a decrease in total α-satellite (although triptolide treatment resulted in a substantial α-satellite RNA increase) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>). This suggests that the α-satellite transcribed during our 6 hr treatment is likely a small subset of total α-satellite.</p><p><italic>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and C</xref> – you need to state the binding affinity of R55A &amp; R84A mutants for nucleic acid substrates used in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C-F</xref> to determine whether the decrease in binding is specific to RNA substrates. Without these data the assertion that R55A and R84A mutants are defective for binding to RNA only is untested in vitro, and would need to be removed from the text.</italic> </p><p>We agree that the R55A and R84A mutations likely disrupt binding to all nucleic acid substrates, including RNA and DNA. Therefore, we have changed our language in the manuscript to refer to these as nucleic acid binding mutants. One important note is that the treatment of mitotic chromosomes with RNase A, or treatment of interphase cells with RNA polymerase inhibitors, recapitulates defects of the nucleic acid binding mutants in these assays, indicating that the relevant binding substrate for SUV39H1 localization on chromosomes is likely RNA. Thus, in cases where we can ascribe the primary defect we observe in the mutants to RNA binding, we have maintained this phrase.</p><p><italic>4) Comparing <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E, F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5C</xref>: Is the decrease in R55A's ability to bind to α-satellite RNA due to a decrease in H3K9me binding or interaction with RNA? The in vitro binding experiments (4E, F) reveal a decrease in H3K9me binding for R55A compared to the wild-type protein. This can contribute to the in vivo decrease in RIP signal in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>. This should be ruled out experimentally (see below).</italic> </p><p>We acknowledge that the R55A mutation appears to cause a slight but insignificant decrease in SUV39H1 binding to H3K9me3. However, if the R55A mutation were really disrupting H3K9me3 binding, we would expect this to have a measurable effect on SUV39H1 localization. This is clearly not the case, as the localization defects of the R55A mutant – observed by IF on mitotic chromosomes and by FRAP in interphase cells – quantitatively matches the localization defects of R84A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>), which exhibits no measurable defect in H3K9me3 binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E, 4F</xref>). Therefore, we can be confident that the RIP difference we observe is due to R55A’s effects on nucleic acid binding, not on H3K9me3 binding (see also the response to point 5).</p><p><italic>5) A prediction of the proposed model is that loss of CD-mediated nucleic acid and H3K9me binding together should reduce SUV39H1 interaction with α-satellite RNAs more than either mutation alone. This can be done by creating a protein carrying a nucleic acid-binding mutation (R55A/R84A) with an H3K9me-binding mutation (W64/F43) (or a SET domain mutation in a Suv39H1/H2 mutant cell line). RIP experiments with these mutants will permit the authors to test this prediction directly. Either these experiments should be done or the model toned down.</italic> </p><p>We agree that a prediction of our model is that breaking nucleic acid binding and H3K9me3 binding together should have a larger effect on SUV39H1 function than breaking either of these interactions in isolation. To test this, we have performed new experiments (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>) that demonstrate that a double mutant of SUV39H1 that disrupts both nucleic acid binding and H3K9me binding (R55A/F43A) causes more substantial derepression of α-satellite transcription than either individual mutant alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref>). This experiment also addresses the above concern (point 4) – that effects of the R55A mutant may be due to a slight decrease in H3K9me3 recognition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E, F</xref>) – in that an R55A mutation would not add an additional defect on top of that contributed by F43A if R55A were solely acting through disrupting H3K9me3 binding.</p><p><italic>6) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and 6. Please show data to demonstrate that RNase A treatment of cells does not cause a decrease in SUV39H1 protein levels.</italic> </p><p>We have included a new supplemental figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1M</xref>) showing that RNase treatment does not decrease SUV39H1 protein levels.</p><p><italic>Other revisions:</italic></p><p><italic>1) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> – why only 4 out of the 8 cell lines tested show α-satellite pericentric RNA localization in mitosis? It will be good to see RNA-FISH data for HeLa cells as well.</italic> </p><p>We have now included data showing α-satellite RNA FISH signal on HeLa mitotic chromosomes (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>). Potential explanations for why we do not detect pericentric EU-RNA in all cells are: 1) RNA FISH is a more sensitive assay than EU-RNA labeling, EU is incorporated in only a subset of uridine positions and it only labels RNA transcribed during our incubation period, 2) there may be variation from cell line to cell line how much RNA is bound to chromosomes during mitosis. Because we can detect pericentric α- satellite RNA by RNA-FISH in both HeLas and DLD-1s, but only detect pericentric EU-RNA in HeLas, we conclude that the RNA FISH is the more reliable and sensitive assay.</p><p><italic>2) For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> – what is the affinity of NTE (1-42 aa's), for different nucleotide substrates? It will be good control to understand if NTE, by itself, has any nucleotide binding capacity.</italic> </p><p>We agree this in an important consideration, and have purified MBP-SUV39H1 1-41 and measured its binding to the 19mer ssRNA (updated <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). We found that 1-41 exhibits greatly reduced RNA binding affinity (51 μM) compared to either of the truncations, including the chromodomain (1-106: 0.15 μM, 42-106: 2.3 μM). However, it is interesting that the NTE is making an additional contribution to nucleic acid binding, and we plan to explore this effect further in the future.</p><p><italic>3)Subsection “RNA associates with the pericentric regions of human mitotic chromosomes”, last paragraph: Are there other genomic regions where the RNA is associated with mitotic chromosomes in cis? If yes, then what are those euchromatic/heterochromatic regions?</italic> </p><p>We are also very interested in the RNAs bound to mitotic chromosomes, and we hope to further explore the identities and functions of these RNA in the future. We have begun preliminary experiments purifying mitotic chromosomes from human cells in the hopes of analyzing bound RNAs by RNA-seq. In addition, our lab has developed a new technique, ChAR-seq, to map chromatin-associated RNAs genome-wide (Bell et al., 2017) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/03/20/118786">http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/03/20/118786</ext-link>), and we plan to apply this technique to mitotic cell populations. However, we feel that a comprehensive characterization of other genomic regions that might have cis-associated noncoding RNAs is outside the scope of this manuscript. We plan to explore this in a future study using the new methods we are currently developing.</p><p><italic>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and C</xref> – is the methylation efficiency of R55A and R84A mutants comparable to that of wild type protein? This will also impact results presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1D and E</xref>.</italic> </p><p>We have included a new supplemental figure comparing the ability of SUV39H1 mutants to methylate histone H3/H4 tetramer in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1F</xref>). The data show comparable methyltransferase activity between WT and mutants; however, our purified full-length SUV39H1 contains degradation products that make us wary of making quantitative comparisons. As observed in previous studies with other histone methyltransferases, we see that the addition of RNA to our reaction inhibits SUV39H1 methyltransferase activity (Cifuentes-Rojas et al., 2014; Kaneko et al., 2014). However, we see that this inhibition occurs with our nucleic acid binding mutants as well, suggesting that this RNA-dependent inhibition of methyltransferase activity is largely non-specific.</p><p><italic>5) Subsection “A model for the RNA-dependent stabilization of SUV39H1 on chromatin”, first paragraph. The discussion of the pombe HP1/Swi6 and its requirement for Clr4-dependent H3K9me is incorrect. Even though this was shown in the referenced paper, subsequent work using the complete deletion of swi6 (instead of a this special swi6 mutant) have shown that loss of Swi6 has little impact on Clr4-dependent H3K9me (Sadaie et al. 2004 EMBO; Motamedi et al. 2008 Mol Cell).</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewers for alerting us to this important point.
