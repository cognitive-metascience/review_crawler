maintenance, but its other physiological roles remain elusive. Here we show transcriptional and anatomical contributions of compartmentalized epidermal stem cells in tactile sensory unit formation in the mouse hair follicle. Epidermal stem cells in the follicle upper-bulge, where mechanosensory lanceolate complexes innervate, express a unique set of extracellular matrix (ECM) and neurogenesis-related genes. These epidermal stem cells deposit an ECM protein called EGFL6 into the collar matrix, a novel ECM that tightly ensheathes lanceolate complexes. EGFL6 is required for the proper patterning, touch responses, and αv integrin-enrichment of lanceolate complexes. By maintaining a quiescent original epidermal stem cell niche, the old bulge, epidermal stem cells provide anatomically stable follicle–lanceolate complex interfaces, irrespective of the stage of follicle regeneration cycle. Thus, compartmentalized epidermal stem cells provide a niche linking the hair follicle and the nervous system throughout the hair cycle.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>skin</kwd><kwd>stem cell</kwd><kwd>tactile sensation</kwd><kwd>hair follicle</kwd><kwd>extracellular matrix</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100006264</institution-id><institution>RIKEN</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Intramural grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fujiwara</surname><given-names>Hironobu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>25122720</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fujiwara</surname><given-names>Hironobu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008732</institution-id><institution>Uehara Memorial Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fujiwara</surname><given-names>Hironobu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007449</institution-id><institution>Takeda Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fujiwara</surname><given-names>Hironobu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005926</institution-id><institution>Cosmetology Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fujiwara</surname><given-names>Hironobu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Watt</surname><given-names>Fiona M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Watt</surname><given-names>Fiona M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Watt</surname><given-names>Fiona M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Heterogeneous epidermal stem cells define a niche for tactile sensation via providing a unique ECM and tissue architecture for nerves, revealing their new functions in coordinated sensory organ formation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Tissue stem cells in many epithelia, including the epidermis, intestine, mammary glands and lungs, often comprise heterogeneous populations with distinct transcriptional and anatomical features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Donati and Watt, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Xin et al., 2016</xref>). Individual stem cell pools contribute to tissue maintenance through different homeostatic and regenerative properties and give rise to distinct epithelial compartments, while they also hold plasticity to change their identity and function when perturbed. These recent findings question the traditional view of the role of stem cell heterogeneity, which underlies the theory of unidirectional stem cell differentiation hierarchy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Goodell et al., 2015</xref>). Although the biological significance of the heterogeneity and compartmentalization of epithelial stem cells has primarily been studied in the context of epithelial tissue maintenance and regeneration, its other physiological roles remain unclear.</p><p>Hair follicles are highly conserved touch sensory organs in the hairy skin that covers most of the mammalian body surface and detects touch signals essential for development and survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lumpkin et al., 2010</xref>). Hair follicles are innervated by mechanosensory end organs called lanceolate complexes, which are composed of parallel, longitudinally aligned low-threshold mechanoreceptor (LTMR) axonal endings and terminal Schwann cell processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Zimmerman et al., 2014</xref>). Hair follicles are also connected to arrector pili muscles (APMs), thus forming a unique regenerating motile sensory organ. These two hair follicle appendages attach to the permanent portion of the hair follicle, known as the bulge, where epidermal stem cells reside.</p><p>Hair follicle epidermal stem cells are heterogeneous in their molecular and functional properties and compartmentalized along the longitudinal axis of the hair follicle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Solanas and Benitah, 2013</xref>). The mid-bulge region contains CD34<sup>+</sup> slow-cycling epidermal stem cells that serve as a reservoir of epidermal stem cells and were once thought to be the master stem cells at the top of the epidermal hierarchy. A series of recent studies, however, identify several additional pools of different epidermal stem cells around the bulge (e.g. in the isthmus, junctional zone, upper-bulge and hair germ). For example, the upper-bulge is a niche for <italic>Gli1</italic><sup>+</sup>epidermal stem cells and they contribute to hair follicle regeneration and wound healing of interfollicular epidermis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brownell et al., 2011</xref>). The importance of epidermal stem cell heterogeneity and compartmentalization has almost entirely been explained by their role in regional tissue replenishment to maintain different functional compartments of the epidermis, but its roles apart from epidermal maintenance remain poorly understood. As coordinated epithelial–mesenchymal interactions are essential for hair follicle development, regeneration and functioning, the unique signaling territories and tissue architecture provided by compartmentalized epidermal stem cells probably regulate the interactions between the epidermis and a variety of hair follicle–associated structures, including sensory nerves, APMs and the dermal papilla. Consistent with this idea, it has been reported that mid-bulge epidermal stem cells create a specialized basement membrane containing nephronectin, thereby providing a niche for APM development and anchorage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fujiwara et al., 2011</xref>). Follicle epidermis–derived BDNF is also critical for follicle-nerve interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Rutlin et al., 2014</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38883.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Upper-bulge epidermal stem cells are molecularly specialized for hair follicle–nerve interactions.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Graphical illustration of epidermal stem cell compartments.

At P9, nestin-positive terminal Schwann cells appeared at the upper-bulge with disorganized cellular morphologies. After the maturation of the hair follicle (P14), sensory nerves and terminal Schwann cells formed parallel stripes, but EGFL6 showed a circumferential distribution confined to the base of lanceolate endings. At P35, the mature distribution of EGFL6 and lanceolate complexes was observed.</p><p>To investigate the ultrastructural localization of EGFL6, we performed electron microscopic analysis of transverse sections of the upper-bulge.

We identified an electron-dense amorphous ECM structure surrounding the lanceolate complexes (black arrowheads in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). We named this novel structure the ‘collar matrix’, as it tightly ensheathes the lanceolate complexes. Terminal Schwann cell processes have two openings, at the follicular basement membrane and at the opposite side of the cell, thus exposing axonal endings and terminal Schwann cell processes to at least two different ECMs, the hair follicle basement membrane and the collar matrix. Although EGFL6 is expressed by the upper-bulge epidermal stem cells, an immunogold-labeled EGFL6 antibody was detected exclusively in the collar matrix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>), indicating that upper-bulge epidermal stem cells secrete EGFL6, which is incorporated in the collar matrix that ensheathes lanceolate complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>EGFL6 mediates cell adhesion via αv integrins</title><p>Since integrins are key cell surface receptors for cell–ECM interactions, we next explored integrins that interact with EGFL6.

Among nine cell lines tested, one skin fibroblast and two glial cell lines adhered to EGFL6, whereas other cell types, including keratinocytes, did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), suggesting that although EGFL6 is derived from the upper-bulge epidermal stem cells, these stem cells are incapable of interacting with EGFL6. Instead dermal cell lineages interact and adhere to EGFL6. A point mutation in the Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) integrin recognition sequence of EGFL6 (RGE mutant) significantly reduced its cell adhesive ability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Oberauer et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Osada et al., 2005</xref>).

It has remained unclear how hair follicles are able to maintain stable hair follicle–lanceolate complex interactions over the course of this cycle. To gain insight into this question, we first examined the changes that occur in the anatomical structure of the upper-bulge epidermis during the hair regeneration cycle. We found that at the first telogen (P20), the upper-bulge exhibits a single circular peripheral morphology with one hair shaft, while at the first anagen (P35), the upper-bulge perimeter doubles due to the formation of a new hair follicle rostral to the existing hair follicle (old bulge) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–C</xref>). At the second telogen (P49), the upper-bulge perimeter decreased due to a reduction in the new bulge perimeter.

We measured the signal intensities of immuno-stained lanceolate complex components along the upper-bulge, and assigned average signal intensities to the position angle of hair follicles. At the first telogen, hair follicles exhibited relatively regular signal intensities along the epidermal perimeter, but at the first anagen the new bulge (rostral side) showed areas of low signal intensity, while these remained unchanged at the old (caudal) bulge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and D</xref>). The low-intensity areas at new bulges became narrower in the second telogen. Both Aδ- and C-LTMRs exhibited caudally polarized distribution in the second telogen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Consistent with these signal intensity data, EGFL6 and terminal Schwann cells in the old bulge maintained regular parallel morphologies throughout the hair cycle, while those in the new bulge exhibited diverse morphologies and wider widths in the first anagen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Thus, the polarized distributions of lanceolate complex components toward the caudal side of the hair follicles are induced as the new bulge structure forms at the rostral side of the hair follicle. The caudal side of the hair follicle, where the old bulge is maintained by quiescent epidermal stem cells, does not change in morphology, suggesting that the old bulge stably preserves lanceolate complexes irrespective of the stage of hair regeneration cycle.</p><p>Finally, we plucked a club hair, a retained hair from the previous hair cycle in the old bulge, to test whether the removal of the sensor probe (hair) and subsequent alteration of the old bulge architecture would affect the lanceolate complex structure. The hairs were painted at the first telogen (P20) and the painted hairs (i.e., club hairs) were plucked when the new hair and bulge formed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>). The club hair plucking itself did not compromise the two-bulge epidermal architecture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D</xref>). It has been reported that hair plucking induces apoptosis in bulge stem cells within 4.5 hr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ito et al., 2002</xref>). Consistent with this, epidermal cells with a bright DAPI signal, an indicator of apoptosis, were observed in the old bulge, but not in the new bulge, within 4 hr after club hair plucking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Three days after plucking, the old bulges regressed with a slight decrease in overall follicle perimeter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1E</xref>), but the new follicles remained, suggesting that the club hair plucking procedure specifically depleted the old bulge epidermal cells through inducing apoptosis and changed the topology of the old bulge. In these plucked hair follicles, axon endings and terminal Schwann cell processes disappeared from the caudal side of the upper-bulge, while ectopic axon endings and terminal Schwann cell processes appeared at the rostral side of the upper-bulge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F and G</xref>). Thus, the maintenance of the old bulge appears to be critical for sustaining caudally polarized lanceolate complex structure.</p><p>The observed relocation of lanceolate complexes from the caudal side to the rostral side of the hair follicle can be explained as an active relocation of lanceolate complex processes by old bulge regression, rather a passive sliding of a whole array of lanceolate complex processes toward the rostral side, which could potentially be induced by the simple shrinking of overall follicle perimeter after club hair plucking. This notion is supported by the fact that EGFL6 remained at the caudal side of the plucked hair follicles even without axon endings and terminal Schwann cell processes, while the deposition level of EGFL6 was still low at the rostral side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F and G</xref>). This observation suggests that i) lanceolate complex processes in the old bulge retracted after club hair plucking, but EGFL6 matrix remained in the caudal side, and ii) ectopic lanceolate complex processes were formed at the rostral side, but EGFL6 deposition required additional time as observed in lanceolate complex morphogenesis.</p><p>Together these results indicate that the formation and preservation of the old bulge epidermal structure provides a stable epidermal–neuronal interface and induces an lanceolate complex structure oriented toward the caudal side of the hair follicle. Rutlin et al. (2014) reported that caudally polarized localization of Aδ-LTMRs underlies direction-selective responsiveness of Aδ-LTMRs to hair deflection, suggesting that the unique tissue architecture generated by upper-bulge epidermal stem cells is involved in the directional selectivity of the lanceolate complexes.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our findings reveal transcriptional and anatomical roles of compartmentalized epidermal stem cells in hair follicle sensory unit formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>). Our previous study also showed that the mid-bulge epidermal stem cells express many tendon-related genes and induce the differentiation of APMs and their correct anchorage to the bulge via secretion of the basement membrane protein nephronectin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fujiwara et al., 2011</xref>). Deletion of nephronectin moves the muscle near the upper-bulge. The morphology of the lanceolate complex was altered in the nephronectin mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1E–G</xref>), likely due to the changes in mechanical or geometrical environments of the upper-bulge by the mis-location of APMs. Therefore, we propose that the heterogeneous epidermal stem cells are compartmentalized not only for efficient epidermal homeostasis and regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Schepeler et al., 2014</xref>), but also for defining patterned niches for specific epidermal–dermal interactions, in part through providing different ECM environments.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Requirement of a unique ECM in touch sensation</title><p>We identified a novel electron-dense and amorphous ECM structure, which we named the collar matrix, that ensheathes lanceolate complexes. The deletion of a collar matrix protein, EGFL6, impaired the structure and sensory function of lanceolate complexes. The collar matrix has anatomical and functional features in common with the essential ECM in touch end organs of non-vertebrate organisms, such as the mantle in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Emtage et al., 2004</xref>). Thus, electron-dense amorphous ECMs are likely to be the fundamental ECM regulating sensory end organ formation and function in multicellular organisms.</p><p>Deletion of EGFL6 did not change the number or length of sensory axonal endings, electrical excitability of Aδ-LTMRs and gross skin histology. These results indicate that defects in tactile responses in the mutants were induced not by the loss or severe damage of touch sensory neurons themselves, but by the changes in the local ECM environment. The ECM can simultaneously function as both a tissue insulator and glue, keeping different cell populations and subcellular structures from intermingling. Indeed, the deletion of EGFL6 modestly but significantly perturbed the parallel stripe pattern of lanceolate endings. Moreover, it has been proposed that the ECM forms stable connections, or tethers, between sensory axon endings and their surroundings to transmit mechanical stimuli to axonal endings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Zimmerman et al., 2014</xref>). Integrins and integrin signalling genes are required for touch responses of touch receptor neurons in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Calixto et al., 2010</xref>). We showed that EGFL6 induces cell adhesion via αv integrins, which are enriched on the collar matrix side of axonal endings of lanceolate complexes in an EGFL6-dependent manner. αv integrins accumulate at synapses of the central nervous system and play key roles in synapse development and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chavis and Westbrook, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">McCarty et al., 2005</xref>). Thus, EGFL6-αv integrin complexes can potentially be involved in mechanotransduction on the collar matrix side of lanceolate complexes. However, the molecular mechanisms of how EGFL6 regulates lanceolate complex morphology and function are currently unknown. Further genetic analysis, such as an analysis of conditional deletion of αv integrins in sensory nerves or terminal Schwann cells, are needed.</p><p>In addition to EGFL6, many other upper-bulge ECM proteins were identified in this study and were located at the upper-bulge with unique tissue distribution patterns. We also showed that lanceolate complexes express multiple integrin receptors that have distinct tissue distribution patterns—accumulated to the collar matrix side and/or the basement membrane side. These results indicate that lanceolate complexes establish topologically complex but well-organized cell–ECM interactions between two molecularly and topologically distinct ECM structures. This rich ECM environment may also cause functional redundancy and compensation among cell–ECM interactions in the <italic>Egfl6</italic> knockout even without compensatory upregulation of other EGFL family genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). Further analysis on upper-bulge–specific ECM molecules and their receptors will provide insights into how tactile sensation is regulated by the ECM.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Compartmentalized epidermal stem cells shape responses to tactile sensation</title><p>The biological significance of forming two bulges has not been well explained. A recent report by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Lay et al., 2016</xref> suggests that the two-bulge structure has an advantage for life-long hair follicle epidermal maintenance as it increases the number of epidermal stem cells and maintains stem cell quiescence by holding a keratin 6<sup>+</sup> inner bulge that expresses factors that inhibit stem cell activation. Our study now brings an entirely different perspective on the significance of the old bulge formation. We demonstrated that the formation and preservation of the old bulge provides a stable epidermal-neuronal interface and induces a lanceolate complex structure oriented toward the caudal side of the hair follicle. Caudally polarized expression of BDNF in the bulge epidermis of developing hair follicles regulates caudally enriched localization of Aδ-LTMRs, which underlies direction-selective responsiveness of Aδ-LTMRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Rutlin et al., 2014</xref>). Our data show that both Aδ-LTMRs and C-LTMRs become caudally polarized after the formation of the two-bulge structure, indicating that the unique tissue architecture provided by epidermal stem cells is another major determinant of the formation, preservation and function of lanceolate complexes in the hair follicle.</p><p>The mechanisms that form and preserve proper innervation in regenerating hair follicle have attracted attention. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Botchkarev et al., 1997</xref> reported the constant number of longitudinal nerve endings in the lanceolate complexes in both natural and hair plucking-induced hair cycle. This invariance of nerve ending number, together with the unique epidermal tissue geometry and dynamics revealed in the present study, may underlie stability and topological reorganization of lanceolate complexes during the hair cycle and in hair plucking–induced old bulge depletion.</p><p>In conclusion, our findings give a new perspective on the roles played by heterogeneous and compartmentalized epidermal stem cell populations in more global aspects of organogenesis, beyond their role in epithelial maintenance and regeneration. Our study also provides insights into how sensory organs take advantage of a stable niche provided by a quiescent epidermal stem cell compartment to maintain sensory function within a structurally dynamic tissue environment.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (M. musculus)</td><td valign="top"><italic>Egfl6</italic> KO</td><td valign="top">MMRRC</td><td valign="top">032277-UCD</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (M. musculus)</td><td valign="top"><italic>Egfl6-H2b-Egfp</italic> BAC transgenic</td><td valign="top">this paper</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (M. musculus)</td><td valign="top"><italic>Ret-eGFP</italic> knock-in</td><td valign="top">PMID: 17065462</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Gift from H.

The modified BAC construct was purified with a NucleoBond Xtra Midi kit (Macherey-Nagel) and injected into the pronuclei of fertilized one-cell mouse eggs derived from the breeding of BDF1 and C57BL/6N mice. Potential founder mice were screened by genomic PCR of ear biopsy DNA with following primers: 5’- CCAAGGTCCTGACCAGCGAAG-3’ and 5’- CCTTAGTCACCGCCTTCTTGGAG −3’ (product size: 163 base pairs). These primers were also used for routine genotyping of this mouse line. The transgene-positive founder mice were bred with wild-type C57BL/6N mice and some of the offspring were used for immunostaining of eGFP to confirm the expression and nuclear localization of the H2B-eGFP protein. We have established 16 nuclear-GFP-positive transgenic mouse lines and confirmed the GFP expression in the upper-bulge in 13 mouse lines.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Cell lines</title><p>Cell lines used in this study were 293F cells (Thermo Fisher), human primary keratinocytes (Watt lab), human embryonic kidney epithelial cell line HEK293 (RIKEN Bioresource Center), human glioblastoma cell line T98G (JCRB Cell Bank), Human glioma cell line KG-1-C (JCRB Cell Bank), human skin fibroblast cell line SF-TY (JCRB Cell Bank), human embryonic fibroblast cell line NTI-4 (JCRB Cell Bank), human sarcoma cell line HT-1080 (JCRB Cell Bank), human myelogenous leukemia cell line K562 (JCRB Cell Bank) and human myelogenous leukemia cell line transfected with human integrin α8 cDNA K562-a8 (Gift from L.

The antigen was expressed in the 293F mammalian expression system (Invitrogen) and purified from the supernatant of the transfected cells with a Ni-NTA column. The antibody in the antiserum was affinity-purified with an antigen conjugated CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B. The specificity of the antibody to mouse EGFL6 was confirmed by the absence of the antibody immunoreactivity to tissue samples from <italic>Egfl6</italic> knockout mice. Rabbit antiserum to mouse nephronectin was generated by the same method described above. Recombinant flag-tagged full-length mouse nephronectin was expressed in 293F cells and purified with a FLAG-M2 immuno-affinity column (Sigma). The antibody in the antiserum was affinity-purified with a CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B conjugated with purified His-tagged mouse full-length nephronectin.

We utilized <italic>Lgr6-GFP-ires-CreERT2</italic>, <italic>Gli1-eGFP</italic> and <italic>Cdh3-eGFP</italic> mice to fluorescently visualize the epidermal stem cells in the lower-isthmus (<italic>Lgr6<sup>+</sup></italic>), upper-bulge (<italic>Gli1<sup>+</sup></italic>), and hair germ (<italic>Cdh3<sup>+</sup></italic>) with eGFP. Dissected dorsal skin of the 8-week-old female mice was treated with 0.25% trypsin solution (Nakalai tesque) at 37°C for 1 hr. The epidermal tissue was scraped off from the dermal tissue with a scalpel. This epidermis separation protocol leaves hair germ cells in the dermal tissue. Effectiveness of this tissue separation was verified by the following qRT-PCR, RNA-seq and immunohistochemical analyses with compartment-specific markers as described below. For the sorting of lower-isthmus (<italic>Lgr6</italic>-eGFP<sup>+</sup>), upper-bulge (<italic>Gli1</italic>-eGFP<sup>+</sup>) and mid-bulge (CD34<sup>+</sup>) epidermal stem cells, the separated epidermis was minced with scalpels and mixed with repeated pipetting to make a single cell suspension. To deplete haematopoietic and endothelial cells (lineage-positive cells; Lin<sup>+</sup>), the cell suspension was stained with PE-Cy7-conjugated antibodies for CD45, TER-119 and CD31. To sort the target cells, the cell suspension was also stained with Sca-1-PerCP-Cy5.5, CD34-eFluor660, CD49f (integrin α6)-PE. Sca-1 was used to remove epidermal basal cells of the interfollucular epidermis and follicle infundibulum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Jensen et al., 2008</xref>). Cells were sorted with a FACSAria II according to the expression of cell surface markers, after gating out dead and Lin<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>).</p><p>Hair germ epidermal cells (<italic>Cdh3</italic>-eGFP<sup>+</sup>) were sorted from the remaining dermal tissue since the most hair germ epidermal cells were retained in the dermal tissue after the separation of the epidermis. The dermal tissue was minced with scalpels and incubated with 2 mg/ml of collagenase type I at 37°C for 2 hr with gentle mixing. Single cell suspension was obtained by repeated pipetting. The cell suspension was stained with the same antibodies used above and subjected to the sorting procedure.</p><p>The purity of sorted cells was confirmed by qRT-PCR with compartment-specific genes: <italic>Lrig1</italic> (junctional zone and lower-isthmus), <italic>Lgr6</italic> (lower-isthmus and upper-bulge), <italic>Gli1</italic> (upper-bulge and hair germ), <italic>Bdnf</italic> (upper-bulge), <italic>Cd34</italic> (mid-bulge), <italic>Cdh3</italic> (hair germ) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). While the expression of <italic>Gli1</italic>-eGFP was detected in both upper-bulge and hair germ regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), our cell isolation and sorting methods gave highly pure upper-bulge cells and hair germ cells, respectively. For example, a marker for upper-bulge cells, <italic>Bdnf</italic>, was highly enriched in <italic>Gli1</italic> + upper bulge cells, but not in <italic>Cdh3</italic> +hair germ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). On the other hand, the expression of <italic>Cdh3</italic>, a marker for hair germ cells, was high in the <italic>Cdh3</italic> + hair germ population, but was very low in the <italic>Gli1</italic> +upper bulge population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). We identified <italic>Spon1</italic> as a gene exclusively expressed in the hair germ from our gene expression profiling of isolated stem cell populations and confirmed that it was not detected in the <italic>Gli1</italic>+ upper bulge population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>).

Attached cells were fixed and stained with 0.5% crystal violet in 20% methanol for 15 min. The cell-bound crystal violet was extracted with 1% SDS solution and the absorbance was measured at 595 nm. To inhibit cell adhesion activity of different integrins in cell adhesion assays, integrin function blocking antibodies were added to cell suspension before seeding to the coated wells. The cell suspension with the antibodies was incubated for 20 min and then plated on the coated dishes. The function-blocking integrin antibodies used in this study were listed below: integrin α2 (P1E6), α3 (P1B5), α5 (P1D6), α6 (GoH3), αv (L230), and β1 (P5D2). P1E6, P1B5, P1D6, and P5D2 were purchased from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank of the University of Iowa. GoH3 and L230 were purchased from BioLegend and ATCC, respectively. Cell lines used in the assays were human primary keratinocytes, HEK293, T98G, KG-1-C, SF-TY, NTI-4, HT-1080, K562 and K562-a8.</p></sec><sec id="s4-22"><title>Hair plucking assays</title><p>Dorsal hairs of 20-day-old anesthetised BALB/c mice were dyed using a neon orange hair colour cream for 30 min. Mice were maintained till the tip of new growing undyed hairs could be observed at the skin surface under a dissection microscope (P32-35). The dyed long club hairs, but not short emerging undyed new hairs, were plucked using tweezers under anaesthesia in an area of 10 × 15 mm. Three days after club hair plucking (P36-38), dorsal skin tissue samples containing both plucked and unplucked hair follicles were collected and subjected to whole-mount immunostaining. Plucked and unplucked skin areas could be easily distinguished by hair colour: the unplucked area showed dyed orange hair colour and the plucked area showed undyed white hair colour. In skin tissue samples, hair shafts could be identified by their autofluorescence. This allowed us to distinguish plucked and unplucked hair follicles within tissue samples under a confocal microscope. Zigzag hair follicles were selected for the analysis. Hair follicle types were distinguished by the following criteria under light-field illumination of 150 μm-thick tissue sections. Zigzag hair follicles are the most abundant follicle type in adult mouse dorsal skin (~81%) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Driskell et al., 2009</xref>). Growing new zigzag hairs in plucked and unplucked hair follicles have one row of medulla cells and the smallest diameter (9.58 ± 0.90 μm, n = 32 hair follicles) at the bulge region in comparison to other hair types. Awl and auchene hair follicles together make up ~17% of the dorsal skin hair follicles. Growing awl/auchene hairs in plucked and unplucked hair follicles have more than three rows of medulla cells and have a large hair shaft diameter (15.7 ± 1.95 μm, n = 27 hair follicles) at the bulge region. Guard hair follicles are rare (~1% of the adult dorsal skin hair follicles) and can be clearly identified by their prominent large follicle diameter.</p></sec><sec id="s4-23"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical parameters including the numbers of samples and replicates, types of statistical analysis and statistical significance are indicated in the Results, Figures and Figure Legends. p values: *p&lt;0.05; **p&lt;0.01; ***p&lt;0.001.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We thank Shigehiro Kuraku, Yuichiro Hara, Osamu Nishimura of the Laboratory for Phyloinformatics, RIKEN for help in RNA-seq and bioinformatics; Hideki Enomoto for Ret-GFP mice; RIKEN Kobe light microscopy and animal facilities for technical assistance; Shigeo Hayashi and Douglas Sipp for their critical reading of the manuscript.

The relationship between epidermal stem cells and touch neuron patterning and function is of broad interest to multiple fields.

Further, the localization of αv integrins in or near lanceolate complexes doesn't suggest that αv integrins are the receptors of EGFL6 in vivo. Further genetic analyses, such as an analysis of αv integrin conditional knockout mice, would be needed to convincingly show that EGFL6 mediates cell adhesions through αv integrin in vivo.

We are now starting to obtain α-v integrin floxed mice and several different <italic>CreER</italic> mice to genetically delete α-v integrin specifically in sensory nerves or terminal Schwann cells. These experiments will require more than a year of further work, while they are only made possible by the discoveries described in this paper. So, we also believe that this paper merits publication prior to that considerable extension. In the revised manuscript, we have now included discussion on the limitation of the current results (subsection “Requirement of a Unique ECM in Touch Sensation”), together with the possible contribution of α-v integrin-EGFL6 interactions in lanceolate complex regulation in vivo (subsection “Requirement of a Unique ECM in Touch Sensation”). A detailed examination of α-v integrin tissue localization has been performed (subsection “EGFL6 mediates cell adhesion via αv integrins”) and this is described in our response to comment #3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Could the hair plucking experiments shown in Figure 4F and 4G also be explained by simply shrinking the volume of the hair follicle after the old hair was plucked? This experiment may not allow one to conclude that hair follicles actively preserve lanceolate complex structures. More experiments would be needed to back up this claim.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for raising this concern. We have now included several experimental data that rule out this possibility. We measured the perimeter of the upper-bulge three days after club hair plucking and found that the perimeter was slightly reduced (Unplucked: 133 ± 2.2 micro meter; Plucked 106 ± 2.2 micro meter in zigzag hair follicles) (Figure 5—figure supplement 1E). However, this reduced perimeter would not be a consequence of global shrinking of the overall perimeter (or volume) of the upper-bulge, like a shrinking balloon, but it could result from specific topological changes in the old bulge, based on the following evidence. (i) The club hair plucking itself did not compromise the two-bulge epidermal architecture (Figure 5—figure supplement 1D). (ii) It has been reported that the hair plucking induces apoptosis in the bulge stem cells within 4.5 hours after hair plucking (Ito et al., 2002; Chen et al., 2015). (iii) Consistent with this, cells with a bright DAPI signal, an indicator of apoptotic event, were observed only in the old bulge of the plucked hair follicles within 4 hours after club hair plucking (Figure 5—figure supplement 1D). (iv) After club hair plucking, the new follicle remained, but the old follicle disappeared (Figure 5F). These results suggest that our club hair plucking procedure specifically depletes the old bulge epidermal cells through inducing apoptosis. Therefore, the club hair plucking does not uniformly reduce overall perimeter (volume) of the bulge, but specifically removes old bulge epidermal cells and changes the topology of the old bulge.</p><p>Taking this experimental condition into account, the observed relocation of lanceolate complexes from the caudal side to the rostral side of the hair follicle can be explained as an active relocation of lanceolate complex processes, rather than a passive sliding of a whole array of lanceolate complex processes toward the rostral side. This notion is supported by the fact that, in the plucked follicles, EGFL6 remains at the caudal side even without lanceolate complex processes, while the deposition level of EGFL6 was still low at the rostral side (Figures 5F and G). These results suggest that (i) lanceolate complex processes in the old bulge retracted after club hair plucking, but EGFL6 matrix remained in the caudal side, and (ii) ectopic lanceolate complex processes were formed at the rostral side, but EGFL6 deposition requires additional time as observed in lanceolate complex morphogenesis (Figure 5F and G, Figure 2—figure supplement 1). Therefore, the observed lanceolate complex relocation is not likely to be explained as a consequence of simple shrinking of the volume of hair follicles after the old hair was plucked. We have now described this in Results section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The reduced α v integrins upon loss of EGFL6 and observed alteration in lanceolate complexes patterning would suggest possible impairment of cell-cell adhesions. Can the authors increase our understanding of EGFL6 function? Which cell population expresses α-v integrins in-vivo? Are cell-cell adhesions affected in Egfl6-null?</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks to these questions, we have now examined the detailed tissue localization of α-v integrins. Alpha-v integrins were localized to the axonal endings and distributed on their collar matrix side, where EGFL6 was deposited, but they did not colocalize with terminal Schwann cell processes (Figure 3H). This tissue distribution was confirmed by three distinct α-v integrin antibodies (see key resources table). We have also examined the localization of other integrins, including beta1, alpha3 and alpha6 integrins, and they were also detected predominantly at the outer or inner surfaces of the lanceolate complex endings, where the collar matrix and basement membrane exist (Figure 3H). These results indicate that the EGFL6-α-v integrin interactions are restricted at the collar matrix side of axonal endings and involved in axon–ECM interactions, but not directly involved in cell–cell adhesions between axonal endings and terminal Schwann cell processes.</p><p>Nevertheless, we have examined defects in cell–cell adhesions that could be indirectly caused by <italic>Egfl6</italic> deletion. Since molecules mediating cell–cell adhesions between axonal endings and terminal Schwann cells remain unknown, we examined the ultrastructural morphology of cell–cell adhesion sites in electron microscopic images of lanceolate complexes in <italic>Egfl6</italic> knockout mice. Although we found lanceolate complex endings that show imperfectly sandwiched morphologies in the KO mice, we did not detect obvious abnormalities in the morphology of cell–cell interfaces and cell–cell adhesion structures (Figure 4—figure supplement 2). We describe these results in the revised manuscript (see Results section and Discussion section). Since receptor information of EGFL6 is one of the major issues in this revision and would be of interest to readers, we decided to move this part from a supplemental figure to a main figure (new Figure 3).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The experimental time point for quantification of axon and terminal Schwann cell processes should be indicated. Were all samples collected at the same hair follicle stage? Did the phenotype persist after one additional hair cycle was completed?</p></disp-quote><p>Quantification of axon and terminal Schwann cell processes were performed with 8-week-old <italic>Egfl6</italic> KO/<italic>Ret</italic>-eGFP mice (Figure 4A–C, Figure 4—figure supplement 1A–D). Thus, all samples for this quantification were collected at the same hair follicle stage, namely the second telogen. This information was not stated in the figure legend of Figure 4—figure supplement 1A–D. We apologize for the lack of detail and have now added this in the revised manuscript.</p><p>To examine whether the lanceolate complex phenotypes persist after one additional hair cycle was completed, we investigated the lanceolate complex structure of <italic>Egfl6</italic> knockout mice at the first telogen (P19), rather than at the third telogen. To obtain third telogen skin samples, three months of rearing period of the mutant mice was needed, which would not allow us to complete the requested experiment within the revision period. We believe that examining the first and second telogen hair follicles allows us to address this question. Quantitative 3D histomorphometric analysis of nerve and terminal Schwann cell processes revealed occasional appearance of disorganized parallel axonal endings and terminal Schwann cell processes, together with increased number of axon overlaps (Figure 4—figure supplement 3, subsection “EGFL6 is required for the proper patterning and touch responses of”). Thus, disorganized lanceolate complex phenotypes persisted after an additional hair cycle was completed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Can the authors hypothesize why the effect of EGFL6 loss is mild? Is there some compensation by other close homologues (EGFL7, EGFL8, EGFLAM, others…) start being expressed by bulge cells or other neighboring cells?</p></disp-quote><p>We have examined the mRNA expression levels of all 11 EGFL family member genes (<italic>Egfl2, Egfl3, Egfl4, Egfl5, Egfl6, Egfl7, Egfl8, Egfl9, Egflam, Megf10</italic> and <italic>Npnt</italic>) in CD34<sup>+</sup>epidermal stem cells, which contain mid-bulge epidermal stem cells and a part of <italic>Gli1</italic><sup>+</sup> upper-bulge epidermal stem cells, from wild-type and <italic>Egfl6</italic> knockout mice. The expression of 7 family members, including <italic>Egfl6</italic>, was detected in wild-type (Figure 5—figure supplement 2). But no significant difference in the expression levels of these genes was observed between wild-type and mutant (except for mutated <italic>Egfl6</italic>). The following genes were under a detectable level in both genotypes; <italic>Egfl3, Egfl8, Egfl9, Megf10</italic>. The EGFL family members expressed in the bulge region could functionally compensate for the deletion of EGFL6 even without changing their expression levels.</p><p>We have also examined the expression of several integrins, such as integrins beta1, alpha3 and alpha6. They are also expressed in the axonal endings and accumulated to the axon-collar matrix interfaces (Figure 3H). There are many evidences of functional redundancy and compensation in cell-ECM interactions by other family members of integrins and ECM molecules in vivo (Lowell and Mayadas, 2012). Thus, compensation by other cell-ECM interactions in lanceolate complexes could account for the mild phenotype of <italic>Egfl6</italic> mutants. Further analysis on upper-bulge–specific ECM molecules and their receptors will provide insights into how tactile sensation is regulated by the ECM. We have now described this in the Discussion section.</p></body></sub-article></article>
