However, the mechanisms that regulate ion channels abundance remain poorly understood. Here we show that <italic>pickpocket 29</italic> (<italic>ppk29</italic>), a gene that encodes a <italic>Drosophila</italic> degenerin/epithelial sodium channel (DEG/ENaC), regulates neuronal excitability via a protein-independent mechanism. We demonstrate that the mRNA 3′UTR of <italic>ppk29</italic> affects neuronal firing rates and associated heat-induced seizures by acting as a natural antisense transcript (NAT) that regulates the neuronal mRNA levels of <italic>seizure</italic> (<italic>sei</italic>), the <italic>Drosophila</italic> homolog of the human <italic>Ether-à-go-go</italic> Related Gene (hERG) potassium channel. We find that the regulatory impact of <italic>ppk29</italic> mRNA on <italic>sei</italic> is independent of the sodium channel it encodes. Thus, our studies reveal a novel mRNA dependent mechanism for the regulation of neuronal excitability that is independent of protein-coding capacity.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01849.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01849.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01849.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Neurons communicate with one another via electrical signals known as action potentials. These signals are generated when a stimulus causes sodium and potassium ion channels in the cell membrane to open, leading to an influx of sodium ions, followed by an efflux of potassium ions. Changes in temperature affect the rate at which ion channels open and close, and thus affect how easy it is for a stimulus to trigger an action potential. In response to a sudden rise in temperature, neurons must adjust the number of ion channels in their membranes to ensure that they do not become hyperexcitable, which could result in epilepsy.</p><p>Now, Zheng et al. have revealed one possible mechanism for how neurons do this. In the fruit fly, <italic>Drosophila</italic>, a gene for a potassium channel is found on the same chromosomal location as a gene for a sodium channel, and some of the genetic elements that regulate the expression of these two genes even overlap. However, the genes are on opposite strands of the DNA double helix. This means that when the genes are transcribed to produce molecules of messenger RNA (mRNA), which is usually single stranded, some of the mRNA molecules will pair up to form double-stranded mRNA molecules. This is significant because such RNA ‘duplexes’ have been shown to inhibit the translation of conventional single-stranded mRNA molecules into proteins, or to lead to their complete degradation.</p><p>Zheng et al. found that flies with mutations in the potassium channel gene display seizures in response to sudden changes in temperature. However, insects with mutations in the sodium channel gene are not affected because, surprisingly, they have a higher than expected number of potassium channels. It turns out that the mutant sodium channel mRNA molecules are unable to form RNA duplexes with potassium channel mRNA molecules: these duplexes would normally limit the number of potassium channels so, in their absence, the number of potassium channels increases, and this protects the flies from seizures.</p><p>Zheng et al. also uncovered a novel mechanism by which mRNA molecules can regulate gene expression independent of their role as templates for proteins. Further work is required to determine whether this mechanism is also present in other organisms, including humans.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01849.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01849.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>Degenerin</kwd><kwd>Epithelial sodium channel</kwd><kwd>DEG/ENaC</kwd><kwd><italic>Drosophila</italic></kwd><kwd>fruit fly</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DC010244</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ben-Shahar</surname><given-names>Yehuda</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1322783</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ben-Shahar</surname><given-names>Yehuda</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>The Esther A &amp; Joseph Klingenstein Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ben-Shahar</surname><given-names>Yehuda</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funder had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The mRNA that encodes a <italic>Drosophila</italic> sodium channel enables neurons to adapt to acute temperature changes, via a mechanism independent of its protein-coding role.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The neuronal action potential is sensitive to abrupt changes in environmental temperatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Peng et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Buzatu, 2009</xref>).

Previous theoretical and experimental studies suggested that one of the main mechanisms for maintaining normal neuronal excitability, circuit integrity, and behavioral robustness under varying environmental temperatures depends on changes in the abundance and membrane half-life of various voltage-dependent ion channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Marder and Prinz, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">O’Leary et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Rinberg et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rosati and McKinnon, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Tang et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">2012</xref>).

Thus, as a first test of our hypothesis that these two ion channels might interact antagonistically to regulate the neuronal response to heat we measured the relative expression levels of both genes in wild type animals that were adapted to variable environmental temperatures. In agreement with our hypothesis, we found that when animals adapted to high temperature (37°C) the transcripts levels of <italic>sei</italic> went up and <italic>ppk29</italic> went down relative to their levels at 25°C. In contrast, adaptation to colder temperature (13°C) led to an opposite effect on the expression of both genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).

Based on our model presented in Figure 6, such a protective effects for <italic>ppk29</italic> mutations may arise from the loss of sodium currents or alternatively due to the upregulation of SEI-dependent potassium currents. As was previously reported, we found that multiple independent mutations in <italic>sei</italic> lead to rapid seizures and paralysis in response to acute heat stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).

However, our current genetic and transgenic tools make it impossible for us to completely disentangle the direct effects of temperature changes on <italic>sei</italic> and <italic>ppk29</italic> transcription and the indirect effects via the interactions of their mRNAs. Thus, more studies will be needed to further establish <italic>ppk29</italic> mRNA as a homeostatic factor, beyond its effects on the acute heat response.</p><p>In contrast to the linear simplicity of the ‘central dogma of molecular biology’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Crick, 1970</xref>), we now know that the true molecular landscape of cells is complex and far from linear. In this regard, our studies provide an additional layer of regulatory complexity, and support the idea that mRNAs, which are typically thought to solely act as the template for protein translation, can also serve as regulatory RNAs, independent of their protein-coding capacity. Thus, the abundance of convergent transcription of protein-coding genes in eukaryotic genomes suggests that many other mRNAs might serve dual functions that are not necessary associated with the same cellular or physiological processes. Furthermore, although the phenomenon of mRNA-dependent interaction between the two genes we describe here occurs in <italic>cis</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), we currently have no reason to assume that similar interactions between RNAs cannot occur in <italic>trans</italic> as well. Consequently, it is likely that some of the evolutionary changes observed in mRNAs, including those that are considered ‘neutral’, should be re-evaluated in light of the possible regulatory function that some mRNAs might exert independently of the proteins they encode.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Fly strains</title><p>Flies (<italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>) were raised on standard cornmeal-agar food at 25°C and 60% relative humidity with a 12 hr light: dark cycle.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor and 2 reviewers, one of whom, Leslie Griffith, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewer discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission:</p><p>The full text of the original reviews is attached for your consideration. It would be good to address as many of the comments as you can, but the 3 key issues are enumerated below.</p><p>The consensus of the reviewers was that the paper was very novel but there were several things that should be addressed to make the argument for the proposed mechanism stronger. In addition, perhaps because of the novelty of this finding, it was felt that some of the conclusions should be tempered by acknowledgement that there might be other potential mechanisms to explain the findings. Specifically:</p><p>1) Since the identification of the antisense region was based on the (sometimes imperfectly) annotated genome, the authors should isolate the mRNAs and sequence them to verify that the UTRs from the annotation are present in the actual transcripts.</p><p>2) The data on colocalization of the <italic>ppk</italic> and <italic>sei</italic> transcripts is very weak and the figure hard to interpret. A better demonstration of coexpression would substantially strengthen the argument for example, cell specific expression profiling, high quality in situ, etc.</p><p>3) Authors should include the other interpretations and caveats of the results. Specifically, the UAS-FP-3'UTR-<italic>ppk29</italic> thermoprotective phenotype and <italic>sei</italic> transcript reduction suggests the antisense mechanism, but does not prove it conclusively. The 3'UTR might have additional targets, and the evidence for this mechanism in the endogenous rather than over-expression case is still weak.</p><p><italic>Reviewer</italic> <italic>#1:</italic></p><p>This is a very novel study demonstrating temperature/stress-dependent regulation of seizure via an antisense transcript that is part of a neighboring gene. The importance of this mechanism for regulation of CNS function is made clear by the behavioral outcomes.</p><p>The data seem very clear and consistent. There is one thing lacking, however, and that is information on where and how temperature acts transcriptionally. The model would suggest that transcription of <italic>ppk</italic> is regulated in a temp-dependent manner, but <italic>sei</italic> is not (its mRNA levels are controlled exclusively posttranscriptionally). Some measure of temperature effects on transcription rate or nascent transcripts would add substantially to the story and make it completely solid that the NAT is the major regulator and not some transcriptional effect of temperature on <italic>sei</italic>.</p><p><italic>Reviewer</italic> <italic>#2:</italic></p><p>The authors show that the sodium channel ppk29 and the potassium channel sei are transcribed on opposite strands from mRNA with overlapping 3'UTRs. Reduced expression of <italic>sei</italic> makes flies more vulnerable to heat-induced paralysis, while reduction of ppk29 makes them more resistant. The authors propose that the 3'UTR of <italic>ppk29</italic> targets the <italic>sei</italic> transcript for destruction via the endogenous RNA interference pathway (siRNA and RISC complex).</p><p>The straightforward hypothesis is that the amount of ion exchange through neural membranes could be achieved by co-regulating the protein expression levels of sodium and potassium channels. The surprise here is that the 3'UTR of one channel (ppk29) seems to affect the mRNA levels of the other, so the regulation might be at the transcriptional stage.</p><p>This is a very interesting concept and, if supportable, makes us think about how the balance of ion channels is achieved in new ways. Because it is such a surprising and potentially impactful finding, it needs to be extremely well supported, and I think it still falls short.</p><p>1) The overlapping transcripts of <italic>ppk29</italic> and <italic>sei</italic> are suggested by computational annotation of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> genome. Is there any independent verification that the identification of the 3'UTRs is correct? RT-PCR, with polyA primers and <italic>sei</italic> or <italic>ppk29</italic>-specific 5' primers, should amplify the actual mRNA transcripts and confirm that the 3' UTRs exist as predicted. Do full-length cDNAs exist for these genes already, and do they support the transcript annotation?</p><p>2) For the proposed mechanism to work, <italic>sei</italic> and <italic>ppk29</italic> do have to be precisely co-expressed, and I do not find any of the data presented convincing on this point. The cell lines are next to useless, whole CNS or whole tissue profiling is at best suggestive, and the in situ figure, which would be the most helpful is too low resolution and dim to be interpretable. Adult brain in situs in flies are notoriously hard, so I applaud the authors for trying, but <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–E</xref> does not persuade me that these two transcripts are co-expressed. In addition, my reading of the Methods using the Tyramide amplification system and the HRP quenching makes me nervous that there may be artifactual cross-talk as well.</p><p>3) A lot of these data rest on the “thermo-protective” phenotype of <italic>ppk29</italic>, and this is a new result, so I would like to see a bit more about how it is measured and how variable it is.</p><p>4) The temperature-sensitive paralysis occurs very quickly (a few minutes), while the affect of temperature rearing on ion channel transcript levels shown if <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> is very slow (7 hr). At what speed do the authors think the natural antisense mechanism normally is acting? To set the basal levels of sei K<sup>+</sup> channel expression appropriate for current environmental conditions? This should be clarified.</p><p>5) The authors use transgenes with a fluorescent protein fused to the <italic>ppk29</italic> or <italic>sei</italic> 3'UTR to assess whether the UTRs alone are sufficient. The levels of endogenous fluorescence would be a quantifiable measure of how much the expression levels are changes and this could provide an alternative measure to the qRT-PCR data. Not essential, but should be considered.</p><p>6) The result that the <italic>ppk29</italic> 3'UTR alone has a thermo-protective effect is certainly interesting. Is it certain that all of its effect is due to increased levels of sei? Does the UAS-sei without UTR rescue better than the version with the UTR? Presumably it would bypass the <italic>ppk29</italic> regulation and produce more sei. Given the chromosomal proximity, it would be hard to make a double mutant of <italic>sei</italic> and <italic>ppk29</italic>, but perhaps RNAi could be used to confirm that reducing sei modifies the <italic>ppk29</italic> mutant phenotype? The sei drug blockers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4–figure supplement 1</xref>) address this a bit, but RNAi would corroborate.</p><p>The authors should connect their findings to other regulatory mechanisms that have been shown to act on channel transcripts, specifically the RNA helicase NAP thought to regulate the para sodium transcript levels and RNA editing (Reenan and Ganetzky, Neuron 2000), the Dao protein proposed to regulate potassium and sodium channel levels (Fergestad and Ganetzky, PNAS 2010), the conductance-independent affects of the eag potassium channel on intracellular signaling (Hegle and Wilson PNAS, 2006), and the co-regulation of various ion channels as described in McLean and Harris-Warrick, J. Neurophys (2005), for example. The current proposal of RNA degradation of sei by ppk29 is an interesting idea, but adding some historical and intellectual context seems appropriate for the Discussion.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01849.021</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>The consensus of the reviewers was that the paper was very novel but there were several things that should be addressed to make the argument for the proposed mechanism stronger.

We are currently following up on this line of investigation as part of larger study on the role of NATs in regulating neuronal homeostasis. We’re generating new sets of transgenic reporters that will enable us to measure activity levels of both promoters independent of transcript levels in vivo. Although these studies are beyond the scope of this manuscript, we now address this caveat in the interpretation of our data: “Our findings also indicate that the regulatory interaction between sei and ppk29 may play a role in the homeostatic response to slow changes in environmental temperature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). However, our current genetic and transgenic tools make it impossible for us to completely disentangle the direct effects of temperature changes on <italic>sei</italic> and <italic>ppk29</italic> transcription and the indirect effects via the interactions of their mRNAs.

We interpret our data to indicate that when <italic>seizure</italic> mRNA levels are high due to a mutation in <italic>ppk29</italic> it leads to an increase in baseline resistance to heat. Thus, we predict that the slow adaptation to heat as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> is the natural process in which flies slowly become desensitized to the effects of slowly increasing temperatures by increasing <italic>seizure</italic> expression and lowering <italic>ppk29</italic> expression.

The current proposal of RNA degradation of sei by ppk29 is an interesting idea, but adding some historical and intellectual context seems appropriate for the Discussion</italic>.</p><p>As suggested by the reviewer, we now expand our Discussion to include these important studies in the context of our findings.</p></body></sub-article></article>
