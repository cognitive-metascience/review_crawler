characterized by precisely organized climbing fiber (CF) projections that are congruent with alternating aldolase C/zebrin II expression. However, the behavioral relevance of CF inputs into individual modules remains poorly understood. Here, we used two-photon calcium imaging in the cerebellar hemisphere Crus II in mice performing an auditory go/no-go task to investigate the functional differences in CF inputs to modules. CF signals in medial modules show anticipatory decreases, early increases, secondary increases, and reward-related increases or decreases, which represent quick motor initiation, go cues, fast motor behavior, and positive reward outcomes. CF signals in lateral modules show early increases and reward-related decreases, which represent no-go and/or go cues and positive reward outcomes. The boundaries of CF functions broadly correspond to those of aldolase C patterning. These results indicate that spatially segregated CF inputs in different modules play distinct roles in the execution of goal-directed behavior.</p></abstract><kwd-group

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Anatomically, the cerebellum is the simplest structure in the brain, comprising a few types of neurons with similar interconnections. The inputs and outputs of the cerebellar cortex are organized into modules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Voogd and Glickstein, 1998</xref>), wherein spatially defined populations of Purkinje cells (PCs) project to a distinct subdivision of the cerebellar nucleus, which in turn projects to a subnucleus of the inferior olive that provides climbing fiber (CF) inputs to PCs. These modules are called zones or microzones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Oscarsson, 1979</xref>) and are considered as functional units in the cerebellum. On the other hand, PCs show parasagittal alternating band-like expression of various molecules, including aldolase C/zebrin II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brochu et al., 1990</xref>). Each hemi-cerebellum can be subdivided into 14 alternating aldolase C-positive (AldC+) and aldolase C-negative (AldCâ) compartments (1+ to 7+), which are largely congruent with the classical zones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sugihara and Shinoda, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Voogd and Ruigrok, 2004</xref>).</p><p>Accumulating evidence suggests functional difference between AldC+ and AldCâ PCs. AldC+ PCs receive enhanced glutamate release by CFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Paukert et al., 2010</xref>), but parallel fiber inputs that are similar to those received by AldCâ PCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nguyen-Minh et al., 2018</xref>). AldC+ and AldCâ PCs show distinct firing properties and plasticity rules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhou et al., 2014</xref>), and differ in interaction between simple and complex spikes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tang et al., 2017</xref>). CF inputs to AldC+ and AldCâ compartments are separately and precisely synchronized at cellular resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tsutsumi et al., 2015</xref>). AldC+ and AldCâ PCs respond differently to optic flow stimulation in the pigeon cerebellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Graham and Wylie, 2012</xref>). Despite these functional implications and theÂ rich anatomical information that is available, surprisingly little is known about the differences in CF inputs across the AldC+ and AldCâ compartments and across the mediolateral axis of the cerebellar lobules during behavior.</p><p>To address this issueÂ systematically, we expressed the geneticallyÂ encoded calcium indicator GCaMP6f (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2013</xref>) in the cerebellar hemisphere folium Crus II of Aldoc-tdTomato mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tsutsumi et al., 2015</xref>), which express the red fluorescent protein tdTomato in AldC+ PCs, and conducted two-photon calcium imaging of PC dendrites of awake mice performing a lick/no-lick task. We found that the proportion of AldC+ PCs showing CF-dependent dendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals (CF signals) is scaled with licking behavior and higher than that of AldCâ PCs. CF signals in the medial Crus II were prevalent during licking trials and scaled with licking behavior, whereas those in the lateral Crus II showed equal prevalence in all trial types or were pronounced after no-go cues. We found anticipatory decreases in population CF signals toward sensory cues in a medial AldC+ compartment, which were correlated with the initiation of licking, and in a lateral AldCâ compartment, which were related to delay in lick initiation. Early increases of CF signals after sensory cues in the medial Crus II were correlated with the initiation of licking, quicker lick response, faster licking, and the presence of go cues, whereas those in lateral AldCâ compartments were correlated with the presence of no-go cues. Subsequent increases in CF signals in the medial Crus II reflected faster licking. Later decreases in CF signals in the lateral Crus II and increases in a medial AldCâ compartment after licking represented positive reward outcomes. These results suggest distinct contributions of spatially organized CF inputs to the Crus II to sensorimotor behavior.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The cerebellar Crus II contributes to an auditory lick/no-lick task</title><p>We trained mice to perform a lick/no-lick auditory discrimination task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), which required theÂ initiation or suppression of licking in response to different auditory cues. We reasoned that the task requires sensorimotor functions beyond motor correction or adaptive control of reflex, andÂ therefore efficiently reveals functional differences across AldC compartments during behavior. In this task, mice had to respond to a high-frequency tone (go cue) with a lick to receive a water reward (hit; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). A lick after a low-frequency tone (no-go cue) was punished with a timeout (4.5 s; false alarm or FA). No licking after a go cue (miss) or aÂ no-go cue (correct rejection or CR) was neither rewarded nor punished. The inter-trial interval was set to 6 s, but a subsequent trial was delayed for 1 s after the cessation of continued licking. Well-trained mice almost completely withheld licking after a no-go cue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) and cut off protracted licking, yielding a constant inter-trial interval (hit, CR, and miss trials: 6.23Â Â±Â 0.58 s; FA trials: 10.98Â Â±Â 1.65 s; meanÂ Â±Â s.d., <italic>n</italic>Â =Â 17 mice). Licking in hit trials was shorter in latency, higher in frequency, longer in duration, and more regular than licking in FA trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1C</xref>). The performance of mice quickly improved to an expert level, defined as fraction of correct trialsÂ &gt;80%, within 3â6 sessions (4.18Â Â±Â 0.27 sessions, meanÂ Â±Â s.e.m., <italic>n</italic>Â =Â 17 mice; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>) by first increasing the hit rate, and then increasing the CR rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A and B</xref>). Licking behavior in hit trials remained relatively unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F and G</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1D</xref>). By contrast, the frequency of FA licking robustly decreased and became irregular (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H and I</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1E</xref>). Therefore, mice learned to suppress their licking inÂ responseÂ to a no-go cue, while preserving their lickingÂ inÂ response to a go cue.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.47021.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>A lick/no-lick auditory discrimination task.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Left, schematic diagram of a mouse performing the task under a two-photon microscope.

In accordance with our observation of diverse task-related CF signals across AldC compartments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>), lesions of inferior olivary subnuclei have been reported to cause specific behavioral deficits in cats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Horn et al., 2010</xref>). According to a grouping of cerebellar modules on the basis of a detailed tracing study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sugihara and Shinoda, 2004</xref>), group I compartments (7+, 6+, and 5+) are innervated by CFs originating from the principal olive and neighboring areas.Â TheseÂ compartmentsÂ receive inputs from the cerebral cortex via the nuclei in the mesodiencephalic junction, including the red nucleus, area parafascicularis prerubralis, and nucleus of Darkschewitsch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Stuesse and Newman, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Swenson and Castro, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Veazey and Severin, 1982</xref>). Furthermore, a recent study showed that perioral tactile information is directly conveyed by a pathway from the periphery to the Crus II via the mesodiencephalic junction and inferior olive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kubo et al., 2018</xref>). Group IV compartments (6â and 5â) receive CF inputs from the dorsomedial group of the principal olive and the medial part of the dorsal accessory olive, which receive somatosensory inputs from the spinal cord, dorsal column nuclei, and trigeminal nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Molinari et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Swenson and Castro, 1983</xref>). Group II (5a+, 4b+, and 4+) and III compartments (5aâ and 4bâ) are innervated by CFs from the medial subnuclei and medial accessory olive, which receive somatosensory inputs from the spinal cord as well as vestibular and collicular inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akaike, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boesten and Voogd, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brown et al., 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Swenson and Castro, 1983</xref>). Therefore, the CF inputs to group I (7+, 6+, and 5+) compartments mainly convey information from the cerebral cortex, while the majority of CF inputs to group IV and II/III compartments (6â, 5â, 5aâ, 5a+, 4bâ, 4b+, and 4+) send sensory information from the periphery. In terms of outputs, only PCs in the lateral part of group I and IV compartments (7+, 6â, and 6+) project to the dentate nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sugihara, 2011</xref>), which in turn projects back to a wide range of brain regions, including the motor and association cortices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dum and Strick, 2003</xref>). PCs located in the medial part of group I and IV compartments (5â and 5+) and those in group II/III compartments (5aâ, 5a+, 4bâ, 4b+, and 4+) project to the sensorimotor cortex via interpositus and fastigial nuclei, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sugihara, 2011</xref>). These differences in anatomical projections could account for the functional differences that we observed in CF inputs across AldC compartments.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>AldC modules provide a functional reference for CF inputs</title><p>Our analyses on theÂ functional clustering of CF signals revealed broad congruence betweenÂ the boundaries of theÂ functional clusters and those of AldC expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>â4), indicating that theÂ AldC profile can be used as an approximate for cerebellar functional modules at both cellular and microzonal resolutions. Previous studies have suggested several functional differences between AldC+ and AldCâ PCs: (i)Â AldC+ PCs haveÂ a lower simple spike rate and aÂ higher complex spike rate than AldCâ PCs, which are dependent on co-expressing TRPC3 subtypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhou et al., 2014</xref>); (ii)Â coupling between simple spikes and complex spikes is enhanced in AldC+ PCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tang et al., 2017</xref>); (iii)Â AldC+ PCs receive enhanced glutamate release by CF inputs whenÂ compared with AldCâ PCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Paukert et al., 2010</xref>), but show no difference in parallel fiber-PC synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nguyen-Minh et al., 2018</xref>); (iv)Â at theÂ population level, CF inputs to AldC+ and AldCâ compartments are separately and precisely synchronized at the cellular resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tsutsumi et al., 2015</xref>); andÂ (v)Â AldC+ and AldCâ PCs haveÂ been shown to respond differently to optic flow stimulation in the pigeon cerebellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Graham and Wylie, 2012</xref>). In the present study, we found that more AldC+ PCs than AldCâ PCsÂ receive motor-related CF inputs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Furthermore, theÂ spatial organization of CF signals broadly corresponded to theÂ AldC expression boundaries at both theÂ microzone level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>) and theÂ single cell level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2</xref>â4). This spatial clustering of similarly behaviorallyÂ relevant CF inputs benefits in terms of outputs because of an expected convergence of these densely clustered PCs on downstream neurons in the cerebellar nuclei, which exclusively read out synchronous inputs from these PCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bengtsson et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Person and Raman, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tang et al., 2019</xref>).

However, behaviorally relevant CF signals across the entire mediolateral axis of a cerebellar lobule have never been investigated.</p><p>We found that CF signals in the medial Crus II were more representative of motor behavior, in that during hit trials,Â more CFs respond in the medial Crus II than in the lateral Crus II, and the responses are graded on the basis of lick rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C and D</xref>). Anticipatory decreases in CF signals in the medial Crus II were correlated with subsequent initiation of licking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), and early increases in these signals were correlated with lick initiation, presence of go cues, shorter lick latency, and faster licking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B,D and F</xref>), suggesting their involvement in motor execution. Sharp peaks in CF signals in the medial Crus II at the onset of spontaneous licking (black lines in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4âfigure supplement 3</xref>) further support this notion. Moreover, secondary increases in CF inputs were observed almost exclusively in the medial Crus II (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1</xref>) and theyÂ reflected faster licking during licking trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>), indicating their role in online control of licking.</p><p>ByÂ contrast, CF signals in the lateral Crus II were more representative of sensory responses, in thatÂ during CR trials, more CF signals were observedÂ there than in the medial Crus II, and the responses were equally observed irrespective of licking or even pronounced after no-go cues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C and D</xref>), although movements such as jaw opening or tightening of theÂ mouth specific to no-go cues could also contribute to these signals. Anticipatory decreases in CF signals in the lateral Crus II were correlated with delay in lick initiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), which could be interpreted asÂ a representation of lower attention to the task or asÂ intention to delay the motor initiation (suppression of impulsive behavior). Early increases in these signals were correlated withÂ the presence of no-go cues, but not with licking behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B,D and F</xref>). Moreover, CF signals were sharply time-locked to sensory cues withoutÂ a secondary rise during licking trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1</xref>), together indicating their sensory nature.</p><p>These findings imply distinct behavioral functions of CF inputs to the lateral and medial cerebellum: CF inputs to the lateral Crus II might represent sensory saliency and/or attention signals, which could be conveyed via the dentate nucleus to be used for higher-order processing in the association cortices, whereas CFÂ inputs to the medial Crus II could control motor behavior online (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Welsh et al., 1995</xref>) by indirect projections, via the interpositus and fastigial nuclei, to either the motor cortex or brainstem motor neurons. Close monitoring of licking behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gaffield and Christie, 2017</xref>) together with high temporal resolution imaging or targeted electrical recording from PCs will elucidate how the tongue trajectory is controlled by CF inputs to the medial Crus II. Sensory demanding task such as multi-sensory discrimination could further address the sensory function of CF signals in the lateral Crus II.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Mechanisms of anticipatory decreases in CF inputs to the Crus II</title><p>We discovered a decrease in population CF signals for an upcoming sensory cue during the period when theÂ mice were not licking (â1 to 0 s from cue onset; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>). In our task design, expert mice could predict the timing of cue presentation because the inter-trial interval was fixed at 6 s. We found that this anticipatory decrease in CF signals was associated with the subsequent initiation of licking (5+; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), or withÂ delay in lick initiation (5â; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), which could reflect motor preparation, timing prediction, or shift in attention (engagement in the task). Given the anticipatory ramping-up activity in dentate nuclear neurons in monkeys representing timing prediction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ashmore and Sommer, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ohmae et al., 2017</xref>), as well as fastigial/dentate nuclear neurons in mice representing motor preparation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chabrol et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gao et al., 2018</xref>), the anticipatory decreases in CF signals thatÂ we observed could reflect ramping-up activity in these cerebellar nuclei via nucleo-olivary inhibitory projections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hesslow, 1986</xref>). Simultaneous recordings from pairs of PCs and cerebellar nuclear neurons using highly efficient electrodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jun et al., 2017</xref>) will further elucidate the mechanism for how the decrease in CF signals contributes to anticipatory and preparatory activity in the cerebellum.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Mechanisms of reward-related decreases in CF inputs to the Crus II</title><p>Positive reward outcomes were represented by decreases in CF signals at long latency (&gt;1 s) in the lateral Crus II, and byÂ increases in one of the medial AldC compartments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4âfigure supplement 3</xref>). The reward outcome-related CF signals were consistent with recent reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Heffley et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Heffley and Hull, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kostadinov et al., 2019</xref>). Extremely long latency (~2.2 s from lick onset) of CF signals could be explained by longer duration of our reward delivery (0.41â1.23 s from lick; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A and B</xref>; see 'Materials and methods'). The lateral Crus II is reciprocally connected with the ventral tegmental area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ikai et al., 1992</xref>). Furthermore, dopamine D1 receptors are expressed on a subset of neurons in the dentate nucleus, which has been shown to contribute to cognitive behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Locke et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, it is possible that midbrain dopamine neurons send positive reward outcome-related information to the dentate nuclei, which in turn send inhibitory projections to the inferior olive, thus causing decreases in CF inputs to the lateral Crus II. This putative pathway could contribute to reward-based reinforcement learning of goal-directed behavior.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Comprehensive monitoring of CF signals in the Crus II under the context of go/no-go discrimination behavior revealed theÂ spatiotemporal organization of behaviorallyÂ relevant functions thatÂ broadly correspond to AldC expression and mediolateral locations.

A 3 mm diameter glass coverslip (number 0 thickness; Matsunami Glass) was directly mounted over the dura, and its edge was sealed with tissue adhesive (Vetbond; 3M) and dental adhesive resin cement (ADFA; Shofu). After the surgery, mice were singly housed and allowed to recover for 8â14 days. Sulfadiazine/trimethoprim antibiotics were included in the drinking water (12 g/L) during the recovery period. Abnormal behavior was not observed after AAV injections.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Task training</title><p>For efficient training of mice to perform a lick/no-lick task under head fixation, we used a task training apparatus (OâHara and Co.) similar to that described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Isomura et al., 2009</xref>). Water intake was restricted to 1 mL/day for 3 days before the onset of task training. Water was only provided from the lick port during task training. When mice failed to maintain 85% of their initial body weight after the task session, additional water (1â2 mL) was provided. Mice were trained once daily and typically underwent 3 days of pre-training sessions that consisted of two steps. First, mice were acclimated to a head-fixed configuration, and every lick on the lick port was rewarded with 2 Î¼L of 0.1% saccharine solution (maximum: 2 Î¼L/s) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Isomura et al., 2013</xref>). During the following 2 days, go cues (10 kHz tone) and no-go cues (4 kHz tone) were provided randomly. Only licks within 1 s after either cue were rewarded with 6 Î¼L of saccharine solution (2 Î¼LÂ ÃÂ 3; 0.41â1.23 s from lick onset; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A and B</xref>). The inter-trial interval was set at 6 s, but the subsequent trial was delayed by 1 s from the last lick if the mouse continuedÂ to lick. Once their success rate for the task exceeded 80%, the mice proceeded to a lick/no-lick task. In this task, licking of the port within 1 s after the go cue was rewarded with 6 Î¼L of saccharine solution, whereas licking within 1 s after the no-go cue was punished with a time-out of 4.5 s. All tasks were controlled and recorded at 100 Hz (<italic>n</italic>Â =Â 16 mice) or 200 Hz (<italic>n</italic>Â =Â 1 mouse) by a custom-written program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tsutsumi, 2019</xref>; copy archived at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/elifesciences-publications/Aldoc-behavior">https://github.com/elifesciences-publications/Aldoc-behavior</ext-link>) using LabVIEW software (National Instruments).

At 30â60 min after muscimol injection, the lick/no-lick task session was started. The effect was observed throughout the session (~1 hr), but disappeared on the following day. For control experiments, mice were injected with the same amount of saline in the left Crus II on the following day, and started the task after 30â60 min.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Behavior analysis</title><p>To evaluate the performance in the go/no-go task, we calculated the fraction of correct (hit and CR) trials and defined 80% as an expert performance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). For hit and FA trials, licking behavior within 4 s from the cue onset was analyzed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">2</xref>). A lick bout was defined as a cluster of licks wherein the inter-lick interval was less than 1 s. Lick onset and offset were defined as the onset and offset of the first lick bout in each trial, respectively. Instantaneous lick rate was calculated as the inverse of the inter-lick interval and was assigned at each time point. The coefficient of variation (CV2), which was used to assess the regularity of licks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">2</xref>), was calculated as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Holt et al., 1996</xref>). Non-task licking epochs (nontask; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4âfigure supplement 3</xref>) were determined as a lick bout isolated from cues (at least 1 s before cues), meaning that the bout could not be associated with cues (spontaneous licking without a reward).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Two-photon imaging</title><p>During the lick/no-lick task, two-photon imaging was performed using a two-photon microscope (MOM; Sutter Instruments) equipped with a 40Â ÃÂ objective lens (Olympus) controlled by ScanImage software (Vidrio Technologies) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pologruto et al., 2003</xref>). Two-photon excitation was achieved with a pulsed Ti:sapphire laser (Mai Tai HP; Spectra-Physics) at a wavelength of 910 nm. The laser power was adjusted to ensure that it was below 40 mW at the sample to avoid phototoxicity. Fluorescence signals were divided into green and red channels with a dichroic mirror and emission filters (Chroma), and detected with GaAsP photomultiplier tubes (Hamamatsu Photonics). A pair of Galvano scanners was used for the first batch of mice (<italic>n</italic>Â =Â 3), and a resonant scanner was used for the remaining mice (<italic>n</italic>Â =Â 14). The imaging field was 180Â ÃÂ 230 Î¼m at a depth ofÂ ~50 Î¼m from the pia, with a resolution of 128Â ÃÂ 128 pixels. Two thousand frames were acquired at 7.8125 Hz (256 s) for the first batch (<italic>n</italic>Â =Â 3), and 28,910 frames were acquired at 109.86 Hz with 14 frame averaging (net: 7.8471 Hz; 263 s) for the second batch (<italic>n</italic>Â =Â 13). For a separate mouse (<italic>n</italic>Â =Â 1), 28,770 frames were acquired at 107.18 Hz (268 s) without frame averaging.</p><p>First, tdTomato fluorescence on the red channel was imaged to identify the AldC compartments in the whole Crus II using the relative locations and widths of the compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sugihara and Quy, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tsutsumi et al., 2015</xref>). Diagrams in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3E</xref> were created by manually tracing the boundary of tdTomato expression in a single animal. Typically, the 6+/5â boundary was at the center of the cranial window (4 mm lateral from midline and 2 mm caudal from lambda), and the relative locations of the 7+/6â, 6â/6+, 5â/5+, 5+/5aâ, 5aâ/5a+, and 5a+/4bâ boundaries were 0.59Â Â±Â 0.05, 0.41Â Â± 0.04, â0.28 Â± 0.05, â0.56 Â± 0.05, â0.71 Â± 0.09, and â0.80Â Â±Â 0.08 mm from the center of the window (<italic>n</italic>Â =Â total 10 mice; meanÂ Â±Â s.d.); corresponding to 4.59, 4.41, 3.72, 3.44, 3.29, and 3.20 mm lateral from midline, respectively.</p><p>Next, GCaMP6f calcium imaging was performed on the green channel at the boundaries of aldolase C expression. Before starting each imaging session, a tdTomato image on the red channel was obtained for reference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplements 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">3A</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2A</xref>). According to our functional separation of the Crus II, the 5â/5+ boundary (3.72 mm lateral and 2 mm caudal from lambda) delineates the lateral and medial Crus II (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Imaging analysis</title><p>Imaging data was analyzed using MATLAB software (R2018a; MathWorks). To correct motion artifacts in the x-y plane and toÂ extract regions of interest (ROIs) corresponding to PC dendrites, the Suite2P algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pachitariu et al., 2017</xref>) was used. Typical parameters were used for ROI extraction: Nk0Â =Â 120 (number of clusters to start with), NkÂ =Â 60 (number of clusters to end with), sigÂ =Â 0.5 (spatial smoothing length in pixels), and diameterÂ =Â 2 (expected diameter of dendrites). After image registration and automatic ROI extraction, ROIs corresponding to PC dendrites were manually selected and non-PC-like ROIs were curated on the basis of the following criteria: (1) the shape of the ROI did not resemble that of a PC dendrite, being round or vessel-shapedÂ forÂ example; (2) a calcium trace generated by the mean pixel fluorescence in the ROI did not show a characteristic calcium increase caused by CF inputs (fast rise and slow decay); (3) calcium signals were saturated, such that an increase in fluorescence was sustained over a period in the order of seconds; and (4) the signal-to-noise ratio was too low (theÂ lowest signal-to-noise ratio in our dataset was 5.68).</p><p>To reduce multiple counting of single PC dendrites as a result of oversegmentation, ROIs were merged if they satisfied the following criteria: (1) ROIs were adjacent or separated by two dendrites mediolaterally; and (2) the correlation coefficient between calcium traces from the ROIs was greater than 0.75. This process was iterated until no ROI pairs satisfied the criteria. After completion of these processing steps, imaging data that included at least five PCs on both sides of an AldC expression boundary obtained during an expert behavioral performance (fraction correct:Â &gt;80%) were used for further analyses (total: 94 imaging sessions). The number of cells expressing GCaMP6f was counted on the basis of z-stacks obtained by two-photon imaging. We found that 53% of PCs (<italic>n</italic>Â =Â 5 stacks; 9.40Â Â±Â 0.51 cells/10<sup>4</sup> Î¼m<sup>2</sup>) and 6% of molecular layer interneurons (<italic>n</italic>Â =Â 5 stacks; 5.37Â Â±Â 3.44 cells/10<sup>6</sup> Î¼m<sup>3</sup>) expressed GCaMP6f, showing that molecular layer interneurons contributed only 5% of the total fluorescence signals at most.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Event detection</title><p>ÎF/F was calculated from the raw fluorescence traces using the following equation: (F â F<sub>0</sub>) / (F<sub>0</sub> â F<sub>b</sub>), where F is the raw fluorescence value, F<sub>0</sub> is the 8th percentile of the fluorescence values of the surrounding 12 imaging frames (â6 frame to +6 frame; total: 13 frames), and F<sub>b</sub> is the minimum fluorescence value of the mean image (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ozden et al., 2012</xref>). Response to the task was determined by an averaged ÎF/F trace for a given response window: pre-trial, â2 to â1 s from cue onset; pre-cue, â1 to 0 s from cue onset; early, 0 to 0.5 s from cue onset; and secondary, 0.5 to 1 s from cue onset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1</xref>). An additional response window was defined for lick bout onset-aligned traces: pre-lick, â2 to â1 s from lick onset; late, 1.2 to 2.2 s from lick onset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4âfigure supplement 3</xref>). Responsive ROIs for each trial type for each response window (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3C</xref> and D, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1</xref>) were determined on the basis of trial-averaged ÎF/F within a response window exceeding mean +Â 2 s.d. of the baseline, which was defined as a ÎF/F trace that was less than the absolute Z-score of 1 calculated from the whole ÎF/F trace in an imaging session. For the calculation of response probability of single ROIs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>), a significantly positive response was determined on the basis that theÂ single trial ÎF/F trace averaged within theÂ early response window exceededÂ the mean +Â 2 s.d. of the baseline. Then the response probability was defined as the number of trials with the significantly positive response divided by the total number of trials for each trial type. Response of an AldC compartment was determined by using the same method, where a single trial population averaged ÎF/F trace was used instead of aÂ single ROI ÎF/F trace. Mean +Â 2 s.d. and mean â0.5 s.d. values of the baseline ÎF/F trace of the AldC compartment were determined as thresholds to detect significantly positive and negative responses in each trial for each response window (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref>â<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4âfigure supplement 2</xref>). For analyses of theÂ pre-cue period, only trials without any appreciable licking (&lt;1 Hz) during the pre-trial period were taken into account (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4âfigure supplement 2</xref>)Â inÂ order to remove false positives resultingÂ from differences in licking activities between these periods.</p><p>GCaMP6f-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> increases in PC dendrites evoked by CF inputs are shown to haveÂ ~33 ms in rise andÂ ~100 ms in decay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gaffield et al., 2016</xref>), which is fast enough to detect individual CF inputs (~1/ s). To ensure that theÂ Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals thatÂ we observed correspond to complex spike firing in PCs, we detected Ca<sup>2+</sup> events during baseline (pre-trial period; â2 to â1 s from cue onset) by using local peak exceeding mean +Â 2 s.d. of whole trace (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mukamel et al., 2009</xref>).

Absolute event rates were much lower than the reported values in awake mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhou et al., 2014</xref>), which might be because of the poor temporal resolution of our imaging (7.8 frames/s): more than one complex spike could be included in the single detected event.

Your article has been reviewed by Ronald Calabrese as the Senior Editor, a Reviewing Editor, and three reviewers. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The reviewers agreed that the questions being addressed were interesting and the study has potential to be suitable for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. However, there was concern that while the data are potentially very rich, the analysis and the spin chosen are rather weak. Although no additional experiments would be required, a substantial reanalysis of the data set is necessary, with proper statistics and data reporting with less pooling (allowing the reader to assess the variability of the responses by themselves).</p><p>In the consultation process there was general agreement about the strengths and weaknesses of the study. In particular, the following points were emphasized by all reviewers:</p><p>- All reviewers agreed that it would be interesting to know if there are sharp functional boundaries at zebrin transitions, but the manuscript in its current form does not achieve this, since the authors classified ROI's according to the zebrin stripe from the beginning based on the overall synchrony calculated from a whole imaging session. Specifically, all three Reviewers agreed that it would be important to establish the categories of dendritic responses independently from the zebrin and then show the correspondence between the two, i.e., analyze response type independent of anatomy.</p><p>- There is concern that the pooling by and across zebrin zone is poorly justified (the implicit logic in the manuscript is that there is synchrony within bands, hence, all Purkinje cells in single bands behave the same.) It seems that all CF-evoked calcium signals were averaged (across cells/animals, and even pooling across zones). This makes it difficult to assess the actual strength of the differences reported. (See reviewer 2's essential revision 3 and reviewer 1's essential revision 2.)</p><p>- Essential revisions 3 and 4 of reviewer 3 propose many possible analyses that the authors can try</p><p>- Orienting the manuscript toward the demonstration of the diversity of responses along a wide medio-lateral axis would fit well in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>In preparing the revised manuscript, we ask you to please pay particular attention to these points, as well as to the individual comments of the three reviewers, which are appended below.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The authors make use of a zebrin promoter-dependent transgenic mouse line to label microzones, thus allowing in vivo responses to be mapped to molecular markers. This is potentially an important contribution to understanding the functional mapping of cerebellum crus II.</p><p>Several concerns make it difficult to evaluate the paper in its current form. First, the mice are not generally available, which may not be in alignment with <italic>eLife</italic> policies. Second, claims are made for sharp boundaries between different zones, yet statistical analysis is not offered to support such a claim. The observations could also be consistent with gradients of responsiveness that do not correlate with boundaries. Third, other technical and biological claims are not adequately demonstrated by rigorous analysis.</p><p>No new experiments would be needed to address any of these comments. However, much more analysis is required.</p><p>Essential revisions</p><p>1): validation of anatomical locations</p><p>1) AldoII/tdTomato mice: Are these mice the same as the ones reported in Tsutsumi et al., 2015? That was four years ago. Are they now deposited at an internationally available resource? After they are deposited, in the Materials and methods section, describe where these mice came from and how others can gain access to them. Note that <italic>eLife</italic> journal policies state &quot;Data, methods used in the analysis, and materials used to conduct the research must be clearly and precisely documented, and be maximally available to any researcher for purposes of reproducing the results or replicating the procedure.&quot; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://reviewer.elifesciences.org/author-guide/journal-policies">https://reviewer.elifesciences.org/author-guide/journal-policies</ext-link></p><p>2) Locations: Although the emphasis is on the difference between zebrin-positive and zebrin-negative zones, the reward-vs-error signal seems to sort by anatomical position, not zebrin+/-. In this case, the zebrin bands act, in a sense, as a mediolateral coordinate system. What are the stereotactic coordinates of the zones in groups I, II/III, and IV? Is it possible to add such information to Figure 3H? Where is the distinction between medial and lateral Crus II? Please report the location of zebrin-band boundaries relative to visible landmarks. For instance: &quot;The boundary between lateral bands (7+, 6+/-, and 5+/-, or Groups I and IV) and medial bands (5a+/- and 4b-, or Groups II and III) was found XXX +/- XXX Î¼m (average+/-SD) lateral from the most medial visible location of crus II, its junction with STRUCTURENAME.&quot; This will maximize the impact of the authors' work, especially with other investigators who do not have the tdTomato line.</p><p>3) Figure 2A: Related to the comment above, explain how the diagram in Figure 2A was generated. Is this from a single animal or averaged? How reproducible are the compartments?</p><p>4) Figure 2B: It is hard to see expression patterns. Please show red and green images from two-photon microscopy side-by-side along with an overlay image.</p><p>5) Group II/III zones contain zebrin-positive and zebrin-negative zones, but this distinction is not made in the analyses for the group II/III zones. This is contrary to the analyses for groups I and IV, where different functions are described for CF in zebrin -positive and zebrin -negative zones. Figure 3âfigure supplement 1A: looks like more CF activity following cue onset in the hit trials in the zebrin-positive zones. Given that based on these data, zones in group II/III are pooled, please show quantifications of CF activity following a cue in the zebrin-positive and zebrin-negative zones (not just as synchrony as in Figure 3âfigure supplement 1C).</p><p>2: analysis of responses and qualitative claims</p><p>6) For several zones within a group, the claim is made that at the population level three different responses were found. That is, CF responses in group I zones during hit trials had 3 responses: (1) decrease during the pre-cue period. (2) early increase after the cue. (3) later decrease after the reward. Is anything known about these three different types of responses at the level of individual dendrites? Does one dendrite show all 3 types of responses, or can one distinguish a subset of the population only responsible for one of the responses?</p><p>7) Subsection âDifference in CF inputs between AldC+ and AldCâ zonesÂ£â: &quot;although these task-relevant CF responses were graded within zones, the boundary of the response pattern was largely congruentâ¦&quot;: Explain this gradation in more detail. In what way and direction, were they graded? What is the quantitative distinction between a gradient and a sharp step?</p><p>8) Claims of segregation by microzone are not adequately supported. Show responses of PC dendrites based on location with 100-micron step. Also, please plot functional parameters for dendrites as a function of mediolateral distance from key microzone boundaries. If there is a microzone effect, it would be apparent as a step at the boundary.</p><p>9) Subsection âMediolateral differences in CF responsesâ, &quot;synchrony&quot;: define this term precisely so that readers do not have to look up another article to find out what was analyzed.</p><p>10) Subsection âFunction of CF inputs 1 to group II/III zonesâ: &quot;In summary, the population CF responses in group II/III zones tended to decrease before a cue,.â¦&quot; (related to Figure 6). This is not apparent in Figure 6B. Also mentioned is a 'tendency' toward an anticipatory decrease (subsection âFunction of CF inputs 1 to group II/III zonesâ). Where is the quantification for that? What is the size of this tendency? An effect size (i.e. difference divided by SD) would be helpful.</p><p>11) Figure 6âfigure supplement 1, &quot;higher temporal resolution images from these zones revealed rhythmic relationships with individual licks&quot; (also subsection âFunction of CF inputs 1 to group II/III zonesâ): What is the duration of individual licks? Is the temporal resolution of the calcium indicator high enough to capture responses to individual licks? Need to demonstrate.</p><p>12) How many imaging sessions were done per mouse? Figure 6âFigure supplement 1B and C: each trace is for 1 session. Are the 12 sessions in B and C the same 12 sessions as in A? Does that mean that each trace is from 1 mouse? Or is this whole figure an example from 1 mouse? Please clarify. If it is from one mouse, can we then also see data from averages of all mice to support this claim?</p><p>3: interpretation of results</p><p>13) Abstract: &quot;These results indicate that spatially segregated CF inputs represent diverse brain functions, and are indispensable for execution of goal-directed behavior&quot; This seems like an overstatement of the findings. The &quot;diversity&quot; of functions includes reward and motor initiation/termination, which would be &quot;multiple functions.&quot; &quot;Indispensable for execution of&quot; clause is overstated and should be reworded to &quot;may contribute to&quot;.</p><p>14) Introduction, &quot;reward outcomes&quot;: Because complex spikes (CSs) could represent both rewards and errors, maybe change this to either &quot;rewards&quot; so it is clear that the CS encodes a positive reward event? Or &quot;positive reward outcomes&quot;</p><p>15) Discussion section: Discussion starts confusingly because the terminology changes. Is lateral zebrin+ the same as 7+/6+/5+ and Group I? Is lateral zebrin- the same as 6- and 5- or Group IV? And so on. I think the authors are trying to be clearer, but it is better to either introduce the lateral/medial concept earlier, or use all the terminology here so that readers can be anchored</p><p>16) Discussion section are confusing. I assume the inhibitory effect of the cerebellar nuclei on the inferior olive would explain how a decrease in population CF can reflect the ramping up activity in fastigial nuclei. Some mention of simple spike activity occurs in the Discussion section, but it would be helpful to include those earlier in the discussion, and explain the (hypothesized) mechanisms of how CF activity reflects ramping up activity in cerebellar nuclei with all other pathways involved as well.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This study observed optic dendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal simultaneously from many Purkinje cells in identified anatomical compartments in crus II in mice during behavior performance of the go/no-go task. A combination of new techniques has been employed in this study. The main finding is that the type of response is well correlated with the anatomical compartment in which the Purkinje cell is located, and that the previous anatomical classification of compartments is well correlated with different type of responses. The results demonstrated functional importance of the anatomical compartmentalization of the cerebellum in animal behavior. The essential finding in results seems to be quite novel. Limitation of this study would be that (1) contents of the manuscript are basically descriptive about the recorded signal, without clear interpretation of mechanisms or consequences and that (2) time resolution of the signal seems poor to provide some time dependent aspects of CF inputs, such as the degree of synchronous firing of complex spikes among Purkinje cells (Sasaki, Bouwer and Llinas, 1989). Nevertheless, this report seems to have certain level of impact to general readers as well as researchers in the cerebellum field. The experiments seem to be performed with expertise. Writing is understandable. However, I have several concerns as follows.</p><p>1) The Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal recorded in this study is not in parallel with the climbing fiber input (or complex spikes), in time or in intensity. Kitamura and Hausser, (2011), which have been cited in the manuscript, shows that (dendritic) Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal decays in a slow time constant of ~1 s. On the other hand, the complex spike has a duration of several tens of ms and can fire repetitively at a frequency of ~10 Hz. Therefore, I think &quot;CF input&quot; in the manuscript should be replaced by &quot;CF-dependent dendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup>&quot; or something in many places. Also, the response speed (rise time, decay time, etc.) of protein Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator (GCaMP6f) used in experiments should be mentioned.</p><p>2) In the Abstract: &quot;Crus II&quot; should be mentioned, since &quot;medial and/or lateral aldolase C-positive and/or -negative modules&quot; cannot be defined unless the lobule is specified.</p><p>&quot;â¦represent diverse brain functions&quot;. This study does not support this conclusion, since no &quot;functions&quot; were demonstrated. Instead, this study demonstrated different types of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in relation to go/no-go tongue behavior.</p><p>&quot;â¦are indispensable for..&quot; This study does not support this conclusion. This phrase should be omitted.</p><p>3) Concerns about experiments and analyses:</p><p>&quot;ROI&quot; should be clearly defined. It seems that the authors assume that one ROI is equivalent with one Purkinje cell. But, in Figure 3A, the size of single ROIs varies significantly.</p><p>Basic information of experiments, for example, the number of ROIs (or Purkinje cells) in each compartment should be provided. For example, in Figure 2A, the recording area covers 4b- and 7+ according to this drawing. But, no data from Purkinje cells in 7+ or in 4b- are provided in the paper. However, the authorsâ claims that Purkinje cells in 5+, 6+ and 7+ are similar (group I) and Purkinje cells in 4b-, 5a+ and 5a- are similar (group II/III).</p><p>I could not find data that show that Purkinje cells in 5+, 6+ and 7+ (or Purkinje cells in 5- and 6-) show similar response patterns in this paper, although it is claimed.</p><p>Is it possible to quantify the Ca<sup>2+</sup> response? For example, traces in Figure 2C,D. show signals of various intensity. How these signal correspond to or reflect complex spike firing frequencies?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript Shinichiro Tsutsumi and co-authors explore the dynamics of climbing fiber activity in the cerebellar cortex of head-fixed mice performing a simple auditory-cued go/no-go task. The climbing fibers (CF) are recorded by calcium imaging using two-photon microscopy in a perio-oral lobule of the cerebellum, and their functional identity is provided by their relation to the zebrin positive/negative bands of the cerebellar cortex. The main conclusion of the study is that CF innervating Purkinje cells belonging to different bands have different relation to behavior, with somewhat different modulation of their activity in relation to movement, movement omission, movement initiation, reward. Overall the experiments and data curation seem carefully performed but the statistical analysis and presentation of the results is currently unsatisfactory and makes the assessment of the strength of the author's claim difficult. Moreover, the differences seem in many cases more quantitative than qualitative, preventing firm conclusions to be drawn on a differential involvement of the cerebellar regions in behavior.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The relevance of the task chosen may be questioned; indeed, the inactivation of the cerebellar cortex seems mostly to decrease licking vigor/onset, yielding a moderate increase in correct rejection and decrease in hit rate. There is no real evidence that the animals fail to process the cue or cue-reward association very differently with or without cerebellum; the cerebellum could help thus to have a slightly better time-locking of licking (as already shown in Rahmati et al., 2014) the authors focus here on a signal associated with learning (CF discharge) but it is unclear what the cerebellum needs to learn in this task.</p><p>2) The task used by the authors does not include a delay between the cue onset and the availability of the water, making difficult to separate what is sensory representation, reward expectation, motor preparation and motor execution. For example, in many cases, the calcium responses are seen in the absence of lick (CR) (absence of calcium signal in &quot;misses&quot; could be due to lack of attention of the mouse); the 1 second time period before the cue is defined as a period of motor preparation but it could be as well caused by an attentional shift. It seems to me a number of experiments could have been attempted to examine their impact on the CF responses (changes in the protocol such as omission of the reward, delayed reward delivery, presentation of the sound in the absence of the lick port etc.).</p><p>3) The differences of activations seem in many cases quantitative more than qualitative. Is it possible (or even likely since microzones could be a few PC wide) that the functional segmentation by zebrin zones is too coarse: indeed inspection of the correlation matrices in Figure 2âfigure supplement 1 and Figure 3âfigure supplement 1 suggest the existence of sub-compartments in the lobules 5+, 5- and 4- (other zones are not illustrated). I wonder whether a more fruitful analysis would be instead to categorize single CF response using functional criteria (probability of firing correlated to licking vigor, latency, presence of a reward, etc.) and examine the spatial distribution of the cells which, based on the current analysis, should be constrained by the zebrin zonation. Finally, the lobule studied is known to receive sensory inputs from many regions of the oral/peri-oral area in the rat (although the C3/5- zone could be more associated with the forelimb); it may therefore be engaged in other motor responses than licking (e.g. tightening of the mouth in the case of active omission?); therefore interpreting an increased response as encoding motor suppression is questionable.</p><p>4) While the number of cells/animals seems appropriate, the statistics are questionable, and the analysis seems sometimes incomplete. First, many cases show highly significant p-values, but tiny effect sizes (&lt;10% of the SD, see for example Figure 4âfigure supplement 1H,I); it seems no repeated measure ANOVA was used throughout the paper. This has to be corrected and the effects should be tested by nesting the random effects of cells within mice. The ANOVA with Gaussian model is probably not adequate for testing proportions (which are bounded between 0 and 1). In many cases the Ns are not indicated (e.g. when splitting trials for presence/absence of early response). Second, the choice of data illustrated or analyzed may be aggregating multiple factors. To provide a few examples, the lick rate is sometimes presented just for cases with licks (Hit+FA) or for all cases (including trials without licks, which make little sense); in the latter case, the quantification of Miss would be more appropriate to illustrate the difference in behavior (e.g. Panels 4C and 4E, could be instead 4E + Miss rate histogram). Also, DF/F aggregates the CF response probability and the fluorescence amplitude of CF discharge, which may show considerable changes from trial to trial according to Figure 2BE and is not reported nor analyzed. It seems that two types of 'Early' CF response take place: either in the 0-.5 second following cue onset or in the next.5 second (in groups II-III-IV); it would be useful to analyze this phenomenon more in detail: is the absence of 0.5-1s CF response due to a high CF firing probability in the 0-0.5s period and an apparent refractory period of &gt;.5 s? are the late 0.5-1s CF response due to a poor temporal tuning of the CF within single trial? or the ability of the CF to fire twice in that time window in the zones where this occurs? The synchrony in relation to the movement seems not explored (while it could help to enhance the contrast between types of responses).</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Modular organization of cerebellar climbing fiber inputs during goal-directed behavior&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Ronald Calabrese (Senior Editor), a Reviewing Editor, and three reviewers.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>There are still concerns about the extent to which the claims of segregation of responses by aldolase C/zebrin expression are supported by the data. However, we appreciate that the demonstration of a wide range of activity patterns that are now well documented by the glm and which are grossly -if not finely- delineated by the zebrin zones. We therefore ask you to revise the manuscript in order to de-emphasize the strong conclusion, that CF responses are strictly segregated by aldolase C banding, and emphasize instead the diversity of responses across regions more broadly. Specific examples of necessary changes are given by reviewers 1 and 3, below.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The authors have addressed a number of concerns. I appreciate the availability of the mice.</p><p>However, a central claim, segregation of responses by aldolase C expression, is still not convincing. Therefore, I cannot recommend acceptance of this manuscript.</p><p>1) Subsection âAldC expression delineates task-related CF signalsâ: The choice of a silhouette threshold appears to be arbitrary. It is claimed that &quot;Silhouette value was mostly above 0.7, indicating good separation.&quot; But inspection of Figure 2âfigure supplement 2 shows that only 5-/5+ shows a clear segregation by correlation. The other boundaries are blurred.</p><p>Therefore their conclusion in subsection âAldC expression delineates task-related CF signalsâ is not suitable: &quot;showing that unbiased clustering of ROIs based on their responses largely corresponds to separation using AldC expression, thus further verifying our approach to separately analyze function per each AldC compartment.&quot;</p><p>2) Figure 2âfigure supplement 1: Similarly, quite often the probability in CF response varies within a microzone. 5a-5a+ doesn't show a difference in probability between the neighboring 100 microns of each zone, either for Hits, False Alarm, or Correct Rejection. Also, probabilities between individual imaging sessions (gray lines) are variable. So, their conclusion that &quot;Significant differences in response probability were noted across all the AldC boundaries for either or all of hit, FA, and CR trials (Figure 2âfigure supplement 1),.â¦ &quot; (subsection âAldC expression delineates task-related CF signalsâ) seems too far-fetched at the least. What does it say if all 4 zones of 100 Î¼m differ from each other? The effect does not seem to always be AldC-dependent.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This study observed optic dendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal simultaneously from many Purkinje cells in identified anatomical compartments in crus II in mice during behaviour performance of the go/no-go task.

I still have a few comments:</p><p>1) Match of boundaries of functional and anatomical zones: the phrasing in the text seems stronger than the figures. Microzones within zones seem to be visible in the data either using clustering (Figure 2âfigure supplement 2) or distance (Figure 2âfigure supplement 1). Notably, a number of clusters of dendrite are crossing the zebrin borders (Figure 2âfigure supplement 2 panels 5a+/4b-, 6+/5-, 6-/6+). The quantitative arguments (Figure 2âfigure supplement 4C) provides enough argument to group responses using anatomical boundaries in the rest of the paper, but I feel the presentation of the results should acknowledge more clearly that the zebrin zonation is far from covering all the functional segmentation.</p><p>2) The manuscript is much improved by the addition of all the data, but the message may become harder to grasp for the reader; a synthetic scheme might help to gather the main information currently distributed in many schemes and increase the impact of the manuscript.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Modular organization of cerebellar climbing fiber inputs during goal-directed behavior&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.

At a minimum, please address the following specific points:</p><p>1) The Abstract still overemphasizes the aspects of the study relating to the correspondence of the functional and anatomical boundaries. The abstract needs to be revised in accordance with the previous decision letter, and for clarity. We suggest the following changes:</p><p>- In the third sentence, please return to the original phrasing, so that the sentence ends with &quot;to investigate the functional differences in CF inputs to modules.&quot; (at a minimum, remove &quot;across aldolase C-positive and -negative&quot;)</p><p>- Please edit these sentences for clarity and readability: &quot;Anticipatory decreases and early increases in CF signals in the medial modules represent quick motor initiation, and early and secondary increases in these modules represent fast motor behavior. Early increases in CF signals also discriminated go/no-go cues oppositely in the medial aldolase C-positive and lateral aldolase C-negative modules. Positive reward outcomes were indicated by decreases in CF signals in the lateral modules. &quot; Perhaps it would be helpful to focus on stating each spatial region and describing the signals found there (as was the style of the original abstract). Please also tone down the conclusions regarding aldolase C patterning, as requested. It may be helpful use language such as, &quot;broadly corresponding to molecular patterning&quot; or similar, as used in previous reviews.</p><p>- Please revise the last sentence of the Abstract to reduce the emphasis on molecular segregation, either by removing &quot;molecularly&quot; or at least to moving it after &quot;spatially&quot; and qualifying it based on the concerns about the hard borders that have already been raised.</p><p>2) Additional problematic statements need to be addressed:</p><p>- Subsection âAldC expression delineates task-related CF signalsâ: 'indicating that the AldC expression boundaries delineate CF functions at microzone level to some extent.'</p><p>This is untrue as noted by the other reviewers as well. Maybe it would be more appropriate to say that AldC expression boundaries have a close (&lt;100Âµm?) spatial correspondence with the CF functional boundaries?</p><p>- Subsection âAldC expression delineates task-related CF signalsâ: 'in many cases': this is again rather fuzzy. According to Figure 2âfigure supplement 2, the coincidence of boundaries seemed to fit approximately at the cellular level (which is the nature of zebrin limits) for the 7+/6-, 5-/5+, 5a-/5a+ boundaries; the other boundaries seem far less perfect.</p><p>- Furthermore, in the Discussion section &quot;spatial organization of CF signals was delineated at AldC expression boundary at both microzone level (Figure 2âfigure supplement 1) and single cell level (Figure 2âfigure supplement 2, Figure 2âfigure supplement 3 and Figure 2âfigure supplement 4).&quot; Same comment as above; this is not supported by the figures. A statement cannot be sometimes true and sometimes wrong.</p><p>3) Figure 8: shouldn't &quot;intermediate&quot; (which is more spatial than temporal) become 'late'? It is unclear how the arrows to 5-/6- and 6+ are related to the text underneath.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.47021.038</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Summary:</p><p>The reviewers agreed that the questions being addressed were interesting and the study has potential to be suitable for publication in eLife.

The observations could also be consistent with gradients of responsiveness that do not correlate with boundaries.

To look at these relationships at single cell level, we added principal component analysis (PCA) on the whole calcium trace followed by <italic>k</italic>-means clustering, irrespective of AldC expression (Figure 2âfigure supplement 2â4), and showed that unbiased functional classification of CF signals mostly correspond to separation using AldC expression.</p><p>3) We have reanalyzed spatiotemporal pattern of CF responses at single dendrites and single compartments to avoid excessive pooling of the data.

In this case, the zebrin bands act, in a sense, as a mediolateral coordinate system. What are the stereotactic coordinates of the zones in groups I, II/III, and IV? Is it possible to add such information to Figure 3H? Where is the distinction between medial and lateral Crus II? Please report the location of zebrin-band boundaries relative to visible landmarks. For instance: &quot;The boundary between lateral bands (7+, 6+/-, and 5+/-, or Groups I and IV) and medial bands (5a+/- and 4b-, or Groups II and III) was found XXX +/- XXX Î¼m (average+/-SD) lateral from the most medial visible location of crus II, its junction with STRUCTURENAME.&quot; This will maximize the impact of the authors' work, especially with other investigators who do not have the tdTomato line.</p></disp-quote><p>We manually mapped the relative location of these AldC bands on the basis of tdTomato fluorescence on two-photon imaging.

This is contrary to the analyses for groups I and IV, where different functions are described for CF in zebrin -positive and zebrin -negative zones. Figure 3âfigure supplement 1A: looks like more CF activity following cue onset in the hit trials in the zebrin-positive zones. Given that based on these data, zones in group II/III are pooled, please show quantifications of CF activity following a cue in the zebrin-positive and zebrin-negative zones (not just as synchrony as in Figure 3âfigure supplement 1C).</p></disp-quote><p>Instead of pooling the data by grouping based on CF innervation pattern, we now showed task-related CF signals in each compartment sorted from lateral to medial (Figure 3âfigure supplement 1C), and found some difference between AldC+ and AldCâ compartments even in the medial Crus II, as the reviewer pointed out. Then we compared the responses in the lateral vs. medial Crus II separately for AldC+ and AldCâ compartments (Figure 3CâD).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2: analysis of responses and qualitative claims</p><p>6) For several zones within a group, the claim is made that at the population level three different responses were found. That is, CF responses in group I zones during hit trials had 3 responses: (1) decrease during the pre-cue period. (2) early increase after the cue. (3) later decrease after the reward. Is anything known about these three different types of responses at the level of individual dendrites? Does one dendrite show all 3 types of responses, or can one distinguish a subset of the population only responsible for one of the responses?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for raising this important issue. We analyzed single ROI, single trial traces (Figure 4âfigure supplement 2) to address this point. Decreases in CF signals at pre-cue period (â1 to 0 s from cue onset), increases in CF signals at early (0 to 0.5 s from cue onset) and intermediate (0.5 to 1 s from cue onset) response window could be induced simultaneously even in single dendrites and single trial level (Figure 4âfigure supplement 2A; Results section).

It is still controversial how ramping up activity in cerebellar nuclei (both fastigial and dentate) is generated. According to this reviewerâs suggestion, we have removed discussion about simple spikes and only discuss the relationship between nuclear ramping up activity and decreases in CF signals (Discussion section).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>This study observed optic dendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal simultaneously from many Purkinje cells in identified anatomical compartments in crus II in mice during behavior performance of the go/no-go task.

Kitamura and Hausser, (2011), which have been cited in the manuscript, shows that (dendritic) Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal decays in a slow time constant of ~1 s. On the other hand, the complex spike has a duration of several tens of ms and can fire repetitively at a frequency of ~10 Hz. Therefore, I think &quot;CF input&quot; in the manuscript should be replaced by &quot;CF-dependent dendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup>&quot; or something in many places. Also, the response speed (rise time, decay time, etc.) of protein Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator (GCaMP6f) used in experiments should be mentioned.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that âCF inputâ is overstated for our study, because the temporal resolution of our imaging (7.8 frames/s) is not enough to quantify actual complex spikes, as the reviewer pointed out. We now rephrased it as âCF-dependent dendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signalsâ or simply âCF signalsâ (Results section) throughout the manuscript. As for response speed of GCaMP6f, we cited Gaffield et al., (2016), where they showed that the rise and decay time constant are ~33 ms and ~100 ms, respectively, for CF-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in Purkinje cell dendrites. We have stated this in Materials and methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In the Abstract: &quot;Crus II&quot; should be mentioned, since &quot;medial and/or lateral aldolase C-positive and/or -negative modules&quot; cannot be defined unless the lobule is specified.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing this out.

As in the Materials and methods section, we inspected the results of automatic ROI extraction and semi-automatically corrected by the criteria described (Materials and methods section). In brief, closely located fractured ROIs which showed highly correlated activity (r &gt; 0.75) were regarded as dendrites of the same cell. Furthermore, there is a manual inclusion criterion for the shape of regions of interest (ROIs), where round or vessel-shaped ROIs were omitted (Materials and methods section). In a new Figure 2B, we separately showed selected ROIs to make this point clearer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Basic information of experiments, for example, the number of ROIs (or Purkinje cells) in each compartment should be provided.

On the basis of this method, we found that baseline event rates (during pre-trial: â2 to â1 s from cue onset) were 0.46 Â± 0.02 and 0.43 Â± 0.02 events/s for AldC+ and AldCâ PCs (<italic>n</italic> = 1,295 and 1,219 ROIs; Materials and methods section). Given that ÎF/F can represent both probability and amplitude of CF signals (Najafi et al., 2014), the event rate that we measured by simple thresholding could underestimate the actual complex spike rate (~1 spikes/s Zhou et al., 2014). Therefore, we used either binarized response for each region of interest (ROI) for each trial (Figure 2âfigure supplement 1), or whole session (Figure 2 and Figure 3 and Figure 3âfigure supplement 2), or relative change in ROI-averaged ÎF/F detected within single trials (Figure 4âfigure supplement 1 and Figure 4âfigure supplement 3).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>In this manuscript Shinichiro Tsutsumi and co-authors explore the dynamics of climbing fiber activity in the cerebellar cortex of head-fixed mice performing a simple auditory-cued go/no-go task.

To address this reviewerâs concerns, we substantially added new analyses and statistics to make our conclusions stronger.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The relevance of the task chosen may be questioned; indeed, the inactivation of the cerebellar cortex seems mostly to decrease licking vigor/onset, yielding a moderate increase in correct rejection and decrease in hit rate. There is no real evidence that the animals fail to process the cue or cue-reward association very differently with or without cerebellum; the cerebellum could help thus to have a slightly better time-locking of licking (as already shown in Rahmati et al., 2014); the authors focus here on a signal associated with learning (CF discharge) but it is unclear what the cerebellum needs to learn in this task.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that we are not addressing the causal sensory role of the cerebellum in our task. Nevertheless, we still observed difference in CF signals in response to go and no-go cues, and they were opposite for the lateral and medial Crus II (Figure 5B). This result provides insights into spatial organization of sensory-related CF signals (lateral &gt; medial) of the cerebellum.</p><p>We also agree that the role of the cerebellum (Crus II) in motor timing has been somehow shown and not novel (Welsh, 2002, and Rahmati et al., 2014, as pointed out). However, the present finding that motor timing is mostly relevant to CF signals in the medial Crus II rather than the lateral Crus II (new Figure 4, Figure 5 and Figure 6) is novel and we believe that our findings provides a new perspective on mediolateral differences in cerebellar function.</p><p>We are not claiming CFâs role in learning in the previous and revised manuscript, rather addressing their role in learned motor execution (Welsh et al., 1995, Welsh, 2002, and ten Brinke et al., 2017). Nevertheless, we totally agree that their role in goal-directed learning remains a very important topic and needs to be addressed in future. We added a sentence on this topic with regard to the reward-related CF signals (Discussion section).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The task used by the authors does not include a delay between the cue onset and the availability of the water, making difficult to separate what is sensory representation, reward expectation, motor preparation and motor execution. For example, in many cases, the calcium responses are seen in the absence of lick (CR) (absence of calcium signal in &quot;misses&quot; could be due to lack of attention of the mouse); the 1 second time period before the cue is defined as a period of motor preparation but it could be as well caused by an attentional shift. It seems to me a number of experiments could have been attempted to examine their impact on the CF responses (changes in the protocol such as omission of the reward, delayed reward delivery, presentation of the sound in the absence of the lick port etc.).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that a delayed go/no-go task can clearly separate sensory, motor, and reward expectation-related signals. Nevertheless, we tried to separate out sensory and motor aspects of CF signals by building a generalized linear model with mixed effects (GLMM) using both the presence (1) and absence (0) of licking and the presence of go cue (1) and no-go cue (0) in the trial to fit single trial ROI-averaged ÎF/F of each compartment (Figure 5B). We found distinct contributions of sensory and motor variables to CF signals in each Aldolase C (AldC) compartments: lick initiation to 6â, 5+, and 5aâ compartments (mostly medial Crus II), and go cues to 5+, 5a+, and 5aâ (medial Crus II), and no-go cues to 6â and 5â (lateral AldCâ), which suggested their distinct roles in sensory and motor functions (Results section; Discussion section).</p><p>As the reviewer pointed out, what we call âmotor preparationâ could also be explained by attentional shift or timing prediction. Actually, the observed delay in lick initiation after decreases in CF signals in the 5â compartment (Figure 4CâD) could be regarded as low level of attention to the task. We added these different interpretations in Discussion section.</p><p>We also agree that we did not address full potential of reward representations in CF signals (such as in Kostadinov et al., 2019). However, we believe that our findings of delayed (&gt; 1 s) decreases in CF signals at the lateral Crus II and their increases in a medial compartment (Figure 4âfigure supplement 3), and their significant representations of positive reward outcomes (Figure 7), could add another layer of (or task-specific) spatiotemporal representations of positive reward outcomes in CF signals (Discussion section).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The differences of activations seem in many cases quantitative more than qualitative. Is it possible (or even likely since microzones could be a few PC wide) that the functional segmentation by zebrin zones is too coarse: indeed inspection of the correlation matrices in Figure 2âfigure supplement 1 and Figure 3âfigure supplement 1 suggest the existence of sub-compartments in the lobules 5+, 5- and 4- (other zones are not illustrated). I wonder whether a more fruitful analysis would be instead to categorize single CF response using functional criteria (probability of firing correlated to licking vigor, latency, presence of a reward, etc.) and examine the spatial distribution of the cells which, based on the current analysis, should be constrained by the zebrin zonation. Finally, the lobule studied is known to receive sensory inputs from many regions of the oral/peri-oral area in the rat (although the C3/5- zone could be more associated with the forelimb); it may therefore be engaged in other motor responses than licking (e.g. tightening of the mouth in the case of active omission?); therefore interpreting an increased response as encoding motor suppression is questionable.</p></disp-quote><p>To fully address the functional separation irrespective of AldC expression identity, we performed principal component analysis on whole trace followed by <italic>k</italic>-means clustering to functionally separate CFs for each field of view (Figure 2âfigure supplement 2). This analysis indeed revealed sub-compartmental structures: CFs in single fields of view were divided into three or more clusters in some cases, which showed distinct task-related responses (Figure 2âfigure supplement 3). Nevertheless, this unbiased functional separation still largely corresponded to the separation using AldC expression boundary (coincidence rate &gt; 80%; Figure 2âfigure supplement 4), which validated our approach to group CFs on the basis of AldC compartments. We then performed the analyses regarding various functional aspects of CF signals on single AldC compartment basis instead of excessive grouping (Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6 and Figure 7), and showed functional differences between compartments along the entire mediolateral axis in Crus II.</p><p>We agree that the Crus II is also responsible for sensory processing and motor control other than licking, and also agree that CF signals during correct rejection trials could also be explained by non-monitored motor actions. We have added this possibility in Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) While the number of cells/animals seems appropriate, the statistics are questionable, and the analysis seems sometimes incomplete. [â¦] The synchrony in relation to the movement seems not explored (while it could help to enhance the contrast between types of responses).</p></disp-quote><p>Effect sizes for all the comparisons are now summarized in Supplementary file 1(Materials and methods section). We agree that effect sizes are sometimes very small (&lt; 0.2), in that case we attenuated the claims (Results section). We now use repeated measures ANOVA and GLMM to control for across mice variability in every single statistic in the figures. For data that has bounds such as percentage, response probability, and cluster numbers, we used ANOVA on ranks (Figure 2F, Figure 3C, 3D, Figure 2âfigure supplement 1, Figure 2âfigure supplement 4, and Figure 3âfigure supplement 2). We also provided the number of trials and mice used for each analysis in the figure legends as well as in Supplementary file 1.</p><p>Lick rate analyses are now only using licking trials (hit and FA). We agree that ÎF/F can represent both probability and amplitude of CF signals (Najafi et al., 2014). Therefore we used either binarized response for each region of interest (ROI) for each trial (Figure 2âfigure supplement 1), or whole session (Figure 2F, Figure 3C, 3D and Figure 3âfigure supplement 2), or relative change in ROI-averaged ÎF/F was detected within single trials (Figure 4âfigure supplement 1 and Figure 4âfigure supplement 3).</p><p>We deeply appreciate this reviewerâs comment on the two phases of CF signals within âearlyâ (0 to 1 s from cue onset) response window. Following the reviewerâs advice, we separated this âearlyâ response window into two: 0 to 0.5 s (early) and 0.5 to 1 s (intermediate) from cue onset. We basically found the same results on the narrower early CF signals (0 to 0.5 s from cue onset; Figure 2, Figure 3 and Figure 5) as those of old broader early CF signals (0 to 1 s from cue onset), whereas we found clear differences across the lateral and medial Crus II with regard to the secondary increases in CF signals (0.5 to 1 s from cue onset; Figure 3âfigure supplement 2) and their behavioral relevance (Figure 6), which were unclear in the previous version of our manuscript. Single ROI single trial traces (Figure 4âfigure supplement 2A) suggest that even a single ROI can sometimes fire twice within 0â1 s time window.</p><p>We ceased to pursue synchrony of CF signals because we lack temporal resolution (frame rate of 7.8 frames/s) to support the claims.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[â¦] We therefore ask you to revise the manuscript in order to de-emphasize the strong conclusion, that CF responses are strictly segregated by aldolase C banding, and emphasize instead the diversity of responses across regions more broadly.

It is claimed that &quot;Silhouette value was mostly above 0.7, indicating good separation.&quot; But inspection of Figure 2âfigure supplement 2 shows that only 5-/5+ shows a clear segregation by correlation.

Also, probabilities between individual imaging sessions (gray lines) are variable. So, their conclusion that &quot;Significant differences in response probability were noted across all the AldC boundaries for either or all of hit, FA, and CR trials (Figure 2âfigure supplement 1),.â¦ &quot; (subsection âAldC expression delineates task-related CF signalsâ) seems too far-fetched at the least. What does it say if all 4 zones of 100 Î¼m differ from each other? The effect does not seem to always be AldC-dependent.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewerâs careful inspection of our data.

I still have a few comments:</p><p>1) Match of boundaries of functional and anatomical zones: the phrasing in the text seems stronger than the figures. Microzones within zones seem to be visible in the data either using clustering (Figure 2âfigure supplement 2) or distance (Figure 2âfigure supplement 1). Notably, a number of clusters of dendrite are crossing the zebrin borders (Figure 2âfigure supplement 2 panels 5a+/4b-, 6+/5-, 6-/6+). The quantitative arguments (Figure 2âfigure supplement 4C) provides enough argument to group responses using anatomical boundaries in the rest of the paper, but I feel the presentation of the results should acknowledge more clearly that the zebrin zonation is far from covering all the functional segmentation.</p></disp-quote><p>We attenuated the statement that only some of the AldC boundaries delineate CF function (subsection âAldC expression delineates task-related CF signalsâ).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The manuscript is much improved by the addition of all the data, but the message may become harder to grasp for the reader; a synthetic scheme might help to gather the main information currently distributed in many schemes and increase the impact of the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this reviewerâs constructive comment.

The abstract needs to be revised in accordance with the previous decision letter, and for clarity. We suggest the following changes:</p><p>- In the third sentence, please return to the original phrasing, so that the sentence ends with &quot;to investigate the functional differences in CF inputs to modules.&quot; (at a minimum, remove &quot;across aldolase C-positive and -negative&quot;)</p></disp-quote><p>We have changed this sentence as suggested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Please edit these sentences for clarity and readability: &quot;Anticipatory decreases and [â¦] in the lateral modules. &quot; Perhaps it would be helpful to focus on stating each spatial region and describing the signals found there (as was the style of the original abstract). Please also tone down the conclusions regarding aldolase C patterning, as requested. It may be helpful use language such as, &quot;broadly corresponding to molecular patterning&quot; or similar, as used in previous reviews.</p></disp-quote><p>According to these suggestions, we now describe the patterns of activity and their functions in medial and lateral modules respectively, instead of emphasizing correspondence with aldolase C expression. We also added a sentence as suggested. Abstract: The boundaries of CF functions broadly correspond to those of aldolase C patterning.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Please revise the last sentence of the Abstract to reduce the emphasis on molecular segregation, either by removing &quot;molecularly&quot; or at least to moving it after &quot;spatially&quot; and qualifying it based on the concerns about the hard borders that have already been raised.</p></disp-quote><p>We have removed a word âmolecularlyâ and changed the sentence as follows (Abstract); âThese results indicate that spatially segregated CF inputs in different modules play distinct roles for execution of goal-directed behavior.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Additional problematic statements need to be addressed:</p><p>- Subsection âAldC expression delineates task-related CF signalsâ: 'indicating that the AldC expression boundaries delineate CF functions at microzone level to some extent.'</p><p>This is untrue as noted by the other reviewers as well.

According to Figure 2âfigure supplement 2, the coincidence of boundaries seemed to fit approximately at the cellular level (which is the nature of zebrin limits) for the 7+/6-, 5-/5+, 5a-/5a+ boundaries; the other boundaries seem far less perfect.</p></disp-quote><p>We have changed this part as follows (subsection âCorrespondence between task-related CF signals and AldC expressionâ);</p><p>Mean coincidence rates across animals were as high as 90% in 7+/6â, 5â/5+, and 5+/5aâ boundaries (Figure 2âfigure supplement 4C), indicating that unbiased clustering of ROIs based on their responses corresponds to separation using AldC expression at cellular resolution in these boundaries, but more broadly tuned in the other boundaries.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Furthermore, in the Discussion section &quot;spatial organization of CF signals was delineated at AldC expression boundary at both microzone level (Figure 2âfigure supplement 1) and single cell level (Figure 2âfigure supplement 2, Figure 2âfigure supplement 3 and Figure 2âfigure supplement 4).&quot; Same comment as above; this is not supported by the figures.
