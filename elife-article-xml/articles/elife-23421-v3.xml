Radiomics is an emerging field that translates these medical images into quantitative data to enable phenotypic profiling of tumors. While radiomics has been associated with several clinical endpoints, the complex relationships of radiomics, clinical factors, and tumor biology are largely unknown. To this end, we analyzed two independent cohorts of respectively 262 North American and 89 European patients with lung cancer, and consistently identified previously undescribed associations between radiomic imaging features, molecular pathways, and clinical factors. In particular, we found a relationship between imaging features, immune response, inflammation, and survival, which was further validated by immunohistochemical staining. Moreover, a number of imaging features showed predictive value for specific pathways; for example, intra-tumor heterogeneity features predicted activity of RNA polymerase transcription (AUC = 0.62, p=0.03) and intensity dispersion was predictive of the autodegration pathway of a ubiquitin ligase (AUC = 0.69, p<italic>&lt;</italic>10<sup>-4</sup>). Finally, we observed that prognostic biomarkers performed highest when combining radiomic, genetic, and clinical information (CI = 0.73, p&lt;10<sup>-9</sup>) indicating complementary value of these data. In conclusion, we demonstrate that radiomic approaches permit noninvasive assessment of both molecular and clinical characteristics of tumors, and therefore have the potential to advance clinical decision-making by systematically analyzing standard-of-care medical images.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.23421.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.23421.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23421.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Medical imaging covers a wide range of techniques that are used to look inside the body, including X-rays, MRI scans and ultrasound. A process called radiomics uses computer algorithms to process the data collected by these techniques to identify and precisely measure a large number of features that would not otherwise be quantifiable by human experts. By doing so, radiomics can automatically measure the radiographic characteristics of a tumor. For example, radiomics can establish the size, shape and texture of a tumor to help to diagnose cancer and guide its treatment.</p><p>Research has suggested that radiomics can predict certain clinical characteristics of cancer, such as how far through the body the cancer has spread, how likely it is to respond to treatment, and how likely a patient is to survive. However, these radiomic characteristics have not yet been precisely linked to the biological processes that drive how cancer develops and spreads.</p><p>Cancers develop as a result of genetic changes that activate “molecular pathways” in the cells and trigger processes such as cell division and inflammation. To work out exactly which changes are behind a particular tumor, a sample of the tumor from biopsy or surgery is analyzed using genomics techniques. Linking radiomics features to the molecular processes active in a tumor can generate further information that can complement the molecular data. Images are routinely collected on all cancer patients yet molecular data is not. Hence, in some cases, the images can be used to infer the molecular underpinnings of cancer in individual patients.</p><p>Grossmann et al. have now analyzed radiomic, genomic and clinical data collected from approximately 350 patients with lung cancer. The analysis revealed links between biological processes normally detected by genomics – in particular, inflammatory responses – and radiomics features. Furthermore, these features could also be associated with clinical characteristics, such as tumor type and patient survival rates. These results were further validated by using a technique called immunohistochemical staining on tumor tissue obtained by surgery.</p><p>Further investigation revealed that certain radiomics features can predict the state of molecular pathways that are key to cancer development (such as the inflammatory response). Furthermore, Grossmann et al. found that combining data from radiomics, genomics and clinical parameters predicts how the cancer will progress better than any of these parameters can predict on their own. These results demonstrate the complementary value of radiomic data to genomic and clinical data.</p><p>There are many different algorithms that can be used to process images for radiomics. Before radiomics can be used clinically to assess the biological processes underlying the tumors of patients, a specific algorithm needs to be decided upon and then tested in prospective clinical trials.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.23421.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.23421.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group

the molecular characterization of a patient’s tumor with genomic approaches, which requires tissue extraction usually obtained via biopsy. A number of examples demonstrate successful translation of genomic information obtained from biopsies into clinical applications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Doroshow and Kummar, 2014</xref>), but these approaches also have inherent limitations, such as their invasive nature or sampling artifacts caused by intra-tumor heterogeneity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sottoriva et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fisher et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gerlinger et al., 2012</xref>). These limitations can be addressed by medical imaging that has served as crucial diagnostic tool and treatment guidance in clinical oncology. In contrast to biopsies, medical imaging is usually noninvasive, can be applied longitudinally, and provides information about the entire visible tumor volume. In this way, medical imaging has the potential to characterize phenotypic information of tumors and thus complement molecular interrogation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Choi et al., 2016</xref>). As imaging is already used routinely throughout the course of treatment this facilitates ready access to this type of data. Therefore, imaging has the potential to serve as valuable diagnostic tool in clinical decision making by complementing biological interrogation or serving as a surrogate in settings where biospecimen-derived diagnostics is not feasible, such as in longitudinal monitoring.</p><p>Radiomics is an emerging field that translates these medical images into mineable data by extracting a large number of quantitative imaging features that objectively define tumor intensity, shape, size, and texture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gillies et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aerts, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lambin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kumar et al., 2012</xref>) in a robust and reproducible way (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zhao et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fried et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Balagurunathan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Leijenaar et al., 2013</xref>). As this approach is applied to existing standard of care images, radiomics can be cost-effectively integrated with genomics or serve as surrogate in cases where biopsies are not feasible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">O'Connor et al., 2015</xref>). Hence, such strategies can be of value for the development of clinical biomarkers for diagnosis, prognosis, and prediction of response to specific treatments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Choi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Huang et al., 2016a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aerts et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Nicolasjilwan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Parmar et al., 2015a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Parmar et al., 2015b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aerts et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chong et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Coroller et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gevaert et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ganeshan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Win et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mattonen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Grossmann et al., 2017</xref>). Due to the enormous potential for precision medicine, an increasing number of studies have investigated associations between imaging and tumor biology in different cancer types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aerts et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gevaert et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Diehn et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Grossmann et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Gutman et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Segal et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Li et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Yoon et al., 2015</xref>). However, these studies focused on specific genetic associations, or tended to be underpowered due to a limited number of available samples and lacked validation via independent datasets.</p><p>Here, we present a broad radiomic-genomic analysis in independent and large cohorts of patients with lung cancer. We rigorously investigated the mechanistic connections between imaging phenotypes and underlying molecular pathways. Furthermore, we validated key associations via immunohistochemical staining and related these associations to clinical factors. In addition, we developed and validated radiomic predictors of pathway activation status, and investigated the prognostic value of combining radiomic biomarkers with genetic and clinical data. In this study, we aimed at uncovering whether radiomic approaches have the potential to predict both molecular and clinical characteristics of tumors noninvasively and therefore have the potential to augment clinical decision-making using data extracted from standard of care medical images.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>To uncover the mechanistic connections between radiomic phenotypes, molecular pathways, and clinical information, we performed an integrated radiomic-genomic analysis of a lung cancer discovery cohort (Dataset1, <italic>n</italic> = 262), and validated our results on an independent validation cohort (Dataset2, <italic>n</italic> = 89).

Clinical association to overall survival (red), pathologic histology (purple), and TNM stage (yellow) was statistically tested in both datasets, and results were combined in a meta-analysis to investigate relationships of modules.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.23421.004">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.23421.004</ext-link></p><p><supplementary-material id="SD1-data"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23421.005</object-id><label>Figure 2—source data 1.</label><caption><title>Dataset1.</title><p>Spreadsheet containing radiomic data, normalized gene expression, and clinical data of the discovery cohort.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.23421.005">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.23421.005</ext-link></p></caption><media mime-subtype="xlsx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-23421-fig2-data1-v3.xlsx"/></supplementary-material></p><p><supplementary-material id="SD2-data"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23421.006</object-id><label>Figure 2—source data 2.</label><caption><title>Dataset2.</title><p>Spreadsheet containing radiomic data, normalized gene expression, and clinical data of the validation cohort.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.23421.006">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.23421.006</ext-link></p></caption><media mime-subtype="xlsx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-23421-fig2-data2-v3.xlsx"/></supplementary-material></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="postscript" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-23421-fig2-v3"/></fig><table-wrap id="tbl1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23421.007</object-id><label>Table 1.</label><caption><p>Proportions of clinical characteristics in Dataset1 and Dataset2, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>.</p><p>Histology and TNM stage were based on pathology were available.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.23421.007">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.23421.007</ext-link></p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top"><break/></th><th valign="top">Dataset1</th><th valign="top">Dataset2</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Gender</td><td valign="top"><break/></td><td valign="top"><break/></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Male</td><td valign="top">100 (45%)</td><td valign="top">59 (68%)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Female</td><td valign="top">124 (55%)</td><td valign="top">28 (32%)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Histology</td><td valign="top"><break/></td><td valign="top"><break/></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Adenocarcinoma</td><td valign="top">129 (58%)</td><td valign="top">42 (48%)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Squamous</td><td valign="top">61 (27%)</td><td valign="top">33 (38%)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Other</td><td valign="top">34 (15%)</td><td valign="top">12 (14%)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Stage</td><td valign="top"><break/></td><td valign="top"><break/></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">I</td><td valign="top">123 (55%)</td><td valign="top">39 (45%)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">II</td><td valign="top">35 (15%)</td><td valign="top">26 (30%)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">III</td><td valign="top">46 (21%)</td><td valign="top">12 (14%)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Other</td><td valign="top">20 (9%)</td><td valign="top">10 (11%)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Smoking Status</td><td valign="top"><break/></td><td valign="top"><break/></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Current</td><td valign="top">66 (29%)</td><td valign="top">NA</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Former</td><td valign="top">141 (63%)</td><td valign="top">NA</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">None</td><td valign="top">17 (8%)</td><td valign="top">NA</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Tumor site</td><td valign="top"><break/></td><td valign="top"><break/></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Primary</td><td valign="top">224 (100%)</td><td valign="top">87 (100%)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Endpoints</td><td valign="top"><break/></td><td valign="top"><break/></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Overall survivals</td><td valign="top">134 (60%)</td><td valign="top">41 (47%)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Overall deaths</td><td valign="top">90 (40%)</td><td valign="top">46 (53%)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Follow up <break/>(median months)</td><td>32</td><td>31</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p><sec id="s2-1"><title>Association modules of radiomic features and molecular pathways</title><p>To investigate the main associations of radiomics and underlying molecular pathways, we developed association modules describing radiomic-pathway coherency.

Radiomics allows quantification of the radiographic phenotype of a tumor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kuo and Jamshidi, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gillies et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Rutman and Kuo, 2009</xref>), but the underlying connections of radiomics to tumor biology and clinical factors have not been elucidated yet. In this study, we identified novel and consistent associations between radiomic phenotype data, underlying molecular pathways, and clinical factors of patients with lung cancer in a North American cohort, and validated our findings in a European cohort and with immunohistochemical staining. In addition, we presented radiomic predictors for pathway activations, and demonstrated the complementary prognostic value of combining radiomic, genetic, and clinical information.</p><p>Preliminary studies have previously investigated associations between imaging features, clinical factors, and molecular data for a number of cancer types as outlined in recent reviews (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gillies et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kuo and Jamshidi, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gillies et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Rutman and Kuo, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cook et al., 2013</xref>). Our analysis builds on these studies in that we performed a rigorous classification of a comprehensive set of radiomic features in terms of underlying molecular pathways on a genome-wide scale and clinical factors in large and independent cohorts. Although the long-term vision is to augment clinical decision making, the current goal of our study is to satisfy the need of the radiomic and oncological community to better understand the underlying biological rationale of radiomic predictions. Furthermore, we are the first to publicly share all study data and analysis code with the growing radiomic and biomedical community to enable further translational research.</p><p>We identified and independently validated thirteen radiomic-pathway modules with coherent expression patterns, eleven of which were significantly associated with OS, stage, or histology. By basing these clinical associations exclusively on radiomic features, we could demonstrate that the associated molecular pathways robustly matched radiomic- based hypotheses. For example, based on radiomic features modules M2, M9, and M12 were prognostic and also associated with stage. These modules were highly enriched for immune system, p53, and cell-cycle regulation pathways, biological processes that are widely recognized to play key roles in lung cancer. For example, it has been established that cell cycle regulation is of utmost importance in lung cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baldi et al., 2011</xref>). Furthermore, the status of p53 is reported to be a predictor of survival in lung cancer patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ahrendt et al., 2003</xref>) and a recent review has laid out how p53 can modulate innate immune system responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Menendez et al., 2013</xref>). Radiomic features in these prognostic modules M2, M9, and M12 quantified textural entropy and dispersion image intensity values suggesting associations between textural heterogeneity, cell cycling, and prognosis. Therefore, these results suggest that noninvasive radiomic surrogates may benefit diagnostic methods in assessing cell cycling and immune system states of tumors.</p><p>We aimed at confirming our statistical results indicating connections between radiomics, immune response, and survival by immunohistochemical staining of lymphocytes in cases for which a relatively high or low immune response was predicted according to a radiomics score. We generally found high agreement between pathology and radiomics, especially in cases where immune response was predicted to be high. In cases of predicted low responders that showed high pathological immune response, the cause of disagreement may be a heavy distribution of CD3 clusters in the extreme periphery of the tumor with very little staining in the bulk of the tumor. In cases of predicted high responders that showed little to no immune response, this could be due to the lack of normal tissue margin around the edge of the tumor section or a sampling effect. Similarly, we stained tissue for RelA, the p65 subunit of NFkB, to validate radiomic predictions of inflammation. Overall, we found high agreement between pathology and radiomics, although at lower statistical significance. Future studies with whole mount sections stained with multi-plex phenotyping can help determine the relationship between a radiomic and a genetic immune or inflammation signature, and the gold standard.</p><p>A variety of textural features were also associated with stage and histology (module M5). Similar associations have been reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ganeshan et al. (2010)</xref>, who suggested that 2D texture features of lung cancer CT scans could predict if tumor stage was II or above. Here, we found that texture features were enriched for axon guidance and lipoprotein metabolism. Furthermore, we observed strong associations between image intensity entropy features and pathways involved in gene expression, transcription regulation, and mitochondrial processes (M13 and M7). Previous research has suggested that imaging can detect consequences of an increase in the hypoxia-inducible factor as a result of absence of oxygen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gillies et al., 2010</xref>). Hence, if extracting quantitative information about mitochondrial pathways from medical images leads to assessment of hypoxia status of a tumor, this may ultimately aid in clinical decision-making as alternative therapies for hypoxic tumor areas are being developed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Denny, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bryant et al., 2014</xref>). Indeed, previous work has indicated that CT pixel intensities correlate with hypoxia markers such as Glut-1 and pimonidazole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ganeshan et al., 2013</xref>). Those two modules (M1 and M3) that were not associated with any of the tested clinical factors were relatively small modules; these modules suggested radiomic associations to circadian clock and neural system. The impact of these pathways to the clinical factors we tested is not apparent from current lung cancer literature, which could explain why these modules did not show clinical associations.</p><p>Our results further suggest that radiomic approaches could have the potential to predict molecular states of pathways. We found that the highest predictors of every module was also a suitable representative of the overall biological and radiomic themes of that module. Amongst these examples of pathways that showed high predictability in terms of radiomics, we found various pathways essential for tumorigenesis such as cell cycle pathways (e.g., G0 and early G1), signaling pathways (e.g., Notch and NfKB), and tumor suppressor pathways (e.g., COP1 autodegration and p53). Furthermore, we tested those radiomic pathway predictors for predictive value of driver mutations. Thereby, the highest performances were found for mutations in EGFR and KRAS, which is in line with current radiomic-genetic literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aerts et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Gutman et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Liu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Rizzo et al., 2016</xref>). Interestingly, however, the highest performance for the tumor suppressor and cell cycle regulator TP53 we found was given by a textural entropy feature that also predicted G0 and early G1 (module M12). In addition, features expressed selectivity for predicting mutations, which was suggested previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Gutman et al., 2015</xref>). These results highlight the diagnostic potential, as ready information on pathway and mutation status may permit advanced patient stratification. Previous studies have indicated that gene expression can be predicted by imaging features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gevaert et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Segal et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gevaert et al., 2014</xref>). To our knowledge, however, no study has examined and independently validated radiomic models for specific pathways, including biological validation such as immunohistochemical staining.</p><p>Finally, we verified a previously described prognostic radiomic signature and observed that the best performance is achieved when combining radiomic, genetic, and clinical data. These results strongly suggest that radiomic data contain complementary prognostic information and are robust, as the published radiomic signature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aerts et al., 2014</xref>) has not been tested on our data before. Notably, these prognostic improvements were relatively stable to substitution of radiomic or gene signatures. A related indication of improved survival predictions by combining imaging features and molecular data has been recently given for glioblastoma, however without validation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Nicolasjilwan et al., 2015</xref>). It is worth noting that for the first time we also demonstrate that radiomic prognostication generalizes across cohorts from different continents.</p><p>Three research tracks have recently been proposed for clinical translation of such imaging biomarkers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">O'Connor et al., 2017</xref>), including biological validation, technical validation, and evaluation of cost-effectiveness. Our study conforms with several of these roadmap recommendations by advancing results on a previously proposed radiomic signature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aerts et al., 2014</xref>) with additional biological validation and investigations on how genetic data and clinical factors impact this signature. Fixing a radiomic signature for technical validation and cost-effectiveness verification should be considered in subsequent studies to overcome additional translational gaps. Although the long-term vision would be to augment clinical decision making, the current goal of our study is to contribute in satisfying the need of the radiomic and oncological community to understand the underlying biology of radiomic predictions.</p><p>Our study is limited by its retrospective nature. Imaging protocols are not standardized and hence variability in CT acquisition and reconstruction parameters is inherent in clinical practice. However, despite this, no corrections by cohort or scanner type were made in this study illustrating the translational aspect of our results that generalized across institutions. Hence, we expect that the performance of radiomics will further improve, as imaging data are becoming more standardized. In fact, multiple studies have already documented the robustness of radiomic feature extractions in terms of reproducibility and repeatability in test/re-test settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fried et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Balagurunathan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Leijenaar et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Parmar et al., 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aerts et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Grove et al., 2015</xref>). Another limitation of this study is that the current cohorts mainly focused on early stage (I - III) tumors, hence generalization of radiomic-genomic associations to late stage tumors should be drawn with precaution only. However, most radiomic applications do focus on early stage tumors as the current radiomic approach requires segmentation of tumors which for late stage tumors remains to be of particular complexity. Furthermore, although our study provides multiple facets of validation, immunohistochemical validation was restricted to considerably smaller sample sizes as compared to our statistical validations due to limited availability of frozen tissue. Prospective protocols can ensure availability of sufficient tissue for additional validation.</p><p>Biological material investigated in this study has been acquired by single-needle biopsies, thus the interpretation of our genomic data is limited due to heterogeneity of lung cancer tumors. However, as our results validated in independent data and because known drivers of tumorigenesis were among the main pathways found to be associated with radiomic features, this suggests that these associations have been established in an early evolutionary step in tumorigenesis and are therefore reasonable representatives of the overall tumor. Prospective studies with defined spatial matchings of biopsies and/or single cell analyses could provide deeper insight into whether the strengths of these associations can be further increased. Prospective studies will also be required to assess clinical utility of combining radiomic, genomic, and clinical data into prognostic models.</p><p>In conclusion, this study presented novel and consistent associations between radiomics, molecular pathways, and clinical factors. We applied an independent discovery and validation design on large patient cohorts from different continents with enough variability that allowed confidence in the generalization of our results. Furthermore, we performed biological validation and demonstrated that radiomics predicts molecular pathway status and thus improves the prognostic performances of clinical and gene signatures. The clinical impact of our results is illustrated by the fact that it advances the molecular knowledge of automated radiomic characterization of tumors, information currently not used clinically. This may provide opportunities to improve decision-support at low additional cost as imaging is routinely used in clinical practice as standard of care.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Discovery and validation data</title><p>Data underlying this study is made publically available with this article; Dataset1 can be downloaded as <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 2—source data 1</xref> and Dataset2 can be downloaded as <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Figure 2—source data 2</xref>. We analyzed two cohorts of patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), Dataset1 and Dataset2, each consisting of pretreatment diagnostic computed tomography (CT) scans, gene expression profiles, and clinical data. While the larger cohort Dataset1 (North American) is novel and served as a discovery cohort, Dataset2 (European) has been previously published with CT scans and gene expression data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aerts et al., 2014</xref>), and was used for independent validation of our findings. Patients in Dataset1 were treated in the Thoracic Oncology Program at the H.

Patients in Dataset2 were treated at MAASTRO clinical, Maastricht, NL; we included patients with confirmed primary tumors who received surgery. Further details of Dataset2 are given by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aerts et al. (2014)</xref>. The majority of CT scans were recorded to be contrast-enhancing (89% and 71% of patients in Dataset1 and Dataset2, respectively).</p><p>For analyses involving CT scans and gene expression data, 262 and 89 patients were available for Dataset1 and Dataset2, respectively. In addition, clinical data were available for 224 and 87 patients, respectively. Clinical outcomes investigated were overall survival (OS), pathologic TNM stage (combined T, N, and M stages, according to the latest version 7 of the IASLC guideline for lung cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Mirsadraee et al., 2012</xref>]), and pathologic histology (grouped into adenocarcinoma, squamous carcinoma, and others). Clinical stage and histology were used when pathologic information was not available. Tumors in these cohorts were mainly early stage; in Dataset1 among the 224 clinically annotated cases 26 were stage IIIB or IV and in Dataset2 among the 87 clinically annotated cases 3 cases were stage IV. These late stages have been grouped into ‘other’ for analysis.

The resulting gene rank was input to a preranked gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Subramanian et al., 2005</xref>) version 2.0.14 on the C2 collection version 4 of the Molecular Signature Database (MSigDB) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Liberzon et al., 2011</xref>).

Those 511 out of 674 pathways were considered that contained at least 15 and at most 500 genes. GSEA reports normalized enrichment scores (NESs) for every pathway, which we further analyzed.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Radiomic-pathway association modules</title><p>To identify coherently expressed expressed features and pathways, a matrix holding an NESs for every pair of radiomic feature and Reactome pathway was biclustered with the Iterative Signature Algorithm (ISA) using the ‘isa2’ and ‘eisa’ packages in R and Bioconductor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bergmann et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Csárdi et al., 2010</xref>). As a result, each bicluster contains a set of coherently expressed features and pathways and is referred to as module. Potential module redundancy was limited using the ‘isa.unique’ function in the ‘isa2’ package with a maximum correlation threshold of 0.3. To avoid parameter sensitivity with ISA, row and column clustering seed thresholds were set to a liberal sequence of 1.5 to 2.5 by 0.5 to include all potential signals. This procedure yielded 20 putative modules.

After correcting for multiple-hypothesis testing with the false-discovery-rate (FDR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995</xref>), the validation resulted in 13 significantly enriched modules (FDR &lt; 0.05).

Next, we fitted univariate logistic regression models of every feature to predict the NES sign of pathways (which corresponded to activation or deletion) in Dataset1. We assessed the concordance between the predicted probabilities of the pathway sign and the true sign with the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operator characteristic (ROC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bradley, 1997</xref>). The strongest predictor of each module according to the AUCs in Dataset1 was evaluated on Dataset2 for validation; significance of AUCs was calculated according to Noether for binary outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Pencina and D'Agostino, 2004</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Associations to clinical factors</title><p>Associations to OS were assessed by calculating the mean concordance-index (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Harrell et al., 1982</xref>) of all features in a module univariately using the ‘survcomp’ package in Bioconductor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Schröder et al., 2011</xref>), and by validating this statistic with repeated random permutation tests (N = 1000). Similarly, associations to stage and histology were assessed by the mean of Kruskal-Wallis chi square statistics and permutation tests. As clinical information was not part of the module identification process, a meta-analysis of the results in Dataset1 and Dataset2 was conducted to account for sample size differences and other dataset specific variations. For this, a Fisher Z-transformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Whitlock, 2005</xref>) of the independent p-values in both datasets was employed for every module with weights equal to the respective sample sizes in Dataset1 and Dataset2.</p><p>We tested additive prognostic effects of integrating radiomic, gene expression, and clinical data by combining in a Cox proportional-hazards model the predictions of (I) a clinical Cox model with stage and histology, (II) an NSCLC OS gene signature, and (III) an NSCLC OS radiomic signature.

We developed this novel radiomic signature using a supervised feature selection algorithm followed by a stepwise Cox regression approach on Dataset1: First, we employed the minimum-redundancy maximum-relevance (mRMR) algorithm implemented in the ‘mRMRe’ R package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">De Jay et al., 2013</xref>) on all radiomic features with respect to OS to select a non-redundant, highly informative ranked set of complementary features. Next, we trained Cox models incrementally, adding features starting by the highest ranked feature. We performed repeated random cross-validation (N = 1,000) to measure the performance of each model, and retained the model with the highest mean CI. Finally, these fitted models were tested on Dataset2 for validation.</p><p>All statistical analyses were carried out using the R software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">R Development Core Team, 2013</xref>) version 3.1.0 on a Linux operating system.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Aviv Regev (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Trever Bivona (Reviewer #1) who served as Guest Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: James O'Connor (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This study presents of series of medical imaging based findings that link radiographic tumor features to clinical and molecular features in lung cancer (via radiomics). This radiomic approach was used in combination with clinical and genetic characteristics of the tumors to generate prognostic assessments, with improved performance. Overall, this study presents interesting insights and suggests the utility of radiomics for informing the understanding of the pathogenesis of lung cancer.</p><p>Several issues should be addressed to confirm the validity and clarity of the data presented and better link the findings to the current molecular state of the lung cancer field.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The cohort analyzed by the authors is mostly early stage lung cancer. Were any stage IIIB or IV tumors included? This stage bias should be noted in the text and the findings contextualized accordingly.</p><p>2) It is important to at least annotate the tumors studied for major driver mutations in lung cancer (e.g. mutant EGFR, mutant KRAS, ALK gene rearrangements, mutant BRAF, mutant NF1, TP53, and so on). Associating radiomic features with these genotypes that direct clinical management would greatly enhance the relevance and impact of the current study.</p><p>3) There should be better molecular validation by biomarker staining in the tumor tissue of the gene sets that are used to score different molecular phenotypes. As it stands, it is unclear how and why the gene sets were selected for classification of the tumors and whether such in silico based classification translates into the human tissue in a meaningful way at the protein level (of key pathway biomarkers). An example is to perform RelA IHC to validate the NFkB finding in the relevant tumors.</p><p>4) Were the 5 or so radiomic values &quot;aggregated&quot; into a single index per tumor to perform the clustering analysis with the gene set signature? If not, more elaboration as to how the clustering analysis was done would be very helpful.</p><p>5) Please clarify the purpose and message of the network presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>. First, what does it mean for a module to correlate with the respective clinical feature. For instance, are tumors in modules 2, 9, and 12 derived from patients with a lower OS compared to the rest of the cohort? If so, perhaps the authors could comment on the importance of defining this, either in the development of their methodology or to clinical decision making. Moreover, could the authors elaborate as to why some modules do not correlate with any clinical feature.</p><p>6) It is appreciated that the modules were verified with an additional patient data set independent of the discovery data set, but this study begs for validation of pathway activation in some of the tissues directly using immunohistochemistry. Modules 4, 6, and 8 seem like low hanging fruit given the enrichment of well characterized signaling pathways with an abundance of markers of pathway activation for IHC.</p><p>7) Related to point #6, is it not troubling that the IHC for CD3 did not appear to agree with the prediction of high or low immune response for modules 2, 9, and 12?</p><p>8) Can the authors elaborate on the clinical significance of developing a prognostic marker for a cancer that is overall highly aggressive? How will the prognostic power of the combination of R + G + C impact clinical decision making?</p><p>9) What is the rationale for extending the 440 features in the previous Nat Commun study to 636 features? Please comment on this specific point for this study, but also for the subsequent translation of the radiomics idea could the authors discuss how to move from deriving and testing one or another 'radiomic signature' to deciding on a final signature and then locking this down, for future application. Is this approach planned, would it be tumor-therapy specific etc.? Some discussion of this is important in biomarker translation. The imaging biomarker roadmap in Nat Rev Clin Oncol 2017 should be cited in this regard.</p><p>10) Since this study has several positives (use of test-validation, multisite data, advanced tailored statistics, use of pathology and outcome data etc.) it would be important to a) state how this study conforms with several of the roadmap recommendations and b) explicitly highlight how the biomarker = radiomics signature family (the one here is different from that in the previous paper in Nat Commun) has been advanced in this study down the biological/clinical validation pathway. This is alluded to, to some extent in the eighth paragraph of the Discussion, but this point could be strengthened.</p><p>11) The section 'Immunohistochemical investigation of radiomic immune response assessment' seems less convincing that the data from other sections as there is N=15. Is this justified as an analysis based on the very small N? Please justify the inclusion of these data for this section.</p><p>12) Many of the statistical associations are strong. But it is difficult to understand how the radiomic metrics relate to biological pathways that clearly measure something quite different (scale, biology). Is this really going to convince oncologists that a radiomic metric (e.g. a gray scale texture) is an adequate measure of say cell cycling? Does this seem plausible and if not then is that a translational barrier? Please discuss this a bit more in the text, as I think this will be seized upon by readers over the next few years.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23421.027</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>[…] Several issues should be addressed to confirm the validity and clarity of the data presented and better link the findings to the current molecular state of the lung cancer field.</italic></p><p>In addition to the responses below, to better reflect the specific focus of study we would like to change the current title of the manuscript into: “Defining the biologic basis of radiomic phenotypes in lung cancer”.</p><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic></p><p><italic>1) The cohort analyzed by the authors is mostly early stage lung cancer. Were any stage IIIB or IV tumors included? This stage bias should be noted in the text and the findings contextualized accordingly.</italic></p><p>We thank the reviewer for the time in critically assessing our study. Indeed, our study cohorts contain mainly early stage tumors, although several stage IIIB and IV cases are included; specifically 26 in the discovery cohort. In the radiomic analysis of histology, these cases were grouped into “Other” to avoid imbalanced outcome groups. In our revised manuscript, we emphasized this important point in the Materials and methods and Discussion. Furthermore, a relevant issue with these late stage tumors is that they are difficult to segment, and are thus a challenge for radiomics of lung lesions. The approach that is currently being taken is to extract radiomic features from metastatic sites, e.g. liver, lymph nodes, adrenals; but this is quite distinct from the focus of the current work. Our text has now also been updated to reflect this, as well.</p><p><italic>2) It is important to at least annotate the tumors studied for major driver mutations in lung cancer (e.g. mutant EGFR, mutant KRAS, ALK gene rearrangements, mutant BRAF, mutant NF1, TP53, and so on). Associating radiomic features with these genotypes that direct clinical management would greatly enhance the relevance and impact of the current study.</italic></p><p>We thank the referee for this insightful comment. We agree that associating radiomic features with widely established lung driver mutations would enhance our study. Therefore, we retrospectively queried our institutional database to include all available sequencing records. For our revised manuscript, we can now present additional data on 60 patients whose primary tumors were profiled with Sanger sequencing. For these patients we analyzed how the representative features of every module of our analysis predict mutant EGFR, KRAS, and TP53. We found strong predictive value for EGFR and KRAS, but only moderate predictive value for TP53. In particular, features that predicted EGFR and KRAS were first-order statistics of the voxel intensities and textural features, complementing our previous associations to cell cycling and proliferation pathways. We included these new results in the revised manuscript. The mutation status of the current cohort will be made available in the revised text and shared publicly with all other data. Furthermore, we referenced prior work from our research groups and others wherein radiomic features were associated with EGFR, KRAS, and other lung cancer driving mutations according to the popular model of clonal evolution.</p><p><italic>3) There should be better molecular validation by biomarker staining in the tumor tissue of the gene sets that are used to score different molecular phenotypes. As it stands, it is unclear how and why the gene sets were selected for classification of the tumors and whether such in silico based classification translates into the human tissue in a meaningful way at the protein level (of key pathway biomarkers). An example is to perform RelA IHC to validate the NFkB finding in the relevant tumors.</italic></p><p>We would like to thank the referee for the apparent interest in our study. Indeed, additional molecular validation of our computationally derived and, on a large and independent cohort, statistically validated results is a positive suggestion. Hence, we selected tumors that were predicted to have the highest and lowest activation of NFkB by shape sphericity, the representative feature of module 10 that was also associated with NFkB activation. Following the suggestion from the reviewer we stained available tissue from these tumors for RelA and assessed the enrichment by an experienced pathologist (author Dr. MB, MD, PhD). Comparison of radiomic and pathological assessment revealed that radiomic feature values were higher for those cases that were also pathologically scored to be relatively higher enriched for RelA; according to a Wilcoxon rank sum test this was at a significance level of <italic>p</italic> = 0.06. We added these new results to our revised manuscript and included a corresponding discussion of these updates.</p><p><italic>4) Were the 5 or so radiomic values &quot;aggregated&quot; into a single index per tumor to perform the clustering analysis with the gene set signature? If not, more elaboration as to how the clustering analysis was done would be very helpful.</italic></p><p>We thank the referee for this request and apologize if clarity in our Materials and methods was limited. We leveraged a pre-ranked gene-set enrichment analysis using a correlation rank between every radiomic feature and the expression of every gene. This allowed us to calculate a normalized enrichment score for every feature and gene set (i.e., a large matrix), which was the basis for our clustering analysis. In this sense, indeed, we associate every feature with every gene set independently. We updated the text in our revised manuscript to increase clarity of this point.</p><p><italic>5) Please clarify the purpose and message of the network presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>. First, what does it mean for a module to correlate with the respective clinical feature. For instance, are tumors in modules 2, 9, and 12 derived from patients with a lower OS compared to the rest of the cohort? If so, perhaps the authors could comment on the importance of defining this, either in the development of their methodology or to clinical decision making. Moreover, could the authors elaborate as to why some modules do not correlate with any clinical feature.</italic></p><p>We appreciate and thank for the detailed review of our manuscript. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> summarizes the clinical associations that we found and validated for every module. Specifically, every module describes an association of a cluster of radiomic features and molecular pathways. We tested whether the radiomic features of a module were also associated with overall survival, tumor stage, and histology by C-index and chi-square based statistics as described in our Materials and methods in section “Associations to clinical factors.” With this imaging-based (i.e., genomic-independent) analysis we aimed at verifying whether radiomic-clinical associations of a module also follow the radiomic-genomic associations of that module that are supported by current lung cancer biological literature and hence contribute in closing the gaps of understanding the ‘association-triangle’ of imaging, genomics, and clinical factors. We updated our Discussion regarding why certain modules may not been associated to certain clinical factors.</p><p><italic>6) It is appreciated that the modules were verified with an additional patient data set independent of the discovery data set, but this study begs for validation of pathway activation in some of the tissues directly using immunohistochemistry. Modules 4, 6, and 8 seem like low hanging fruit given the enrichment of well characterized signaling pathways with an abundance of markers of pathway activation for IHC.</italic></p><p>We thank this reviewer for noting our stringent statistical study design and for suggesting additional staining experiments, which is in line with similar comments. To address these comments, we present additional data on immunohistochemical staining for RelA (a p65 NKkB subunit) to validate radiomic associations with inflammation, and also present additional data on staining for CD3 to validate radiomic associations to immune response. We kindly refer to the corresponding sections of our revised manuscript and hope that the significance of these updates is noted.</p><p><italic>7) Related to point #6, is it not troubling that the IHC for CD3 did not appear to agree with the prediction of high or low immune response for modules 2, 9, and 12?</italic></p><p>We would like to thank the referee for taking time to assess the results of our manuscript, and apologize for any confusion. We did find pathological agreement for the association with immune response in modules 2, 9, and 12. We used modules 2, 9, and 12 to select the radiomic feature that representing the immune response score. We used this score to select cases that this radiomic feature predicted to show relatively high or low immune response. For these cases, we performed immunohistochemical staining for CD3 (as surrogate for immune response) and found that the pathological assessment of immune response agreed with the radiomic score in the majority of stained cases. In our revised manuscript, we present additional data on this to increase statistical power of our analysis. We updated the revised manuscript to highlight this important point.</p><p><italic>8) Can the authors elaborate on the clinical significance of developing a prognostic marker for a cancer that is overall highly aggressive? How will the prognostic power of the combination of R + G + C impact clinical decision making?</italic></p><p>According to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN), an alliance of cancer centers in the United States, there are a number of treatment options for early stage cancers including, inter alia: adjuvant CTx, chemorads, immune Tx with and without RTx/CTx combinations. We propose that radiomic biomarkers can be used within a decision support system when planning therapy. Realizing that therapy choice is made between clinical oncologist and patient preference, more aggressive radiomic signatures may lead to more aggressive therapies. The superior prognostic power of combining radiomics with genomics and clinical data has long been hypothesized, but up to now no study rigorously investigated whether this holds true. The advantages of combining these inherently different data types seem obvious: while genomics quantifies molecular events happening in tumors, radiomics is able to provide a phenotypic quantification. The hope for clinical decision making is that these data types complement each other in prognostication. We included additional elaboration in the discussion on these fundamental points of our and other's work. At this time, we are not proposing that this be used in a CADx system. This important point was added to the Discussion.</p><p><italic>9) What is the rationale for extending the 440 features in the previous Nat Commun study to 636 features? Please comment on this specific point for this study, but also for the subsequent translation of the radiomics idea could the authors discuss how to move from deriving and testing one or another 'radiomic signature' to deciding on a final signature and then locking this down, for future application. Is this approach planned, would it be tumor-therapy specific etc.? Some discussion of this is important in biomarker translation. The imaging biomarker roadmap in Nat Rev Clin Oncol 2017 should be cited in this regard.</italic></p><p>We thank the referee for commenting on the various feature sets presented in current radiomic research and their translational impact. With regard to the referenced feature set from our previous study published 2014 in Nature Communications, we simply updated the 2014 feature set with a novel textural matrix (i.e., the gray-level size-zone matrix) to derive new radiomic texture features from. Including this additional matrix in our feature extraction resulted in a total of 636 features; we describe this in more detail in our Materials and methods section and provide the mathematical derivation of those new features in the supplemental material. Generally, radiomics is a dynamic field in which feature sets continue to be enhanced which is a major focus of investigation by a number of groups internationally. What we show is that a parsimonious set derived from a large set of features can be used to improve prognostic value, but indeed in near-future studies we aim at fixing a radiomic signature for definitive clinical evaluation. We believe that the most reasonable way to conduct this would be to define such a radiomic signature from a research group, fix its weights at later stages, and have another, independent group evaluate its prognostic performance whilst having an institutional ethics committee oversee and verify double-blindness of this procedure. Unlike biological biomarkers, technical validation can occur at later stages; however, cost-effectiveness is a crucial track in translation that needs to be considered early on. We include an elaborate discussion including the suggested reference to reflect on all of these important points.</p><p><italic>10) Since this study has several positives (use of test-validation, multisite data, advanced tailored statistics, use of pathology and outcome data etc.) it would be important to a) state how this study conforms with several of the roadmap recommendations and b) explicitly highlight how the biomarker = radiomics signature family (the one here is different from that in the previous paper in Nat Commun) has been advanced in this study down the biological/clinical validation pathway. This is alluded to, to some extent in the eighth paragraph of the Discussion, but this point could be strengthened.</italic></p><p>We thank the referee for this very positive feedback in correctly noting the multiple efforts we undertook to provide a stringent analysis. We agree that in this regard it would be valuable to emphasize how our study can advance the urgently needed development for accurate and robust imaging biomarkers in clinical settings. We built on the signature that we proposed in the referenced study (Aerts et al., Nature Communications 2014) by investigating the prognostic results of combining features of this signature with genetic and clinical data. In addition to this, we developed a novel signature to investigate whether the results of the previous signature hold for further signatures, as well. To convey this message more clearly, we extended the corresponding paragraphs with more elaborate discussions, including future perspectives.</p><p><italic>11) The section 'Immunohistochemical investigation of radiomic immune response assessment' seems less convincing that the data from other sections as there is N=15. Is this justified as an analysis based on the very small N? Please justify the inclusion of these data for this section.</italic></p><p>We thank the reviewer for the critical assessment of our study. IHC of patient derived tissue samples is limited in clinical practice by availability of frozen tissue. Therefore, we chose a manageable, yet statistically reasonable sample size; initially, we selected N=20 for 10 samples of high radiomic expression and 10 for low radiomic expression. From these N=20 samples, N=15 samples that contained tumor tissue were located by the institutional tissue core, which still provided us with a sufficiently large sample size to calculate a valid <italic>p</italic>-value with a standard Fisher’s exact test. As the <italic>p</italic>-value is a function of the sample size, insufficient sample size would be reflected in this <italic>p</italic>-value.</p><p>We agree, however, that even more efforts in analyzing stained tissue would greatly enhance our study. We therefore performed additional staining for CD3 as described in the Materials and methods and now aimed at doubling our initial sample size in the resubmitted manuscript. We also updated our statistical method to a more quantitative one. Indeed, with these updates we observe a considerable increase in statistical power from <italic>p</italic> = 0.13 to <italic>p</italic> = 0.008. We include these updated results in the revised manuscript with a corresponding discussion of the results and methods (including potential sample size limitations), and thank the reviewers for suggesting additional stains of relevant tumors.</p><p><italic>12) Many of the statistical associations are strong. But it is difficult to understand how the radiomic metrics relate to biological pathways that clearly measure something quite different (scale, biology). Is this really going to convince oncologists that a radiomic metric (e.g. a gray scale texture) is an adequate measure of say cell cycling? Does this seem plausible and if not then is that a translational barrier? Please discuss this a bit more in the text, as I think this will be seized upon by readers over the next few years.</italic></p><p>We would like to thank the referee for this positive remark and agree that this important point will have relevance for readers of our study over the next years, as our study for the first time directly addresses the numerous requests from the oncological community to gain better biological rationale of radiomics in general. Indeed, we do not propose to directly replace biospecimen-derived diagnostics with radiomic approaches, but rather augment and complement them in cases where biological measurements are not feasible, such as in situations where frequent treatment monitoring is essential. Furthermore, we aim at contributing to better understanding what the biological basis for the various prognostic associations that have been described for radiomic features over past couple of years. To address this challenging task, we implemented a broad genome-wide analysis with a stringent and thorough statistical design, including external validation of putative associations. We revised our Discussion to reflect the translational impact of our study more clearly.</p></body></sub-article></article>
