Transport-cycle models to describe and explain this unusual mechanism have been proposed based on known CLC structures. While the proposed models harmonize with many experimental findings, gaps and inconsistencies in our understanding have remained. One limitation has been that global conformational change – which occurs in all conventional transporter mechanisms – has not been observed in any high-resolution structure. Here, we describe the 2.6 Å structure of a CLC mutant designed to mimic the fully H<sup>+</sup>-loaded transporter. This structure reveals a global conformational change to improve accessibility for the Cl<sup>–</sup> substrate from the extracellular side and new conformations for two key glutamate residues. Together with DEER measurements, MD simulations, and functional studies, this new structure provides evidence for a unified model of H<sup>+</sup>/Cl<sup>–</sup> transport that reconciles existing data on all CLC-type proteins.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cells are shielded from harmful molecules and other threats by a thin, flexible layer called the membrane. However, this barrier also prevents chloride, sodium, protons and other ions from moving in or out of the cell. Channels and transporters are two types of membrane proteins that form passageways for these charged particles.</p><p>Channels let ions flow freely from one side of the membrane to the other. To do so, these proteins change their three-dimensional shape to open or close as needed. On the other hand, transporters actively pump ions across the membrane to allow the charged particles to accumulate on one side. The shape changes needed for that type of movement are different: the transporters have to open a passageway on one side of the membrane while closing it on the other side, alternating openings to one side or the other.</p><p>In general, channels and transporters are not related to each other, but one exception is a group called CLCs proteins. Present in many organisms, this family contains a mixture of channels and transporters. For example, humans have nine CLC proteins: four are channels that allow chloride ions in and out, and five are ‘exchange transporters’ that make protons and chloride ions cross the membrane in opposite directions. These proteins let one type of charged particle move freely across the membrane, which generates energy that the transporter then uses to actively pump the other ion in the direction needed by the cell. Yet, the exact three-dimensional changes required for CLC transporters and channels to perform their roles are still unknown.</p><p>To investigate this question, Chavan, Cheng et al. harnessed a technique called X-ray crystallography, which allows scientists to look at biological molecules at the level of the atom. This was paired with other methods to examine a CLC mutant that adopts the shape of a normal CLC transporter when it is loaded with a proton. The experiments revealed how various elements in the transporter move relative to each other to adopt a structure that allows protons and chloride ions to enter the protein from opposite sides of the membrane, using separate pathways. While obtained on a bacterial CLC, these results can be applied to other CLC channels and transporters (including those in humans), shedding light on how this family transports charged particles across membranes.</p><p>From bone diseases to certain types of seizures, many human conditions are associated with poorly functioning CLCs. Understanding the way these structures change their shapes to perform their roles could help to design new therapies for these health problems.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>antiporter</kwd><kwd>membrane exchanger</kwd><kwd>crystallography</kwd><kwd>MD simulations</kwd><kwd>DEER spectroscopy</kwd><kwd>chloride</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM113195</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mchaourab</surname><given-names>Hassane S</given-names></name><name><surname>Tajkhorshid</surname><given-names>Emad</given-names></name><name><surname>Maduke</surname><given-names>Merritt</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000968</institution-id><institution>American Heart Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>17POST33670553</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chavan</surname><given-names>Tanmay S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000015</institution-id><institution>U.S. Department of Energy</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DE-AC02-06CH11357</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Koehl</surname><given-names>Antoine</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P41GM103393</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mathews</surname><given-names>Irimpan I</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005302</institution-id><institution>University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Blue Waters at National Center for Supercomputing Applications</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jiang</surname><given-names>Tao</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MCA06N060</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tajkhorshid</surname><given-names>Emad</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P41-GM104601</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tajkhorshid</surname><given-names>Emad</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Crystallography together with electron-resonance spectroscopy, molecular-dynamics simulations, and transport measurements reveal the molecular details of protein conformational change, and how this change contributes to function in a CLC-type chloride/proton exchanger.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>CLC transporter proteins are present in intracellular compartments throughout our bodies – in our hearts, brains, kidneys, livers, muscles, and guts – where they catalyze coupled exchange of chloride (Cl<sup>–</sup>) for protons (H<sup>+</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Jentsch and Pusch, 2018</xref>).

Like all CLC proteins, CLC-ec1 is a homodimer in which each subunit contains an independent anion-permeation pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Miller and White, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Ludewig et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Middleton et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dutzler et al., 2002</xref>). Studies of CLC-ec1 revealed the importance of two key glutamate residues – ‘Glu<sub>ex</sub>’ and ‘Glu<sub>in</sub>’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) in the transport mechanism. Glu<sub>ex</sub> is positioned at the extracellular entryway to the Cl<sup>–</sup>-permeation pathway, where it acts both as a ‘gate’ for the transport of Cl<sup>–</sup> and as a participant in the transport of H<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dutzler et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Accardi and Miller, 2004</xref>).

The ‘middle’ conformation is observed in the WT CLC-ec1 structure, where Glu<sub>ex</sub> occupies the extracellular anion-binding site, ‘S<sub>ext</sub>’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dutzler et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The ‘up’ conformation is seen when Glu<sub>ex</sub> is mutated to Gln, mimicking protonation of Glu<sub>ex</sub>; here, the side chain moves upward and away from the permeation pathway, allowing a Cl<sup>–</sup> ion to bind at S<sub>ext</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dutzler et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The ‘down’ conformation is seen in the eukaryotic cmCLC structure, where Glu<sub>ex</sub> plunges downwards into the central anion-binding site, ‘S<sub>cen</sub>’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Feng et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The intracellular anion-binding site, ‘S<sub>int</sub>’, is a low-affinity site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Picollo et al., 2009</xref>) and is not depicted.</p><p>The rotation of the Glu<sub>ex</sub> side chain is the only conformational change that has been detected crystallographically in the CLC transporters. A central question, therefore, is whether and how other protein conformational changes contribute to the CLC transport mechanism. In previous work, we used a spectroscopic approach to evaluate conformational changes in CLC-ec1, and we found that raising [H<sup>+</sup>] (to protonate Glu<sub>ex</sub>) caused conformational change in regions of the protein outside of the permeation pathway, up to ~20 Å away from Glu<sub>ex</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Elvington et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abraham et al., 2015</xref>). Using a combination of biochemical crosslinking, double electron-electron resonance (DEER) spectroscopy, functional assays, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we concluded that this H<sup>+</sup>-induced conformational state represents an ‘outward-facing open’ state, an intermediate in the transport cycle that facilitates anion transport to and from the extracellular side (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Khantwal et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Here, to obtain a high-resolution structure of the H<sup>+</sup>-bound conformational state, we crystallized a triple mutant, ‘QQQ’, in which glutamines replace three glutamates: Glu<sub>ex</sub>, Glu<sub>in</sub>, and E113. E113 is located within hydrogen bonding distance of Glu<sub>in</sub> and is computationally predicted to be protonated at neutral pH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Faraldo-Gómez and Roux, 2004</xref>). In contrast to the single-point mutants of Glu<sub>in</sub> and Glu<sub>ex</sub>, which reveal either no conformational change (Gln<sub>in</sub>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Accardi et al., 2005</xref>) or only a simple side-chain rotation (Gln<sub>ex</sub>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dutzler et al., 2003</xref>), the QQQ mutant structure reveals global conformational change, which generates the expected opening of the extracellular permeation pathway. Unexpectedly, this structure additionally reveals new side-chain conformations for both Gln<sub>ex</sub> and Gln<sub>in</sub>. Based on this new structure, together with MD simulations, DEER spectroscopy, and functional studies, we propose an updated framework for modeling the CLC transport cycle.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>New conformation of Glu<sub>ex</sub></title><p>The QQQ mutant (E148Q/E203Q/E113Q) was crystallized in the lipidic cubic phase, without any antibody Fab fragment. The structure, determined at 2.6 Å resolution (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>), reveals an unanticipated change in the conformation of the mutated Glu<sub>ex</sub> residue, Q148 (Gln<sub>ex</sub>). Instead of occupying the ‘up’ position, as seen in the structure of the E148Q protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dutzler et al., 2003</xref>), the sidechain has moved away from the permeation pathway and into the hydrophobic core of the protein, a conformation we designate as ‘out’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>).

In contrast, to facilitate ion pumping, secondary active transporters must have permeation pathways that are alternately exposed to the extracellular or intracellular sides of the membrane, but never to both simultaneously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jardetzky, 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Tanford, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Forrest et al., 2011</xref>). Since Glu<sub>ex</sub> in the ‘out’ position has only been observed in a channel structure (CLC-1) before now, it is prudent to question whether this positioning is compatible with an alternating access mechanism. We therefore examined the QQQ structure along the intracellular aspect of the permeation pathway. In WT CLC-ec1, Cl<sup>–</sup> permeation to and from the intracellular side is controlled by a constriction formed by conserved residues S107 and Y445, which is thought to act either as a kinetic barrier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Feng et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Feng et al., 2012</xref>) or as a gate that opens and closes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Accardi, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Basilio and Accardi, 2015</xref>).

On the other hand, if Cl<sup>–</sup> transport through E148Q and QQQ have the same rate-limiting step, then Cl<sup>–</sup> transport rates, like Cl<sup>–</sup> binding affinities, should be similar. Experimental measurements revealed that QQQ Cl<sup>–</sup> transport rates are ~2 fold faster than E148Q transport rates at pH 7.5, the pH at which the binding studies were performed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B,C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata1">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>), indicating that the two mutants have different rate-limiting steps. If this difference in transport rates is due to the wider extracellular Cl<sup>–</sup> entryway in QQQ compared to E148Q, then lowering the pH – to allow E148Q to adopt the QQQ-like (outward-facing open) conformation – should increase the Cl<sup>–</sup> transport rate.

Within each repeat of the QQQ structure, significant changes occur compared to the equivalent repeat in WT CLC-ec1, particularly in Helices H and Q (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). However, the repeats have not interconverted (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata2">Figure 5—source data 2</xref>). In addition to the changes within each repeat domain, there are substantial changes between the two repeats (relative to one another), most strikingly between Helices G-I of Repeat 1 and Helices J-N of Repeat 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>).</p><p>Within Repeat 2, the major change occurs at Helices O-Q. This region is of mechanistic interest because a cross-link between residue 399 on Helix O and 432 on Helix Q is known to inhibit transport through coupling to the inner gate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Basilio et al., 2014</xref>). Interestingly, although we find that Helices O and Q move with respect to the rest of Repeat 2, residues 399 and 432 do not change position with respect to one another and do not couple to movement at the inner gate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3A–D</xref>). Thus, our data suggest that the Helix-O motions involved in transition to the outward-facing state are distinct from those postulated to facilitate inner-gate opening. While the mechanistic details linking Helix O-Q movements between outward- and inward-facing states are currently unknown, it is of interest to note that many disease-causing mutations occur in this segment, in both CLC channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Saviane et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Pusch, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bignon et al., 2020</xref>) and transporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Lourdel et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Veeramah et al., 2013</xref>).

This segment also changes position relative to Repeat 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Helix H is of mechanistic interest because it contains the Glu<sub>in</sub> residue that is thought to transfer H<sup>+</sup> from the intracellular solution to Glu<sub>ex</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Accardi et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Accardi, 2015</xref>) and because Helix H is one of the most highly conserved regions of the protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dutzler et al., 2002</xref>).

Overall, the total number of modeled waters associated with the protein dimer in each structure is 110 (QQQ), 167 (1ots), and 52 (4ene).

When working with a mutant, however, one always wonders whether any conformational change observed is relevant to the WT protein. We therefore used DEER spectroscopy to evaluate conformational change in WT CLC-ec1. DEER spectroscopy is advantageous because it can evaluate conformational change by site-directed spin labeling, without the constraints of crystallization. Accurate distance distributions can be obtained for spin labels separated by ~20–70 Å (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Jeschke, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Mishra et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Stein et al., 2015</xref>). Since CLC-ec1 is a homodimer ~100 Å in diameter, a simple labeling strategy with one spin label per subunit can provide a sample with optimally spaced probes for distance-change measurements. For example, the extracellular sides of Helices N and O (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,C</xref>) are separated by ~50 and 35 Å respectively from their correlates in the other subunit. To test the hypothesis that these helices move, we generated WT CLC-ec1 (cysteine-less background) with spin labels at positions 373, 374 (Helix N) and 385 (Helix O) and performed DEER measurements under two conditions, pH 7.5 and pH 4.5. The rationale for this experimental strategy is that pH 4.5 will promote protonation of Glu<sub>ex</sub> and Glu<sub>in</sub>, thus favoring a global conformation comparable to that observed in the QQQ structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>DEER spectroscopy reveals that the QQQ conformation is similar to WT CLC-ec1 at low pH.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Cartoon depiction of the hypothesis.

While we do see some water pathways occurring along the interfacial route, on a pathway that is lined by Gln<sub>in</sub>, these occur only rarely (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Importantly, the previous mutagenesis studies supporting the interfacial route are also concordant with the inner water pathway observed here. In the previous studies, mutations that add steric bulk at either E202 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lim et al., 2012</xref>) or the adjacent A404 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Han et al., 2014</xref>) were found to inhibit the H<sup>+</sup> branch of the CLC-ec1 transport cycle. The observation that all water pathways involve rotation of E202 away from its starting position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s3">Figure 8—figure supplement 3</xref>), can explain why bulky mutations at this position would interfere with H<sup>+</sup> transport.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Proton pumping without a titratable residue at the Glu<sub>in</sub> position</title><p>Glu<sub>in</sub> has long been modeled as a H<sup>+</sup>-transfer site in the CLC Cl<sup>–</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Accardi et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Miller, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Lim and Miller, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Basilio et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Accardi, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Khantwal et al., 2016</xref>). However, this modeling is contradicted by the observation that several CLC transporter homologs can pump H<sup>+</sup> with robust stoichiometry in the absence of a titratable residue at the Glu<sub>in</sub> position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Feng et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Phillips et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Stockbridge et al., 2012</xref>). In our analysis of water pathways in the MD simulations, we observed that these pathways are not always lined by the Gln<sub>in</sub> side chain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>). This finding strongly suggests that while Glu<sub>in</sub> <italic>facilitates</italic> water pathways, it is not required as a direct H<sup>+</sup>-transfer site. To test this hypothesis experimentally, we tested for Cl<sup>–</sup>-coupled H<sup>+</sup> pumping in mutants with non-titratable residues at the Glu<sub>in</sub> position. We designed the experiment with a large Cl<sup>–</sup> gradient and a small H<sup>+</sup> gradient, both favoring outward movement of the ions; thus, any H<sup>+</sup> transport into the vesicles must occur via Cl<sup>–</sup>-driven H<sup>+</sup> pumping, not leak (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>). With an Ala residue at the Glu<sub>in</sub> position (E203A), we observed clear H<sup>+</sup> pumping above the background signal; by comparison, in line with conventional modeling, the Glu<sub>ex</sub> mutant E148Q exhibited H<sup>+</sup> signals similar to control vesicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B,C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig9sdata1">Figure 9—source data 1</xref>). While the coupling stoichiometry of E203A is somewhat degraded compared to the WT protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D</xref>), the thermodynamic fact arising from this experiment is that H<sup>+</sup> pumping occurs with a non-titratable residue at Glu<sub>in</sub>.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Proton pumping by CLC-ec1 with neutralized Glu<sub>in</sub> (E203A).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Cartoon depiction of the H<sup>+</sup>/Cl<sup>–</sup> flux assay.

Of the 10 mutants tested, only the Glu<sub>in</sub> mutant E203Q completely abolished detectable H<sup>+</sup> transport. To directly compare to this original study, we evaluated E203Q in our assay. As with E203A, we found that E203Q can pump H<sup>+</sup>; however, its coupling stoichiometry is substantially more degraded (Cl<sup>–</sup>/H<sup>+</sup>~75, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig9sdata1">Figure 9—source data 1</xref>). Therefore, it is not too surprising that H<sup>+</sup> pumping was not detected in the original study. We also examined double mutants, missing titratable residues at both E203 and its hydrogen-bonding partner E113. When these positions are substituted with two alanines, or with the residues found in the cmCLC homolog (Thr and Lys), H<sup>+</sup> pumping is retained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref>). Thus, the conventional thinking of Glu<sub>in</sub> as a H<sup>+</sup>-transport site must be re-evaluated.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we aspired to determine the high-resolution structure of the CLC ‘outward-facing open’ conformational state. We approached this problem by using a triple mutant, QQQ, to mimic the conformation in which three key Glu residues are in the protonated state. In principle, it should be possible to obtain a similar structure with WT CLC-ec1 at low pH. Though a crystal structure from a low-pH well-solution was previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dutzler et al., 2002</xref>), the pH in the protein crystal may have been closer to that of the purification buffer (pH 7.5) if mixing was inefficient. In an attempt to definitively capture the low-pH state of WT CLC-ec1, we purified the protein at pH 4.0 and performed crystallization trials with well-solutions varying in pH from 3.4 to 5.6. Multiple crystallization attempts, including a grid screen search around reported conditions, varying the protein concentration from 10 mg/mL up to 50 mg/mL, were unsuccessful. In contrast, at pH 7.5–9.5 (the pH range typically used to crystallize CLC-ec1 proteins), we and others routinely obtain crystals with 10–20 mg/mL protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dutzler et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lim et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Khantwal et al., 2016</xref>). Given the challenges in crystallizing WT CLC-ec1 at low pH, the QQQ triple mutant presents a viable and appealing alternative approach to capture the desired outward-facing conformation.</p><p>Our conclusion that the QQQ mutant structure represents such an intermediate in the CLC transport mechanism is supported by several pieces of evidence. First, the WT protein under low-pH conditions (glutamate residues protonated), adopts a conformation different from the high-pH condition and similar to the conformation adopted by the QQQ mutant, as detected by DEER spectroscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Second, the movement of Helix P in the QQQ structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>) is consistent with the inhibition of Cl<sup>–</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> transport by Helix P cross-linking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Khantwal et al., 2016</xref>). Third, the measured transport rates in QQQ relative to E148Q match our expectation for faster Cl<sup>–</sup> transport, which was predicted based on the wider extracellular Cl<sup>–</sup> entryway in the QQQ structure compared to E148Q (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>). Fourth, the prediction based on MD simulations on the structure – that Glu<sub>in</sub> residue need not be titratable – was validated experimentally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Fifth, and perhaps most compellingly, the details observed in this conformational state reconcile a multitude of findings in the literature, as will be discussed below.</p><p>Our results demand that the paradigm of Glu<sub>in</sub> as a H<sup>+</sup>-transfer site be re-evaluated. While E203Q has a severely degraded coupling ratio, it retains the ability to pump H<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref>); thus, a titratable site at the Glu<sub>in</sub> position is not an absolute requirement for H<sup>+</sup> pumping. Moreover, the more robust coupling observed with E203A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>) is near that observed upon mutation of D278 and K131 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Accardi et al., 2005</xref>), titratable residues located on the opposite side of the Cl<sup>–</sup> permeation pathway relative to E203 (Glu<sub>in</sub>). Therefore, we conclude that the loss of coupling efficiency upon mutation of E203 (and D278 and K131) is not due to loss of a H<sup>+</sup>-transfer site but rather due to an effect on the efficiency of water-pathway formation or on some other aspect of the transport cycle. This conclusion brings clarity to previous results with Glu<sub>in</sub> mutants. In a study evaluating transport by 15 mutants with different residues substituted at Glu<sub>in</sub>, it was found that all titratable residues supported well coupled Cl<sup>–</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> transport, with a pH dependence identical to that of the WT protein even with Lys or His at the Glu<sub>in</sub> position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Lim and Miller, 2009</xref>). In that study, slow H<sup>+</sup> transport was observed with neutral substitutions at Glu<sub>in</sub>, but it was uncertain at that time whether this transport was a result of <italic>bona fide</italic> H<sup>+</sup> pumping or an experimental artifact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Lim and Miller, 2009</xref>). Interpreted in the light of our current results, this previous study also supports a model in which the Glu<sub>in</sub> residue contributes indirectly to the efficiency of the H<sup>+</sup> transport step.</p><p>Our observation of Glu<sub>ex</sub> in the ‘out’ position – observed previously only in a channel homolog – was unanticipated. However, in retrospect, it should not have been surprising. Compelling rationale for the close connection between CLC transporter and channel mechanisms was made over a decade ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Miller, 2006</xref>), with CLC channels proposed to operate as ‘broken’ transporters. Moreover, it has been shown that at least some channel homologs retain the ability to transport H<sup>+</sup> as part of the gating cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Lísal and Maduke, 2008</xref>). Therefore, it should not be surprising that CLC channels and transporters share a similar conformation for the Glu<sub>ex</sub> H<sup>+</sup>-transfer residue. Indeed, the Accardi and Berneche labs recently came to that conclusion based on predictions and tests of their MD simulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Leisle et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>The water pathways we identified connect Gln<sub>ex</sub> directly to the intracellular bulk water. The majority of these pathways (&gt;94%) are approximately parallel to the Cl<sup>–</sup>-permeation pathway and lined by residue Q113; a small but non-negligible fraction of pathways occurring along an ‘interfacial’ pathway, lined by residue E202 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>). Previously, it was concluded that the interfacial pathway likely predominates, based on the observation that mutation of E113 (or nearby polar residues) to non-polar residues inhibits H<sup>+</sup> transport by only 4–7 fold, while mutation of E202 inhibits H<sup>+</sup> transport up to 500-fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lim et al., 2012</xref>). These mutagenesis results, however, are also consistent with our MD simulation results, given that E202 conformational dynamics are critical to <italic>both</italic> water pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s3">Figure 8—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>A proposed unifying framework for the CLC transport mechanism</title><p>Based on the information gleaned from our study of the QQQ structural intermediate, we propose an updated framework for understanding 2:1 Cl<sup>–</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchange by CLC transporters. This updated model is inspired by four key findings. First, the outward-facing state has improved accessibility for Cl<sup>–</sup> to exchange to the extracellular side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). This state had been previously predicted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Khantwal et al., 2016</xref>) but is now seen in molecular detail. Second, the protonated Glu<sub>ex</sub> can adopt an ‘out’ conformation, within the hydrophobic core of the protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,E</xref>). This novel conformation allows us to eliminate a disconcerting step that was part of all previous models: movement of a protonated (neutral) Glu<sub>ex</sub> – in competition with Cl<sup>–</sup> – into the S<sub>cen</sub> anion-binding site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Miller and Nguitragool, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Feng et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Basilio et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Khantwal et al., 2016</xref>). Third, water pathways can connect Gln<sub>ex</sub> (and presumably Glu<sub>ex</sub>) directly to the intracellular solution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Finally, H<sup>+</sup> pumping does not require a titratable residue at Glu<sub>in</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Together, these findings allow us to propose a revised framework for the Cl<sup>–</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchange model, which maintains consistency with previous studies and resolves lingering problems.</p><p>In our revised model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A</xref>), the first three states are similar to those proposed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Miller and Nguitragool, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Feng et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Basilio et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Khantwal et al., 2016</xref>). State A reflects the structure seen in WT CLC-ec1, with Glu<sub>ex</sub> in the ‘middle’ conformation, occupying S<sub>ext</sub>, and a Cl<sup>–</sup> occupying S<sub>cen</sub>. Moving clockwise in the transport cycle, binding of Cl<sup>–</sup> from the intracellular side displaces Glu<sub>ex</sub> by a ‘knock-on’ mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Miller and Nguitragool, 2009</xref>), pushing it to the ‘up’ position and making it available for protonation from the extracellular side (State B). Protonation generates state C, which reflects the structure seen in E148Q CLC-ec1 where Gln<sub>ex</sub> mimics the protonated Glu<sub>ex</sub>. This sequence of Cl<sup>–</sup> binding and protonation is consistent with the experimental finding that Cl<sup>–</sup> and H<sup>+</sup> can bind simultaneously to the protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Picollo et al., 2012</xref>). Subsequently, a protein conformational change generates an ‘outward-facing open’ state (D). While this state had previously been postulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Khantwal et al., 2016</xref>), the QQQ structure presented here provides critical molecular details.</p><fig id="fig10" position="float"><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>Proposed new framework for the CLC Cl<sup>–</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> transport cycle.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Starting from state A, which reflects the structure seen in WT CLC-ec1, a single Cl<sup>–</sup> is bound, and Glu<sub>ex</sub> is in the ‘middle’ position. Glu<sub>in</sub> and E113 are in a H-bonded configuration, restricting water access to the center of the protein. Moving clockwise, binding of Cl<sup>–</sup> from the intracellular side displaces Glu<sub>ex</sub> by a ‘knock-on’ mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Miller and Nguitragool, 2009</xref>), making it available for protonation from the extracellular side (State B). This protonation step generates state C, which reflects the structure seen in E148Q CLC-ec1, with Glu<sub>ex</sub> in the ‘up’ conformation. A subsequent H<sup>+</sup>-induced conformational change generates a state D (captured in the QQQ mutant structure), which has an open extracellular vestibule and new positionings for Glu<sub>ex</sub> and Glu<sub>in</sub>. Conformational dynamics of Glu<sub>in</sub> allows water pathways to connect Glu<sub>ex</sub> directly to the intracellular bulk water, as in state E. From State E, deprotonation of Glu<sub>ex</sub> promotes its return to the anion pathway, in competition with Cl<sup>–</sup> (state F). Binding of Cl<sup>–</sup> from the intracellular side, coordinated with inner-gate opening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Basilio et al., 2014</xref>) (reflected by the dotted lines) generates the original state A. (<bold>B</bold>) The updated transport model is consistent with Cl<sup>–</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchange seen in transporters that do not have a titratable residue at the Glu<sub>in</sub> position, such as cmCLC. The upper panel shows a structural overlay of QQQ and cmCLC, highlighting the positions of the Thr and Lys residues occurring at the Glu<sub>in</sub> and E113 positions respectively. The lower panel is a cartoon depiction of the water pathway.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-53479-fig10-v2.tif"/></fig><p>State D involves a widening of the extracellular vestibule, which will facilitate Cl<sup>–</sup> binding from and release to the extracellular side. In the QQQ structure (our approximation of State D), the reorientation of Helix N results in subtle changes in Cl<sup>–</sup>-coordination at the S<sub>ext</sub> site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>), which suggests that binding at this site may be weakened, though we currently lack direct evidence for this conjecture. Regardless of the affinity at S<sub>ext</sub>, the opening of the extracellular permeation pathway in State D will promote Cl<sup>–</sup> exchange in both directions, which is essential to achieving reversible transport.</p><p>In addition to involving a widening of the extracellular vestibule, state D has the protonated Glu<sub>ex</sub> in an ‘out’ conformation and within ~5 Å of Glu<sub>in</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). At first glance, this positioning suggested to us that Glu<sub>in</sub> might be participating in an almost direct hand-off of H<sup>+</sup> to and from Glu<sub>ex</sub>, through an intervening water molecule. However, MD simulations revealed that Gln<sub>in</sub> is highly dynamic and most often is rotated away from its starting position, allowing the robust formation of water pathways from the intracellular bulk water directly to Gln<sub>ex</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>) (State E). Once such transfer occurs, the deprotonated Glu<sub>ex</sub> will be disfavored in the hydrophobic core, and it will compete with Cl<sup>–</sup> for the S<sub>cen</sub> anion-binding site, generating State F. Although this conformational state has not been observed crystallographically for CLC-ec1, computational studies found that Glu<sub>ex</sub> favors the S<sub>cen</sub> position when there are no Cl<sup>–</sup> ions bound in the pathway (as in State F), (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Picollo et al., 2012</xref>) and that the ‘down’ position is in general the preferred orientation for Glu<sub>ex</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Mayes et al., 2018</xref>). In addition, a recent structure of an Asp<sub>ex</sub> CLC-ec1 mutant supports that the carboxylate likes to reach down towards S<sub>cen</sub>, in a ‘midlow’ position, excluding the presence of Cl<sup>–</sup> at both S<sub>cen</sub> and S<sub>ext</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Park et al., 2019</xref>), as depicted in State F. From this state, binding of Cl<sup>–</sup> from the intracellular side (coordinated with inner-gate opening [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Basilio et al., 2014</xref>]) knocks Glu<sub>ex</sub> back up to S<sub>ext</sub>, generating the original state A. This transport cycle is fully reversible, allowing efficient transport in both directions, as is observed experimentally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Matulef and Maduke, 2005</xref>).</p><p>Our proposed updated transport model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A</xref>), in addition to retaining key features based on previous models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Miller and Nguitragool, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Feng et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Basilio et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Khantwal et al., 2016</xref>), unifies our picture of both CLC transporter and channel mechanisms. First, it is compatible with transporters that have non-titratable residues at Glu<sub>in</sub> and E113. Our simulations and experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figures 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9</xref>) lead to the conclusion that these residues play a key role in regulating water pathways rather than in direct hand-off of H<sup>+</sup>. From this perspective, the evolution of non-titratable residues in either (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Feng et al., 2010</xref>) or both (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Phillips et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Stockbridge et al., 2012</xref>) of these positions is perfectly sensible. In addition, previous mutagenesis experiments on CLC-ec1 and on mammalian transporters, which demonstrate a surprising tolerance for mutations at Glu<sub>in</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Zdebik et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Lim and Miller, 2009</xref>) now make more sense. Strikingly, the structural positioning of T269 in cmCLC, located at the Glu<sub>in</sub> sequence position, matches the structural positioning of Gln<sub>in</sub> in the QQQ mutant, such that side-chain dynamics could facilitate comparable water pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B</xref>).</p><p>The second unifying feature of our model is that it attests to Glu<sub>ex</sub> movements being conserved amongst every known type of CLC: 2:1 Cl<sup>–</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchangers, 1:1 F<sup>–</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchangers, and uncoupled Cl<sup>–</sup> channels. Previously, an ‘out’ position for Glu<sub>ex</sub> had been proposed to be essential to the mechanism of F<sup>–</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchangers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Last et al., 2018</xref>), which allow bacteria to resist fluoride toxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Stockbridge et al., 2012</xref>). However, such a conformation had not been directly observed, and it was postulated that it may be only relevant to the F<sup>–</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> branch of the CLC family. Structurally, Glu<sub>ex</sub> in the ‘out’ position has previously only been observed in a CLC channel. Thus, this conformation is a unifying feature of CLC channels and transporters. Moreover, this conclusion connotes that all CLC proteins act via a ‘windmill’ mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Last et al., 2018</xref>), in which the protonated Glu<sub>ex</sub> favors the core of the protein while the deprotonated Glu<sub>ex</sub> favors the anion-permeation pathway. Such a mechanism is preferable to previous ‘piston’-type mechanisms, with Glu<sub>ex</sub> moving up and down within the anion-permeation pathway, which required a protonated (neutral) Glu<sub>ex</sub> to compete with negatively charged Cl<sup>–</sup> ions.</p><p>Elements of the transport cycle require future experiments to elucidate details. Prominently, the nature of the inward-facing conformational state remains uncertain. In our model, we indicated inward-opening with dotted lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>, States F, A, B) to reflect this uncertainty. One proposal is that the inner-gate area remains static and transport works via a kinetic barrier to Cl<sup>–</sup> movement to and from the intracellular side (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Feng et al., 2010</xref>). Consistent with this proposal, multiscale kinetic modeling revealed that 2:1 Cl<sup>–</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchange can arise from kinetic coupling alone, without the need for large protein conformational change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Mayes et al., 2018</xref>). An alternative proposal is that CLCs visit a conformationally distinct inward-open state, based on the finding that transport activity is inhibited by cross-links that restrict motion of Helix O, located adjacent to the inner gate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Basilio et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Accardi, 2015</xref>). This putative inward-open state appears distinct from the conformational change observed in the QQQ mutant, as the inter-residue distances for the cross-link pairs (399/432 and 399/259) are unchanged in QQQ relative to WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3D</xref>). The details of the kinetic-barrier and conformational-change models, and the need for additional experiments on this aspect of transport, have been clearly and comprehensively discussed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Accardi, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Jentsch and Pusch, 2018</xref>).</p><p>Simulations of the QQQ conformational state with the glutamine residues reverted to the native, protonatable glutamate side chains will be needed for full understanding of how protonation and deprotonation of these residues affect the conformational dynamics of side chains and water pathways. In our current model, we propose that Glu<sub>in</sub> needs to be in the protonated (neutral) state to adopt the position that allows water pathways. This proposal appears harmonious with the hydrophobic nature of the protein core explored by the Gln<sub>in</sub> side chain and the fact that other CLC homologs use neutral residues at this position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Feng et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Phillips et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Stockbridge et al., 2012</xref>). In addition, the proposal is consistent with MD simulations that show the Glu<sub>ex</sub>/Glu<sub>in</sub> doubly protonated state is highly populated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Mayes et al., 2018</xref>) and can favor formation of water pathways under certain conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ko and Jo, 2010</xref>). Nevertheless, simulations with glutamate side chains in the QQQ conformational state, together with explicit evaluation of H<sup>+</sup> transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Wang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Duster et al., 2019</xref>), are needed to elaborate details of the H<sup>+</sup>-transfer steps.

To ensure complete removal of chloroform, the lipids were subsequently dissolved in pentane and dried under vacuum on a rotator, followed by further drying (5 min) under argon. The lipids were then solubilized at 20 mg/mL in buffer R (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>) with 35 mM CHAPS on the rotator for 1.5–2 hr. Purified protein (0.4–5 µg per mg lipids) samples or control buffer solution were then added to the prepared lipid-detergent mix and incubated for 10–20 min. Each protein or control reconstitution was divided into 2–4 samples for dialysis to remove detergent, with three buffer changes over 36–60 hr. Following dialysis, each sample was divided into 2–4 for replicate measurements. For experiments shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9</xref>, the replicate measurements were averaged to obtain a turnover rate value, and each of these averages was counted as one ‘n’.

For each assay, 60–120 µL of extruded sample were buffer-exchanged through 1.5- to 3.0 mL Sephadex G-50 Fine resin (GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL) columns equilibrated with buffer F (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). Exchange was accomplished by spinning the columns at ~1100 g for 90 s using a clinical centrifuge. The collected sample (80–200 µL) was then added to buffer F (500–600 µL) for flux-assay measurement. Extravesicular [Cl<sup>–</sup>] and [H<sup>+</sup>] were monitored using a Ag·AgCl electrode and a pH electrode, respectively. The electrodes were calibrated by known additions of KCl (in 20–136 nmol steps) and NaOH (in 10–50 nmol steps). Sustained ion transport by CLC-ec1 was initiated by addition of 1.7–3.4 µg/mL of valinomycin (from 0.5 mg/mL stock solution in ethanol). At the end of each transport experiment, detergent was added to release all Cl<sup>–</sup> from the vesicles. This step served as a quality check to confirm that a reasonable yield of vesicles was obtained following the spin-column step.

For the experiment, QQQ or E148Q protein samples were purified in buffer A. Titrant used in the experiment was 30 mM KCl in buffer A. The starting concentration of protein was 15–20 µM, in a volume of 1.5 mL. KCl (30 mM) was syringe-titrated into the sample cell in thirty 10 µL injections. The reference data were obtained by titrating buffer A into the protein-containing solution. Data were analyzed using Origin 7.0 software, with fitting using the ‘one set of sites’ model (keeping n = 1). The other thermodynamic parameters were obtained accordingly. Isethionate was chosen as the anion of choice for purification of proteins for the ITC experiments since the QQQ mutant shows aggregation upon purification in tartrate-containing solutions, which were previously used for ITC experiments with WT and mutant variants of CLC-ec1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Picollo et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Khantwal et al., 2016</xref>).

Determination of the spin concentration of the samples were obtained using Bruker’s built-in Spin Quantitation method. The spin concentration is divided by the protein concentration to obtain the labeling efficiency. DEER experiments were performed at 83 K on a Bruker 580 pulsed EPR spectrometer at Q-band frequency (33.5 GHz) using either a standard four-pulse protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Jeschke and Polyhach, 2007</xref>) or a five-pulse protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Borbat et al., 2013</xref>).

In the original five-pulse protocol paper the pure five-pulse signal was obtained by subtracting the artefact four-pulse data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Borbat et al., 2013</xref>). This method requires the ability to discern clearly the extent of the artefact. For the data in this study, we chose to simultaneously fit the four- and five-pulse data with a single Gaussian component in order to improve accuracy of subtracting the four-pulse artefact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). Confidence bands for the distance distributions were determined using the delta method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hustedt et al., 2018</xref>). The confidence bands define the 95% confidence interval that the best fit distance distribution will have. In the case of a Gaussian distribution, the shape of the confidence bands can be non-Gaussian.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Simulation system setup</title><p>The structure of the CLC-ec1 QQQ mutant crystallized in this work at 2.6 Å resolution was used as the starting structure for the MD simulation.

In our initial refinement of the QQQ structure, we had modeled water rather than Cl<sup>–</sup> at the S<sub>ext</sub> site, and therefore the simulation was performed without Cl<sup>–</sup> at this site. The pKa of each ionizable residue was estimated using PROPKA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Olsson et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Rostkowski et al., 2011</xref>), and the protonation states were assigned based on the pKa analysis at pH 4.5. Specifically, E111, E202, E235, and E414 were protonated in the simulation. All other side chains are in their default protonation state. Missing hydrogen atoms were added using PSFGEN in VMD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Humphrey et al., 1996</xref>). In addition to the crystallographically resolved water molecules, internal water molecules were placed in energetically favorable positions within the protein using DOWSER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Zhang and Hermans, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Morozenko et al., 2014</xref>), including in a bridging position between Gln<sub>ex</sub> and Gln<sub>in</sub>.

Periodic boundary conditions were used throughout the simulations. To evaluate long-range electrostatic interactions without truncation, the particle mesh Ewald method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Darden et al., 1993</xref>) was used.

Bonded interactions and short-range nonbonded interactions were calculated every two fs. Pairs of atoms whose interactions were evaluated were updated every 20 fs. A cutoff (13.5 Å) slightly longer than the nonbonded cutoff was applied to search for interacting atom pairs. Simulation systems were subjected to Langevin dynamics and the Nosé–Hoover Langevin piston method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Nosé, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hoover, 1985</xref>) to maintain constant pressure (p=1 atm) and temperature (T = 310 K) (NPT ensemble).</p><p>The simulation system was energy-minimized for 10,000 steps, followed by two stages of 1-ns relaxation. Both the protein and the Cl<sup>–</sup> ions in the binding sites were positionally restrained (k = 1 kcal⋅mol<sup>−1</sup>⋅Å<sup>−2</sup>) in the first 1-ns simulation to allow the membrane to relax. In the second 1-ns simulation, only the protein backbone and the bound Cl<sup>–</sup> ions were positionally restrained (k = 1 kcal⋅mol<sup>−1</sup>⋅Å<sup>−2</sup>) to allow the protein side chains to relax. Then a 600-ns equilibrium simulation was performed for the system without any restraint applied.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Analysis of water pathways</title><p>The water pathways between Q148 (Gln<sub>ex</sub>) and the intracellular bulk water was searched using a breadth-first algorithm. In Subunit 2 of the homodimer, Gln<sub>ex</sub> drifted up and away from the ‘out’ position at the beginning of the simulation (within five ns), and it did not return to the ‘out’ position during the simulation. In Subunit 1, Gln<sub>ex</sub> remained near the ‘out’ position for the first 400 ns; we focused our analysis of water pathways on this subunit. A distance-based criterion of 2.5 Å for the hydrogen bonds, which was found to be useful and inexpensive in computational terms in a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Matsumoto, 2007</xref>) was used to determine whether water molecules are connected through continuous hydrogen-bonded network. The water pathway with the smallest number of O-H bonds in each frame was considered as the shortest hydrogen-bonded path. The first water molecule in each water pathway is searched using a distance cutoff of 3.5 Å for any water oxygen atoms near the OE1/NE2 atoms of Q148. The water pathway is considered to reach the intracellular bulk once the oxygen atom of the newly found water molecules is at z &lt; −15 Å (membrane center is at z = 0).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Chris Miller and Martin Prieto for comments on the manuscript.

chloride/proton exchanger that represents a conformation that mimics the protonated state of three important glutamate residues. A series of complementary experimental and theoretical approaches paint an extended picture of the transport cycle and the new structure fills some of the predicted conformations as well as presents unexpected results. The authors have extensively revised their manuscript and improved the presentation with a better description and interpretation of results as well as a few new experiments. This is a fine contribution that increases our understanding of these remarkable transporters.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Structural characterization of an intermediate reveals a unified mechanism for the CLC Cl<sup>-</sup>/H + transport cycle&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Leon D Islas as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Richard Aldrich as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>In consultation, the reviewers agreed that the new structure represents a significant advance, but they also concluded that at this stage the structure, calculations and experiments do not support a unified mechanism of transport for CLC transporters. The reviewers request that the paper should focus only on characterization of the global structural changes observed and that the conclusion of a unified global transport mechanism be toned down. This also means that the title of the paper should be changed accordingly. Perhaps the paper can be a short communication instead of a full article.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>CLC chloride/proton exchangers are important physiological mediators of chloride movement. Several structures have been determined ant these, together with functional studies have painted a picture of the transport cycle. However, some parts of the cycle are lacking and he precise role of protonation/deprotonation of key acidic residues in not fully understood.</p><p>In this manuscript Chavan et al. report on a new structure of a mutant of the CLC-ec1 transporter. The structural data is also accompanied by spectroscopic (DEER) measurements of conformational changes induced by pH and chloride transport essays.</p><p>The authors show that the triple QQQ mutant might represent a new intermediate state, presumably corresponding to protonated external and internal glutamate residues. This structure additionally shows an enlarged entry pathway for extracellular chloride. Interestingly, DEER experiments show that in WT CLC, low pH induces a conformational change compatible with the QQQ structure.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>While the new structure is novel and interesting, it is unclear that the additional experiments and simulations pin down this newly proposed mechanism. For instance, while the QQQ construct may have increased water access, it does not move protons, and is in fact in a similar conformation to that found in the CLC-1 channel structure. It seems possible that the water access could pertain to uncoupled transport, or channel-like permeation, rather than a means of efficiently transferring the proton to/from Glu<sub>ex</sub>. Furthermore, the significant observation in this structure is the fact that the two ionizable GLUs are now 5.6 Å; away from one another – a point that appears to become irrelevant in the water accessibility mechanism. Therefore, the presentation of this new mechanism needs to be carefully considered. The following outlines some of the specific questions associated with this study:</p><p>1) It is unclear that the QQQ structure represents the protonated structure that pertains to the coupled transport in WT CLC-ec1. While experiments were carried out to show that proton pumping does not require ionization at E203, it still may be required for coupled and efficient transport. A previous study (Lim et al.) showed that three non-ionizable E203 mutants – G, S and Q – show low, near-baseline proton uptake that they considered to be inactive. They interpreted this as weak pumping due to &quot;direct, inefficient proton donation from solvent hydronium ion&quot;. This seems to also explain the functional results shown here, with weakly coupled 20:1 Cl<sup>-</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> transport. Furthermore, the MD simulations of the QQQ construct appear to support this, with a mechanism of increased water access allowing for uncoupled proton transfer directly to the external glutamate. Finally, the &quot;out&quot; conformation of Glu<sub>ex</sub> is also observed in the channel structure CLC-1, which exhibits uncoupled Cl<sup>-</sup> transport. Therefore, it is not clear whether the observations from uncoupled transport examples pertain to the tightly coupled transport mechanism in the wild-type transporter.</p><p>2) The results from the DEER measurements appear to be qualitative. The data from position 374 and 385 do not appear to agree with the expected distances from the crystal structures. Furthermore, the changes observed are much larger than the expected 2 A; changes. It raises the question of whether the protein is much more dynamic at low pH, and whether it is even possible to correlate the change in distributions to the expected changes in distance. It would be useful to analyze other positions, where no change is expected, for comparison.</p><p>3) It appears as though there are many changes in the protein structure, as depicted in the backbone RMSD analysis in Figure 3C. This is very interesting, because it has not been observed in any other CLC structure. Do the helices move independently, or does the inverted topology repeat move as rigid bodies? So far, only limited analysis of the structure has been presented. It would be useful to elaborate on this analysis, including adding a figure overlaying the two structures, showing all of the changes in the protein.</p><p>4) &quot;within kissing distance&quot; implies the sidechains are near contact. However, a 5.6 Å; measured distance means that these chemical groups are significantly separated. The description is misleading as it suggests that there is the possibility of the residues handing the proton off to one another. It is more likely that there would have to be a water coordinated between (as is observed in the MD simulation), or further conformational change required to bring these residues closer. This should be clarified throughout the manuscript, especially in the cartoons where it shows the two residues in contact.</p><p>5) What are the protonated states used in the MD simulations? This is not stated explicitly but is important for future reproducibility of the simulations.</p><p>6) Please provide trajectories, or snapshot PDB files of the final equilibrated configurations.</p><p>7) This is a high resolution structure for CLC-ec1. Are there crystallographic waters resolved inside the core of the protein? Or along the pathway? Some analysis of this would be useful to the field.</p><p>8) Water wires are mentioned throughout the analysis, however, the snapshots and simulation look like the water is disordered. Can you provide analysis on specific water wire geometries?</p><p>9) Subsection “A unifying model for the CLC transport mechanism”, third paragraph – you state that the change in the N helix results in changes in ion coordination that are predicted to decrease affinity of this site. However, the ITC measurements argue against this, since the QQQ construct has a higher affinity. Can you clarify this confusion?</p><p>10) The fact that the QQQ mutant represents a stable &quot;native&quot; conformation intermediate that can be captured in a X-ray crystal structure and mimics the H<sup>+</sup>-loaded state of the transporter strongly suggests that it would be possible to obtain the structure of the WT (or E148A) at low pH. This would be much more directly relevant for the conclusions of the authors than the results on a triple mutant.</p><p>Please add in the manuscript whether the attempt to crystallize the WT or E148A at low pH has been made and why it did not work.</p><p>11) A major difference of this structure compared to previous ones is the larger access to the permeation pathway on the extracellular side with removal of all the constrictions present in the WT and the E148A mutant. However, transport rate is only 2 times faster whereas one would expect a much larger functional effect. The data on the Cl<sup>-</sup> K<sub>d</sub> for E148A and QQQ are presented in Figure 3—figure supplement 2 where it is also explained that it was not possible to use Br- to distinguish the binding affinities at different sites. The K<sub>d</sub>s for the 2 mutants are very similar.</p><p>More importantly, the K<sub>d</sub> reported for E148A and the QQQ mutants are very similar. How can this be reconciled with a larger permeation pathway in the QQQ mutant but only a doubling of the transport rate? This casts some question marks on the extent to which the QQQ structure is representative of a native conformation intermediate.</p><p>The inconsistency between the similar K<sub>d</sub> and the doubling of the transport rate (in spite of a larger pore) between E148A and the QQQ mutant should be more clearly acknowledged and on this basis the speculative nature of the conclusions is explicitly stated.</p><p>12) In a previous study, Accardi et al. (JGP 2004) reported that the E203A mutation abolished proton transport in CLC-ec1. In the present manuscript the authors state that the double mutant E113A/E203A is able to transport protons. It should be clarified in the manuscript whether this difference is a result of the E113A mutation or if the result contrasts with the ones of Accardi et al. In this case the authors should indicate in the Discussion possible reasons for the discrepancy.</p><p>13) Is it possible that some of the residues observed to change conformation in the QQQ mutant of CLC-ec1 (for example in Helix P and N) are involved, when mutated, in genetic diseases when expressed in human CLC transporters? Could this be a way to establish the relevance of the conclusions on CLC-ec1 for the entire class of CLC proteins?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.53479.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>We revised the manuscript to address the concerns, including addition of new data to support the QQQ structural model as well as revisions to the text to clarify what has been learned from our experimental and computational results and what aspects of our proposed model require additional (future) testing.

The bulk of the reviewer criticisms reflect uncertainty as to whether the structure represents an on-pathway conformation. We shared this uncertainty, but we consider that the multiple lines of evidence presented here argue strongly for the mechanistic relevance – indeed the central mechanistic relevance – of the structure.

To provide further support for our interpretation that the QQQ represents an intermediate in the transport cycle, we performed additional DEER/EPR experiments to compare the protein conformation of QQQ with WT. Using spin labels on Helices N, O, P, and G, we shown that the QQQ conformation is similar to that adopted by WT at pH 4.5 (Figure 7).</p><p>Coupling does not require ionization at E203. We have clarified that our results are definitive in demonstrating that E203 protonation is not required for coupled transport. Lim and Miller, 2009, indeed previously showed that three non-ionizable E203 mutants exhibited low, near-baseline activity. However, they were very explicit in their waffling regarding the interpretation these results. They pointed out that the small signals <italic>might</italic> be due to pumping (coupling) but that they could just as well be assay artifacts. Had they been convinced that their data demonstrated coupling (even weakened 20:1 coupling), they would have concluded at that time that a titratable group at E203 is <italic>not</italic> required for the fundamental coupling mechanism. We note that the H<sup>+</sup> turnover rates reported in that research article are not unitary turnover rates, and therefore coupling ratios cannot be derived from those measurements. A major strength of our current work is that – motivated by the QQQ structure – we re-examined this question and demonstrated definitively that proton pumping (coupling) does not require titration of E203. Please also see our response to point 12. We have improved our discussion of these points in the manuscript (subsection “Proton pumping without a titratable residue at the Glu<sub>in</sub> position”, Discussion, third and fifth paragraphs).</p><p>Uncoupled proton transfer.Our observation of water access to the external glutamate from the intracellular side is agnostic as to whether it is part of a coupled or uncoupled H<sup>+</sup> transport process. It is, however, an observation that fits exceedingly well into a model for coupled H<sup>+</sup> transport, one that is consistent with all experimental results on coupled transport. We note that experimentally we do not observe uncoupled proton transport in the QQQ mutant, nor has anyone reported uncoupled H<sup>+</sup> transport in any CLC mutant.</p><p>The “out” conformation is observed in the CLC-1 channel structure. We note that Park and MacKinnon’s rationale for concluding that the “out” position may be unique to the channels was based on the observation that in previously known CLC transporters the “out” conformation would generate steric clashes, and not on any argument that an “out” conformation necessarily precludes an antiport mechanism. We have added text to the manuscript to explain this point and the point that CLC channel and transporter mechanisms are highly related, and therefore that it is completely reasonable for the two to share many similar mechanistic steps, including the same “out” conformation for Glu<sub>ex</sub>. We have included this point in the manuscript (subsection “New conformation of Glu<sub>ex</sub>” and Discussion, fourth paragraph).</p><p>While it is generally accepted that CLC channels are “broken” (uncoupled) transporters, the mechanistic details of which steps are “broken” in the channel uncoupling are not yet established. One possibility that has been suggested is that the inner and outer Cl<sup>–</sup> gates are no longer opened and closed in a coupled manner. This possibility is supported by the observation that the structures of CLC channels (CLC-1 and CLC-K) show intracellular gates in open-appearing conformations. In the revised manuscript, we have added text and a figure illustrating the fact that the QQQ mutant retains a constricted intracellular gate (subsection “The intracellular barrier remains constricted” and Figure 3), thus supporting its feasibility as representing an intermediate in a coupled transport cycle.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The results from the DEER measurements appear to be qualitative.

(2014) Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 111(41):14752-7. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1410431111). As to the absolute magnitude of the changes in the crystal structures and distance distributions, there is not absolute correlation as there is some uncertainty introduced by the potential rotameric state of the spin-label. We have carried out two different modeling methods, MMM and MDDS (Polyhach et al. (2011) Phys Chem Phys. 13(6):2356-66. doi: 10.1039/c0cp01865a; Islam et al. (2013) J Phys Chem B. 117(17):4740-54. doi: 10.1021/jp311723a), that place spin-labeled rotamers on a fixed protein backbone to derive an expected distance distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>). While neither method perfectly matches the width of the distance distribution, as expected (Alexander et al. (2013) PLoS One. 8(9):e72851. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0072851), they support that the changes seen in the DEER data are reflective of the changes in the crystal structure.</p><p>To further support the relevance of the DEER measurements, we evaluated an additional position, on the intracellular side, to complement the previous measurements at sites at the extracellular side.

This is very interesting, because it has not been observed in any other CLC structure. Do the helices move independently, or does the inverted topology repeat move as rigid bodies? So far, only limited analysis of the structure has been presented. It would be useful to elaborate on this analysis, including adding a figure overlaying the two structures, showing all of the changes in the protein.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion.

It is more likely that there would have to be a water coordinated between (as is observed in the MD simulation), or further conformational change required to bring these residues closer. This should be clarified throughout the manuscript, especially in the cartoons where it shows the two residues in contact.</p></disp-quote><p>We have revised the cartoons and removed the “within kissing distance” phrase. To make the narrative easier to follow, we have separated the introduction and discussion of the changes at Glu<sub>ex</sub> and Glu<sub>in</sub>.

This is not stated explicitly, but is important for future reproducibility of the simulations.</p></disp-quote><p>The simulation was performed using the QQQ mutant structure as the template, with three glutamates mutated to glutamine (E148Q, E203Q, E113Q), and therefore there is no concern regarding their protonation states. Regarding the other protonatable residues: since the triple mutant represents the CLC-ec1 structure under low pH, we assigned the protonation state of each titratable residue in the protein based on the pKa analysis at pH 4.5 using PROPKA. To be specific, the following amino acids were in their protonated states in the simulation: E111, E202, E235, and E414. All other side chains are in their default protonation state. We have added this information to the Materials and methods subsection “Reconstitution and chloride flux assay”, first paragraph.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Please provide trajectories, or snapshot PDB files of the final equilibrated configurations.</p></disp-quote><p>Representative snapshot PDB files are provided in Figure 8—source data 1.

We have added this information in Figure 6—figure supplement 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Water wires are mentioned throughout the analysis, however, the snapshots and simulation look like the water is disordered. Can you provide analysis on specific water wire geometries?</p></disp-quote><p>The water molecules are not disordered, although from the figure it may appear so. In fact, we have characterized these water wires after careful analysis of the water arrangements ensuring that the water molecules are connected and form a H-bonded configuration required for proton transport. We have included the definition of water pathways in “Analysis of water pathways” in “Materials and methods”. The pathways are defined only when there are water molecules connected through a continuous hydrogen-bonded network. The reason that in the figure the water pathway might appear a bit disordered may be due to inclusion of all water molecules in the protein cavity, rather than only the ones that form a single file. We opted to include all water molecules (rather than just showing those forming a single file pathway) to highlight how much the protein interior was hydrated during the simulation. The pdb files we have provided (see response to point #6) allow the reader to examine the pathways closely.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Subsection “A unifying model for the CLC transport mechanism”, third paragraph – you state that the change in the N helix results in changes in ion coordination that are predicted to decrease affinity of this site. However, the ITC measurements argue against this, since the QQQ construct has a higher affinity. Can you clarify this confusion?</p></disp-quote><p>It is correct that, based on the changes observed at Helix N, we anticipated that the affinity of the QQQ construct for Cl<sup>–</sup> would be decreased compared to E148Q. There are several very reasonable explanations for the observation that QQQ and 148Q have similar affinities measured by ITC. First, the ITC measurement does not distinguish between Cl<sup>–</sup> binding to the central site (S<sub>cen</sub>), which appears structurally identical in QQQ and E148Q, and the external site (S<sub>ext</sub>), which exhibits some structural differences. Second, the crystal structures are static snapshots of the proteins, whereas the ITC measurements are performed on protein in detergent solution. Conformational flexibility in solution may allow the S<sub>ext</sub> binding site in QQQ to make small (~0.5 Å) adjustments that generate an increased binding affinity. We have completely rewritten this section and the section on QQQ and E148Q transport assays (subsection “Comparison of QQQ and E148Q Cl<sup>–</sup> binding and transport rates”) to clarify the point that even though these mutants display identical Cl<sup>–</sup> binding affinities (a thermodynamic measurement), they display different Cl<sup>–</sup> transport rates (a kinetic measurement) and that our results are completely consistent with our interpretation that the Helix-N opening occurs as part of the normal transport cycle. Please also see our response to point #11.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) The fact that the QQQ mutant represents a stable &quot;native&quot; conformation intermediate that can be captured in a X-ray crystal structure and mimics the H<sup>+</sup>-loaded state of the transporter strongly suggests that it would be possible to obtain the structure of the WT (or E148A) at low pH. This would be much more directly relevant for the conclusions of the authors than the results on a triple mutant. Please add in the manuscript whether the attempt to crystallize the WT or E148A at low pH has been made and why it did not work.</p></disp-quote><p>We now describe our crystallization attempted on WT CLC-ec1 at low pH, in the first paragraph of the Discussion. The protein is very soluble at low pH, and we did not obtain any crystals even at 50 mg/mL protein. (At pH 8.5, CLC-ec1 crystallizes from solutions at 10-20 mg/mL.)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) A major difference of this structure compared to previous ones is the larger access to the permeation pathway on the extracellular side with removal of all the constrictions present in the WT and the E148A mutant. However, transport rate is only 2 times faster whereas one would expect a much larger functional effect. The data on the Cl<sup>-</sup> K<sub>d</sub> for E148A and QQQ are presented in Figure 3—figure supplement 2 where it is also explained that it was not possible to use Br- to distinguish the binding affinities at different sites. The K<sub>d</sub>s for the 2 mutants are very similar.</p><p>More importantly, the K<sub>d</sub> reported for E148A and the QQQ mutants are very similar. How can this be reconciled with a larger permeation pathway in the QQQ mutant but only a doubling of the transport rate? This casts some question marks on the extent to which the QQQ structure is representative of a native conformation intermediate. The inconsistency between the similar K<sub>d</sub> and the doubling of the transport rate (in spite of a larger pore) between E148A and the QQQ mutant should be more clearly acknowledged and, on this basis, the speculative nature of the conclusions is explicitly stated.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for raising these points, which guided us in making clarifications and improvements in the manuscript, rewriting the section describing these results (subsection “Comparison of QQQ and E148Q Cl<sup>–</sup> binding and transport rates” and Figure 4). A critical point we had not made clear is that the prediction that Cl<sup>–</sup> transport through QQQ will be faster than through E148Q is agnostic towards the magnitude of the difference. The wider vestibule in QQQ predicts that transport through QQQ will be faster than through E148Q, if extracellular gate-opening is a rate-limiting step. On the other hand, if Cl<sup>–</sup> transport through E148Q and QQQ have the same rate-limiting step, then Cl<sup>–</sup> transport rates should be similar. Experimental measurements revealed that QQQ Cl<sup>–</sup> transport rates are ~2-fold faster than E148Q transport rates at pH 7.5, the pH at which the binding studies were performed (Figure 4B, C), indicating that the two mutants have different rate-limiting steps. Thus, the prediction is supported. A further prediction is that if this difference in transport rates is due to the wider extracellular Cl<sup>–</sup> entryway in QQQ compared to E148Q, then lowering the pH (to allow E148Q to adopt the QQQ-like (outward-facing open) conformation) should increase the Cl<sup>–</sup> transport rate. Consistent with this prediction, transport rates of the E148Q mutant increase by 2-fold at pH 4.5 (Figure 4D). While the transport rates of QQQ and E148Q remain slower than WT CLC-ec1 by ~6-fold, such a result is not surprising (actually, it is expected) given that these Glu<sub>ex</sub> mutants lack a negatively charged carboxylate to compete Cl<sup>–</sup> out of the permeation pathway. Thus, these results support the conclusion that E148Q CLC-ec1 (and by extension WT CLC-ec1) undergoes an opening of the extracellular vestibule at low pH. To provide further support that the QQQ structure represents a native conformation intermediate, we additionally added new DEER data comparing QQQ to WT CLC-ec1 (Figure 7).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) In a previous study, Accardi et al. (JGP 2004) reported that the E203A mutation abolished proton transport in CLC-ec1. In the present manuscript the authors state that the double mutant E113A/E203A is able to transport protons. It should be clarified in the manuscript whether this difference is a result of the E113A mutation or if the result contrasts with the ones of Accardi et al. In this case the authors should indicate in the Discussion possible reasons for the discrepancy.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for raising the point that we should provide additional information discussion concerning these previous results. We have added new data to the manuscript, reporting flux assay results on single mutants at the Glu<sub>in</sub> position, E203A and E203Q (Figure 9 and Figure 9—figure supplement 1). We find that both mutants can pump protons. Interestingly, E203A retains stronger coupling stoichiometry than E203Q (10:1 versus 75:1). In the Accardi et al. manuscript (JGP 2005), it is the latter mutant (E203Q) that was examined. There is no discrepancy between our results and those of Accardi et al., whose report of reversal potentials for E203Q (Figure 2C in Accardi et al., 2005) are consistent with a 75:1 coupling stoichiometry. Accardi et al. did not examine the E203A mutant. We have included a discussion of these points in the manuscript, subsection “Proton pumping without a titratable residue at the Glu<sub>in</sub> position”, last paragraph.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13) Is it possible that some of the residues observed to change conformation in the QQQ mutant of CLC-ec1 (for example in Helix P and N) are involved, when mutated, in genetic diseases when expressed in human CLC transporters? Could this be a way to establish the relevance of the conclusions on CLC-ec1 for the entire class of CLC proteins?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion. We have added relevant references to disease-causing mutations (subsections “Opening of the extracellular vestibule” and “Overall conformational change in QQQ”). We have modified the title to “A CLC-ec1 mutant reveals global conformational change and suggests a unifying mechanism for the CLC Cl<sup>–</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> transport cycle”.</p></body></sub-article></article>
