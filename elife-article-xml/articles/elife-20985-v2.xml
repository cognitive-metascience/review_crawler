understood. Here, we report that decreasing the function of CCR5 increases MAPK/CREB signaling, long-term potentiation (LTP), and hippocampus-dependent memory in mice, while neuronal CCR5 overexpression caused memory deficits. Decreasing CCR5 function in mouse barrel cortex also resulted in enhanced spike timing dependent plasticity and consequently, dramatically accelerated experience-dependent plasticity. These results suggest that CCR5 is a powerful suppressor for plasticity and memory, and CCR5 over-activation by viral proteins may contribute to HIV-associated cognitive deficits. Consistent with this hypothesis, the HIV V3 peptide caused LTP, signaling and memory deficits that were prevented by Ccr5 knockout or knockdown. Overall, our results demonstrate that CCR5 plays an important role in neuroplasticity, learning and memory, and indicate that CCR5 has a role in the cognitive deficits caused by HIV.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.20985.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.20985.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>CCR5</kwd><kwd>hippocampus</kwd><kwd>barrel cortex</kwd><kwd>learning and memory</kwd><kwd>HIV-associated cognitive deficits</kwd><kwd>gp120</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P50-MH0779720</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fox</surname><given-names>Kevin</given-names></name><name><surname>Silva</surname><given-names>Alcino J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005984</institution-id><institution>Dr. Miriam and Sheldon G.

CCR5 is highly expressed in T cells and macrophages in the immune system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sorce et al., 2011</xref>). In the central nervous system, CCR5 is expressed in microglia, astrocytes and neurons in multiple brain regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cartier et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Meucci et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tran et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Westmoreland et al., 2002</xref>), including the CA1 region of the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Torres-Muñoz et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>Ligand binding to CCR5 is known to modulate several parallel signaling cascades implicated in learning and memory, including the suppression of adenylyl cyclase (AC), as well as the activation of the PI3K/AKT and p44/42 MAPK signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cartier et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Paruch et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tyner et al., 2005</xref>). The CCR5 endogenous ligand RANTES (also known as CCL5) is reported to block neuronal [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> oscillations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Meucci et al., 1998</xref>) and to modulate glutamate release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Musante et al., 2008</xref>), suggesting a role for CCR5 in the regulation of neuronal function.</p><p>CCR5 has a key role in HIV infection by mediating virus cellular entry. <italic>Ccr5</italic> knockdown inhibits HIV-1 infection in macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Liang et al., 2010</xref>) and CCR5 antagonists effectively reduce HIV-1 expression in AIDS patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hunt and Romanelli, 2009</xref>). Treatment with the CCR5 antagonist maraviroc has been reported to improve neurocognitive test performance among patients with moderate cognitive impairment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ndhlovu et al., 2014</xref>), supposedly by reducing monocytes and inflammation. Cognitive deficits affect approximately 30% of HIV-positive adults and 50% of HIV-positive infants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Galicia et al., 2002</xref>), and are a significant clinical problem associated with HIV infection. Although CCR5 plays a crucial role in HIV infection in the central nervous system (CNS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ellis et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zhou and Saksena, 2013</xref>), little is known about its role in neuronal plasticity or learning and memory, or whether this receptor plays a direct role in HIV-associated cognitive disorders.</p><p>Here, we demonstrate that manipulations that decrease CCR5 function result in elevated MAPK and CREB levels during learning, enhance synaptic plasticity and improve both cortical sensory plasticity and hippocampal learning and memory, while the transgenic overexpression of this receptor causes learning and memory deficits. Thus, our studies reveal an important suppressor role for CCR5 in neuroplasticity, learning and memory, independent of the proposed roles of CCR5 in neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. Since our results and other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cormier and Dragic, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Morikis et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Shen et al., 2000</xref>) show that HIV coat proteins can bind and activate CCR5, thus activating its memory suppressor functions, our results suggest that besides the neuroinflammation induced neurodegeneration that can cause HIV-associated cognitive deficits, CCR5 activation by HIV coat proteins also contributes to the cognitive deficits caused by HIV.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Identification of <italic>Ccr5</italic> knockout mice in a reverse genetic memory screen</title><p>Our first indication that CCR5 was involved in plasticity and memory came from a reverse genetic memory screen. In total, 148 transgenic and knockout mutant mouse strains with controlled genetic backgrounds were chosen at random from the inventories of commercial vendors (Jackson Laboratories and Taconic Farms) as well as individual laboratories, and screened for contextual memory phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). Interestingly, 6 out of the 8 chemokine or chemokine receptor mutant strains screened (# labeling, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) showed positive Z scores (see Materials and methods), including three mutant strains with scores above 1, suggesting enhanced memory for contextual conditioning. HRas<sup>G12V</sup> mice were used for comparison, since they were previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kushner et al., 2005</xref>) to show enhanced memory for contextual fear conditioning.

Importantly, the <italic>Ccr5</italic> knockout did not affect a number of behaviors that could have confounded the learning and memory findings, including anxiety, activity, social interaction, cued conditioning, and shock reactivity. This enhancement in learning and memory is consistent with increases in plasticity at the systems and cellular levels. In the barrel cortex, <italic>Ccr5</italic> knockout results in dramatically accelerated experience-dependent plasticity: <italic>Ccr5<sup>+/-</sup></italic> mice showed robust experience-dependent sensory plasticity at a time point (7-days after whisker removal) when WT mice show no evidence of plasticity. Importantly, temporally and spatially restricted knockdown of <italic>Ccr5,</italic> specifically in adult hippocampus or barrel cortex, also resulted in enhancements in learning and memory as well as experience-dependent plasticity, demonstrating that these effects are not due to changes during development.</p><p>MAPK and CREB have been implicated in learning and memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bourtchuladze et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Roth and Sweatt, 2008</xref>).

However, <italic>Ccr5</italic> knockout resulted in an increase in MAPK and CREB signaling levels at 1- and 3 hr after training, respectively. Enhanced MAPK or CREB signaling have been associated with enhancements in learning and memory. For example, HRas<sup>G12V</sup> mice have enhanced MAPK levels following training, and show increases in LTP and sensory plasticity, as well as enhancements in learning and memory tested in a number of tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kaneko et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kushner et al., 2005</xref>); Similarly, enhanced CREB signaling is also associated with memory enhancements in multiple tasks and model systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Czajkowski et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kathirvelu and Colombo, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zhou et al., 2009</xref>) and in barrel cortex plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barth et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Glazewski et al., 1999</xref>). Altogether, these results indicate that increases in MAPK and CREB signaling are integral to the learning and memory enhancements in the <italic>Ccr5</italic> knockout mice.</p><p> <italic>Ccr5</italic> knockout mice show enhanced long-term synaptic plasticity changes both in hippocampus and barrel cortex. For example, our spike pairing protocol in the cortex induced LTP 20% of the time in WT mice and 70% of the time in the <italic>Ccr5</italic> knockout mice. Our neocortical studies also showed that similar to HRas<sup>G12V</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kaneko et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kushner et al., 2005</xref>), <italic>Ccr5<sup>+/-</sup></italic> mice also have lower release probability and lower mini-amplitudes.

Together with the increased responsiveness of the MAPK/CREB signaling pathway, the naive state of the synapse under CCR5 hypo-function creates a potent mix for increased synaptic potentiation.</p><p>In agreement with the enhanced learning and memory with manipulations that decrease CCR5, transgenic mice that overexpress CCR5 in excitatory neurons show learning and memory deficits, demonstrating that CCR5 acts as a suppressor for plasticity and memory. Although a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lee et al., 2009</xref>) reported learning and memory deficits in aged CCR5 mutants, this study used aged mice (12–18 month old) and the control mice with a different genetic background. Our CCR5 transgenic results suggested that CCR5 activation by viral proteins, and subsequent plasticity and memory suppression, may contribute to HIV associated impairments in cognition.</p><p>A recent study reported that transgenic mice overexpressing an HIV viral protein (gp120) showed neuronal degeneration and subsequent behavioral deficits that could be ameliorated by a <italic>Ccr5</italic> mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Maung et al., 2014</xref>). Similarly, multiple doses of gp120 in rats also resulted in physiological and cognitive deficits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tang et al., 2009</xref>). Interestingly, our study shows that acute treatment (one injection 30 min before training) of HIV gp120 V3 loop peptide, which is known to bind and activate CCR5 in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chan et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Shah et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sirois et al., 2005</xref>), was sufficient to induce deficits in a key cellular mechanism for learning and memory (LTP) and also in hippocampus-dependent learning and memory in WT mice. Remarkably, these deficits were prevented by either a viral-mediated <italic>Ccr5</italic>-knockdown or by a <italic>Ccr5</italic> knockout mutation. The V3 loop is important for HIV binding to CCR5 or CXCR4, and LTP deficits caused by the V3 loop peptide had been reported to be blocked by a CXCR4 antagonist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dong and Xiong, 2006</xref>). Nevertheless, our results show that both in the barrel cortex and in hippocampus, the LTP deficits caused by the V3 peptide are prevented by the homozygous <italic>Ccr5</italic> mutation, demonstrating that CCR5 plays a critical role in the V3-induced deficits in neuroplasticity. CCR5 antagonists and inhibitors have shown efficacy in reduction of viral load in clinical studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fätkenheuer et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gulick et al., 2008</xref>). Our findings support the application of brain permeable CCR5 antagonists, not only as a combination drug in antiretroviral (ARV) therapy, but also as a treatment for cognitive deficits caused by HIV coat proteins.</p><p>Previous studies showed that the establishment of long-lasting synaptic changes and long-term memory requires the removal of inhibitory constraints on MAPK/CREB signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abel et al., 1998</xref>). Our findings with <italic>Ccr5</italic> knockout, region-specific viral knockdown, and neuronal CCR5 over-expression demonstrate that CCR5 functions as a plasticity and memory suppressor by acting on the MAPK/CREB signaling pathway. Our results also suggest that the inappropriate activation of this suppressor by HIV coat proteins contributes to cognitive deficits. Since decreasing CCR5 function leads to robust increases in plasticity and memory, CCR5 provides a novel target for cognitive enhancement, and for the development of treatments for cognitive deficits.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Subjects</title><p>3-month old C57BL/6N and <italic>Ccr5</italic> knockout (<italic>Ccr5</italic><sup>-/-</sup>) mice were purchased from Taconic Farms (Germantown, NY) and tested in a reverse genetic screen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). <italic>Ccr5</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice were then bred with C57BL/6N mice to generate <italic>Ccr</italic>5<sup>+/-</sup>.

To examine whether mice from different groups were able to learn the Morris water maze task with extended training, a second probe test was performed after five days of training. Mice showing floating behavior during training or probe test were excluded from further training or from data analysis. Floating behavior was judged by mouse swimming speed, and mice with a swimming speed lower than (average speed – 2 × SD (standard deviation)) were excluded.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Social recognition</title><p>Mice were handled for 3 days (2 min handling each day) before social recognition task. During the 3- day social recognition task, mice were first habituated to the testing chamber for 10 min on day 1. On day 2, mice were placed back into the same chamber and habituated for 5 min, and then were allowed to interact for 7 min with an ovariectomized (OVX) female mouse placed under a wired cylinder (training session). On day 3, mice were placed back into the same chamber and habituated for 5 min, and then were allowed to interact with two OVX females (one familiar and one novel) for 5 min (test session). The time mice spent on exploring (sniffing) the OVX mice were hand scored by experimenters blinded of mouse genotypes and of familiar or novel OVX mice.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Open field</title><p>Mice were placed in a novel open field (28 cm × 28 cm × 25 cm), and were allowed to explore it for a period of 20 min.

HEK293 cells were ordered from ATCC (CRL-1573) and were tested with Mycoplasma Detection Kit (R&amp;D Systems, CUL001B) to make sure there was no contamination. One day after plasmid transfection, cells were imaged to examine the effect of shRNA-CCR5 on CCR5-tdTomato expression. <italic>Ccr5</italic> knockdown efficiency was also tested by measuring <italic>Ccr5</italic> mRNA expression in the hippocampus one month after the injection of AAV containing shRNA-cont or shRNA-CCR5. To measure <italic>Ccr5</italic> mRNA expression, tissue samples were collected from the dorsal hippocampus and total RNA was extracted by RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) and treated with DNase (Qiagen). Total RNA was first reverse-transcribed into cDNA using oligo (dT) primers and Superscipt III First-Strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), and was then quantified by qPCR. The following primer sequences were used for the <italic>Ccr5</italic> qPCR: 5’GCTGCCTAAACCCTGTCATC 3’(forward) and 5’GTTCTCCTGTGGATCG GGTA3’ (reverse).

Once a whole cell recording was established extracellular stimulus was applied at 0.1 Hz, consisting of a pairs of pulses at 20 Hz. The stimulus was of 0.2 ms duration and 1–35 V intensity, designed to produce a monosynaptic EPSP of 3–6 mV in the postsynaptic cell. After 10 min of baseline recording, LTP was induced by pairing a suprathreshold 2.5 ms somatic depolarizing pulse with a single presynaptic stimulus (5 ms pre-post interval). Four runs of 50 paired stimuli at 2 Hz were delivered at 0.025 Hz. After LTP induction the stimulus paradigm was switched back the same as in the baseline recording and one hour of post-paring data were acquired. EPSP amplitudes were calculated as the peak response above the preceding baseline voltage. Significant potentiation was calculated by comparing mean EPSP amplitude at 50–60 mins after LTP induction with mean baseline EPSP amplitude using Student’s t-test.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16-4"><title>Release probability experiments</title><p>The position of the recording and stimulating electrodes were identical to those for the LTP experiments.

Single extracellular stimuli were delivered at 0.1 Hz. After a stable baseline had been established, stimulation was halted and 10 µM MK-801 was washed onto the slice for 10 min. Stimulation was then resumed as before and at least 100 further stimulus trials were recorded, still in the presence of MK-801 and CNQX in Mg-free ACSF. Single and double-exponential fits of the response amplitude over time were performed with GraphPad Prism 5 and 6 (GraphPad, La Jolla, CA).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Craig Curtis Garner (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The finding that a HIV co-receptor impacts upon learning and memory processes has implications for hippocampal function and may also be relevant to HIV-dementia. The three reviewers provided a number of very positive comments on the study of Ccr5 in hippocampal-dependent plasticity. The findings reported in the study were considered to be novel, interesting and well carried out. The use of overexpression and loss of function of Ccr5 was considered to be appropriate and supportive of the conclusions. It was suggested by the second reviewer that how Ccr5 has effects on excitatory synapses and upon pMAPK and pCREB levels be further considered. These points were brought up, as it is clear how Ccr5 mice with weaker excitatory synapses and lower release probability perform better. We believe you will be able to address these issues in a revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>This manuscript provides important insight into the role of chemokine receptor CCR5 as a suppressor of learning-related plasticity at the molecular, synaptic, and systems level. Traditionally, CCR5 has been studied as a chemokine receptor that mediates HIV cellular entry, and cognitive deficits in HIV infected individuals have been considered as a byproduct of neuroinflammation. In the present study, Zhou et al. use both loss-of-function (haploinsufficiency of Ccr5 heterozygote mice, shRNA mediated knockdown of Ccr5) and gain-of-function (Ccr5 overexpressing transgenic mice) approaches to show that CCR5 acts as a suppressor of neuroplasticity and memory, and that transgenic overexpression of CCR5 causes deficits in hippocampus-dependent contextual memory and neocortical experience-dependent plasticity. The authors further show that a single injection of HIV coat peptide that forms the ligand for CCR5 is sufficient to cause acute memory deficits that are prevented in Ccr5 null mice.</p><p>This is a very impressive and novel study that more than fulfills the criteria for an <italic>eLife</italic> publication. The study addresses the role of CCR5 in learning and memory using multiple approaches that support the overarching conclusion that CCR5 serves as a suppressor of plasticity and memory. I have no issues with the manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (General assessment and major comments (Required)):</italic> </p><p>Understanding the mechanisms that negatively regulate synaptic plasticity and memory processes is an important question. Zhou and colleagues report here that they have identified in a reverse genetic memory screen that hetero- and homozygotic KO mice lacking the GPCR Ccr5 exhibit enhanced memory in multiple memory tasks that involve the hippocampus, as shown here for fear conditioning and the Morris water maze. These behavioral changes are correlated with increased MAPK and CREB signaling following training as well as enhanced hippocampal LTP. In agreement with the hetero- and homozygotic KO data, Ccr5 knockdown in the adult hippocampus results in enhanced memory. Overexpression experiments support that Ccr5 acts in neurons to restrict memory processes. Complementary changes are observed in the barrel cortex, where Ccr5+/- mice or mice in which Ccr5 was knocked-down in neurons show enhanced responses to stimulation of a spared whisker, indicating increased experience-dependent plasticity. Recordings from pyramidal cells in layer 2/3 of the barrel cortex support enhanced LTP in these mice. Other physiological changes include lower release probability and smaller, less frequent mEPSPs in KO mice. Previous findings had shown that HIV coat proteins can bind and activate human CCR5, concomitant with the impaired cognition that can occur in HIV patients. The authors therefore tested acute effects of the gp120 V3 loop peptide on synaptic plasticity and memory processes in mice. They found that loss of Ccr5 or reduction of Ccr5 in hippocampal neurons protects against V3 peptide-induced LTP deficits and memory impairments. This is in agreement with a previous publication by Maung et al. (2014) that reports protection of Ccr5 KO mice against effects of a gp120 peptide. The results extend those findings by determining the timeline of peptide effects and by showing that Ccr5 acts in hippocampal neurons to mediate these effects.</p><p>This study reports interesting effects of Ccr5 on synaptic plasticity and memory processes, and presents data that MAPK and CREB signaling are altered upon loss or reduction of Ccr5. The experiments are convincing and allow for a comparison of effects of Ccr5 loss on hippocampal and cortical function. Yet, it remains unclear how Ccr5 functions as a regulator of plasticity and memory processes. Further, it remains open whether the gp120 V3 peptide impacts the same Ccr5-dependent mechanisms that modulate cognition. More detailed comments are provided below.</p><p>1) The experiments utilizing viral delivery support that Ccr5 acts in neurons, but the synaptic effects of Ccr5 are unclear. How can the authors explain that mice with weaker excitatory synapses and lower release probability can perform hippocampus-dependent tasks better? The idea of increased &quot;headroom&quot; to potentiate synapses is not compelling as it does not explain why Ccr5 is expressed in the brain if it simply acts to limit excitatory synapse properties. Also, it needs to be tested whether the lower mEPSC frequency in Ccr5 +/- mice is correlated with a reduction in excitatory synapse number. This is a possible alternative or additional cause for this mEPSC phenotype.</p><p>2) Through which mechanism can the GPCR Ccr5 impact MAPK and CREB signaling? Also, it is surprising that the activation of only a subset of neurons that occurs in the fear conditioning task is sufficient to substantially increase p-MAPK and p-CREB in total hippocampal homogenates of mice lacking Ccr5. Do the authors assume that the subset of activated Ccr5 +/- neurons undergoes such a massive increase in p-MAPK and p-CREB during learning that this change becomes detectable in total samples?</p><p>3) Does the gp120 V3 peptide alter MAPK and CREB signaling in a Ccr5-dependent manner? This will allow assessing to what extent this HIV peptide modulates the same mechanisms through which Ccr5 may restrict plasticity and learning.</p><p>4) The authors refer to the publication by Lee et al. (2009) that reports opposite effects of Ccr5 loss on cognitive functions. Yet, they do not discuss this beyond commenting that this is &quot;likely due to genetic background effects&quot;. Lee et al. studied these mice in a mixed background while this work analyzes them in a C57BL/6N background. Yet, it is not clear why this difference is a &quot;likely&quot; explanation for this discrepancy. More compelling reasons need to be provided for the opposite phenotype of improved memory processes that is reported here and that is central to this study.</p><p>5) The finding that the effect on long-term memory after fear conditioning after shRNA knockdown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref> is higher than in the heterozygotic Ccr5 KO in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and possibly higher than in the full KO in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref> raises concerns about off-target effects. The authors can address this by testing whether delivery of Ccr5 shRNA causes effects in KO mice in one of the approaches presented here, e.g. the mEPSC recordings.</p><p>6) Does Ccr5 overexpression reduce p-MAPK and p-CREB levels? This would provide evidence that these signaling pathways are indeed linked to Ccr5 effects on neuronal function.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>Experiments presented in this study are designed to assess the role of C-C chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) in learning and memory function. CCR5 is a GPCR involved in the inflammatory response. It is also expressed in CNS. Ligand (RANTES) binding to CCR5 modulates several signaling pathways implicated in learning and memory including adenylyl cyclase, PI3K/AKT and MAPK signaling. CCR5 is also involved in HIV infection. The antagonist maravirco has been found to improve cognition in HIV patents. In this current study, the authors have directly examined the contribution of CCR5 to hippocampal-dependent learning as well as experience-dependent plasticity in the barrel cortex.</p><p>Their data nicely shown that decreasing CCR5 function increases not only MAPK/CREB signaling but also LTP and hippocampal-dependent memory in CCR5 +/- and -/- mice. Conversely, over-expression of CCR5 results in memory deficit. In the barrel cortex, decreasing CCR5 enhanced spike timing dependent plasticity and accelerated experience-dependent plasticity. These data support the conclusion that CCR5 normally act to suppress plasticity and memory.</p><p>Overall the data presented are of very high quality and strongly support the author's claims. I am very impressed with this provocative study, which provides a strong case for the role of CCR5 as a potent suppressor of learning and memory function. The data presented are presented in a clear and logical manner and the discussion provides a balanced assessment of the database on the literature. The topic is well suited for the readership of <italic>eLife</italic>. I thus recommend publication without revision.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.20985.030</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>[…] Reviewer #2 (General assessment and major comments (Required)): […] This study reports interesting effects of Ccr5 on synaptic plasticity and memory processes, and presents data that MAPK and CREB signaling are altered upon loss or reduction of Ccr5.

In our manuscript, we outline molecular (MAPK/CREB signaling), electrophysiological (LTP and probability of release), structural (spine counts), sensory plasticity and behavioral results that fully account for the function of CCR5 in the brain. Our results provide a large number of convergent and consistent results from multiple CCR5 manipulations (transgenic overexpression, viral knockdown, heterozygous and homozygous germ-line knockouts) that demonstrate the function of this receptor in plasticity and learning and memory. It is important that these results are consistent with a large amount of published data that implicate MAPK/CREB signaling and probability of release studies in plasticity and learning and memory.</p><p><italic>Further, it remains open whether the gp120 V3 peptide impacts the same Ccr5-dependent mechanisms that modulate cognition.</italic></p><p>The results in the paper address this question with electrophysiological (LTP) and learning and memory experiments, as well as new signaling experiments with <italic>Ccr5</italic> knockdown or germ line knockouts.

Together with published evidence, this provides strong evidence that the gp120 V3 peptide affects signaling, synaptic plasticity, and learning and memory mechanism modulated by CCR5.</p><p><italic>More detailed comments are provided below.</italic></p><p><italic>1) The experiments utilizing viral delivery support that Ccr5 acts in neurons, but the synaptic effects of Ccr5 are unclear.

The idea of increased &quot;headroom&quot; to potentiate synapses is not compelling as it does not explain why Ccr5 is expressed in the brain if it simply acts to limit excitatory synapse properties.

The independent test of release rate using MK-801 shows that the release rate of <italic>Ccr5</italic><sup>+/-</sup> mice is lower (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A, B</xref>). However, we have also addressed the possibility that synapse number could be lower in the <italic>Ccr5</italic><sup>+/-</sup> mice by looking at dendritic spines on cortical layer 2/3 neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Author response image 1</xref>). We found that the cortical dendritic spine density of <italic>Ccr5</italic> heterozygotes is very similar to that of their wild-type controls (<italic>Ccr5</italic><sup>+/-</sup> mice: spine density = 1.021 spines per micron; wild-type mice: spine density = 1.026 spines per micron). Therefore, lower synapse number is unlikely to account for the lower mEPSC frequency.<fig id="fig12" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.20985.027</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.20985.027">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.20985.027</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-20985-resp-fig1-v2"/></fig></p><p>Consistent with the finding in the cortex, analysis of spine density in the CA1 subregion of hippocampus in <italic>Ccr5</italic><sup>+/-</sup> and wild-type mice also show that the dendritic spine density was similar between the wild-type and the <italic>Ccr5</italic><sup>+/-</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4D</xref>).</p><p>Compared to wild-type mice, the <italic>Ccr5</italic><sup>+/-</sup> synapses have a lower release probability on average. However, there is a significant overlap between the distribution of synaptic strengths between mice with less CCR5 and controls. Consequently, many synapses will be just as strong in mice with CCR5 hypo-function as in their wild-type controls. However, the larger “reserve” of weaker release probability synapses in mice with less CCR5 results in a larger set of readily potentiate-able synapses that we believe are responsible for the increased LTP and for the higher learning speed of these mice. The CCR5 ligand RANTES has been shown to modulate glutamate release (Di Prisco et al., 2012; Merega et al., 2015; Musante et al., 2008). A role of RANTES in controlling glutamate release is consistent with our finding that release probability is lower in the <italic>Ccr5</italic><sup>+/-</sup> mice. Again, we provide two lines of evidence for this: the MK-801 experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7 A, B</xref>) and measurements of mEPSC frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). We also showed that the lower mEPSC frequency is not due to lower synapse number (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4D</xref>).</p><p>We should also point out that there is precedent in the literature for the same association between low release probability, stronger LTP, faster sensory plasticity and enhanced learning and memory. Mice with a HRas<sup>G12V</sup> mutation show enhanced learning and memory, increased LTP, increased experience dependent sensory plasticity, and importantly, lower release probability (Kaneko et al., 2010; Kushner et al., 2005).</p><p><italic>2) Through which mechanism can the GPCR Ccr5 impact MAPK and CREB signaling? Also, it is surprising that the activation of only a subset of neurons that occurs in the fear conditioning task is sufficient to substantially increase p-MAPK and p-CREB in total hippocampal homogenates of mice lacking Ccr5. Do the authors assume that the subset of activated Ccr5 +/- neurons undergoes such a massive increase in p-MAPK and p-CREB during learning that this change becomes detectable in total samples?</italic></p><p>CCR5 is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that is both coupled to the Gαi and Gαq pathway upon activation by endogenous ligands (Blanpain et al., 2002; Mueller and Strange, 2004). Ligand binding to CCR5 modulates p44/42 MAPK signaling (Paruch et al., 2007; Tyner et al., 2005), and p44/42 MAPK can also regulate CCR5 expression (Li et al., 2009). Besides MAPK, CCR5 expression is also modulated by CREB signaling (Kuipers et al., 2008; Wierda and van den Elsen, 2012). Although we did not investigate directly this point in our manuscript, previous results suggest that CCR5 impacts CREB signaling through Gαi pathway and its downstream cAMP and PKA signaling pathways (Delghandi et al., 2005).</p><p><italic>&quot;it is surprising that the activation of only a subset of neurons that occurs in the fear conditioning task is sufficient to substantially increase p-MAPK and p-CREB in total hippocampal homogenates of mice lacking Ccr5.&quot;</italic></p><p>Previous studies have shown that memories are allocated to only a subset of neurons in amygdala, hippocampus, and cortex (Cai et al., 2016; Han et al., 2007; Sano et al., 2014). Nevertheless, previous studies found significant overall increases in p-MAPK or p-CREB after learning (see for example, Atkins et al., 1998; Cammarota et al., 2000; Chen et al., 2012; Kushner et al., 2005). Consistent with previous published findings, we found that activation of a subset of neurons in <italic>Ccr5</italic> knockout mice was sufficient to trigger an overall increase in p44/42 p-MAPK and p-CREB in hippocampal homogenates.</p><p><italic>3) Does the gp120 V3 peptide alter MAPK and CREB signaling in a Ccr5-dependent manner? This will allow assessing to what extent this HIV peptide modulates the same mechanisms through which Ccr5 may restrict plasticity and learning.</italic></p><p>To test whether V3 peptide modulates the same p44/42 MAPK or CREB mechanisms through which CCR5 suppresses plasticity and memory, we measured hippocampal p44/42 MAPK or CREB signaling after V3 peptide treatment and fear conditioning training (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>). We found that treatment with V3 peptide resulted in reduced phospho- p44/42 MAPK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11B</xref>). Importantly, the V3-induced deficits in p44/42 MAPK signaling were ameliorated by <italic>Ccr5</italic> knockdown in the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11D</xref>). These results demonstrate a signaling mechanism (i.e., reduced phospho- p44/42 MAPK signaling) underlying the protective effect of <italic>Ccr5</italic> knockdown in the V3 peptide induced plasticity and memory deficits.</p><p><italic>4) The authors refer to the publication by Lee et al. (2009) that reports opposite effects of Ccr5 loss on cognitive functions. Yet, they do not discuss this beyond commenting that this is &quot;likely due to genetic background effects&quot;. Lee et al. studied these mice in a mixed background while this work analyzes them in a C57BL/6N background. Yet, it is not clear why this difference is a &quot;likely&quot; explanation for this discrepancy. More compelling reasons need to be provided for the opposite phenotype of improved memory processes that is reported here and that is central to this study.</italic></p><p>There are at least two important factors that could have contributed to the different results observed between the study by Lee et al. and ours: 1) In their behavioral studies, Lee et al. used F2 hybrid mice as controls (B6/129 PF2/J background) for their <italic>Ccr5</italic><sup>-/-</sup> (B6J background) mice. There is an extensive literature demonstrating that to determine the effects of a mutation independently from other effects caused by genetic differences between mutants and controls, it is important that the mutant mice and their controls are in the same genetic background. For example, the hybrid mice used as controls in the Lee et al. study out-perform inbred mice, such as the B6J strain (genetic background of the <italic>Ccr5</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mutants in the Lee et al. study), in learning tasks. We also found that in a fear conditioning task, B6/129 hybrid mice given very weak training (one 0.5mA shock) showed similar memory levels (Wiltgen and Silva, 2007) as the C57BL/6NTac mice in our study that received very strong training (3x0.75mA shocks) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A and B</xref> in our current study). In contrast to the Lee et al. study, we used wild type (WT) littermates as controls for the <italic>Ccr5</italic><sup>-/-</sup> and <italic>Ccr5</italic><sup>+/-</sup> mutant mice we studied. In our study, both WT controls and <italic>Ccr5</italic> mice are in the same C57BL/6NTac background. 2) Additionally, Lee et al. used aged mice (12-18 month old) in their study, while we used adult mice (3-5 months old) for our experiments. Cell surface expression of CCR5 has been reported to change with age (Abraham et al., 2008), which may change the role of CCR5 in learning and memory during aging. We have modified our comment in the Discussion section as following &quot;Although a previous study (Lee et al., 2009) reported learning and memory deficits in aged CCR5 mutants, this study used aged mice (12-18 month old) and the control mice with a different genetic background&quot;.</p><p><italic>5) The finding that the effect on long-term memory after fear conditioning after shRNA knockdown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref> is higher than in the heterozygotic Ccr5 KO in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and possibly higher than in the full KO in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref> raises concerns about off-target effects. The authors can address this by testing whether delivery of Ccr5 shRNA causes effects in KO mice in one of the approaches presented here, e.g. the mEPSC recordings.</italic></p><p>We respectfully disagree with the reviewer. It is not uncommon to observe a certain amount of variability in behavioral performance across experiments (which could be due to factors such as environment, season changes, different experimenters, etc.). Because of behavioral variability, in all of our experiments we always compared the manipulation studied (knockout, knockdown) with appropriate experimental cohort controls.</p><p>For example, in the fear conditioning figures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Author response image 2</xref>), we show here the 8 different fear conditioning experiments we have performed with mice with lower levels of CCR5. Although the levels of mouse freezing vary between experiments, the freezing levels of the shRNA experiment fall within this range, and importantly, <italic>Ccr5<sup>+/-</sup>, Ccr5<sup>-/-</sup></italic>mice or mice with <italic>Ccr5</italic> knockdown consistently showed enhanced memory when compared to their controls that were trained and tested at the same time. These results provide strong evidence that lowering <italic>Ccr5</italic> levels result in enhanced learning and memory.<fig id="fig13" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.20985.028</object-id><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Fear conditioning results of WT and <italic>Ccr5<sup>+/-</sup>, Ccr5<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice or mice with <italic>Ccr5</italic> knockdown.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Mice were tested 1 day after fear conditioning training.

This would provide evidence that these signaling pathways are indeed linked to Ccr5 effects on neuronal function.</italic></p><p>Our results show that CCR5 transgenic mice that overexpress CCR5 in the excitatory neurons show decreased phospho-CREB levels 3 hours after fear conditioning training (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3C</xref>; we found the opposite result in <italic>Ccr5</italic> knockouts). Because of the critical role of CREB in memory consolidation (Bourtchuladze et al., 1994; Guzowski and McGaugh, 1997), this decrease in phospho-CREB accounts for the memory deficits of these transgenic mice.</p></body></sub-article></article>
