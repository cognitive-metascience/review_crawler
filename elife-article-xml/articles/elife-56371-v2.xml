In particular, signaling pathways controlling APP transport to the synapse in axons and dendrites remain to be identified. Having previously shown that Huntingtin (HTT), the scaffolding protein involved in Huntington’s disease, regulates neuritic transport of APP, we used a microfluidic corticocortical neuronal network-on-a-chip to examine APP transport and localization to the pre- and post-synaptic compartments. We found that HTT, upon phosphorylation by the Ser/Thr kinase Akt, regulates APP transport in axons but not dendrites. Expression of an unphosphorylatable HTT decreased axonal anterograde transport of APP, reduced presynaptic APP levels, and increased synaptic density. Ablating in vivo HTT phosphorylation in APPPS1 mice, which overexpress APP, reduced presynaptic APP levels, restored synapse number and improved learning and memory. The Akt-HTT pathway and axonal transport of APP thus regulate APP presynaptic levels and synapse homeostasis.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>alzheimer

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Synaptic homeostasis stabilizes neural circuits and ensures faithful communication within networks that are being continuously remodeled. It involves a complex interplay between presynaptic and postsynaptic proteins that modulates synaptic morphology and strength (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Südhof, 2018</xref>). Several studies suggest that amyloid precursor protein (APP) contributes to synapse homeostasis (for reviews see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hoe et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Müller et al., 2017</xref>), and although the evidence is not entirely consistent, this possibility has intuitive appeal because of APP’s involvement in diseases of cognition (e.g., Alzheimer’s disease, Lewy body dementia, and cerebral amyloid angiopathy)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Müller et al., 2017</xref>). Some studies suggest that loss of APP reduces synapse density (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Weyer et al., 2014</xref>), while others show that it increases the number of synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bittner et al., 2009</xref>). More firmly established is the fact that APP is transported both in axons and dendrites and localizes in both the pre- and post-synaptic compartments, where it could associate with synaptic release machinery to regulate neuronal transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Buggia-Prévot et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Das et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fanutza et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Groemer et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Klevanski et al., 2015</xref>). In addition, APP may function as an adhesion molecule at the synapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Müller et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Soba et al., 2005</xref>). Any modification in the transport of APP in either axons or dendrites thus has the potential to disrupt synaptic function or homeostasis. Therefore, there is a need to identify mechanisms and/or pathways that specifically regulate APP transport both in axons and/or dendrites and to determine whether manipulating these pathways control APP accumulation and synapse homeostasis.</p><p>APP is transported from the Golgi apparatus to the synapse in either dendrites or axons, and in both anterograde and retrograde directions by kinesin-1 and dynein, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brunholz et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gibbs et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Toh and Gleeson, 2016</xref>). We and others have shown that wild-type huntingtin (HTT), but not the polyglutamine-expanded HTT that causes Huntington’s disease (HD), facilitates APP transport by increasing the velocity of APP-containing vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Colin et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Her and Goldstein, 2008</xref>). HTT is a large scaffold protein that interacts with various protein complexes including molecular motor proteins and, regulates consequently the transport of several cargos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Saudou and Humbert, 2016</xref>). APP transport into neurites is altered upon reduction of HTT levels or by the presence of polyQ expansion on HTT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Colin et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Her and Goldstein, 2008</xref>). However, these studies did not distinguished axons from dendrites and did not investigate the consequences on APP levels at the synapse both in vitro and in vivo. Consequently, several questions remain to be addressed regarding the interplay between HTT and APP and its physiological consequences.</p><p>To answer these questions, we studied APP and HTT in a microfluidic device that reconstitutes a corticocortical neuronal network with separate presynaptic, synaptic, and postsynaptic compartments, and further tested our findings in APPPS1 mice, which display AD-like pathology. We find that subtle modifications of axonal transport of APP change synaptic levels of APP and have dramatic consequences on synapse function.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Developing an in vitro corticocortical network using microfluidic chambers</title><p>One of the major impediments to assessing APP transport in axons and dendrites under physiological conditions is the difficulty of recreating a mature neuronal network in a dish. Primary cultures are usually randomly distributed, with multidirectional, random connections. The use of Campenot chambers or microfluidic devices made it possible to separate axons from dendrites and soma, but neurons in these chambers are still not integrated into networks as they would be in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Taylor et al., 2005</xref>). We therefore turned to later-generation devices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Taylor et al., 2010</xref>) and modified them to reconstitute an oriented network with optimized connections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Moutaux et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Virlogeux et al., 2018</xref>). These devices contain three compartments (presynaptic, synaptic, and postsynaptic) that are fluidically isolated and separated by microchannels that are 5 μm high and 5 μm wide, but of two different lengths: 500 μm and 75 μm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The 500 μm channels allow only axons from the presynaptic compartment to reach the synaptic compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Taylor et al., 2005</xref>). The 75 μm long microchannels allow dendrites to cross from the postsynaptic to the synaptic compartment, where MAP2 staining shows they connect with axons coming from the presynaptic compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). We reconstructed a corticocortical network-on-a-chip since APP protein is expressed in the cortex, and AD largely targets iso- and archicortical brain regions. In these microfluidic devices, we observed full maturation of the corticocortical neuronal network between days in vitro (DIV) 10 and 15, as revealed by uptake of FM4-64, an indicator of endocytosis/exocytosis of functional synapses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).

The presynaptic level of APP thus appears to determine synapse number and can be modulated by HTT phosphorylation; this further supports a role for the Akt-HTT-APP pathway in synapse homeostasis. To ensure that the HTT<sub>SA</sub> mutation was not affecting neurodevelopment, we transduced a WT circuit at DIV8, when axon growth has ended (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Moutaux et al., 2018</xref>), with lentiviruses expressing APP-mCherry and either an N-terminal HTT construct containing the first 480 amino acids (HTT-480-WT) or a construct in which the S421 has been mutated into alanine (HTT-480-SA). We found that expressing the HTT-480-SA construct in mature neurons led to an increase in synaptic contacts similar to what is observed in HTT<sub>SA</sub> neurons differentiated in microchambers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A and C</xref>). This suggests that the HTT S421A mutation has no major role in axon growth and/or that the increase of synaptic contacts seen in HTT<sub>SA</sub> neurons is not due to changes in neurodevelopment but rather results from reduced transport and accumulation of APP at the presynapses. We then investigated the effect of APP overexpression in WT neurons. As in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>, APP-mCherry overexpression in WT neurons transduced with HTT-480-WT led to a decrease in the number of synaptic contacts.

All tests were performed during light phases of the diurnal cycle. Mice were group housed (4–6/cage) and had free access to food and water except during experiments. They were transported to the behavioral testing room and allowed to acclimate for at least 1 hr prior to initiating experiments.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Novel object recognition test (NOR)</title><p>The object recognition test is based on the natural tendency of rodents to spend more time investigating a novel object than a familiar one (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ennaceur and Delacour, 1988</xref>). The choice to explore the novel object reflects the use of recognition memory. Our protocol is similar to that previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Scholtzova et al., 2009</xref>). The object recognition test was carried out in an illuminated (30 lux) square gray PVC open field box (50 cm x 50 cm x 30 cm). The test consists of a familiarization session of 15 min in which mice explored the open field arena containing two identical, symmetrically placed objects (A1 and A2). The following day, a training session of 15 min was run with two novel identical objects (B1 and B2). Retention was tested 3 hr after the training session to evaluate object memory. During the retention trial, mice were exposed to a third exemplar of the familiar object (B3) and to a novel object (C1) for 10 min. Behavioral monitoring was done with ANY-maze (Stoelting, USA). The results were expressed as a recognition index, deﬁned as percentage of the time spent exploring the new object over the total time exploring the two objects. Experiments with animals whose exploration was not considered sufﬁcient to allow recognition (less than 6 s of exploration time during training and retention sessions) were discarded from analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Morris water maze test (MWM)</title><p>Spatial learning capacity was tested in the standard hidden-platform Morris water maze (MWM). The maze consisted of a large circular pool (diameter 150 cm) filled with water to a depth of 35 cm. The MWM protocol was adapted from a previous description (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lo et al., 2013</xref>). Briefly, mice were trained for 11 days to find a hidden platform (10 cm diameter) set at 1 cm beneath the surface of the water at a fixed position in a selected, constant quadrant. The water was opacified with non-toxic white paint (ACUSOL, Brenntag, Belgium) to prevent animals from seeing the platform. The water temperature was maintained at 25–26°C with four thermostatically controlled heaters (Askoll Therm XL 200W, Truffaut, France). The pool was situated at the center of a brightly lit room (~320 lux) with various fixed posters and visual cues placed on the walls to act as distal landmarks. There were four trials per training day with an inter-trial interval of 30 min. The mice were released into water at semi-randomly chosen cardinal compass points (N, E, S, and W). Mice failing to reach the platform within 90 s were gently guided to the platform and were left on it for 15 s, before being dried and returned to their home cages. Two days of rest were given after the 5th and 10th day of training. On the 11th day of training (i.e.: 72 hr after last training session), a probe trial was performed to evaluate robustness of spatial memory. During the probe trial, the platform was removed and mice were released into the pool from the side diagonally opposite to where the platform was located and allowed to swim freely for 90 s.</p><p>During all testing phases, a video camera was positioned above the pool for trial recording and the ANY-maze videotracking software was used. Rather than measuring latency or distance traveled, which could be biased by variations in swim speeds and path tortuosity, we analyzed the Corrected Integrated Path Length (CIPL) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gallagher et al., 1993</xref>) to assess learning during the 11 training days. During the probe test the percent of time spent in each quadrant was assessed.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Antibodies, plasmids and lentiviruses</title><p>Antibodies used are anti-: HTT (clone D7F7, Cell Signaling; 5656), pHTT-S421 pAb 3517 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Colin et al., 2008</xref>), GFP (for western blotting, Institut Curie, A-P-R#06), SNAP25 (AbCam, sb24737), Synaptophysin (Cell Signaling; s5768), PSD95 (Millipore; mab1598), p38 (AbCam, ab14692), APP (clone 22C11, Millipore; mab348), Lamin B1 (AbCam; ab133741), KHC (clone SUK4, Covance; MMS-188P), p-150 (BD Transduction Laboratories, 610474), MAP-2 (Millipore; AB5622), GFP (for Immunofluorescence experiments, AbCam; Ab13970), HA (clone 6E2, Cell Signaling, mAb#2367), Tubulin (Sigma; t9026) and GAPDH (Sigma; G9545).</p><p>APP-mCherry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Marquer et al., 2014</xref>) plasmid was cloned into pSIN lentiviral vector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Drouet et al., 2009</xref>) by Gateway system (Life Technology) using sense primer 5’-<named-content content-type="sequence">GGGGACAAGTTTGTACAAAAAAGCAGGCTTCGAATTCTGCAGTCGACGG</named-content>-3’ and anti-sense primer 5’-<named-content content-type="sequence">GGGGACCACTTTGTACAAGAAAGCTGGGTCGCGGCCGCCCTACTTGTACA</named-content>-3’ and recombination.

The protocol was adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zala et al., 2013</xref>. Briefly, frozen brains were homogenized in 700 uL of homogenization buffer (320 mM sucrose) by triturating with a Dounce homogenizer. Then, samples were centrifuged twice at 47.000 rcf for 10 min and the two supernatants were combined (S1). From S1, another ultracentrifugation was performed at 120.000 rcf for 40 min to obtain S2 and P2. The S2 fraction was put in another tube and 280 µL of 700 mM sucrose buffer was added under the S2 fraction. After a 2 hr centrifugation at 260 000 rcf, S3 and P3 were obtained. P3 fraction was resuspended in 50 µL of Re-suspension buffer (10 mM HEPES pH 7.3 and 320 mM sucrose). Antibodies used for western blot analysis are KHC (clone SUK4, Covance; MMS-188P,) and p150 (BD Transduction Laboratories, 610474).</p></sec><sec id="s10"><title>Primary Screen (modified SHIRPA)</title><p>The testing was carried out using a modified version of the standard protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rogers et al., 1997</xref>). HTT<sub>SA</sub> and WT littermate control mice were examined at 12 months of age. The primary screen began by observing undisturbed behavior in a viewing jar (clear Perspex cylinder, 15 cm x 11 cm) for 30 s (section 1). Thereafter, the mouse was transferred in the arena (55 cm x 33 cm x 18 cm) for testing of transfer arousal and observation of normal behavior (section 2). The observer also looked for any manifestation of bizarre or stereotyped behavior, convulsions and indications of spatial disorientation. This was followed by a sequence of manipulations using tail suspension and the grid across the width of the arena (section 3). To complete the assessment, the animal was restrained in a supine position to record autonomic behaviors (section 4).</p></sec><sec id="s11"><title>Open field activity (OF)</title><p>The open field test was used to assess locomotor activity (and anxiety-related behaviors). Mice were tested in a homogeneously illuminated (50 lux) circular open field arena made of white plastic (diameter: 54 cm) with 30 cm-high walls. Monitoring was done by an automated video tracking system (AnyMaze, Stoelting, Wood Dale, IL, USA). The main behavioral parameters analyzed during a single 10 min session in the OF were the total traveled distance and also the center-to-periphery exploration ratio.</p></sec><sec id="s12"><title>Grip force test</title><p>Mice were scruffed by the lower back and lowered towards a mesh grip piece attached to a force gauge (Bioseb) until the animal grabbed it with both front paws. The animal was then lowered toward the platform and gently pulled straight back with consistent force until it released its grip. The forelimb grip force was recorded on the strain gauge.</p></sec><sec id="s13"><title>Elevated plus maze (EPM)</title><p>The EPM was made of beige PVC and the center of the field illuminated at 70 lux. The apparatus was elevated 50 cm above ﬂoor level and consisted of four arms (35 cm ×5 cm). Two of the arms contained 15 cm-high walls (enclosed arms) and the other two had no walls (open arms). Each mouse was placed in the middle section facing an open arm and left to explore the maze for a single 5 min session with the experimenter out of view. Animals were video-recorded and their behavior automatically analyzed with the ANY-maze software. Percent time spent in open arms which is supposed to be inversely correlated to anxiety levels was measured for each mouse.</p></sec><sec id="s14"><title>Neuropathology</title><p>Following completion of behavioral testing, at 19 months of age, mice were anesthetized with pentobarbital (120 mg/kg) and then transcardially perfused with phosphate-buffer saline solution. The brain was extracted and carefully weighed on a precision balance. One hemisphere was snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and then stored at −80°C for subsequent biochemical analysis. The other half brain was fixed by immersion in freshly-made formaldehyde solution (3–4 days), then cryoprotected in a 2% - DMSO – 20% glycerol solution and finally cut on a freezing microtome (serial sections of 40 µm of the entire brain).</p><p>Amyloid deposits were labeled by standard Congo red staining (30 min in an 80% ethanol solution saturated with Congo red and sodium chloride). Microscopic scans of whole sections (pixel size 0.25 µm²) were acquired with a NanoZoomer 2.0-RS slide scanner (Hamamatsu Photonics, Hamamatsu, Japan). Amyloid loads were quantified using computer-based segmentation methods using the spot detector plugin of the ICY software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://icy.bioimageanalysis.org">http://icy.bioimageanalysis.org</ext-link>) that automatically calculates the proportion of stained tissue (p=stained area/total area), providing unbiased stereological measurements.</p></sec><sec id="s15"><title>Immunolabelling</title><p>For immunostaining, free-floating sections were washed in PBS 0.1M to remove cryoprotectant. The sections were treated with hydrogen peroxide for 10 min to quench endogenous peroxidase activity, permeabilized with 0.25% Triton X-100 in PBS 0.1M (PBSTx) for 20 min, pre-incubated in a 5% PBS-Tx normal goat serum (NGS) blocking solution and then incubated overnight at room temperature (RT) with the following primary antibodies : a biotinylated mouse anti-Aβ (4G8) (1:3000, Covance Antibody Products), a rabbit polyclonal antibody recognizing amyloid fibrils and fibrillary Aβ oligomers (<bold>OC</bold>) (1:3000, StressMarq Biosciences) and a rabbit polyclonal anti-prefibrillar Aβ oligomers (A11) (1:1000, generous gift of Dr. Kayed Rakez). The sections were incubated with a secondary biotinylated goat anti-rabbit antibody at RT for 90 min (this step was omitted for 4G8 antibody that was already biotinylated). Tissues were then incubated in the Vector Elite avidin-biotin peroxidase kit (1:800) for 90 min at RT. Finally, after washes in PBS-Tx and Tris 0.1M solutions, immunoreactivity was revealed using diaminobenzidine (DAB) as chromogen to visualize the reaction product. The sections were then mounted on Superfrost slides, dehydrated in a series of alcohols (30%, 50%, 70%, 2 × 90% and 2 × 100%), cleared in xylene, and coverslipped with EUKITT mounting medium.</p></sec><sec id="s16"><title>Analysis</title><p>Microscopic scans of immunostained brain sections were acquired with a <bold>NanoZoomer 2.0-RS slide scanner</bold> (Hamamatsu Photonics) at 40X magnification (pixel size 0.25 µm²). Selected regions of interest (ROIs) were delineated by using the Paxinos and Franklin Mouse Brain Atlas: sensori-motor (SM), Frontal (FR) and the hippocampus (HPC). ROIs were assessed across 2 to 6 consecutive serial sections (depending on structure) and were manually outlined on digitized sections. Computer-based segmentation methods were applied for 4G8 and OC immunostaining using the Best threshold plugins of the <bold>ICY</bold>) software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://icy.bioimageanalysis.org">https://icy.bioimageanalysis.org</ext-link>) that automatically calculate the proportion of stained tissue (p=stained area/total area) in each ROIs. For A11 immunostained sections, Aβ loads were calculated using the <bold>Ilastik</bold> interactive learning and segmentation toolkit software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://ilastick.org/index.html">https://ilastick.org/index.html</ext-link>). The frontal cortex, the sensori-motor cortex and the hippocampus brain regions were manually outlined on digitized sections. To evaluate the 4G8-detected Aβ loads, reference background staining of the corpus callosum was used to binarize the digitized image to 8-bits black and white image. The mean number of thresholded pixels per ROI was automatically calculated using an ICY image analysis software script. A minimum of 3 sections per brain ROIs per animal were analyzed and counting’s were reported to the overall ROI surface to provide the 4G8 amyloid loads.</p></sec><sec id="s17"><title>Aβ42 dosages</title><p>Hemi-forebrains (~200 mg) were harvested in 500 μl of solution containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 0.01% NP-40, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 0.1% SDS, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), and protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma). Soluble, extracellular-enriched proteins were collected from mechanically homogenized lysates following centrifugation for 10 min at 3,000 g. Cytoplasmic proteins were extracted from cell pellets mechanically dissociated with a micropipettor in 500 μl buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100 following centrifugation 90 min at 11,000 g. Supernatant was collected for dosages. Supernatants from cortical neurons plated in microchambers were collected on ice in polypropylene tubes (Corning, Corning, NY, USA) containing a protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche) and were then stored at −80°C Concentration of Aβ peptides were measured by Electro-Chemiluminescence Immuno-Assay (ECLIA) performed according to the manufacturer's instructions Meso Scale Discovery (MSD). Briefly, samples were analyzed using MSD SECTOR Imager 2400 (Meso Scale Discovery, Gaithersburg, MD, USA), with the Rodent Aβ triplex kit (from MSD) on carbon 96-well plates. 100 µl of blocking buffer solution were added to avoid non-specific binding. The plates were then sealed, wrapped in tin foil, and incubated at room temperature on a plate shaker (300 rpm) for 1 hr. Wells were then washed three times with washing buffer, and 25 µl of the standards and samples were then added to the wells, followed by an Aβ-detecting antibody at 1 µg/ml (MSD) labelled with a Ruthenium (II) trisbipyridine N-hydroxysuccinimide ester; this detection antibody was 4G8. Plates were then aspirated and washed three times. MSD read buffer (containing TPA) was added to wells before reading on the Sector Imager. A small electric current passed through a microelectrode present in each well producing a redox reaction of the Ru2+ cation, emitting 620 nm red light. The concentration of Aβ was calculated for each sample, using dose–response curves, the blank being cell-less culture medium. All the conditions were tested in duplicate. Aβ levels were normalized with total amount of proteins quantified by Bradford dosage.</p></sec></boxed-text></sec></app></app-group></back><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.56371.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Orr</surname><given-names>Harry T</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution>University of Minnesota</institution><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text><p>In the interests of transparency, eLife publishes the most substantive revision requests and the accompanying author responses.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Acceptance summary:</bold></p><p>Using S421D Htt and S421A knockin mice, this study nicely demonstrates the functional importance of Htt 421 phosphorylation on axonal transport of amyloid precursor protein. In addition, it demonstrates a role of neuronal cell-autonomous mechanisms, independent of the plaque/microglia-related toxicities, in the development of synaptic and behavioral impairments in amyloid AD models.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>[Editors’ note: the authors submitted for reconsideration following the decision after peer review. What follows is the decision letter after the first round of review.]</p><p>Thank you for choosing to send your work, &quot;Axonal Akt-Huntingtin pathway determines synaptic Aβ levels&quot;, for consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Senior Editor. Although the work is of interest, we regret to inform you that the findings at this stage are too preliminary for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>All reviewers found that your work addresses an important question – HTT's role in axonal transport, and using a physiologically relevant model system. However, there are key areas where it was felt that the status of the current work fell short. Thus, given that the amount of work needed to improve this study will take more than two months, we regret that we must reject the current manuscript. Since all reviewers noted the potential of this work, however, we would be happy to consider a new submission in the future as long as it addresses the key issues. If you select to submit a new and revised manuscript, it is critical that the Htt S421A knockin mice, a novel model, be characterized in more depth; e.g. are there developmental defects that might explain synaptic changes rather than the alterations in trafficking. In addition, since previous work linked Htt to trafficking of APP the conceptual advance of the current work is limited. To enhance the conclusion that this Htt/S421 phosphorylation pathway is relevant to AD direct data linking this pathway to AD needs to be presented, perhaps by crossing the Htt S421A mice to an amyloid AD mouse model.</p><p>Please note that we aim to publish articles with a single round of revision that would typically be accomplished within two months. This means that work that has potential, but in our judgment would need extensive additional work, will not be considered for in-depth review. We do not intend any criticism of the quality of the data or the rigor of the science. We wish you good luck with your work and we hope you will consider <italic>eLife</italic> for future submissions.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This utilizes an elegant microfluidic system to examine the role of the Htt protein in regulating axonal versus dendritic transport of APP. Previous support the concept that Htt regulates APP transport via phosphorylation of Htt at ser 412, but the specifics of its role and its mechanistic aspects remain unclear. Strengths of this study include the use of full length Htt in an experimental model that closely replicates physiological conditions of axonal and dendritic transport of APP. The basic finding of this study is that ser 421 phosphorylation promotes APP anterograde transport in axons but not in dendrites. In addition, they present data supporting the idea that Akt, a kinase previously shown to phosphorylate ser421, regulates anterograde transport of APP in axons. Unfortunately, to this reviewer's perspective, the potentially most important data are the least impressive. In Figures 4-6 data are presented on the ability of this ser421-Htt pathway to impact APP targeting to the synapse and numbers of synapses.

With chamber separated, primary neuronal cultures, the authors successfully measured the dynamics of APP trafficking in cortical axons and dendrites from synaptically connected cultures. They then used this system to demonstrate the absence of phosphorylation on Ser421 of Htt increased retrograde transport of APP in the axons, while its dendritic transport was unaffected. The authors furthered their findings with Akt inactive and constitutively active transgenes to demonstrate that activated Akt facilitates APP anterograde transport and this phenotype is dependent on the phosphorylation of Htt-Ser421. The authors used a previously described Htt S421A knockin mouse model (HttSA) that allows for the study of this phosphorylation site in the context of the intact Htt gene and full-length protein as a source for their primary cultures. Using the same co-culture system, they suggest that synaptic APP exocytosis is reduced in HttSA cultures. Consistent with this, reduced amounts of synaptic Aβ in the presynaptic compartment of adult HttSA cortices in vivo was identified. Then by testing combinations of wildtype and HttSA cells cultured in separate but synaptically connected chambers, they found that HttSA results in decreased APP in the synaptic compartment only when cultured on the presynaptic side. Finally, the authors examined the Aβ levels in the synaptosomal fractions of HttSA versus wildtype cortex and measured changes in synaptic size and density in CA1, finding a reduction in Aβ and smaller but increased density of synapses in CA1. Overall, the authors concluded that phosphorylation of Htt at Ser421 by Akt regulates APP trafficking in axons but not dendrites and results in altered synapse size and number.</p><p>The question of the physiological function of Htt is an important one for both basic biological and neurodegenerative disease reasons. Similarly, APP trafficking is tied to both basic and neurodegenerative disease processes and tying these proteins together mechanistically would be a significant advance. The strength of the manuscript lies in the use of the chambered primary culture system to physically isolate the presynaptic cells, synaptic compartment, and postsynaptic cells and combine this with knockin HttSA mouse cells and transfection/infection of wildtype cells to convincingly demonstrate altered APP trafficking and exocytosis in presynaptic HttSA cells. In addition, the use of the HttSA mouse versus wildtype to characterized changes in Aβ and synaptic APP is informative. However, there are a few major issues need to be addressed to strengthen the study.</p><p>1) Major conclusions in this study rely on the precise compartmentalization of axons and dendrites in the microfluidic device.

If so, this mouse could be utilized in primary cortical neuronal culture to determine if APP transport and exocytosis was accelerated and examine if the synaptic changes observed in HttS421A are the opposite in Htt S421D in vivo?</p><p>4) Another general concern is whether S421 mutation could change the levels of Htt expression?

First, the authors show that Huntingtin (HTT) phosphorylation at S421 regulates APP transport in axons, but not in dendrites. Second, as the authors previously published that Akt is the kinase that phosphorylates HTT at S421 (Humbert et al., 2002), they validate their previous findings by demonstrating that constitutively active form of Akt (Akt-CA) increases APP transport in the wildtype cortical neurons, but not in HTT S421A neurons, suggesting that the Akt-HTT pathway regulates APP transport in axons. Third, the authors found that APP levels in the presynaptic compartment are decreased in HTTS421A neurons compared to the wildtype. Fourth, they further measure Aβ levels in synaptosomes in HTT S421A neurons and found decreased, and suggest that a decrease in APP and Aβ levels in HTT S421A neurons is due to APP trafficking defects. Lastly, using electron microscopy, the authors examine axonal terminals, spines and synapses in HTT S421A/S421A mouse hippocampus and found shorter postsynaptic density (PSD) length and higher number of synapses compared to the wildtype mice.</p><p>This study presents exciting data on the role of HTT phosphorylation in APP transport, but there are some major comments:</p><p>Last Figure 6C raises some question on its relevance to APP transport and even more questions on the HTTS421A/S421A knockin mouse phenotype.

Previous support the concept that Htt regulates APP transport via phosphorylation of Htt at ser 412, but the specifics of its role and its mechanistic aspects remain unclear. Strengths of this study include the use of full length Htt in an experimental model that closely replicates physiological conditions of axonal and dendritic transport of APP. The basic finding of this study is that ser 421 phosphorylation promotes APP anterograde transport in axons but not in dendrites. In addition, they present data supporting the idea that Akt, a kinase previously shown to phosphorylate ser421, regulates anterograde transport of APP in axons. Unfortunately, to this reviewer's perspective, the potentially most important data are the least impressive. In Figures 4-6 data are presented on the ability of this ser421-Htt pathway to impact APP targeting to the synapse and numbers of synapses. While the impact is statistically significant, effect size blocking ser421 phosphorylation has on AB transport and synaptic number is very subtle. This leaves this reviewer unsure as to the biological relevance of this pathway on regulating synaptic aspects in vivo.</p></disp-quote><p>All three reviewers felt that we needed to bolster the physiological relevance of the work. We have now conducted a number of new experiments and present the new data throughout the manuscript. In brief, we found that presynaptic APP levels rather than Ab loads correlate with synapse number both in vitro and in vivo (new Figures 5, 6, 7 and 8, Figure 8—figure supplement 1). Crossing HTTSA mice with APP-PS1 mice rescued the latter’s synapse number and improved learning and memory, indicating a link between APP anterograde axonal transport, synapse number and morphology as well as cognitive behaviors in vivo (new Figures 8 and 9).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[…] There are a few major issues need to be addressed to strengthen the study.</p><p>1) Major conclusions in this study rely on the precise compartmentalization of axons and dendrites in the microfluidic device.

If these processes are not neatly separated, how can they be certain the kymographs are measuring APP vesicular transport in different neuronal processes?</p></disp-quote><p>This is an important point, and one we are happy to clarify. Given that dendrites cannot grow over 300µm, and that we capture the transport of vesicles in the distal part (the last 100µm of these microchannels), we are assessing the transport of vesicles in axons only. The fact that axons but not dendrites are present in the distal part is attested by the negative staining for MAP2 (Virlogeux et al., 2018). Conversely, to be certain that we are recording transport of vesicles in dendrites, we are capturing events in the dendritic channels and use MAP2-GFP infection of the postsynaptic neurons to make sure that transport is recorded in dendrites only. The new Figure 1B shows that synapses formed within the synaptic chamber are made from the presynaptic bouton coming from the presynaptic chamber (GFP-transduced neurons) and the postsynaptic dendrite coming from the postsynaptic chamber (MAP2 staining). We conclude that we can measure specifically APP vesicular transport in axons versus dendrites.</p><p>We should note that the capacity of microfluidic devices to compartmentalize axons and dendrites is now well established (e.g., (Lehigh, et al., 2017)), and we have carefully characterized the three-compartment device we use here (Virlogeux et al., 2018).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The CA-Akt construct is somewhat artificial. Can they overexpress or knockdown Akt to change APP anterograde trafficking in axons? What happens to manipulate Akt activity or levels to the dendritic trafficking of APP?</p></disp-quote><p>To answer the second question first: We previously demonstrated that overexpression of Akt or treatment with the Akt physiological activator IGF-1 enhances anterograde transport (Colin et al., 2008, Zala et al., 2008). Here, we used the Akt-CA (constitutively active) construct, which significantly enhances Akt activity in neurons, because – though we agree it is somewhat artificial – it strongly activates Akt and it reliably induces HTT phosphorylation (unlike, say, using IGF1). This enables us not only to avoid the activation of other IGF-1-dependent pathways but also to demonstrate that since the Akt-mediated effect is lost when HTT cannot be phosphorylated, this effect is due solely to Akt-induced HTT phosphorylation.</p><p>To make sure that expression of Akt-CA did not produce artifacts, we used an Akt construct that contains a mutation at K179 that blocks its catalytic activity and shows some dominant-negative activity over endogenous Akt. The previous Figure 3A showed a significant difference in anterograde transport of APP in axons between WT + AKT-N versus WT neuron + Akt-CA.</p><p>To assess the effect of reducing Akt activity, we measured anterograde transport in WT neurons transduced with GFP, AKT-N and Akt-CA. Akt-N led to a reduction of APP anterograde flux when compared to Akt-CA and GFP, indicating that reducing Akt activity decreases anterograde axonal transport of APP by increasing the speed of retrograde moving vesicles (new Figure 4C). Finally, we show that HTT phosphorylation has no effect on dendrites.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Was a Htt S421D mouse knockin model generated in parallel to the HttSA model? If so, this mouse could be utilized in primary cortical neuronal culture to determine if APP transport and exocytosis was accelerated and examine if the synaptic changes observed in HttS421A are the opposite in Htt S421D in vivo?</p></disp-quote><p>We did indeed generate a HTT-S421D knock-in mouse. We utilized this model to prepare cortical neuronal cultures and analyze transport in axons and dendrites in parallel to WT and HTTSA neurons. These results (new Figure 3A and B) show that in axons, APP transport in HTT<sub>SD</sub> neurons is significantly different from the transport in HTT<sub>SA</sub> neurons for anterograde and retrograde velocities, cumulative distance and net directional flux. Compared to WT, anterograde transport is slightly increased in HTT<sub>SD</sub> neurons, because the WT neurons are cultured in high percentage of serum and HTT is highly phosphorylated in these conditions (our personal observations). See also the western blot of the new Figure 4A showing that levels of phospho-HTT are similar between GFP and Akt-CA transduced neurons.</p><p>We also measured exocytosis by expressing HTT-S421D in Cos cells. The level of exocytosis of APP-SEP in cells transfected with pARIS-HTT<sub>SD</sub> was similar to that of pARIS-HTT<sub>WT</sub> cells but significantly different from cells transfected with pARIS-HTT<sub>SA</sub>.</p><p>Thus, WT and HTT<sub>SD</sub> neurons or constructs behave similarly, because HTT is mostly phosphorylated in our experimental conditions. Therefore, in most of the experiments, we compared WT and HTT<sub>SA</sub> conditions.</p><fig id="sa2fig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Extended version of Figure 5A showing the comparison in APP exocytosis in cells expressing WT full length HTT (pARIS HTT WT), or version with S421A (pARIS HTT SA) or S421D (pARIS HTT SD) mutations.</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-56371-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Another general concern is whether S421 mutation could change the levels of Htt expression?

As previously shown by others and us, silencing HTT reduces both anterograde and retrograde axonal transport (Colin et al., 2008, Gauthier et al., 2004, Her and Goldstein, 2008) while S421 phosphorylation affects directionality ((Colin et al., 2008) and this study). Therefore, knockdown or knockout of endogenous HTT cannot mimic the SA mutation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The discussion on the link of Akt-HTT pathway to AD pathophysiology appears tenuous at the best.

Without such study, they should avoid speculating the role of Akt-HTT pathway in AD pathophysiology, and limit their interpretation on the pathway in the physiological trafficking of wildtype APP.</p></disp-quote><p>To evaluate the pathophysiological relevance of our findings, we crossed HTT<sub>SA</sub> mice with APPPS1 mice, which bear mutations that reproduce features of familial Alzheimer’s disease (amyloid plaques, loss of synapses, and cognitive defects (Bittner et al., 2012, Radde et al., 2006, Zou et al., 2015)). We found that blocking HTT phosphorylation in APPPS1/HTT<sub>SA</sub> mice leads to a reduction of APP levels in the presynaptic compartment, along with complete rescue in synapse number and in post-synaptic density length – all without any effect on Ab accumulation or plaques. Importantly, we found that HTTSA mutation significantly improved spatial and non-spatial memory in APPPS1 mice. We conclude that blocking Akt phosphorylation at HTT S421 reduces APP presynaptic levels and improves learning and memory in APPPS1 mice. These experiments are shown in new Figures 8 and 9 and new Figure 9—figure supplement 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>[…] Last Figure 6C raises some question on its relevance to APP transport and even more questions on the HTTS421A/S421A knockin mouse phenotype.

As shown in new Figure 6—figure supplement 1, and in Supplementary file 1, we did not find any motor or cognitive defects in these mice. Also, these mice do not show changes in HTT expression (Ehinger et al., 2020).</p><p>There were, however, differences from WT revealed by anatomical MRI (new Figure 6A and B). HTT<sub>SA</sub> mice showed a significant increase of the whole brain volume (4,8 %) affecting the hippocampus (8,5%) and the cortex (3,7%) but not the striatum. An in-depth characterization of soma size, dendrite length, axonal length, etc. was beyond the scope of this study, but the results would not alter the findings that HTT dephosphorylation affects axonal APP transport, synapse number and morphology.</p><p>We believe that this question of reviewer 3 is related to a point raised by the Editors: “Are there developmental defects that might explain synaptic changes rather than the alterations in trafficking?” This is an important but difficult question to answer, since there is evidence that axonal transport affects axonal development, and a dispositive experiment would require selective HTT dephosphorylation in adult mice. We tried to investigate the effect of APP and HTT dephosphorylation in mature circuits in vivo in order to bypass any developmental contribution to the observed effect in adult mice. We stereotaxically injected lentiviruses expressing APP in the entorhinal cortex of 4-month-old animals and counted synapses 2 months later. Unfortunately, we could not detect any changes in the synapse number (data not shown) as compared to what is observed in APP/PS1 mice (see new Figure 8C), making the experiment not possible.</p><p>We therefore performed the following experiments: we first tested whether our microfluidic device can be used to assess synapse number. We found that an HTT<sub>SA</sub> circuit shows more synapses, indicating that circuits-on-a-chip recapitulate in vivo circuit characteristics (new Figure 7A). We then tested APP overexpression as a strategy to increase the quantity of APP within the presynaptic cortical compartment of a WT or HTT<sub>SA</sub> network (new Figure 7B). WT or HTT<sub>SA</sub> neurons were transduced with a lentivirus expressing APP at DIV7 and synapse number was measured at DIV12. Overexpressing APP in WT presynaptic cortical neurons decreased synaptic contacts, but overexpressing APP in HTT<sub>SA</sub> presynaptic cortical neurons restored synaptic contacts back to the levels seen in WT neurons (new Figure 7B). The presynaptic level of APP thus appears to determine synapse number and can be modulated by HTT phosphorylation; this further supports a role for the Akt-HTT-APP pathway in synapse homeostasis.</p><p>To circumvent any potential effect of the HTT<sub>SA</sub> mutation on axonal growth, we transduced WT circuit at DIV8 – when axon growth has ended(Moutaux et al., 2018) – with lentiviruses expressing APP and either an N-terminal HTT construct containing the first 480 amino acids (HTT480-WT) or a construct in which S421 has been mutated into alanine (HTT-480-SA). We found that expressing the HTT-480-SA construct in mature neurons led to an increase in synaptic contacts similar to what we observed in HTT<sub>SA</sub> neurons differentiated in microchambers (new Figure 7A and C). This suggests that the HTT S421A mutation has no major role in axon growth and/or that the increase of synaptic contacts seen in HTT<sub>SA</sub> neurons is not due to changes in neurodevelopment but rather on reducing the transport and accumulation of APP at the presynapses. We then investigated the effect of APP overexpression in WT neurons. As in Figure 7B, APP overexpression in WT neurons transduced with HTT-480-WT led to a decrease in the number of synaptic contacts. However, it had no effect in neurons expressing HTT-480-SA, indicating that HTT dephosphorylation reduces the effect of APP overexpression on synapse number (new Figure 7D). We conclude that reducing anterograde axonal transport of APP either during axonal growth or in mature networks is sufficient to modulate synaptic contacts.</p><p>Finally, we report that blocking HTT phosphorylation in APPPS1/HTT<sub>SA</sub> mice leads to a reduction of APP levels in the presynaptic compartment, and a rescue in synapse number and in postsynaptic density length, while having no effect on Ab accumulation or plaques (new Figure 8 and Figure 8—figure supplement 1). Importantly, HTT<sub>SA</sub> significantly improved spatial and non-spatial memory in APPPS1 mice (new Figure 9 and Figure 9—figure supplement 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition, it may be important to define the mechanism of APP transport in the axons by further validating previous findings (Colin et al., 2008) such as whether HTT S421 phosphorylation is required for Kinesin-1 recruitment to microtubules and vesicles using HTTS421A/S421A knockin mouse.</p></disp-quote><p>We provide subcellular fractionation of cytosolic and vesicular fractions from WT and HTT<sub>SA</sub> mouse brains showing a trend towards a decreased association of kinesin-1 and HTT<sub>SA</sub> vesicles (new Figure 3—figure supplement 1).
