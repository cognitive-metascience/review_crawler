SCML2 is a mammalian homolog of <italic>Drosophila</italic> SCM, a <italic>Polycomb</italic>-group protein that associates with PRC1. In this study, we show that SCML2A, an SCML2 isoform tightly associated to chromatin, contributes to PRC1 localization and also directly enforces repression of certain <italic>Polycomb</italic> target genes. SCML2A binds to PRC1 via its SPM domain and interacts with ncRNAs through a novel RNA-binding region (RBR). Targeting of SCML2A to chromatin involves the coordinated action of the MBT domains, RNA binding, and interaction with PRC1 through the SPM domain. Deletion of the RBR reduces the occupancy of SCML2A at target genes and overexpression of a mutant SCML2A lacking the RBR causes defects in PRC1 recruitment. These observations point to a role for ncRNAs in regulating SCML2 function and suggest that SCML2 participates in the epigenetic control of transcription directly and in cooperation with PRC1.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02637.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02637.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02637.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Almost every cell in our bodies has the same genes but at any one time different genes will be switched on in different cells. Much of the DNA in a cell is wrapped around proteins called histones to form a compact structure called chromatin. The DNA in chromatin is often so tightly packed that the genes in the DNA cannot to be accessed or switched on.</p><p>A complex of proteins called the Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 (or PRC1 for short) pack DNA into chromatin to switch genes off (and keep them off) in both plants and animals. Other proteins are known to weakly bind to this complex, including one called SCM in fruit flies. However, this protein has not been extensively studied.</p><p>Bonasio, Lecona et al. have now looked at a related version of this protein that binds to chromatin in humans. These experiments revealed that this protein, which is called SCML2A, also binds to molecules of RNA, and Bonasio, Lecona et al. also identified a previously unrecognized domain within SCML2A that interacts with these molecules.</p><p>Like other domains in this protein that bind to PRC1 and histones, SCML2A needs its RNA-binding region to be able to bind to chromatin in order to target and switch off certain genes. As such, the findings of Bonasio, Lecona et al. support models whereby RNA molecules can regulate the expression of genes, and suggest that some RNA molecules do this by interacting with SCML2A.</p><p>Future work is needed to address whether RNA molecules serve as guides that direct SCML2A to specific genes that need to be switched off, or whether these molecules' roles are more complex.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02637.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02637.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>Polycomb</kwd><kwd>noncoding RNA</kwd><kwd>chromatin</kwd><kwd>SCML2</kwd><kwd>PRC1</kwd><kwd>MBT</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM-64844, R37-37120</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Reinberg</surname><given-names>Danny</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Reinberg</surname><given-names>Danny</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CA-16359</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Parisi</surname><given-names>Fabio</given-names></name><name><surname>Kluger</surname><given-names>Yuval</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The Polycomb group protein SCML2 contributes to the assembly and gene silencing function of Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 (PRC1) and requires an RNA-binding region to reach chromatin targets.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Polycomb group (PcG) genes are key epigenetic regulators in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, mammals, and plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Schuettengruber et al., 2007</xref>). PcG mutants fail to maintain transcriptional repression of differentiation genes during development, which results in their ectopic expression, compromised patterning of the embryo, and homeotic transformations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lewis, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Struhl, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Simon et al., 1992</xref>). Most PcG genes encode proteins that recognize chromatin or modify its structure, often by forming multi-subunit protein complexes such as <italic>Polycomb</italic> repressive complex 1 (PRC1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Simon and Kingston, 2009</xref>). Genetic screens and biochemical studies have identified several additional PcG proteins that are not stable components of known <italic>Polycomb</italic> complexes. One of these proteins is sex comb on midleg (SCM), which is required for appropriate body patterning during embryonic development in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Simon et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bornemann et al., 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">1998</xref>). SCM and its human homologs were recovered in sub-stoichiometric amounts after biochemical purifications of the PRC1 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Shao et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Levine et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gao et al., 2012</xref>), suggesting a functional link between SCM and PRC1. SCM also belongs to a small family of proteins characterized by the presence of a conserved malignant brain tumor domain (MBT), which functions as a binding module for methylated lysines on histones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bonasio et al., 2010a</xref>), further suggesting that SCM might function on chromatin. In addition to the MBT domain, SCM contains a C-terminal SPM domain, through which it is thought to interact with PRC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Peterson et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>Despite the crucial importance of PcG proteins in gene regulation, development, and disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sparmann and van Lohuizen, 2006</xref>), a coherent model that explains how these proteins are recruited and regulate different target genes in different cell lineages is lacking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Simon and Kingston, 2009</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, arrays of DNA motifs recognized by a variety of transcription factors function as recruitment ‘hubs’ for PRCs and are known as <italic>Polycomb</italic> responsive elements (PREs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Müller and Kassis, 2006</xref>); however, PREs alone are not sufficient to explain or predict the genome-wide occupancy patterns of PcG complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Simon and Kingston, 2009</xref>). In mammals, our understanding of PRC targeting is even more limited, given that only a few examples of PRE-like DNA elements have been described to date (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bengani et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cuddapah et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sing et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Woo et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">2013</xref>) and several of the transcription factors that bind and recruit <italic>Drosophila</italic> PRCs are absent or poorly conserved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Schuettengruber et al., 2007</xref>). Moreover, there are several mammalian versions of the two best characterized <italic>Drosophila</italic> PcG complexes, PRC1 and PRC2, which differ in subunit composition and chromatin localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kuzmichev et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Margueron et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gao et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>The mammalian PRC1 closest in subunit composition to their <italic>Drosophila</italic> homolog (PRC1.2 and PRC1.4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gao et al., 2012</xref>]) have conserved functions in development and disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Richly et al., 2011</xref>) and contain subunits that recognize trimethylated lysine 27 of histone H3 (H3K27me3), the catalytic product of PRC2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cao et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kuzmichev et al., 2002</xref>). However, the mechanistic details of PRC1 repression in mammals are poorly understood. Although H3K27me3 may contribute to stabilizing some forms of PRC1 on chromatin, the genome-wide distribution of PRC1 is largely unchanged in embryonic stem cells that do not have H3K27me3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tavares et al., 2012</xref>), and many PRC1 complexes do not contain the subunit that binds to H3K27me3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gao et al., 2012</xref>). Various factors, including RUNX1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yu et al., 2012</xref>) and the RNA helicase MOV10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">El Messaoudi-Aubert et al., 2010</xref>), have also been proposed to guide PRC1 recruitment in specific contexts, but an overarching model remains lacking. Given that increasing evidence points to a role for noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) in mediating recruitment of chromatin complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Koziol and Rinn, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wang and Chang, 2011</xref>) and that at least one ncRNA has been shown to make contact with PRC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yap et al., 2010</xref>), we hypothesized that an RNA-binding chromatin protein may be involved in PRC1 recruitment in mammals.</p><p>The potential role of SCM and its mammalian homologs in the regulation of PRC1 and function remain unexplored. A recent study showed that <italic>Drosophila</italic> SCM is recruited to the PRE upstream of <italic>Ultrabithorax</italic> independent of PRC1 or PRC2, whereas PRC1 and PRC2 binding requires the presence of SCM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wang et al., 2010b</xref>). The human genome comprises four genes with homology to <italic>Scm</italic>, but only two that contain conserved MBT, SPM, and DUF3588 domains, <italic>SCMH1</italic> and <italic>SCML2</italic>. <italic>SCMH1</italic> functions in spermatogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Takada et al., 2007</xref>), whereas little is known about <italic>SCML2</italic>, except that it is ubiquitously expressed and that deletions of its coding sequence are found in a subset of medulloblastomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Northcott et al., 2009</xref>), suggesting it may have tumor-suppressive activity.</p><p>In this study, we report that SCML2 interacts with ncRNAs through an RNA-binding region (RBR), contributes to the recruitment of PRC1 to target genes and also directly collaborates in gene repression. Furthermore, we show that the chromatin localization of SCML2 is achieved through the combined action of the RBR, MBT, and SPM domains and that the expression of ΔRBR mutants of SCML2 causes mislocalization of PRC1.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>SCML2 interacts with RNA through a novel RNA-binding region</title><p>Interaction with RNA regulates recruitment and assembly of several chromatin-associated factors, including members of the <italic>Polycomb</italic> and <italic>trithorax</italic> groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rinn et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Khalil et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kanhere et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tsai et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kaneko et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">2014</xref>).

Although the most prominent bands recovered by pull-down of SCML2 fragments corresponded to ribosomal RNA, this was most likely due to their abundance in the input and not to a specific interaction.

Because the region spanning 256–330 bears no resemblance to other known RNA-binding domains, we tentatively refer to it as the RNA binding region (RBR) of SCML2. The SCML2 RBR exhibited little specificity for RNA sequence, but discriminated between RNA and DNA in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), and strongly preferred single-stranded to double-stranded RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, left).

The RBR displayed an affinity for nucleosome particles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), but much lower than for RNA as demonstrated by the fact that nucleosomes could not compete with <italic>HOTAIR</italic> RNA for binding to the RBR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). When both nucleosomes and RNA were present in limiting amounts, we noticed the appearance of a super-shifted band that was not observed when either species were added separately (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, asterisk), suggesting that the RBR—and therefore SCML2—is capable of forming a ternary complex with nucleosomes and RNA simultaneously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>).

Indeed, cell differentiation caused a measurable shift in the pool of lincRNAs associated with SCML2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>), suggesting that in addition to intrinsic binding preferences, cellular context may also determine which RNAs bind to SCML2 and, in turn, how its function and distribution on chromatin is affected by these interactions. This phenomenon was not restricted to lincRNAs. RIP for SCML2 also recovered a variety of mRNAs, some of which were specific for certain states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>).</p><p>We also found several examples of unannotated ncRNAs that were enriched in SCML2 RIPs compared to input RNA and were transcribed near SCML2 ERs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B–E</xref>), which is consistent with the notion that some ncRNAs interacting with SCML2 might act in <italic>cis</italic>.

Together with the observation that SCML2B retains the ability to repress a reporter independent of BMI1 recruitment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), these findings reinforce the notion that SCML2 represses transcription by itself, and that, in its absence, PRC1 alone is not sufficient to maintain repression at all target genes.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Proteins belonging to the <italic>Polycomb</italic> and <italic>trithorax</italic> group are epigenetic regulators and maintain specialized chromatin structures that are refractory or permissive to transcription, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Schuettengruber et al., 2007</xref>). Unlike conventional transcription factors, these proteins do not contain a DNA binding domain that directs them to targets on chromatin; instead, there is accumulating evidence that recruitment and regulation of PcG proteins are coordinated by a number of molecular pathways that act in a combinatorial fashion to repress specific genes in different cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Simon and Kingston, 2013</xref>).</p><p><italic>Drosophila</italic> SCM and its human homologs, including SCML2, associate with the PRC1 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Shao et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Levine et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gao et al., 2012</xref>), but their role in PRC1 function has remained elusive. Here, we have unveiled two mechanisms by which SCML2A contributes to PRC1 function: (1) SCML2 and PRC1 cooperate in chromatin binding, as evidenced by loss of BMI1 upon overexpression of SCML2A<sub>ΔRBR</sub>, recruitment of BMI1 by SCML2A at artificial tethering sites, and the weak association of SCML2B to chromatin; and (2) SCML2 enforces repression at some target sites independent of the presence of PRC1. In addition, our results show that RNA binding also plays a role in SCML2 function, as it is required for its localization to chromatin.</p><p>In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, the interaction of SCM and PRC1 relies on the C-terminal SPM domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Peterson et al., 2004</xref>) and our results show that a similar mechanism is conserved in humans. Genome-wide analyses revealed an extensive overlap of SCML2A target sites with those of BMI1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), suggesting that this interaction is relevant in a chromatin context. Despite the considerable overlap some sites were occupied by SCML2 or BMI1 alone. The former might reflect the complexity of PRC1 subtypes in mammals and the fact that SCML2 is also part of PRC1.2, which does not contain BMI1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gao et al., 2012</xref>); the latter is likely due to the higher sensitivity of the BMI1 antibody, although we cannot exclude that some BMI1 target sites are devoid of SCML2. Together with genetic evidence in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Simon et al., 1992</xref>) and mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Takada et al., 2007</xref>), these observations firmly establish SCML2 as an important player in <italic>Polycomb</italic>-mediated epigenetic regulation. Consistent with this, the SCML2B isoform, which lacks the SPM domain, does not bind to BMI1 and is unable to recruit PRC1 to chromatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>); however, when artificially tethered to a chromatinized reporter, SCML2B is still capable to repress it (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), suggesting that SCML2 (and possibly other SCM homologs) might directly enforce gene repression. This notion is further supported by the observation that knockdown for <italic>SCML2</italic> causes derepression of target genes without affecting BMI1 levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). This PRC1-independent silencing may be mediated by the MBT domain, which binds to methylated histone tails (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Grimm et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Santiveri et al., 2008</xref>) and, in the case of L3MBTL1, represses transcription via chromatin compaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Trojer et al., 2007</xref>). In fact, the MBT domain of SCM in <italic>Drosophila</italic> is important for repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Grimm et al., 2007</xref>), and our results show that the MBT domain contributes to the chromatin localization of SCML2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>).</p><p>In vitro binding assays and domain mapping experiments revealed the existence of a previously unknown RBR within SCML2. Despite the fact that the 74-residue fragment containing the RBR is both necessary and sufficient for RNA binding in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1 fig2">Figures 1 and 2</xref>), prediction algorithms failed to detect known protein folds or the propensity to form secondary structures in this region, suggesting that, in isolation, the RBR remains unstructured. This is not entirely unexpected, considering that induced fit is a common feature of RNA–protein interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Williamson, 2000</xref>). For example, the fragile X syndrome protein FMR1/FMRP contains an arginine-rich stretch that is disordered in solution but becomes ordered in presence of an RNA ligand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Phan et al., 2011</xref>). Although the RBR was dispensable for the interaction with PRC1, its disruption resulted not only in a delocalization of SCML2A from chromatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), but also in decreased PRC1 occupancy at several target genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). This observation is intriguing in view of the fact that short-term <italic>SCML2</italic> knockdown did not affect BMI1 localization, and suggests that nucleoplasmic SCML2<sub>ΔRBR</sub>, being still capable of interacting with BMI1 through the SPM domain, might function in a dominant negative fashion, titrating PRC1 away from chromatin.</p><p>RIP-seq identified several species of RNAs that associate with SCML2, including annotated lincRNAs, unannotated RNAs, and protein-coding mRNAs. Despite promiscuous RNA binding in vitro, SCML2–RNA interactions appeared to be specific in vivo, as demonstrated by the following observations: (1) the profile of lincRNAs enriched in the SCML2A WT RIP-seq was unique and distinct from input and control samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>); (2) the lincRNAs associated with SCML2 changed upon cellular differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>); and (3) several divergently transcribed ncRNAs were enriched in SCML2 RIPs although the coding mRNAs originating from the same locus were not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B–E</xref>). The latter also demonstrates that physical proximity on chromatin alone was not the main determinant of SCML2–RNA interactions. Furthermore, the RBR is likely required to mediate the interactions with these RNAs, given that immunoprecipitation of the ΔRBR mutant recovered less RNA than the WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>) and that the few detected ΔRBR-associated RNAs were undistinguishable from those obtained in empty tag-expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). We propose that the RBR of SCML2A contributes to its recruitment either by interacting with <italic>trans-</italic>acting RNAs transcribed from distant intergenic loci, or by recognizing <italic>cis</italic>-acting ncRNAs. The latter may include divergent and overlapping antisense ncRNAs that originate downstream of the TSS, some of which have a demonstrated role in gene regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Faghihi and Wahlestedt, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Modarresi et al., 2012</xref>), or promoter-associated ncRNAs that originate near the TSS of coding genes and are transcribed from the same strand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kapranov et al., 2007</xref>), similar to the ncRNAs reported to bind PRC2 via SUZ12 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kanhere et al., 2010</xref>). We note that despite the examples shown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B–E</xref>) and several others, we could not detect a significant spatial association between the RIP-seq and ChIP-seq signals at the genome-wide level (data not shown). This might be due to the fact that only a subset of the SCML2-associated ncRNAs act in <italic>cis</italic> or to the intrinsically noisy nature of the RIP-seq signal. Future studies utilizing improved technologies and/or different cellular and genetic tools will be needed to fully characterize the set of SCML2-associated ncRNAs and their mechanism of action.</p><p>Using different experimental approaches, we have dissected the molecular interplay of SCML2 and PRC1. We have identified a novel RBR in SCML2 that contributes to its chromatin localization. Along with the recognition of methylated lysines by the MBT domain, the RNA-binding activity of the RBR is required to recruit or stabilize SCML2 on chromatin. We propose that SCML2A is then retained at target genes through the interaction with PRC1 and that, in turn, SCML2A contributes to stabilizing PRC1. We also report that, at a subset of genes, SCML2 appears to enforce repression directly, independent of PRC1 recruitment, via mechanisms that remain to be elucidated.</p><p>The identification of SCML2 as a PcG protein that binds RNA and contributes to repression of <italic>Polycomb</italic> targets will help shed new light on the interplay between ncRNAs and epigenetic regulation and on the combinatorial factors that drive the specificity of the diverse PcG complexes in different cellular contexts.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture, transfections, and fractionation</title><p>HeLa (ATCC), HelaS3 (ATCC), K562 (ATCC), and 293T-REx (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) cells were grown in DMEM with 10% FBS, penicillin (100 IU/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and L-glutamine (300 μg/ml).

After full discussion of the study and the reviews, we are happy to report that the reviewers and the BRE member are enthusiastic about considering a revised version of the paper following the implementation of their suggestions.</p><p>Please address the following points in your revised manuscript:</p><p>1) Do the loci that produce RNA that associates with SCML2A correspond to those sites of PRC1/SCML2A co-occupancy? The reviewers have suggested that you should address this point with mRNAs and lncRNAs in the same cell type where RIPs were performed.</p><p>2) The reviewers were concerned that in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, RBR mainly co-precipitates with ribosomal RNAs. This point needs further clarification in the text of the manuscript for our readerships. Could you also please clarify if there is a co-IP of PRC2 and SCML2A?</p><p>3) Since SCML2 associates with the PRC1 complex, then the genome-wide distribution of the peaks of both proteins should largely overlap. All the analyses presented here refer to common targets, rather than peak distributions. This observation needs to be further clarified in the revised manuscript.</p><p>4) In the Results section you have stated: &quot;...suggesting that RNA-protein interactions participate in the recruitment or stabilization of SCML2 on chromatin...&quot; should be toned down as 'might participate in'.</p><p>5) In the ChIP-seq experiments with the WT HA-tagged SCML2 and the &quot;delta RBR&quot; mutant in cells with endogenous SCML2 kd - it is unclear from the Western on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure S4</xref>, how much of a knockdown effect we are observing since the levels of SCML2A and SCML2B in a control shRNA or in the parental cell line is not provided; for the same reason, we don't know how much of the HA-tagged proteins we are actually expressing compared to normal endogenous levels; this information is important to interpret the results, therefore, the normal levels of SCML2 in a shRNA control or parental cell line should be provided to be able to compare. Similarly, in the ChIP-seq experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4 fig5">Figure 5 and S4</xref>), the control with no SCML2-HA-tagged expressed in the SCML2 shRNA conditions is missing.</p><p>6) The reviewers suggested that the alignments to whole transcriptome and not just lncRNAs should be performed in the study.</p><p>7) Although the reviewers requested demonstration of physiological significance of the findings, upon discussion it was concluded that such information could be the subject of the next study. However, if you have such data already available, we feel that its inclusion would significantly strengthen the manuscript.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02637.019</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) Do the loci that produce RNA that associates with SCML2A correspond to those sites of PRC1/SCML2A co-occupancy?</italic></p><p>We performed the requested analyses by calculating whether the SCML2 RIP signal near SCML2 ERs was enriched compared to input, empty tag, and ΔRBR RIP. Using all 2,479 SCML2 ERs in 293T-REx, no specific enrichment can be observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Author response image 1A</xref>). However, the 2,479 sites are likely to include false positive and/or RNA-independent SCML2 targets. We reasoned that the noise in the RIP data could be filtered by focusing on those regions where the WT RIP showed more signal than the ΔRBR RIP. These ERs showed an accumulation of signal in the SCML2 WT RIP but not in the other 2 independent controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Author response image 1B</xref>). As an additional control, we analyzed the ERs that showed stronger RIP signal in the ΔRBR sample. In these regions the ΔRBR signal was as high as the input and empty vector controls and can be attributed to non-specific interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Author response image 1C</xref>).<fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Enrichment of SCML2-bound RNAs at SCML2 ERs on chromatin.</title><p>(A) The <italic>cis</italic> enrichment score was calculated by first counting the reads per million sequenced (RP10M) for each RIP sample in 5kb windows spanning the SCML2 ERs, dividing by the RP10M for the same sample in 1,000 simulations of an equal number of randomly selected regions in the genome, and then normalized to the input signal.

We have added text in the Discussion reporting some of these considerations.</p><p><italic>The reviewers have suggested that you should address this point with mRNAs and lncRNAs in the same cell type where RIPs were performed</italic>.</p><p>Most genomic regions with RIP enrichment do not contain gene annotations.

Because total RNA was used and the most abundant RNA species are rRNAs, they are also the most prominent bands in this gel. It is not unusual for chromatin-associated proteins to have broad binding specificities, at least <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Davidovich et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kaneko et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>We added a comment about this in the revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>Could you also please clarify if there is a co-IP of PRC2 and SCML2A?</italic></p><p>We do not observe co-IP of PRC2 and SCML2A in native conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Author response image 2A</xref>) or after crosslinking with formaldehyde (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Author response image 2B</xref>). Kuroda and colleagues recovered SCML2 in their EZH2 crosslinking and affinity purification (Alekseyenko et al., 2014); however, they only detected 2 peptides (compared to 124 for SUZ12). This reflects either an extremely weak interaction, or indirect crosslinking due to co-localization or PRC1 and PRC2 components on chromatin targets. We have included a brief mention of these considerations in the revised manuscript. We can add Figures R2A and R2B to the supplement upon request, but we feel that they would add little to the paper.<fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Immunoprecipitations for SCML2 and EZH2.</title><p>(A) IPs were performed in native conditions (200 mM KCl, 0.05% NP-40) with the indicated antibodies (C-20 and 86A are two different commercial antibodies against MLL).

It is rare to observe a full overlap in genome-wide datasets, due to different antibody sensitivity and protein abundance. By increasing the stringency of our peak calling, an even larger fraction of SCML2 ERs overlap with BMI1 ERs (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4–figure supplement 1D,E</xref>). Relevant text has been added (Pg. 9). In addition, BMI1 is part of only one (PRC1.4) of the several types of PRC1 complexes present in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gao et al., 2012</xref>). Although PRC1.1/3/5/6 do not appear to interact with SCML2, PRC1.2 does (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gao et al., 2012</xref>), and therefore it is possible that some of the SCML2+/BMI1- ERs are bound by PRC1.2. We added these considerations to the revised Discussion.</p><p><italic>All the analyses presented here refer to common targets, rather than peak distributions. This observation needs to be further clarified in the revised manuscript</italic>.</p><p>Because the overlap between SCML2 and BMI1 decreases at higher <italic>P</italic>-values (see new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4–figure supplement 1E</xref>) and to minimize the inclusion of ERs that might be the result of cross-reactivities of the anti-SCML2 antibody, we restricted some of the analyses to a “high-quality” set of ERs comprising the intersection of SCML2, BMI1, and HA ERs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5–figure supplement 1C</xref>). However, the meta-ER analyses shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B–D</xref> were performed on the inclusive set of all 2,479 SCML2 ERs with <italic>P</italic>-value &lt; 10-5, and the gene set overlap shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B–C</xref> included all unique target genes associated with these 2,479 ERs (1,866 total; some genes are associated with more than one ER).</p><p>The average enrichment in WT vs. ΔRBR decreases as ERs with higher <italic>P</italic>-values are added to the set (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Author response image 3A</xref>) suggesting a corresponding increase in the fraction of false positive ERs. Nonetheless the heatmap including all 2,479 ERs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Author response image 3B</xref>) is similar to the one restricted to the high-confidence set (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). However, because <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B–D</xref> already show the appropriate comparisons using the full set, we think that <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Author response image 3B</xref> would not add to the manuscript.

As they all derived from the same <italic>shL2</italic> clone, the extent of knockdown is equivalent in all cell lines and can be gauged by comparing the levels of endogenous (untagged) SCML2 before and after dox in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5–figure supplement 1A</xref>. This figure also allows the direct comparison between the levels of exogenous and endogenous SCML2, as both types of protein are detected by the SCML2 antibody. Because the shRNA is not induced in absence of dox, we deemed the –dox condition a better control than the parental cell line. Indeed, the levels of SCML2 in the empty vector uninduced line (N3 –dox) line are equivalent to those in the parental 293T-Rex line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Author response image 4</xref>).

We have included these data in revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5–figure supplement 1C</xref>.</p><p><italic>6) The reviewers suggested that the alignments to whole transcriptome and not just lncRNAs should be performed in the study</italic>.</p><p>The lincRNA DB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cabili et al., 2011</xref>) was only used for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C,D</xref>. The purpose of those figures was to show that the set of lincRNAs associated with SCML2 changes with cellular state. Indeed SCML2 binds as efficiently to mRNA as it does to lincRNAs by RIP-seq. This is expected based on its behavior <italic>in vitro</italic>. We have added the same analysis for protein-coding mRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6–figure supplement 1A</xref>) and some explanatory text.</p><p><italic>7) Although the reviewers requested demonstration of physiological significance of the findings, upon discussion it was concluded that such information could be the subject of the next study. However, if you have such data already available, we feel that its inclusion would significantly strengthen the manuscript</italic>.</p><p>This is the subject of an ongoing study still too preliminary to be included in this manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
