We identified 53,613,739 unique sRNAs and 165,797 sRNA expression traits (s-traits). A total of 66,649 s-traits mapped 40,049 <italic>local</italic>-sQTLs and 30,809 <italic>distant</italic>-sQTLs. By defining 80,362 sRNA clusters, 22,263 sRNA cluster QTLs (scQTLs) were recovered for 20,249 of all the 50,139 sRNA cluster expression traits (sc-traits). The expression levels for most of s-traits from the same genes or the same sRNA clusters were slightly positively correlated. While genetic co-regulation between sRNAs from the same mother genes and between sRNAs and their mother genes was observed for a portion of the sRNAs, most of the sRNAs and their mother genes showed little co-regulation. Some sRNA biogenesis genes were located in <italic>distant</italic>-sQTL hotspots and showed correspondence with specific length classes of sRNAs suggesting their important roles in the regulation and biogenesis of the sRNAs.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03913.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03913.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03913.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Genes within the DNA of a plant or animal contain instructions to make molecules called RNAs. Some RNA molecules can be decoded to make proteins, whereas others have different roles. A single gene often contains the instructions to make both protein-coding RNAs and non-coding RNAs.</p><p>Molecules called small RNAs (or sRNAs) do not code for proteins. Instead, sRNAs can control protein-coding RNA molecules or chemically alter the DNA itself; this allows them to perform many different roles in living organisms. In plants, for example, these molecules affect how the plant grows, the shapes and structures it forms, and how likely it is to survive challenges such as drought and diseases. Often different plants of the same species have different amounts of sRNAs, but the reasons for this remain unclear.</p><p>Now, Wang, Yao et al. have made use of a technique called ‘expression quantitative locus’ analysis to look at how sRNAs in rice plants are controlled by additional information encoded within DNA. The analysis identified over 53 million sRNA molecules from a population of rice plants. Many of these sRNAs varied in their abundance between different plants within the population. Wang, Yao et al. also found many thousands of individual instructions within the DNA of the rice that can either increase or reduce the abundance of their associated sRNA.</p><p>Some of the abundant sRNAs were influenced by instructions within their own genes; some were influenced by instructions from other genes; and some were influenced by both. Wang, Yao et al. also found that the control of protein-coding RNAs was not necessarily related to the control of sRNAs encoded by the same gene. Further work is now needed to identify which specific DNA sequences regulate the abundance of sRNA molecules in plants and other organisms.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03913.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03913.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>rice</kwd><kwd>genetic</kwd><kwd>sRNA</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31330039</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Qifa</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>The 863 Program of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2012AA10A304</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Qifa</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The expression of small RNAs (or sRNAs) is regulated not only by mRNA expression, but also by their own regulatory elements and by sRNA biogenesis genes.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Small RNAs (sRNAs) are non-coding RNAs mainly 18–30 nt in length that regulate a wide range of biological processes in eukaryotic organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carthew and Sontheimer, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Axtell, 2013</xref>). According to their origin, sRNAs can be grouped into two major types: hpRNAs that are derived from single-stranded precursors with a hairpin structure (such as microRNAs [miRNAs]) and short interfering RNA (siRNAs) that are derived from double-stranded RNA precursors such as heterochromatic small interfering RNAs (hc-siRNA) and <italic>trans</italic>-acting siRNAs (ta-siRNA). There has been an explosion of interest in recent years in studies of miRNAs and siRNAs on their identification, biogenesis, and functioning in diverse biological processes. In plants, sRNAs function in regulating growth, development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Juarez et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zhu and Helliwell, 2011</xref>), architecture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jiao et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Miura et al., 2010</xref>), yield (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>), and response to biotic and abiotic stresses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Shukla et al., 2008</xref>). Such regulations are usually achieved by mediating endogenous mRNA cleavage and decay, DNA methylation of source and target loci, and chromatin modification and transcriptional silencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arikit et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Although the sRNAs differ in length, sequences, and functions, the pathways for their biogenesis and functioning from precursor transcription, processing, maturation, and action are relatively conserved, which involve the activities of a number of enzymes including RNA polymerase II (Pol II), RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RDRs), Dicer-like proteins (DCLs), and Argonautes (AGOs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ghildiyal and Zamore, 2009</xref>). It is also known that the abundance of sRNA species can be highly variable among individuals within a species, and the possible regulatory role of such quantitative difference has been assumed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">He et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Groszmann et al., 2011b</xref>). It is not known whether the quantitative variation of sRNA species between genotypes is related to the biological machinery, as quantitative variation of sRNAs has not been assayed at the population level and their genetic control has yet to be elucidated.</p><p>The recently developed expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) analysis has provided an approach for determining the genetic control of the expression level of a gene, including <italic>cis-</italic> and <italic>trans-</italic>eQTLs, as well as epistatic effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Becker et al., 2012</xref>). This approach can also be applied to the genetic analysis of quantitative variation of sRNAs by regarding the abundance of the sRNAs in the population as quantitative traits. Once the QTLs are identified, subsequent studies can be pursued very much the same way as the analysis of genes and regulatory networks underpinning phenotypic QTLs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Xing and Zhang, 2010</xref>).</p><p>There have been several studies focusing on the genetic regulation of known and validated miRNAs and small nucleolar RNAs in specific tissues/cells from samples of the human population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Borel et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gamazon et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Parts et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Civelek et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jin and Lee, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Siddle et al., 2014</xref>). These studies detected a number of <italic>cis</italic>- and <italic>trans</italic>-miQTLs that could also influence the expression of the mRNA targets, which may be associated with phenotype difference.</p><p>Here, we performed a whole genome QTL analysis of the entire sRNA kingdom consisted of 18-nt to 26-nt sRNAs from flag leaf of rice using an experimental genetic population. The analysis revealed features of the genetic controls of sRNA abundance showing both commonality and distinction with their precursor transcripts. It was also shown that the abundance of sRNAs is probably related to proteins constituting the machinery for sRNA biogenesis and functioning.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Patterns and distributions of sRNAs</title><p>The genetic materials consisted of 98 hybrids obtained by paired crosses of 196 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived by single seed descent from a cross between Zhenshan 97 and Minghui 63, the parents of Shanyou 63 that was the most widely cultivated rice hybrid in the 1980s and 1990s and still used with reduced area in recent years in China. Because the genetic composition of these crosses resembled individuals in an F<sub>2</sub> population, they were referred to as an immortalized F<sub>2</sub> (IMF2) population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hua et al., 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">2003</xref>), and each hybrid in the population was hereafter referred to as an IMF2 for ease of description. An sRNA library was constructed using RNA extracted from flag leaf at the day of full expansion for each IMF2, and two biological replicates were obtained for each of the two parental lines and their F<sub>1</sub> hybrid, producing a total of 104 libraries.</p><p>The read size of the raw sequencing data obtained using Illumina Hiseq2000 varied from 3 nt to 44 nt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Approximately 51.1% of sRNAs originated from the 2-kb upstream and the genic regions of non-transposon genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).

The genic regions of non-transposon genes held the highest number of 21 nt sRNAs, while 24 nt sRNAs were most common in the intergenic regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). sRNAs of 21 nt in genic regions were mostly derived from the exon of non-transposon genes, while 24 nt sRNAs in genic regions were mainly from the intron of non-transposon genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). The 24-nt sRNAs mainly consist of endogenous heterochromatic siRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Axtell, 2013</xref>) and tend to be produced from repeats and transposable elements as well as intergenic regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen, 2009</xref>). The 24-nt sRNAs are components of the epigenome that target the homologous genomic regions for de novo DNA methylation through RNA-directed DNA methylation to maintain genome stability by transcriptional gene silencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Groszmann et al., 2011a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pooggin, 2013</xref>).</p><p>Next, the abundance of each sRNA in a library was normalized to number of reads per millions (RPM) (‘Materials and methods’) to quantify the sRNA levels in each library, which were subject to analyses and comparisons. An sRNA with RPM value ≥0.6 was regarded as expressed, and an sRNA identified as expressed in more than 25 of the 98 IMF2s was regarded as an sRNA expression trait (s-trait). In this way, a total of 165,797 s-traits were recovered (Supplementary file 3 in Dryad [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wang et al., 2015</xref>]). A total of 87.9% of s-traits were 24 nt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). The s-traits mainly originated from the intergenic regions, 2-kb upstream, and genic regions of non-transposon genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Although the 2-kb upstream and the genic regions of non-transposon genes contained almost equal number of sRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), the number of s-traits derived from the 2-kb upstream of non-transposon genes was more than twice of the number of s-traits in genic regions of non-transposon genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). The distribution of different species s-traits in different genomic regions was similar to that of sRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,H</xref>). Although sRNAs of various lengths from genic regions were mostly from exons of non-transposon genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), the s-traits of different sizes were mainly derived from introns of non-transposon genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>). The coefficients of variation of the 165,797 s-traits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>) showed a very wide range of distribution of the sRNA levels in the population. We selected 9 s-traits randomly from all the 165,797 s-traits, and the distributions of the expression values for most of these s-traits across the IMF2 population were more or less normal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Expression correlations between sRNAs that originated from the same genes</title><p>To test whether s-traits originated from the same gene were transcribed together, the correlation coefficients between the expression values of s-traits originated from the same gene were calculated. A total of 3,739,873 correlation coefficients involving 15,078 genes and 96,914 s-traits were obtained, 2,593,503 (69.3%) and 507,528 (13.6%) of which were contributed by 2278 s-traits from genes LOC_Os03g01360 and 1008 s-traits from LOC_Os07g01240, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). The correlation coefficients naturally fell into three classes: strong negative correlations, no correlation, and strong positive correlations with obvious dividing points at −0.3 and 0.3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), which were far above 0.25, the threshold for statistical significance at p &lt; 0.05 determined by simulation data. While 85.8% of these strong correlations (positive or negative) were contributed by s-traits originated from LOC_Os03g01360 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), most of s-traits originated from gene LOC_Os07g01240 showed low (or no) correlations with each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Although the expression values of s-traits originated from the same regions of the remaining 15,076 genes in the whole genome were mostly slightly positively correlated, the correlation coefficients were significantly distinct from that of the simulation of random data (Mann–Whitney U test, p-value &lt;2.2e-16, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), indicating various degrees of correlations. We found that the correlations were affected by the sizes of s-traits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Expression correlations between s-traits of the same size were stronger than that between s-traits of different sizes. In particular, the expression correlations between 21-nt sRNAs and 25-nt sRNAs from the same genes were very weak. The correlations between overlapped s-traits were slightly stronger than that between s-traits not overlapping with each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A,B</xref>). The correlations between s-traits from the same transposons were slightly different from that of s-traits from the same non-transposons genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C,D</xref>). Most of the s-traits originating from LOC_Os03g01360 were significantly correlated (positive or negative) with each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>), and the correlations between different s-traits were mainly dependent on their genomic positions rather than their sizes, which were mostly 21, 22, and 24 nt, accounting for 40.2%, 34.4%, and 19.4% of the 2278 s-traits. This gene could be separated as three parts, the 2 kb-upstream, 5′ UTR, the first intron and the first coding DNA sequence (CDS) as the first part, the most of the second intron comprising the second part, and the second CDS and part of the second intron as the third part (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). s-traits within each part were positively correlated with each other, while s-traits from the first part were mostly negatively correlated with those from the other two parts. The correlations between the expression levels of s-traits from the second parts and s-traits from the third parts were mostly positive. Thus, although very strong positive and negative correlations were found between sRNAs from the same genic regions of specific genes, this was not a common phenomenon. Taken together, this correlation analysis indicated that most of the sRNAs derived from the same genes were correlated with each other to various extents, implying that nearby sRNAs were possibly jointly transcribed. Consecutively overlapped sRNAs were found from introns of specific genes and intergenic regions, indicating that sRNAs were not necessarily jointly transcribed from the genes.<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03913.010</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Expression correlations between s-traits originating from the same genes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The distribution of expression correlations between s-traits originating from the same genes.

These eQTLs were classified as <italic>local</italic>-eQTLs and <italic>distant</italic>-eQTLs according to the same rule applied in the sQTL analysis. As a result, 2964 <italic>local</italic>-eQTLs (shown in the diagonal of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s6">Figure 4—figure supplement 6</xref>) and 3459 <italic>distant</italic>-eQTLs (off-diagonal of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s6">Figure 4—figure supplement 6</xref>) were detected (Supplementary file 7 in Dryad [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wang et al., 2015</xref>]).

In the extreme case, a total of 1660 s-traits were regulated by a single <italic>local</italic>-sQTL (Bin358) on chromosome 3 (Supplementary file 8 in Dryad [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wang et al., 2015</xref>]). Each of another five <italic>local</italic>-sQTLs (Bin359, Bin1183, Bin969, Bin286, and Bin166) explained the expression variations of more than 200 s-traits. The <italic>local</italic>-scQTL (Bin1183) with the largest effect regulated the expression of 93 sc-traits. Each of another 29 <italic>local</italic>-scQTLs was responsible for the expression variations of more than 30 sc-traits. In comparison, a total of 24 e-traits were regulated by Bin3, which is the <italic>local</italic>-eQTL explaining the expression variations of the largest number of e-traits. <italic>Distant</italic>-QTLs regulating many traits across all chromosomes were very common for s-traits and sc-traits but relatively rare for e-traits. A total of 15 bins were identified as <italic>distant</italic>-sQTLs, each of which regulated more than 200 s-traits; in one case, 514 s-traits were regulated by a single <italic>distant</italic>-sQTL (Bin1209). We observed three <italic>distant</italic>-scQTLs (Bin634, Bin635, and Bin636), each of which regulated more than 100 sc-traits, and another 21 <italic>distant</italic>-scQTLs, each of which explained the expression variations of more than 30 sc-traits. Whereas in case of mRNAs, only 9 bins were each responsible for the expression of more than 30 e-traits.</p><p>We further inspected the QTL results of 22,142 s-traits expressed (RPM &gt;0) in only one of the two parents. In all, 11,194 and 10,948 s-traits were expressed only in the genome of Zhenshan 97 and Minghui 63, respectively. A total of 15,037 QTLs, 11,781 of which were <italic>local</italic>-sQTLs, were obtained for 14,139 of these s-traits. This proportion was significantly higher than the whole genome average level (Fisher's exact test, p value &lt;2.2e-16), implying that the expression variations of these s-traits were mostly controlled by local polymorphisms.

In all, 76 bins were <italic>local</italic>-QTL hotspots and 80 bins were <italic>distant</italic>-QTL hotspots for both s-traits and sc-traits. On the other hand, 116 and 126 bins were identified as <italic>local</italic>- and <italic>distant</italic>-eQTL hotspots. The identified hotspots of sQTLs and scQTLs were quite similar but distinct from that of eQTLs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Totally, 33 bins were <italic>local</italic>-QTL hotspots and 36 bins were <italic>distant</italic>-QTL hotspots for both s-traits and e-traits. Consecutive <italic>distant</italic>-QTL hotspots in adjacent genomic regions could explain the expression variations of a large number of s-traits, sc-traits, or e-traits (Supplementary file 8 in Dryad [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wang et al., 2015</xref>]). Four consecutive <italic>distant</italic>-QTL hotspots on chromosome 4, 5, 6, and 9 were identified for both s-traits and sc-traits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,B</xref>). The genomic positions of consecutive <italic>distant</italic>-eQTLs hotspots were quite distinct from that of sQTL or scQTLs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). A cluster of the consecutive <italic>distant</italic>-eQTL hotspots (chr04: 1.713 Mb–2.495 Mb) was located close to one end of chromosome 4, while another cluster of consecutive <italic>distant</italic>-QTL hotspots (chr04: 21.997 Mb–23.342 Mb) for both s-traits and sc-traits was about 10 Mb distant from the other end of chromosome 4. A cluster of consecutive <italic>distant</italic>-eQTL hotspots (chr07: 28.058 Mb–28.557 Mb) was located close to one end of chromosome 7, while no apparent consecutive <italic>distant</italic>-QTL hotspots for s-traits and sc-traits were on chromosome 7.

Three isoforms of this gene were significantly differentially expressed as measured in FPKM between Zhenshan 97 and Minghui 63 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The sRNAs of Zhenshan 97 were mainly derived from the second and the third part of LOC_Os03g01360, while sRNAs of Minghui 63 originated from all the three parts with the expression level from the third part lower than that of sRNAs of Zhenshan 97 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). The expression levels of LOC_Os03g01360.1 and LOC_Os03g01360.4 in the genome of Minghui 63 were higher than Zhenshan 97 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1A</xref>). On the contrary, LOC_Os03g01360.2 was higher expressed in Zhenshan 97 than in Minghui 63. The expression of all the three transcripts in the hybrid was down-regulated compared with the mid-parent value (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We checked the cytosine methylation levels in this region, and the genomic DNA showed high cytosine methylation, especially from the start to the third exon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>, ‘Materials and methods’). This high methylation might be due to the enrichment of sRNAs resulting in RNA-directed DNA methylation. In the differentially expressed region of sRNAs between Zhenshan 97 and Minghui 63, such as the third exon according to the annotated gene model, Minghui 63 had lower methylation and higher mRNA transcript level than Zhenshan 97, suggesting a negative correlation between the transcript level and methylation. The expression variation of three isoforms of LOC_Os03g01360 in the IMF2 population was controlled by <italic>local</italic>-eQTLs (Supplementary file 7 in Dryad [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wang et al., 2015</xref>]).

The expression correlation between e-traits of LOC_Os07g01240 and s-traits originating from LOC_Os07g01240 was weak (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). This result was similar to that of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tong et al.

Our results indicated that almost one third of the detected <italic>local</italic>-sQTLs exhibited much larger effects than <italic>distant</italic>-sQTLs, consistent with the studies for eQTL of mRNA expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kliebenstein, 2009</xref>), suggesting that local elements are a major regulatory factor for sRNA variation. <italic>Local</italic>-QTLs regulating the expression of large numbers of traits were observed for s-traits but not for e-traits, resulting from the enrichment of s-traits in the region produced by the extensive and consecutive overlapping transcripts from the mother genes. Hotspots were found for both <italic>distant</italic>-QTLs of mRNA e-traits and sRNA s-traits, both of which could influence the expression variations of a large number of traits.</p><p>Our results showed that quantitative variation for a large portion of sRNAs transcribed from genic regions did not share the genetic control of the expression with the corresponding mother genes, although by common sense those sRNAs have to be transcribed along and regulated by the promoters of the mother genes. Similar results were reported in previous studies of miRNAs and their host genes, which were regulated or processed independently from their respective regulatory elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Siddle et al., 2014</xref>). The results of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Monteys et al. (2010)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ozsolak et al. (2008)</xref> suggested that the transcription of sRNAs may also be regulated by their own promoters, independent of the mother genes. The widespread occurrence of such independent genetic controls between the sRNAs and the mother genes suggested that independent transcription of the sRNAs might be a common phenomenon, rather than only special circumstances. Moreover, the large number of <italic>distant</italic>-sQTLs that were not collocated with the <italic>distant</italic>-eQTLs for the corresponding mother genes supported the independent regulatory basis of the transcription of the sRNAs.</p><p>Our results showed that some of the sRNA biogenesis genes such as DCLs, AGOs, and RDRs were probably responsible for the quantitative variation of a large number of sRNAs. <italic>OsRDR2</italic> was found in a region of consecutive <italic>distant</italic>-sQTL hotspots explaining the expression variation of many sRNAs, most of which were 24 nt. This was also a region of consecutive <italic>distant</italic>-scQTL hotspots with the highest number of <italic>distant</italic>-scQTLs. <italic>OsDCL2b</italic> was also found in consecutive <italic>distant</italic>-sQTL hotspots regulating the expression of sRNAs, most of which were 22 and 24 nt. Although <italic>OsDCL2a</italic> and <italic>OsDCL1c</italic> were not in <italic>distant</italic>-sQTL hotspots due to lack of local recombination in that region, they were also in bins regulating the expression of a large number of s-traits. This is in accordance with the reports that RDRs function on the upstream of DCLs in the process of sRNA biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chapman and Carrington, 2007</xref>). Studies in sRNA pathways in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> showed that DCL2 is responsible for the synthesis of 22 nt or 24 nt siRNAs, while RDR2 functions in the production of endogenous 24 nt siRNAs and the conversion of ssRNA template into dsRNAs that serve as substrates for DCLs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arikit et al., 2013</xref>), which is in good agreement with the sQTLs found in this study. However, it should also be noted that these genes were associated with s-QTLs for only a small portions of the s-traits, while the quantitative variation of the sRNA abundance for majority of the s-traits was independent of the sRNA biogenesis genes.</p><p>One of the most interesting finding perhaps concerns the sRNAs from the two loci, LOC_Os03g01360 and LOC_Os07g01240, and their regulation patterns. Although both loci produced thousands of sRNAs, which were the most numerous in the genome, they showed sharp contrast in where the sRNAs were generated and the regulatory mechanisms with which the sRNAs were produced. sRNAs from LOC_Os03g01360 mostly originated from the 2-kb upstream and genic regions and were tightly co-regulated with each other and also with the mother gene. By contrast, sRNAs from LOC_Os07g01240 were mostly produced in the intronic region and loosely co-regulated with each other and not co-regulated with the mother gene; in fact, the s-trait variation and sQTLs were detected even without the expression variation of the mother gene. Since neither of the genes has been previously identified as related to the production and function of sRNAs, their roles in sRNA biogenesis warrant further investigation.</p><p>Another noticeable finding is the widespread negative dominance of sRNA levels detected in the IMF2 population such that heterozygotes had lower level of the sRNAs than the means of the two homozygotes (negative partial dominance) or the lower homozygote (negative overdominance). Such negative dominance was also observed in comparative sRNA profiling of hybrids relative to the parents in crosses of rice and <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Groszmann et al., 2011b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">He et al., 2013</xref>), revealing a predominant-negative regulation of siRNA expression in hybrids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">He et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chodavarapu et al., 2012</xref>). Our genetic analysis revealed that the sQTLs showing negative dominance of the sRNA levels are mostly <italic>distant</italic>-sQTLs, indicating regulation by distant elements likely at the transcriptional level. Studies of transcript levels of genes (mRNAs) in the hybrid against the parents in the same rice cross also revealed more negative dominance than positive dominance, also indicating down-regulation in the hybrid relative to the parents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Huang et al., 2006</xref>).

We corrected the SNP sites of the Nipponbare reference genome (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://rice.plantbiology.msu.edu">http://rice.plantbiology.msu.edu</ext-link>, The MSU Rice Database release 7.0) according to the sequences of Zhenshan 97 and Minghui 63 to reconstruct ‘SNPs-replaced reference genomes’ for the two parents.</p><p>For sRNA analysis, all filtered sRNA-seq reads from Zhenshan 97 libraries were specifically mapped to the SNPs-replaced Zhenshan 97 genome and reads from Minghui 63 libraries were mapped to SNPs-replaced Minghui 63 genome. The sRNAs from heterozygous materials of F<sub>1</sub> and IMF2 were simultaneously mapped to the Zhenshan 97- and Minghui 63-replaced genomes. Bowtie (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Langmead et al., 2009</xref>) was used to align short reads to each genome at unique genome location with no mismatch allowed. The reads from heterozygous materials could be divided into three groups: reads specifically mapped to Zhenshan 97, reads only mapped to Minghui 63 genome, and reads mapped to both Zhenshan 97 and Minghui 63 at the same position. In the third class, the sequences of the sRNAs from a monomorphic site were indistinguishable between the parents and thus obtained one count in quantitation of the abundance, whereas the two counts of the sRNAs from a polymorphic site were put together.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Quantification of sRNA or sRNA cluster expression level</title><p>The expression level of an sRNA in a specific library was defined as the number of this sRNA divided by the total number (in millions) of genome-mapped sRNAs in this library, which was designated as ‘RPM’. The R package DESeq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anders and Huber, 2010</xref>) was used to quantify sRNA cluster expression level. The number of sRNA reads in each sRNA cluster for each sample was calculated and integrated as a count table, with each line representing an sRNA cluster and each column representing a sample. Then, the effective library size for each sample was estimated using the ‘estimateSizeFactors’ function in the DESeq package. Each column of the count table was divided by the corresponding library size to get the normalized read count, which was regarded as the expression level of the sRNA cluster.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Processing of mRNA sequencing data</title><p>The removal of poor-quality reads for mRNA-seq reads was done in the same way as sRNA analysis. The sequences from 104 libraries were mapped to the <italic>O. sativa ssp</italic>. <italic>japonica</italic> (cv.

Bismark (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Krueger and Andrews, 2011</xref>) was performed to align bisulfite-treated reads to the SNP-replaced genomes, allowing no mismatch in the seed of 40 nucleotides and up to two good alignments. This bisulfate mapping tool aims to find unique alignment through running four alignment processes simultaneously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Krueger and Andrews, 2011</xref>). Then, the de-duplication tool provided by Bismark was applied to remove potential PCR duplicates. Methylation calls were extracted for every single cytosine analyzed depending on its context (CpG, CHG, or CHH).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>QTL analysis</title><p>The ultrahigh-density bin map constructed by genotyping the RILs with population sequencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Xie et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yu et al., 2011</xref>) was used.

The density of sc-traits, scQTLs, e-traits, and eQTLs was calculated in the same way. Bins with s-trait density larger than three times of the whole genome average level were defined as s-trait hotspots, while bins with sQTL density higher than six times of the whole genome average level were designated as sQTL hotspots. The process of identification of e-traits and eQTL hotspots was the same as that of s-traits and sQTLs. The definition of scQTL hotspots was identical to sQTL hotspots, while sc-traits hotspots were defined as bins with sc-traits density higher than the twice of the whole genome average.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Detlef Weigel (Senior editor) and three reviewers, including Justin Borevitz as guest Reviewing editor.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>You present a large body of new work, with the identification of sRNA eQTL being of wide interest. The explicit questions asked are whether sRNAs are regulated by the genes of origin, and what the genetic architecture of miRNA expression is, by making use of immortalized F2s (RILs).</p><p>The full mRNA eQTL analysis must be included. Based on this, specific tests looking for genetic co regulation of sRNA+mRNA and specific loci should be done, with independence being the null hypothesis. Also, you need to follow up the positive associations to candidate genes as suggested by other reviewers.</p><p>We would be happy to re-review a substantially revised version.</p><p>Full comments from the Reviewing editor:</p><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wang et al (2014)</xref> use an immortalized F2 (IMF2) population generated by crossing RILs from a cross between Zhenshan 97 and Minghui 63 created previously in their laboratory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hua et al. 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hua et al. 2003</xref>) to look into the variation of small RNA expression (from RNA sequencing data). Although numerous eQTL analyses have been previously performed, the novelty is here that they look specifically to the abundance of small RNAs and that has never been done before. Moreover, the added value of using the IMF2 population in comparison to conventional RILs is that this population allows the investigation of additive and dominance effects, and heterosis. The manuscript is well written and will be comprehensible to a broad readership</p><p>The authors give a very detailed description about the number of sRNA expression traits (they refer to as e-traits), the number of cis and trans-sQTL that they find, and the overlap of the e-traits with the mRNA expression of their mother genes. The major findings are that the sRNAs are mostly independently regulated from the sRNA biogenesis genes, that the SRNA are differently transcribed from their mother genes and that most of the heterozygotes show negative dominance. Although these results on the genetic regulation of sRNAs are interesting and valuable to the plant science community, I am not yet convinced that these results have enough added value to the literature for inclusion in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>My major point of criticism is that the analyses are very descriptive and although many sQTLs are found, the genetic regulators of sRNAs are still unknown. Furthermore, the authors might want to go into further detail for the majority of their findings.</p><p>Major points:</p><p>1) The <italic>cis</italic>-sQTL hotspots on chr 3 and 7 are not elaborated on and remain purely descriptive analyses. The authors could at least give information on what the function of these genes is, whether they are co-expressed with other genes, do they have homologs in Arabidopsis or other plants, etc. Trans-sQTL hotspots are also not elaborated on, except the more detailed analysis of the sRNA biogenesis genes.</p><p>2) The <italic>OsDCL2</italic> gene that is found to underlie a trans-sQTL and that has a <italic>cis</italic>-eQTL is also not analyzed further. Is there a correlation in expression between the eQTL and the sQTL? What happens if the <italic>OsDCL2</italic> gene is silenced or over-expressed to the sRNA expression?</p><p>3) The authors published data on yield and heterosis for the same IMF2 population previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hua et al. 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hua et al. 2003</xref>) and it would be very interesting to see whether the negative dominance effects are shared and correlated among the lines. Is there an effect of different sRNA expression on yield?</p><p>4) I further miss an analysis of the variation in the population, the heritability and a detailed comparison of parents and hybrid.</p><p>The other reviewer also largely agrees.</p><p>Decision recommendation:</p><p>In a population derived from crossing RIL lines, that were developed from a cross between two distinct rice inbreds (Zhenshan 97 and Minghui 63), Jian Wang and colleagues investigate: a) expression levels for small RNAs between 18 and 26 nt in length, b) mRNA expression levels and c) (genome-wide) DNA methylation by bisulfite sequencing.</p><p>Wang et al subject the small RNA expression data to an eQTL analysis and report dozens of thousands of QTLs for a similar number of e-traits.</p><p>The population consisted of 98 individuals. Hence, to accumulate the data for this project the authors produced 300 or more second generation sequencing libraries.</p><p>Zhenshan 97 and Minghui 63 are the parents of Shanyou 63, a very successful rice hybrid in China. First generation offspring of original parents (the hybrid) is heterozygous over the entire genome. But a population of individuals derived from crossing RILs provides a means to dissect the genetic interactions of this hybrid as F1s derived from different RILs will represent a different set of genes/alleles in homozygous/heterozygous states.</p><p>Hence, the chosen population is indeed suitable to elucidate genetic interactions underpinning small RNA expression; at least in this particular hybrid.</p><p>The first criticism hence concerns the title. It makes too broad a claim.</p><p>The study uses a very suitable population and a very suitable approach and technology. The study is potentially of high value for our understanding of the biology of hybrids, however, my recommendation at this point is to reject the paper. We will take another look at a revised version.</p><p>Main reasons:</p><p>I feel the study lacks a clear focus and clear messages. It is mainly a large collection of data spiced up with examples of which the reader doesn't know how representative they are.</p><p>Despite the large amount of data it is not really a resource, because the data is not accessible. Lists of QTLs is not accessible data. If a resource, then the interested reader may want to explore expression levels and methylation status himself, genome-wide, to explore the QTLs.</p><p>The low (arbitrary?) thresholds for QTL detection and arbitrary filters for including or excluding e-traits do not help in making it a resource. The reader is left with tens of thousands of QTLs of low LOD scores (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p>I found the paper a difficult read, which was mainly due to the many different layers and concepts that one has to constantly keep separate in ones head: sRNA, siRNA, miRNA, eQTL, sQTL, e-trait, mother gene, target genes, TE genic, non-TE genic, etc., convoluted by ratios and percentages and 20(!) supplementary tables, all long list of numbers. Tens of thousands of e-traits and QTL (eQTLs? sQTLs?) described does not make it easier.</p><p>It is unclear why siRNA and miRNA are dealt with together. Given the different roles, genesis and modes of operation of the small RNAs (miRNAs and siRNA), they should be kept separate as much as possible. miRNAs are post-transcriptional control and siRNA (24mers) are part of the epigenetic machinery. It is probably not expected that they and/or their genetic control have anything in common, and the study finds ample differences. Strict separation of the 2, best in 2 different papers, would reduce confusion.</p><p>Also it is unclear why each sRNA is treated as a separate trait. Based on their biogenesis all that come from the same mother gene are jointly transcribed at least. Different abundance of sRNAs from the same ‘mother gene’ points to either interesting biology or technical artifacts. This is not explored nor discussed.</p><p>My main criticism, however, is that the presented results do not make the use of most of the data. Besides the sRNA abundance data, there is mRNA expression data (by RNAseq) for all lines, and even genome wide methylation data (by bisulfite sequencing) of all lines. These data are only mentioned in passing and selectively used in (arbitrary?) examples. If a whole genome view on sRNA control is to be presented, then the study needs to integrate over all 3 data sets (mRNA, sRNA, Methylome) in a genome wide manner.</p><p>Please address these points in a major revision focusing on highlighting the major findings supporting your sRNA regulation of mother genes. I will take a look and make a decision.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled “Genetic basis of sRNA quantitative variation analyzed using an experimental population derived from an elite rice hybrid” for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.

In the revised version, the main focus was on the co-regulation of the sRNAs, sRNAs and the mRNAs of their mother genes, mostly by correlation and QTL analysis. The manuscript now appears to be more focused. We devoted a section in the Results and a paragraph in Discussion on the two loci that produced huge numbers of sRNAs, also spent more words on the sRNA biogenesis genes. We also analyzed the possible roles of the sQTLs by relating the sQTLs especially the hotspots of <italic>trans</italic>-QTLs with sRNA biogenesis genes and also the length classes of the sRNAs. These changes have led to re-organizing the materials and rewriting for most of the Results section.

LOC_Os03g01360 does not have homolog in Arabidopsis but has homolog in Maize with unknown function (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://rice.plantbiology.msu.edu/cgi-bin/ORF_infopage.cgi?orf=LOC_Os03g01360">http://rice.plantbiology.msu.edu/cgi-bin/ORF_infopage.cgi?orf=LOC_Os03g01360</ext-link>).

For s-traits regulated by QTLs in the consecutive <italic>trans</italic>-sQTL hotspots (Bin1199–Bin1210) on chromosome 9, most of the correlations between them and the e-traits in these bins were weak while the correlations between them and the e-traits of <italic>OsDCL2b</italic> were relatively strong (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2C</xref>). About 51.0% of the s-traits regulated by the consecutive <italic>trans</italic>-sQTL hotspots harboring <italic>OsDCL2b</italic> on chromosome 9 were 22 nt while 35.8% were 24 nt.

We did have data of DNA methylation, mRNA expression and sRNA expression of parents and hybrid. However, we found it hard to relate this comparison to the “genetic basis of sRNA expression” and including that part would divert the focus and make the paper unnecessarily lengthy. Since the manuscript was already criticized by one of the reviewers as having too much data, which we also agree, we decided not to include this part in the revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>The other reviewer also largely agrees</italic>. <italic>[…]</italic></p><p><italic>The first criticism hence concerns the title.

Actually, 53,613,739 unique sRNA reads were filtered to 165,797 s-traits. An sRNA with RPM value ≥0.6 was regarded as expressed, and an sRNA identified as expressed in more than 25 of the 98 IMF2s was regarded as an sRNA expression trait (s-trait). Both of the criteria are very stringent, if the huge numbers are taken into account. We performed 1,000 permutations (FDR set as 5%) for each QTL scanning and got LOD value thresholds for each QTL detected. Again we feel that the criteria are highly stringent, and the QTL scanning results in the revised manuscript were quite different from the results in the previous manuscript (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> of the revised manuscript).</p><p><italic>I found the paper a difficult read, which was mainly due to the many different layers and concepts that one has to constantly keep separate in ones head: sRNA, siRNA, miRNA, eQTL, sQTL, e-trait, mother gene, target genes, TE genic, non-TE genic, etc., convoluted by ratios and percentages and 20(!) supplementary tables, all long list of numbers. Tens of thousands of e-traits and QTL (eQTLs? sQTLs?) described does not make it easier</italic>.</p><p>Thanks for this comment. We restructured the writing by focusing on the genetics of co-regulation of the sRNAs (s-traits) and between sRNAs and the mother genes. We made efforts to unify the terminology used throughout. We deleted the part for miRNAs and condensed the writing to some extent, which reduced the text, figures and data files. We hope the paper now becomes easier to read.</p><p><italic>It is unclear why siRNA and miRNA are dealt with together. Given the different roles, genesis and modes of operation of the small RNAs (miRNAs and siRNA), they should be kept separate as much as possible. miRNAs are post-transcriptional control and siRNA (24mers) are part of the epigenetic machinery. It is probably not expected that they and/or their genetic control have anything in common, and the study finds ample differences. Strict separation of the 2, best in 2 different papers, would reduce confusion</italic>.</p><p>We are grateful for this suggestion. The analysis on miRNA was removed from the revised manuscript and may be dealt with in a future paper.</p><p><italic>Also it is unclear why each sRNA is treated as a separate trait. Based on their biogenesis all that come from the same mother gene are jointly transcribed at least. Different abundance of sRNAs from the same ‘mother gene’ points to either interesting biology or technical artifacts. This is not explored nor discussed</italic>.</p><p>Yes, sRNAs are jointly transcribed. However, sRNAs are not necessarily jointly transcribed from a mother gene since sRNAs were also found in the intergenic region. In this revision, we treated sRNAs transcribed from the same genomic region as an sRNA cluster, which was adopted by several previous studies (subsection headed “Expression correlations between sRNAs that originated from the same sRNA cluster”) (Shen et al. 2012). We also showed that the expression levels of sRNAs from the same mother genes or from the same clusters were slightly positively correlated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2–figure supplement 5</xref>).</p><p><italic>My main criticism, however, is that the presented results do not make the use of most of the data. Besides the sRNA abundance data, there is mRNA expression data (by RNAseq) for all lines, and even genome wide methylation data (by bisulfite sequencing) of all lines. These data are only mentioned in passing and selectively used in (arbitrary?) examples. If a whole genome view on sRNA control is to be presented, then the study needs to integrate over all 3 data sets (mRNA, sRNA, Methylome) in a genome wide manner</italic>.</p><p>In the revised version, we added eQTL analysis of the mRNAs, and used this for the co-regulation analysis of the sRNAs and their mother genes (subsection headed “Expression correlations between sRNAs and their mother genes”). We have data of DNA methylation for parents and hybrid, not the population, thus could not do genetic analysis.</p><p><italic>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below</italic>.<italic>]</italic></p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2</italic></xref> <italic>should be flipped along the diagonal so that QTL are along the x axis and traits on the y.
