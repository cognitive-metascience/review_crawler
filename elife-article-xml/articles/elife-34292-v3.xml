gradient essential for ATP production. In these cases, CII functions as a fumarate reductase that accepts electrons from a low electron potential quinol, rhodoquinol (RQ). To clarify the origins of RQ-mediated fumarate reduction in eukaryotes, we investigated the origin and function of <italic>rquA</italic>, a gene encoding an RQ biosynthetic enzyme. <italic>RquA</italic> is very patchily distributed across eukaryotes and bacteria adapted to hypoxia. Phylogenetic analyses suggest lateral gene transfer (LGT) of <italic>rquA</italic> from bacteria to eukaryotes occurred at least twice and the gene was transferred multiple times amongst protists. We demonstrate that RquA functions in the mitochondrion-related organelles of the anaerobic protist <italic>Pygsuia</italic> and is correlated with the presence of RQ. These analyses reveal the role of gene transfer in the evolutionary remodeling of mitochondria in adaptation to hypoxia.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Pygsuia</kwd><kwd>protists</kwd><kwd>mitochondria</kwd><kwd>anaerobic</kwd><kwd>rhodoquinone</kwd><kwd>evolution</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MOP 142349</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Roger</surname><given-names>Andrew J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1R15GM096398-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shepherd</surname><given-names>Jennifer N</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038</institution-id><institution>Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NSERC-CGS-D</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stairs</surname><given-names>Courtney W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004073</institution-id><institution>Killam Trusts</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stairs</surname><given-names>Courtney W</given-names></name><name><surname>Stairs</surname><given-names>Courtney W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038</institution-id><institution>Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RGPIN 05616</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dellaire</surname><given-names>Graham</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MOP 341174</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fawcett</surname><given-names>James P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A number of microbial eukaryotes have adapted to low oxygen conditions by acquiring a gene that allows their mitochondrial electron transport chain to continue to function when oxygen is scarce.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In aerobic eukaryotes, complexes I (CI) and II (CII) of the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) oxidize reduced cofactors generated by the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle (NADH and FADH<sub>2</sub> respectively) and reduce the lipid-soluble electron carrier ubiquinone (UQ) to ubiquinol (UQH<sub>2</sub>). Complex III (CIII) oxidizes UQH<sub>2</sub> and transfers electrons to cytochrome c oxidase (Complex IV, CIV; via cytochrome c) and eventually to O<sub>2</sub>, converting it to H<sub>2</sub>O (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In the process, CI, CIII, and CIV generate a proton gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane that fuels oxidative phosphorylation of ADP to ATP by the F<sub>1</sub>-F<sub>o</sub> ATP synthase (Complex V, CV). However, the ETCs of facultative anaerobes have adapted to function in the absence of oxygen by utilizing alternative terminal electron acceptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kita et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tielens, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Müller et al., 2012</xref>). For example, in the adult stage of <italic>Ascaris suum</italic>, CIII and CIV are down-regulated but CI continues to oxidize NADH and pump protons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sakai et al., 2012</xref>). In this organism, CI transfers electrons from NADH to the quinone, rhodoquinone (RQ), generating rhodoquinol (RQH<sub>2</sub>). RQH<sub>2</sub> is reoxidized by CII functioning as a fumarate reductase (FRD), reducing fumarate to succinate. Thus, the adult <italic>Ascaris</italic> mitochondrial ETC is still able to generate a proton gradient to fuel ATP synthesis, even in the absence of oxygen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). RQ is structurally similar to UQ but possesses an amino group instead of a methoxy group on the quinone ring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The lower electron potential of RQ (−63 mV), compared to UQ (+100 mV), favors the FRD reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Castro-Guerrero et al., 2005</xref>). RQ has also been detected in other eukaryotes that experience hypoxia including <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Takamiya et al., 1999</xref>), parasitic helminths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kita et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Van Hellemond et al., 1996</xref>)<italic>, Euglena gracilis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Castro-Guerrero et al., 2005</xref>) and <italic>Nyctotherus ovalis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boxma et al., 2005</xref>). However, the presence of RQ in mitochondria or related organelles of other anaerobic eukaryotes has not been established.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34292.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Structure and function of ubiquinone and rhodoquinone in mitochondria.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Under aerobic conditions, electrons from NADH or succinate (Suc) are shuttled to ubiquinone (UQ) via Complex I (I) or Complex II (II) respectively to generate NAD (NAD+), fumarate (fum) and ubiquinol (UQH2).

Of the various adaptations to anaerobiosis, the reduction or remodeling of the respiratory chain is of central importance to the ATP-generating function of the resulting organelles. Some anaerobic protists have completely lost all components of the respiratory chain, while others have maintained all or parts it <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">(Stairs et al., 2015</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">;Gawryluk et al., 2016</xref>).

Recently, biochemical and genetic investigations of the alphaproteobacterium <italic>Rhodospirillum rubrum</italic> have demonstrated that UQ is a precursor to RQ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brajcich et al., 2010</xref>), and that a putative methyltransferase (since named RquA) is essential for RQ biosynthesis and anaerobic growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lonjers et al., 2012</xref>). Here, we explore the distribution, evolutionary origins of RquA and RQ in microbial eukaryotes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The phylogenetic distribution of rquA</title><p>RquA homologs were retrieved from various publicly available databases using the <italic>Rhodospirillum rubrum</italic> sequence as the query in sequence similarity searches. We retrieved a total of 182 sequences from unique taxonomic units (i.e., NCBI taxonomy ID) and reduced this dataset to 166 sequences based on a sequence identity cutoff of less than 90%. The <italic>rquA</italic> gene is extremely rare in bacteria and eukaryotes, and we could not identify homologs in any publicly available archaeal genomes. <italic>RquA</italic> genes are found among sparse representatives of only seven different orders of alpha-, beta- and gammaproteobacteria (Burkholderiales, Magnetococcales, Neisseriales, Rhizobiales, Rhodobacteriales, Rhodocyclales and Rhodospirillales). To investigate the phyletic distribution of <italic>rquA</italic> in alphaproteobacteria specifically, we performed a phylogenomic analysis of <italic>rquA</italic>-containing genomes and their <italic>rquA</italic>-lacking relatives (discussed below).</p><p>Within eukaryotes, we identified <italic>rquA</italic> homologs in 24 representatives of four of the five super-groups of eukaryotes (Obazoa, Amoebozoa, Sar, and Excavata; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). The gene could not be found in the vast majority of eukaryotic genomes and transcriptome surveys available on Genbank (summarized in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Note that the absence of <italic>rquA</italic> in some of these data (particularly the transcriptomes) may be due to a lack of depth of sequence sampling. Within breviates, we identified <italic>rquA</italic> in <italic>Pygsuia biforma,</italic> but not in its close relatives, <italic>Breviata anathema</italic> and <italic>Lenisia limosa</italic>, despite the ample genomic and transcriptomic data available for the latter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hamann et al., 2016</xref>). We identified spliceosomal introns in the <italic>rquA</italic> genes in eukaryotic taxa for which genomic records were available (i.e., <italic>Proteromonas lacertae, Mastigamoeba balamuthi, Brevimastigomonas motovehiculus, Reticulomyxa filosa</italic>, and all the <italic>Blastocystis</italic> subtype genomes) indicating that these are in fact eukaryotic sequences and not prokaryotic contaminants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). The <italic>Proteromonas</italic> and <italic>Blastocystis rquA</italic> gene sequences showed conservation of intron position and size. But none of the other eukaryotic <italic>rquA</italic> gene sequences (for which genomic sequence was available) shared intron positions. We did identify a potential contaminating sequence in the mollusk <italic>Aplysia</italic> (Bioproject:PRJNA77701, Accession number:GBCZ01101516). This homolog was 89% identical to the <italic>Neoparamoeba</italic> amino acid sequence and could derive from a <italic>Neoparamoeba</italic>-related parasite present in the <italic>Aplysia</italic> tissue. Indeed, we were able to identify small subunit sequence (GBCZ01078303.1) that is 93% identical to <italic>Neoparamoeba aestuarina</italic> in this sequencing project. For this reason, we excluded the latter from all subsequent analyses.

A number topology tests were conducted to address this possibility. We first tested the monophyly of alphaproteobacteria as a whole (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>, tree 18) and found this was firmly rejected (p-value = 5×10<sup>−34</sup>), confirming our observation that alphaproteobacteria were phylogenetically interspersed throughout the RquA tree. We then tested: (i) the monophyly of eukaryotes + all alphaproteobacteria, (ii) the monophyly of all Group A eukaryotes + all Group A alphaproteobacteria, and the monophyly of all Group B eukaryotes + all Group B alphaproteobacteria. All of these topologies were rejected with p-values &lt; 0.01 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>, trees 18–21).

As in the full dataset analysis, all eukaryote lineages in each of Group A and B did not form single monophyletic groups and showed similar branching patterns to the full analysis. However, tests did not reject topologies constraining eukaryotes to form higher-order clades within each group (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Like in the full data set analysis, the Group A eukaryotes + ‘MAG Azo/Aceto’ alphaproteobacteria topology was not rejected, but the Group A eukaryotes + all Group A alphaproteobacteria (including the MAGs) topology was strongly rejected (p-value = 3×10<sup>−59</sup>). For Group B there were no alphaproteobacterial lineages particularly close to the eukaryotes in the phylogeny; eukaryotes tend to group with disparate betaproteobacteria in different parts of Group B). The test of a topology containing a clade of Group B eukaryotes + all Group B alphaproteobacteria resulted in strong rejection (p-value = 2×10<sup>−75</sup>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>The distribution of <italic>rquA</italic> amongst alphaproteobacteria</title><p>To further investigate whether Group A or Group B eukaryotic <italic>rquA</italic> homologs originated from the alphaproteobacterial mitochondrial endosymbiont, we investigated the representation and phylogenetic distribution of available <italic>rquA</italic>-containing alphaproteobacterial genomes. We assembled a phylogenomic matrix of 200 conserved ‘core’ proteins from the alphaproteobacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wang and Wu, 2013</xref>) to place the <italic>rquA</italic>-containing alphaproteobacterial taxa from our analyses within the context of a representative alphaproteobacterial species tree. Note that the matrix was assembled in such a way to always represent <italic>rquA</italic>-containing taxa, with the remainder of alphaproteobacterial taxa sub-selected from available genomes to maximize diversity. A maximum likelihood phylogeny estimated from this matrix shows that <italic>rquA</italic>-encoding alphaproteobacterial genomes are patchily distributed, emerging as numerous isolated groups within several orders of the alphaproteobacteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Group A- and Group B-containing taxa are interspersed. Genomes encoding the gene are extremely rare within the alphaproteobacterial orders. Five alphaproteobacterial orders (Rickettsiales, Holosporales, Pelagibacterales, Sphingomonadales, and Caulobacterales) had no <italic>rquA</italic>-containing taxa (out of a total of 455 genomes examined). The remaining three orders had <italic>rquA</italic>-containing taxa in 7 out of 514 (Rhizobiales), 6 out of 513 (Rhodobacterales) and 21 out of 217 (Rhodospirillales). The <italic>rquA</italic>-encoding ‘MAG Azo/Aceto’ alphaproteobacteria branch from within the Rhodospirillales as sister to another <italic>rquA</italic>-containing group.

However, in many of the bacterial genomes, <italic>rquA</italic> is encoded close (i.e., within 15 genes) to the genes encoding respiratory complexes (e.g., complex I, II, or III), respiration-associated functions (e.g., cytochrome, ubiquinone, and heme biosynthesis) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>), and/or anaerobiosis-associated proteins (e.g., [NiFe]-hydrogenase, nitrate reductase, [FeFe]-hydrogenase).

While three of these motifs are conserved in RquA sequences, the SAM-binding motif I is different when compared to other Class I SAM-methyltransferases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). Like the bacterial RquA sequences discussed by Lonjers and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lonjers et al., 2012</xref>), the eukaryotic RquA sequences have substitutions in key SAM binding sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>The distribution of quinone-utilizing enzymes in eukaryotes</title><p>RQ is known to function as an electron carrier between complex I, complex II and other UQ-utilizing enzymes such as electron transferring flavoprotein dehydrogenase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ma et al., 1993</xref>). If RquA is in fact synthesizing RQ in the eukaryotes presented here, then these organisms must encode at least two types of RQ-utilizing enzymes: those that reduce RQ and others that reoxidize it. To test this hypothesis, we searched for genes encoding the following quinone-utilizing enzymes that could possibly interact with RQ in the <italic>rquA-</italic>containing eukaryotic genomes and transcriptomes: the respiratory complexes (CI, CIII); quinone biosynthesis enzymes, COQ1-7; alternative oxidase (AOX); dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHOD); electron transferring flavoprotein system (ETF) (made up of ETFα and β; ETF dehydrogenase, ETFDH); glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (G3PDH); and sulfide:quinone oxidoreductase (SQO).

Our preliminary phylogenetic analysis revealed that all RquA homologs evolved from within a larger clade of proteobacterial Class I SAM-dependent methyltransferases.

RquA is extremely rare and patchily distributed over the backbone phylogeny of the groups of organisms in which it is found. Amongst bacteria, <italic>rquA</italic> is found in only 36 genomes of 2040 alphaproteobacteria, 59 out of 946 genomes of betaproteobacteria, and 2 out of 2493 genomes of gammaproteobacteria present in Genbank (September 2017). If one were to explain the bacterial <italic>rquA</italic> distribution by vertical inheritance alone, the gene would have had to have been present in the common ancestor of alpha-, beta- and gammaproteobacteria, and been lost potentially hundreds of times independently in the various members of the phyla that do not encode <italic>rquA.</italic> Our investigation of the phylogenetic distribution of <italic>rquA</italic> amongst alphaproteobacterial genomes specifically confirms this interpretation; the gene is extremely patchily distributed amongst orders of alphaproteobacteria and is completely absent from five of these orders. This is consistent with the rejection of alphaproteobacterial monophyly in the RquA phylogeny (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). It is therefore extremely difficult to determine in which group of bacteria <italic>rquA</italic> might have originated.

Our topology tests clearly indicate that a single global eukaryotic <italic>rquA</italic> clade and any higher-order grouping of Group A and B eukaryote sequences are strongly rejected by the data. However, within Group A and Group B, the monophyly of eukaryotic homologs cannot be rejected. Therefore, at the very least, Group A and Group B <italic>rquA</italic>s were introduced as different genes into eukaryotic genomes. The presence of <italic>rquA</italic> in some alphaproteobacterial genomes makes an endosymbiotic origin of eukaryote <italic>rquA</italic> an attractive hypothesis. If both A- and B-types of <italic>rquA</italic> had an endosymbiotic origin and were strictly vertically inherited within eukaryotes, then the endosymbiotic progenitor of mitochondria must have encoded both types. This is improbable given that no bacterium or eukaryote currently known (out of 182 organisms possessing the gene) encodes both types. However, it is also possible that either Group A or Group B <italic>rquA</italic>s in eukaryotes had an endosymbiotic origin and the other type was later re-acquired by bacteria-to-eukaryote LGT after loss of the ancestral endosymbiotic type. Of the two types, Group A <italic>rquA</italic> seems to be a more likely candidate for a mitochondrial origin since a Group A eukaryotes + ‘MAG Azo/Aceto’ alphaproteobacteria clade is not rejected in RquA topology tests. However, there are several problems with this scenario. First, ‘MAG Azo/Aceto’ alphaproteobacteria are a subgroup emerging from <italic>within</italic> the Rhodospirillales alphaproteobacteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>) and are not recovered as the sister group of mitochondria in recent phylogenomic analyses. Such analyses suggest that mitochondria are either related to the Rickettsiales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wang and Wu, 2015</xref>) and/or Pelagibacteriales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Thrash et al., 2011</xref>), or emerge as an independent deep branch within alphaproteobacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Martijn et al., 2018</xref> ). Since <italic>rquA</italic> is completely absent from Rickettsiales and Pelagibacteriales, and is very unlikely to be ancestral to alphaproteobacteria as a whole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>), a mitochondrial origin for eukaryotic homologs seems unlikely.</p><p>It is also improbable that either Group A or Group B <italic>rquA</italic> is ancestral to all eukaryotes. For example, if Group A <italic>rquA</italic> genes were ancestral to all eukaryotes, <italic>many</italic> parallel secondary loss events would have to be postulated. Considering the absence of the gene in genome sequence data of diverse eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sibbald and Archibald, 2017</xref>), the list of eukaryotic groups that would have to have lost A-type <italic>rquA</italic> includes multiple amoebozoan lineages except <italic>Mastigamoeba</italic> and neoparamoebids, lineages of stramenopiles besides <italic>Blastocystis</italic> and <italic>Proteromona</italic>s (e.g. diatoms, ochrophytes, oomycetes), lineages of Rhizaria besides <italic>Brevimastigamonas</italic> (e.g. <italic>Bigelowiella</italic> and <italic>Reticulomyxa</italic>), multiple Excavata lineages besides euglenids (e.g. Kinetoplastida, Metamonada, Heterolobosea), and the common ancestors of opisthokonts, apusomonads, alveolates, haptophytes, cryptophytes and Archaeplastida. The number of secondary losses required to explain Group B <italic>rquA</italic> as an ancestral eukaryotic gene is similarly large. Both secondary loss lists become considerably longer if the absence of the gene from transcriptomes of diverse eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sibbald and Archibald, 2017</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>) is considered as evidence.</p><p>Collectively these lines of evidence suggest that neither A- nor B-types of <italic>rquA</italic> are of mitochondrial origin and neither were present in the last eukaryotic common ancestor. Instead, these observations are more consistent with an LGT-based explanation, especially given that all of the eukaryotes that possess <italic>rquA</italic> genes are either anaerobes or facultative anaerobes. Although the role of LGT in eukaryotes has recently been questioned (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ku et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Martin, 2017</xref>), there is now abundant evidence for prokaryote-to-eukaryote and eukaryote-to-eukaryote LGT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andersson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jerlström-Hultqvist et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Stairs et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Karnkowska et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Eme et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Husnik and McCutcheon, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Leger et al., 2018</xref>). An LGT scenario for <italic>rquA</italic>, would require at least two bacteria-to-eukaryote LGTs (minimally one for Group A and one for B) followed by events of eukaryote-to-eukaryote LGT within groups A and B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). The scrambled phylogenetic relationships amongst the <italic>rquA</italic>-containing bacterial groups in the RquA tree makes it difficult to discern potential donors of eukaryotic <italic>rquA</italic>s. However, for the eukaryote sequences of the A-type, the affinities of the ‘MAG Azo/Aceto’ alphaproteobacteria to some of the eukaryotic sequences could implicate this gut-dwelling lineage of the Rhodospirillales as donors. This is particularly intriguing since the same genomes encode other enzymes of anaerobic metabolism including [FeFe]-Hydrogenase and its maturase enzymes HydE-G (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Degli Esposti et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Leger et al., 2016</xref>). Although several of these ‘MAG Azo/Aceto’ alphaproteobacterial homologs of hydrogenase metabolism show affinities to some (but not all) eukaryotic homologs, others appear to be more distantly related to eukaryotes (and to each other) suggesting multiple independent origins by LGT (see supplementary figures S3-S6 from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Leger et al., 2016</xref>). We propose that the ‘MAG Azo/Aceto’ alphaproteobacteria acquired the hydrogen and rhodoquinone metabolism genes from other anaerobic bacteria relatively recently in a series of LGT events.</p><p>In any case, after the initial lateral transfer of A- and B-type genes into recipient eukaryotes, the <italic>rquA</italic> sequences must then have acquired mitochondrial targeting sequences (MTS).

Additional data from more eukaryotic and prokaryotic taxa harbouring <italic>rquA</italic> (perhaps from metagenomic investigations of low-oxygen environments) should improve the resolution of the phylogeny and will allow the relative merits of the various evolutionary origin scenarios to be re-assessed in future.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>RquA function and the ‘transferability’ of RQ biosynthesis between organisms</title><p>The role and enzymatic activity of RquA in this reaction is currently unclear. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lonjers et al. (2012)</xref> outline three hypotheses for the role of RquA in RQ biosynthesis. The first hypothesis is that RquA could serve a regulatory role in the expression of currently unknown RQ biosynthesis proteins. Since the vast majority of mitochondrial proteins (and all of those involved in quinone biosynthesis) are encoded by nuclear genes and we have shown that RquA functions in mitochondria, it is unlikely that RquA has a role in regulating the expression of such genes in the nucleus (although it could participate in post-transcriptional, or post-translational regulation).</p><p>A second hypothesis is that UQ and RQ are synthesized by different multi-enzyme complexes in <italic>R. rubrum</italic> that share <italic>some</italic> components. Therefore, the removal of one of these components (RquA) results in a non-functional complex in their <italic>rquA</italic> knockout experiments. This is based on the observation that some components of the yeast UQ biosynthesis complex are necessary for stabilization of the complex independent of their catalytic role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baba et al., 2004</xref>). If this were the case for RQ biosynthesis, one would expect all organisms that encoded RquA would also have to encode UQ biosynthesis proteins. However, many of the eukaryotes that encode RquA do not encode any components of the UQ biosynthesis pathway (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). These organisms either synthesize UQ by an unknown mechanism, or rely on exogenous sources of UQ as discussed above. It is therefore very improbable that RquA serves to stabilize a UQ/RQ biosynthesis complex.</p><p>The final hypothesis is that RquA is directly involved in catalyzing the conversion of UQ to RQ. Since RquA is related to the quinone biosynthesis enzyme UbiE/Coq5 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>, tree 1), RquA very likely can bind to UQ-like molecules. Although it is tempting to suggest that RquA directly converts UQ to RQ in one step, no enzyme is known that catalyzes a one-step amino-transfer reaction with a methoxy leaving group. It seems more plausible that either: (i) RquA alone catalyzes a multi-step reaction sequence, or, (ii) is one enzyme in a multi-step pathway involving at least a demethylation step followed by an amino-transfer reaction. We were unable to find any other enzyme with the same restricted phylogenetic distribution as <italic>rquA</italic> amongst bacterial or eukaryotic homologs using phylogenetic profiling (i.e., assessing co-presence of genes within <italic>rquA-</italic>containing but not <italic>rquA</italic>-lacking organisms). Therefore, it seems likely that, if option (ii) were correct, another broadly-conserved enzyme with a different main biochemical function in bacteria and in mitochondria could, as a moonlighting side-reaction, catalyze a step of RQ biosynthesis. Under either of these scenarios, then, the lateral transfer of the <italic>rquA</italic> gene could, in principle, confer on the recipient the ability to convert UQ to RQ. Clearly, further experimental work will be needed to test these hypotheses.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Remodeling of the electron tansport chain</title><p>Some of us have previously advanced a hypothetical scenario that proposes evolutionary steps by which the diverse types of anaerobic mitochondrion-related organelles might have evolved in protistan lineages adapted to transient or permanent hypoxia from predominantly aerobic ancestors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Stairs et al., 2015</xref>). The acquisition of <italic>rquA</italic> by LGT as described herein, was a key early step in these transitions; the selective benefit of this acquisition seems relatively clear. For example, assuming that the ancestral mitochondrial metabolism of many aerobic protistan groups resembled that of modern model system eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, ‘aerobic mitochondria’), it is likely that they would occasionally encounter transient low-oxygen conditions regardless of whether they are in marine, freshwater, or terrestrial environments. During transient exposure to anoxia, it is known from model systems that CIII and CIV fail to function efficiently and are downregulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Vijayasarathy et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fukuda et al., 2007</xref>). Furthermore, under hypoxic conditions (e.g., in ischemia-reperfusion injury or solid tumours), shifts in mitochondrial metabolism occur: reduced UQ (UQH<sub>2</sub>) builds up because of the lack of CIII/CIV activity, the NADH/NAD + ratios increase as CI throughput is repressed, and part of the TCA cycle reverses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tomitsuka et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chouchani et al., 2014</xref>). Under these conditions, malate is imported from the cytosol (or produced in mitochondria) and is converted to fumarate by fumarase. At sufficiently high UQH<sub>2</sub> and fumarate concentrations, CII will function in fumarate reduction to regenerate UQ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ackrell et al., 1993</xref>) and succinate. This ‘NADH:fumarate reductase system’ allows CI to continue to function to pump protons and oxidize NADH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tomitsuka et al., 2010</xref>). Under these conditions, however, it is known that CI and CII produce high levels of toxic reactive oxygen species (ROS) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tomitsuka et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chouchani et al., 2014</xref>. Thus, if an organism frequently encountering these low-oxygen conditions were to acquire <italic>rquA</italic> by LGT and express the gene, the organism would able to synthesize and utilize low electron potential RQ as an electron carrier. RQ would greatly enhance the efficiency of the LGT recipient’s NADH:fumarate reductase system leading to an increase in proton pumping of CI, restoration of ATP synthesis and decreased ROS production.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34292.016</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>The interactions of rhodoquinone with other mitochondrial redox reactions in different eukaryotes with mitochondrion-related organelles.</title><p>Standard reduction potentials for each major reaction involved in rhodoquinone (R)) and ubiquinone (U) metabolism are shown in increasing order of potential.

The parasites <italic>Blastocystis</italic> spp. have gone further in this reduction; they completely lack CIII-CV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lantsman et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Stechmann et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gentekaki et al., 2017</xref>) and therefore none of their ATP is produced by oxidative phosphorylation. The most reduced ETCs amongst organisms with RquA occur in <italic>Pygsuia biforma</italic> and <italic>Mastigmoeba balamuthi</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), as both completely lack CI, CIII, CIV and CV. In the absence of CI, it is unclear how these two organisms can be reducing the oxidized RQ produced by CII. Most of their quinone-binding proteins typically catalyze redox reactions with reduction potentials far greater than RQ reduction and thus would be expected to oxidize RQH<sub>2</sub> rather than do the opposite. One possibility is that the electron transferring flavoprotein (ETF)/ETF-dehydrogenase (ETF-DH) systems of these organisms (which usually function in fatty acid oxidation) are able to gain electrons by oxidizing reduced NADH. This could occur by electron bifurcation with butyryl-CoA dehydrogenase, as is known to occur in some bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chowdhury et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chowdhury et al., 2015</xref>).

An alternative possibility in <italic>Pygsuia</italic> is that NADH oxidation could be achieved by two remaining conserved subunits of CI, NuoE and NuoF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Stairs et al., 2015</xref>), working together with ETF/ETF-DH system.

Regardless, these LGTs likely conferred the ability to biosynthesize RQ in mitochondria, making it possible for complex II to efficiently reduce fumarate to succinate, allowing the recipient eukaryotes to respire in the absence of oxygen. This is a stark example of how laterally acquired enzymes can interface with ancestral pathways in mitochondria to rapidly adapt these organelles to low oxygen conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Stairs et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nývltová et al., 2015</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Culturing and microscopy</title><p>Cultures of <italic>Pygsuia biforma</italic> were maintained in American Type Culture Collection medium 802 prepared in natural seawater as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brown et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Stairs et al., 2014</xref>).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Gisela Storz (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal her identity: Julie Dunning-Hotopp (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>All reviewers think this is an interesting paper, and all were particularly impressed with the author's microscopy and biochemical work showing that the gene in question was localized to the organelle and that the metabolite profile was consistent with the predicted function. Overall the reviewers thought this paper will make a valuable contribution to the literature. It is a clear example of an HGT having a critically important role in the evolution of the anaerobic lifestyle, and it adds to a fairly short list of inbound eukaryotic HGTs that have been shown to have a clear and specific function.

In particular, it seems plausible that this gene was present in the ancestor of all eukaryotes, and has been lost in aerobic eukaryotes. Could the taxonomic distribution be explained by the gene being present in the ancestor of all eukaryotes but one significant, key loss in a lineage like Opisthokonts? The current taxonomic disparities could then be explained as eukaryote to bacteria LGT, as well as other explanations. The idea of eukaryote-to-bacteria LGT may have been addressed in the second paragraph of the subsection “Phylogenetic Analysis of Bacterial and Eukaryotic RquA Homologs”, however there is some concern that the prokaryotic genes may be confounding the tests.</p></disp-quote><p>We understand the reviewers concerns. We note that any potential case of LGT can <italic>always</italic> be explained by an alternative vertical descent scenario that involves ancestral presence, gene duplications and massive differential loss. So we suggest that the question is not whether RquA in eukaryotes <italic>can</italic> be explained by such a scenario, but rather what is the most likely explanation for the origins of these genes in eukaryotes. Our analyses show unequivocally that there are two robust clades of RquA: A and B. There are eukaryotic sequences and multiple bacterial sequences that branch within each of these clades. The chances that RquA is ancestral to all eukaryotes seems quite remote given the extreme rarity and patchiness of the gene; of 12225 eukaryotic genomes (in NCBI), 2102 genome shotgun projects (in NCBI TSA database) and 647 transcriptomes in the MMETSP only 24 eukaryote homologs of the RquA gene were found. The eukaryotes that encode the RquA protein are lineages adapted to permanent or transient anoxia that emerge from within predominantly aerobic groups in the global eukaryotic tree. Furthermore, they are distantly related to one another. It is therefore very unparsimonious to posit of all of the ancestors of these organisms going back to the last eukaryotic common ancestor (LECA) retained this gene but, then after these lineages diverged from other eukaryotes (some quite recently), there was widespread loss in dozens of disparate eukaryotic lineages giving rise to the gene presence/absence patterns observed. For example, even if transcriptome data were discounted, for group A RquA enzymes, secondary loss events would have had to happen in <italic>many</italic>different eukaryote lineages for which complete genome data is available. Assuming for the sake of argument a ‘Opimoda/Diphoda’ root for the tree of eukaryotes (Derelle et al. (2015) <italic>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.</italic> USA 112:E693-699), the secondary loss list would include at least several Amoebozoan lineages except <italic>Mastigamoeba</italic> and neoparamoebids (e.g. <italic>Acanthamoeba, Entamoeba</italic>, dictyostelids, <italic>Physarum</italic>), other lineages of stramenopiles besides <italic>Blastocystis/Proteromona</italic>s (e.g. diatoms, <italic>Ectocarpus, Phytophthora</italic>), the common ancestor of all opisthokonts, <italic>Thecamonas</italic>, other lineages of Rhizaria besides <italic>Brevimastigamonas</italic> and foraminifera (e.g. <italic>Bigelowiella</italic>) and common ancestors of Heteroloboseans (e.g. <italic>Naegleria</italic>), Metamonada (<italic>Giardia, Trichomonas, Monocercomonoides</italic>), Alveolates, Cryptophytes (e.g. <italic>Guillardia</italic>) and Archaeplastida. The corresponding list for group B <italic>rquA</italic> is similarly long. Both lists get considerably longer if the absence of the gene from transcriptome data for diverse eukaryotes is considered as evidence.</p><p>Furthermore, a strictly vertical descent and gene duplication scenario would require that the ancestral eukaryote (LECA) and the mitochondrial endosymbiont (assuming a mitochondrial origin) had at least two copies of the <italic>rquA</italic> gene (at least one of the A family and one of the B family). No organism (prokaryote or eukaryote) currently known (out of 182 organisms <italic>rquA</italic> (166 organism with <italic>rquA</italic> sequences less than 90% identical) encodes both an A-type and B-type in their genome, so this scenario also seems rather unlikely. The idea that eukaryotes donated some of the genes to bacteria also seems implausible because most of the <italic>rquA</italic>-containing eukaryotes for which genomic data is available possess spliceosomal introns in their <italic>rquA</italic> genes. Such introns provide a barrier to successful eukaryote-to-prokaryote gene transfer (at least if transfer occurs on the DNA level).</p><p>For these reasons it is more plausible, in our view, that recent independent gains of the gene occurred by prokaryote-to-eukaryote LGT followed by eukaryote-to-eukaryote LGT events during adaptation of these organisms to facultative anaerobiosis.</p><p>We have substantially revised the Discussion section of our manuscript to try to clarify our reasoning and include the foregoing arguments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Please address whether some of these rquA genes might have been obtained from the mitochondrial endosymbiont. There are a number of alphaproteobacterial sequences in the tree, and it would be useful to test whether an alphaproteobacterial origin of the eukaryotic sequences can be rejected (e.g. taking the closest alphaproteobacterial sequence or clade in each case).</p></disp-quote><p>We investigated whether some of the <italic>rquA</italic> genes might have been obtained from the mitochondria symbiont by doing two kinds of analyses:</p><p>Analyses (1): We performed a number of additional topology tests. For the full dataset we tested: (i) the monophyly of eukaryotes + all alphaproteobacteria, (ii) the monophyly of Group A eukaryotes + Group A alphaproteobacteria, and the monophyly of Group B eukaryotes + Group B alphaproteobacteria. Each of these topologies was rejected with a p-value &lt;&lt; 0.01.</p><p>Our further mining of databases (point #4 below) yielded some metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) of new alphaproteobacteria (<italic>Candidatus</italic> ‘Azospirillum’ and <italic>Candidatus</italic> ‘Acetobacter’ metagenome clusters that we refer to as ‘MAG Azo/Aceto alphaproteobacteria’). In our new phylogenies this new group branched closely to a number of Group A eukaryote sequences (e.g. <italic>Blastocystis, Proteromonas,</italic> neoparamoebids, euglenids and <italic>Pygsuia</italic> that we refer to as ‘Group A1 eukaryotes’). In any case, for the full data set we tested the specific affinity of all Group A eukaryotes (A1 and others in group A) to MAG alphaproteobacteria specifically and could not reject this topology (p = 0.227).</p><p>We further tested the affinities of the various taxa using Group A- and Group B-specific data sets. As expected, the Group A eukaryotes + MAG Azo/Aceto alphaproteobacteria topology was not rejected, but the Group A eukaryotes + all Group A alphaproteobacteria (including MAGs) topology was strongly rejected (p-value = 3 x 10<sup>-59</sup>). For Group B there were no alphaproteobacterial lineages particularly close to the eukaryotes in the phylogeny (eukaryotes tend to group with disparate betaproteobacteria in different parts of Group B), and the test of the Group B eukaryotes + all Group B alphaproteobacteria topology resulted in strong rejection (p-value = 2 x 10<sup>-75</sup>).</p><p>Conclusions from (1): Topologies that have <italic>all</italic> the alphaproteobacteria grouping together in a clade with eukaryotes from both Groups A and B, or individually within Group A or Group B are firmly rejected by topology tests. Note that such monophyletic eukaryotes + alphaproteobacterial topologies (or topologies consistent with them) are usually recovered for alphaproteobacterial-derived mitochondrial proteins (e.g. chaperones, PDH subunits, ETC subunits, FtsZ <italic>etc.</italic>). Group A and Group B eukaryote homologs (and alphaproteobacterial homologs in these groups) clearly have distinct origins from each other. However, the possibility that eukaryotes are monophyletic within each of these groups cannot be rejected. Group A eukaryote homologs could have originated from transfer from an ancestral ‘MAG Azo/Aceto’ alphaproteobacteria specifically. This would be evidence of a mitochondrial origin only if these alphaproteobacteria (a sub-group of Rhodospirillales) were candidate for mitochondrial sister groups. However, phylogenomic analyses do not implicate these taxa as mitochondrial sisters; instead they suggest mitochondria are related to either Rickettsiales, Holosporales, Pelagibacteriales or as a deep independent branch of alphaproteobacteria. It seems, therefore, unlikely that the Group A eukaryotes + MAG Azo/Aceto alphaproteobacteria relationship is suggestive of a mitochondrial origin. Group B eukaryotic homologs have no specific affinities to alphaproteobacteria and their alphaproteobacterial origin seems unlikely.</p><p>Analyses (2): If either Group A or Group B eukaryotic <italic>rquA</italic>s originated from the mitochondrial endosymbiont, then the only positive evidence for this would be if these genes were either widespread and ancient within the alphaproteobacterial tree and/or the genes was present in the genomes of the closest alphaproteobacterial relatives to mitochondria. To address this we assembled a phylogenomic matrix of 200 conserved ‘core’ proteins from this phylum to place the <italic>rquA</italic>-containing alphaproteobacterial taxa from our analyses within the context of a representative alphaproteobacterial species tree (note that the tree was constructed in such a way to always represent <italic>rquA</italic>-containing taxa, but the remainder of taxa were sub-seletcted from available genomes to maximize diversity). That phylogeny (now shown as Figure 2—figure supplement 2) shows that many <italic>rquA</italic>-containing alphaproteobacterial genomes occur patchily as derived lineages throughout the various order of the alphaproteobacterial tree. Group A- and Group B-containing taxa are interspersed. The extreme rarity of the enzyme within each of the major α groups for which genomes are available is also shown in this figure. The frequency of <italic>rquA</italic>-containing genomes in each alphaproteobacterial order ranged from 0% (for 5 out of 8 orders) to 9.6% (Rhodospirillales).</p><p>Conclusions from (2): Based on the extreme rarity and patchy distribution of <italic>rquA</italic> across alphaproteobacteria it is very unlikely that either the A-type or B-type gene was encoded in ancestral alphaproteobacterial genomes. Furthermore, no alphaproteobacteria (nor <italic>any</italic> organism so far known) encodes both an A-type or a B-type enzyme, making a single mitochondrial origin for both types very unlikely. The candidate sister groups to mitochondria based on phylogenomic evidence are the Rickettsiaciae, Holosporales, Pelagibacteriales or mitochondria emerge as the deepest branch in the alphaproteobacterial tree (see Box 1 of Roger et al. (2017) Curr. Biol.27: R1177-R1192 and references therein). None of these first three groups contain <italic>rquA</italic>-encoding species, and, since it is unlikely that <italic>rquA</italic> is an ancestral alphaproteobacterial gene, there is no positive evidence for a mitochondrial origin of <italic>rquA</italic> in eukaryotes.</p><p>As a result of these analyses, we have substantially changed the sections of the Results discussing the topology tests (Phylogenetic Analysis of Bacterial and Eukaryotic RquA Homologs)and added a new section discussing Analysis (2) above entitled: “The distribution of <italic>rquA</italic> amongst alphaproteobacteria”.</p><p>We also now explicitly discuss the implications of analyses (1) and (2) in the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) All three reviewers were concerned that the genome/transcriptome and database searches performed with rquA were too insensitive.

The reviewers don't think this will change the fundamental story but rquA distribution is an important part of this paper (and it's not much work) so it should be done to give the reader confidence that this gene is indeed sparsely distributed.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this helpful suggestion. To address this concern, we used our existing RquA alignment and masked N-terminal and C-terminal regions to generate a specific RquA hmmer profile (RquA.hmm). We then generated profiles for COG2226 (the best scoring domain for many RquA and related UBIE/methyltransferase homologues on NCBI conserved domains [NCBI CDD]). To capture sequence diversity we generated two COG2226 profiles: (i) using the NCBI CDD alignment and (ii) retrieved the UniRef90 records for COG2226 and generated an alignment resulting in two HMMs: COG2226_CDD.hmm and COG2226_UniRef90.hmm. Using the RquA.hmm profile and hmmsearch, we retrieved 22174 protein sequences from NCBI GenBank (February 7 2018). We then performed a hmmscan of these 22174 against a custom database of PFAM, RquA and COG2226 profiles. Of these 22174 proteins, only 284 sequences had a best scoring hit to the RquA-specific profile (summarized in Supplementary file 1), 245 of which were deposited at the time of our original analysis (September 2017). Of the 284, the majority represent sequences that are &gt;90% identical to sequences in our existing dataset. However, we did identify some new sequences that were not within this similarity threshold (n=79). We generated a phylogenetic tree of these new sequences together with UBIE and RquA sequences and found that many of the HMM-retrieved sequences belonged to non-RquA clades (Supplementary file 2 – Tree 1; <italic>Mycobacterium</italic> sequences were excluded since they were extremely divergent and could lead to long-branch related artefacts).</p><p>Throughout the procedure, we noticed that some of the HMM-retrieved sequences did indeed branch within the RquA clade and so we reanalysed the phylogenetic history of RquA using these newly identified sequences. In particular, we observed six sequences from metagenomics sequencing projects belonging to genomes annotated as <italic>Candidatus</italic> ‘Azospirillum’ and ‘Acetobacter’ species discussed in the answer to point 3 above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Some reviewers wanted more detail about the conservation of introns in the eukaryotic versions of rquA. Are these introns found at conserved positions within the rquA genes (suggesting a single origin and &quot;eukaryotification&quot; of the gene) or at different sites, which would be consistent with multiple independent acquisitions by LGT?</p></disp-quote><p>To address this concern, we have generated an alignment indicating where in the eukaryotic sequences we detected introns in genomic data (Supplementary file 3). We observed that closely related sequences (e.g., 2 <italic>Blastocystis</italic> subtypes and <italic>Proteromonas</italic>) shared conserved intron positions – although <italic>Blastocystis</italic> subtype 1 has lost the third intron. However, we were unable to observe conservation of intron positions in any of the other species. We were unable to find introns in the genomic <italic>rquA</italic>sequence from <italic>Stentor</italic>. However, the <italic>Stentor</italic> genome has a low intron density with only 9325 introns identified in the 34506 gene models Slabodnick et al. (2017) Curr. Biol. 20:569-575.</p><p>This result is consistent with multiple interpretations of the origins of these proteins. It is well known that intron loss can occur via reverse transcription of spliced messages and recombination with the parental genomic copy. Intron gain can subsequently occur at different intron positions in the same gene (e.g. see Huff et al. (2016) Nature 538:533-536). Thus, both of these phenomena can happen even if the gene evolves by ‘vertical descent’ within eukaryotes. Therefore the lack of intron conservation across the eukaryotic taxa cannot be taken as strong evidence that these homologs had separate bacterial origins, but it is consistent with it.</p><p>We have added the following figure and explanation in the Results section:</p><p>“We identified spliceosomal introns in the <italic>rquA</italic> genes in eukaryotic taxa for which genomic records were available (i.e., <italic>Proteromonas lacertae, Mastigamoeba balamuthi, Brevimastigomonas motovehiculus, Reticulomyxa filosa</italic>, and all the <italic>Blastocystis</italic> subtype genomes) indicating that these are in fact eukaryotic sequences and not prokaryotic contaminants (Figure 2—figure supplement 1). The <italic>Proteromonas</italic> and <italic>Blastocystis rquA</italic> gene sequences showed conservation of intron position and size. But none of the other eukaryotic <italic>rquA</italic>gene sequences (for which genomic sequence was available) shared intron positions.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
