The cytosolic ATPase Cdc48 drives extraction by pulling on polyubiquitinated substrates. How hydrophobic transmembrane (TM) segments are moved from the phospholipid bilayer into cytosol, often together with hydrophilic and folded ER luminal protein parts, is not known. Using a reconstituted system with purified proteins from <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, we show that the ubiquitin ligase Doa10 (Teb-4/MARCH6 in animals) is a retrotranslocase that facilitates membrane protein extraction. A substrate’s TM segment interacts with the membrane-embedded domain of Doa10 and then passively moves into the aqueous phase. Luminal substrate segments cross the membrane in an unfolded state. Their unfolding occurs on the luminal side of the membrane by cytoplasmic Cdc48 action. Our results reveal how a membrane-bound retrotranslocase cooperates with the Cdc48 ATPase in membrane protein extraction.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>The inside of a cell contains many different compartments called organelles, which are separated by membranes. Each organelle is composed of a unique set of proteins and performs specific roles in the cell. The endoplasmic reticulum, or ER for short, is an organelle where many proteins are produced. Most of these proteins are then released from the cell or sorted to other organelles. The ER has a strict quality control system that ensures any faulty proteins are quickly marked for the cell to destroy. However, the destruction process itself does not happen in the ER, so faulty proteins first need to leave this organelle. This is achieved by a group of proteins known as endoplasmic reticulum-associated protein degradation machinery (or ERAD for short).</p><p>To extract a faulty protein from the ER, proteins of the ER and outside the ER cooperate. First, an ERAD protein called Doa10 attaches a small protein tag called ubiquitin to the faulty proteins to mark them for destruction. Then, outside of the ER, a protein called Cdc48 ‘grabs’ the ubiquitin tag and pulls. But that is only part of the story. Many of the proteins made by the ER have tethers that anchor them firmly to the membrane, making them much harder to remove.</p><p>To get a better idea of how the extraction works, Schmidt et al. rebuilt the ERAD machinery in a test tube. This involved purifying proteins from yeast and inserting them into artificial membranes, allowing closer study of each part of the process. This revealed that attaching ubiquitin tags to faulty proteins is only one part of Doa10's role; it also participates in the extraction itself. Part of Doa10 resides within the membrane, and this ‘membrane-spanning domain’ can interact with faulty proteins, loosening their membrane anchors. At the same time, Cdc48 pulls from the outside. This pulling force causes the faulty proteins to unfold, allowing them to pass through the membrane.</p><p>Given these findings, the next step is to find out exactly how Doa10 works by looking at its three-dimensional structure. This could have implications not only for the study of ERAD, but of similar quality control processes in other organelles too. A build-up of faulty proteins can cause diseases like neurodegeneration, so understanding how cells remove faulty proteins could help future medical research.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>ERAD</kwd><kwd>protein quality control</kwd><kwd>protein translocation</kwd><kwd>ubiquitin proteasome system</kwd><kwd>membrane proteins</kwd><kwd>in vitro reconstitution</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010663</institution-id><institution>H2020 European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>677770</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stein</surname><given-names>Alexander</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFB1190, TP15</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stein</surname><given-names>Alexander</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Doa10, a membrane-embedded ubiquitin ligase, facilitates the removal of membrane proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum and cooperates with the Cdc48 ATPase in this process.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a major site for protein folding and maturation in the endomembrane system of the eukaryotic cell. A conserved quality control pathway called ER-associated protein degradation (ERAD) removes misfolded, unassembled and mistargeted proteins from the ER into the cytosol where they are degraded by the proteasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Christianson and Ye, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Mehrtash and Hochstrasser, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Ruggiano et al., 2014</xref>). ERAD thus contributes to protein homeostasis. Its malfunction results in ER stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hwang and Qi, 2018</xref>), and it has been linked to several human diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Guerriero and Brodsky, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Qi et al., 2017</xref>). ERAD is part of the ubiquitin proteasome system. Studies in the yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> identified two universally conserved membrane-embedded ubiquitin ligases that ubiquitinate ERAD substrates, Hrd1 (SYVN1 in human) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bordallo et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hampton et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kikkert et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Nadav et al., 2003</xref>) and Doa10 (TEB-4/MARCH6 in animals, SUD-1 in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Doblas et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hassink et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Swanson et al., 2001</xref>). In higher eukaryotes, a larger variety of ubiquitin ligases plays a role in ERAD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Olzmann et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Substrates of ERAD can be soluble luminal proteins, or membrane proteins that either need to be moved across or extracted from the ER membrane. This process, termed retrotranslocation or dislocation, requires the AAA protein Cdc48 (VCP or p97 in animals) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bays et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Garza et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Jarosch et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Nakatsukasa et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Rabinovich et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Ye et al., 2001</xref>). Cdc48 is recruited to substrates by its cofactors Ufd1 and Npl4 which interact with polyubiquitin chains with lysine 48 linkage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Meyer et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Ye et al., 2003</xref>). The Cdc48 complex is thought to generate a pulling force that drives extraction of polyubiquitinated proteins from the membrane. This notion is based on biochemical experiments with soluble proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bodnar and Rapoport, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Olszewski et al., 2019</xref>) and recent cryo-EM structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bodnar et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cooney et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Twomey et al., 2019</xref>), which showed that processive threading of a substrate through the central pore of the Cdc48 hexamer under ATP consumption leads to unfolding.</p><p>Apart from the Cdc48 ATPase, membrane proteins of the ERAD machinery are thought to contribute to retrotranslocation. For soluble substrates, Hrd1 forms part of a retrotranslocon pore from the ER lumen to the cytosol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Baldridge and Rapoport, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Carvalho et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Stein et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Vasic et al., 2020</xref>), but other components such as the Derlin Der1 are also involved, as shown by biochemical data and a recent cryo-EM structure of the Hrd1 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mehnert et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Wu et al., 2020</xref>). Less is known about retrotranslocation of membrane proteins. The machinery that mediates this process needs to be quite versatile, because substrates can exhibit different topologies. They may contain one or multiple transmembrane (TM) segments, stretches of hydrophilic amino acids in luminal loops and tightly folded domains. How these structurally and physicochemically diverse elements move across a phospholipid bilayer during the extraction process is not known. Multipass transmembrane proteins such as members of the Derlin family (Der1 and Dfm1 in yeast; Derlin-1,–2 in animals), Hrd1 and Doa10 have been suggested to act as retrotranslocases for membrane proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Carvalho et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hampton and Sommer, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lilley and Ploegh, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Neal et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Swanson et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Ye et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>Another unresolved but linked question regards the folding state of luminal domains during the retrotranslocation process. It is unclear whether luminal domains are moved across the membrane in a folded state, if unfolding occurs prior to retrotranslocation, potentially by a separate ER luminal machinery, or if unfolding is directly coupled to retrotranslocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brodsky, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Shi et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>To address these questions, we investigated ERAD mediated by the ubiquitin ligase Doa10 from <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. Doa10 is a 150 kDa protein with 14 TM segments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kreft et al., 2006</xref>). Its substrates include single- and multi-spanning membrane proteins of the ER and inner nuclear membrane, but also soluble proteins of the cyto- and nucleoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Ravid et al., 2006</xref>). No completely soluble, luminal substrates of Doa10 have been described. The degrons of Doa10 substrates can be cytoplasmic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Furth et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Swanson et al., 2001</xref>), or within the TM region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Habeck et al., 2015</xref>). Furthermore, Doa10 regulates sterol metabolism in plants, fungi and animals by degrading squalene monooxygenase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Doblas et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Foresti et al., 2013</xref>). Through degradation of mislocalized membrane proteins, Doa10 has a role in maintaining organelle identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dederer et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Matsumoto et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Ruggiano et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Doa10 works in concert with two ubiquitin conjugating enzymes (E2), the tail-anchored membrane protein Ubc6 and the soluble cytoplasmic protein Ubc7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Swanson et al., 2001</xref>). Ubc7 is anchored to the ER membrane by Cue1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Biederer et al., 1997</xref>). Experiments with soluble cytoplasmic protein fragments showed that Ubc6 and Ubc7 have different roles in the build-up of polyubiquitin chains. Ubc6 initiates ubiquitin chains by transferring the first ubiquitin moiety, whereas Ubc7 extends ubiquitin chains with mainly lysine 48 linkage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Weber et al., 2016</xref>). Importantly, Ubc6 is itself an unstable protein and degraded in a Doa10-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Swanson et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Walter et al., 2001</xref>). Similarly, Ubc6 homologues in plants and mammals have been shown to be unstable and are degraded by the proteasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lam et al., 2014</xref>). Interestingly, in case of the <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> Ubc6 homologue Ubc32, and the mammalian Ube2J1, Hrd1 was identified as the ubiquitin ligase involved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Burr et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Here, we developed a reconstituted system with purified proteins to investigate the role of Doa10 in membrane protein retrotranslocation. This system allowed us to mechanistically investigate membrane protein extraction, without relying on indirect read-outs of downstream reactions such as proteasomal degradation. We show that Doa10 is a membrane protein retrotranslocase. Furthermore, we show how Doa10 cooperates with the Cdc48 ATPase in the extraction of proteins with folded luminal domains.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>We reconstituted purified and fluorescently labeled Doa10 and its substrate Ubc6 into separate liposome populations, together with complementary SNARE proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1, A</xref> to F). The tail-anchored (TA) membrane protein Ubc6 was chosen as a model substrate, to limit the number of membrane proteins in our system and thus its complexity. To achieve efficient liposome fusion, we employed previously well-characterized engineered versions of rat SNAREs involved in synaptic vesicle exocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cypionka et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hernandez et al., 2012</xref>). Indeed, mixing of the two liposome sets led to SNARE-mediated co-reconstitution of Ubc6 and Doa10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1G</xref>). This approach ensures that Doa10 and Ubc6 only interact in the phospholipid bilayer, avoiding non-native interactions that can occur when membrane proteins are mixed in the presence of detergents for co-reconstitution. Protease protection experiments showed that Doa10 was reconstituted mostly in the correct orientation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1H</xref>). For Ubc6, 45% was correctly oriented, another 45% wrong-side out oriented, and a minor fraction not properly membrane inserted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1, I</xref> to K).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Retrotranslocation of Ubc6 by Doa10.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) SNARE-mediated co-reconstitution of Ubc6 and Doa10. Engineered versions of SNAREs involved in synaptic exocytosis were used, that is a Syntaxin 1A fragment, SNAP-25A, and Synaptobrevin 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Pobbati et al., 2006</xref>).

To test this hypothesis, we incubated Ubc6 liposomes with Get3, a chaperone for TA proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mateja et al., 2009</xref>) that also interacts with Ubc6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Liposomes were then immobilized to separate soluble and membrane-bound proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>). In the presence of Get3, 43 ± 4% Ubc6 was released from liposomes with co-reconstituted Doa10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>). When co-reconstitution of Doa10 with Ubc6 was prevented by inhibiting SNARE-mediated fusion or when Ubc6 liposomes were fused with liposomes lacking Doa10, only 7–9% of Ubc6 were found in the soluble fraction, representing the fraction of Ubc6 sticking to the outside of the liposome surface. In the absence of Get3, or when we used a Get3 mutant defective in TA protein binding (Get3 I193D) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mateja et al., 2009</xref>), we observed no, or drastically reduced release, respectively. Nucleotide hydrolysis was not required for Ubc6 release and an ATPase deficient mutant (Get3 D57N) behaved indistinguishably from wild-type (WT) Get3. This suggests that Doa10 allows for passive movement of its substrate Ubc6 out of the membrane.</p><p>Release of Ubc6 from the liposome membrane involves movement of the TM anchor and the luminally encapsulated C-terminus across the lipid bilayer. To directly measure exposure of the C-terminus upon retrotranslocation we used a Ubc6 variant labeled with an AlexaFluor488 (A488) dye at the C-terminus. An anti-A488 antibody quenches A488 fluorescence and reports on accessibility of the C-terminus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). In the absence of Doa10, we observed a sudden decrease in fluorescence by 50% upon antibody addition, corresponding to the fraction of wrong-side out protein that exposes its C-terminus on the outside of liposomes. Upon solubilization of liposomes, the antibody quenches the fluorescence of all A488 epitopes. However, in the presence of Doa10, the sudden decrease in fluorescence was followed by a slower decrease to about 10% of the original fluorescence signal within 30 min. Thus, in the presence of Doa10, the luminally-encapsulated part of Ubc6 becomes accessible to the antibody over time. Ubc6 and Doa10 need to reside in the same membrane as we observed only minor quenching above background when we used a mutant SNARE that only supports liposome docking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E,F</xref>).</p><p>As an alternative read-out for retrotranslocation, we used a protease protection assay. To identify correctly oriented Ubc6 we used an N-terminal SUMO fusion (SUMO-Ubc6) and Ulp1 protease. To monitor retrotranslocation, we introduced a TEV protease cleavage site between the C-terminus of Ubc6 and the fluorescent dye. This cleavage site resides in the liposome lumen and would only become accessible upon retrotranslocation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Ulp1 incubation resulted in a shift of correctly oriented protein in SDS-PAGE. We then added TEV protease and followed cleavage over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G,H</xref>). Wrong-side out SUMO-Ubc6 was completely accessible to TEV protease and was cleaved independently of the presence of Doa10 within 5 min. Strikingly, only in the presence of Doa10, Ulp1-cleaved, and thus right-side out Ubc6 was also accessible to TEV cleavage over longer incubation times, indicating retrotranslocation. In liposomes lacking Doa10, only a small fraction of Ulp1-cleaved Ubc6 was accessible to TEV protease, corresponding to the not properly reconstituted Ubc6. Together, Get3 capture, antibody accessibility, and protease protection assays show that Doa10 facilitates movement of the Ubc6 TM across the membrane into the aqueous phase. Comparison of the fraction of correctly oriented protein and the released fraction shows that retrotranslocation is very efficient in all three assays. Thus, Doa10 is a retrotranslocase.</p><p>Importantly, we also tested if another unrelated multipass membrane protein leads to Ubc6 retrotranslocation by destabilizing the lipid bilayer. To this end, we purified the TF<sub>o</sub>F<sub>1</sub> ATP synthase from <italic>Bacillus</italic> PS3, which contains 20 TM segments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Guo et al., 2019</xref>). Using the same reconstitution protocol as for Doa10, we co-reconstituted ATP synthase with Ubc6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A,B</xref>) and then tested for retrotranslocation of Ubc6 using the antibody accessibility assay. Under these conditions, only a minor fraction of Ubc6 becomes accessible to the antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3C,D</xref>). We conclude that retrotranslocation of Ubc6 is not due to some non-specific perturbation of the membrane caused by any multipass TM protein.</p><p>The observation that traps such as Get3 or the antibody are sufficient to drive retrotranslocation to completion suggests that Doa10 allows membrane-inserted and retrotranslocated soluble states of Ubc6 to exist in an equilibrium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). In the absence of Get3 or the anti-A488 antibody, the membrane-embedded state of the substrate is energetically favored. Get3 or the anti-A488 antibody shift the equilibrium towards the soluble state by binding to retrotranslocated Ubc6. Thus, traps bind retrotranslocated Ubc6 and prevent reinsertion. In the cell, retrotranslocation requires Cdc48 activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Garza et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Nakatsukasa et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Ye et al., 2001</xref>), suggesting that the pulling force generated by Cdc48 provides the directionality.</p><p>To test this directly, we next investigated membrane extraction of Ubc6 by Cdc48. As Cdc48 acts on polyubiquitin chains, we first reconstituted Ubc6 polyubiquitination. Degradation of Ubc6 requires its own E2 activity, the E2 Ubc7 and its adapter, the membrane-anchored Cue1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Biederer et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Swanson et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Walter et al., 2001</xref>). Using the fusion system, we co-reconstituted Doa10 and Cue1 with Ubc6. When we added ubiquitin activating enzyme (E1), ubiquitin, ATP, and Ubc7, we observed robust polyubiquitination of Ubc6 (complete reaction, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). In the absence of Ubc7 or Cue1, polyubiquitination was abolished, and we observed ubiquitin adducts of lower molecular weight (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>). These represent multiple monoubiquitinations, as the ubiquitination pattern was very similar when we used a ubiquitin mutant in which all lysines are mutated to arginine (Ubiquitin K0) and that thus cannot form ubiquitin chains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Monoubiquitination also occurred in the absence of Doa10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>), but was enhanced in its presence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C,D</xref>). Kinetics of transfer of the first ubiquitin onto Ubc6 were independent of the presence of Ubc7/Cue1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), suggesting that monoubiquitination is a prerequisite for Ubc7-dependent polyubiquitination. This is indeed the case, as a catalytically inactive Ubc6 mutant (Ubc6<sub>C87A</sub>) was not ubiquitinated, but an N-terminal fusion of ubiquitin with inactive Ubc6 (Ub-Ubc6<sub>C87A</sub>) was a substrate for Ubc7-dependent polyubiquitination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D,E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Together, these results establish that after active site loading of Ubc6 with ubiquitin, Doa10 catalyzes Ubc6-monoubiquitination, followed by Ubc7/Cue1-dependent polyubiquitination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). These results agree with observations made in intact cells and with recombinant soluble fragments of Doa10 and Ubc6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Walter et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Weber et al., 2016</xref>).

No extraction above this background was observed when either Cdc48 or Ufd1/Npl4 were omitted. Furthermore, ATP hydrolysis by the Cdc48 complex was necessary, as Cdc48<sub>E588A</sub> was inactive.

Ubc6 polyubiquitination by Doa10-N was less efficient compared to full-length Doa10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E,F</xref>). This was not due to impaired E3 activity, because co-reconstitution of Doa10-N and Doa10-C together restored ubiquitination to WT levels. Monoubiquitination in the absence of Ubc7 was similarly affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2,A</xref> to C). We conclude that the Doa10 region that includes TMs 3–14 plays a role in ubiquitination of Ubc6. Both ubiquitination and retrotranslocation of Ubc6 are sensitive to changes in the membrane-embedded regions of Ubc6 and Doa10, indicating a specific interaction of Doa10 with the TM domain of Ubc6. Previous observations suggested that the identity of the TM segment played a role in substrate degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Habeck et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Ruggiano et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Walter et al., 2001</xref>). Our results show that the TM domain of Doa10 recognizes substrates and thereby contributes to the specificity of substrate selection. The observation that the mutant version of Ubc6 (Ubc6<sub>SybTM</sub>) is still ubiquitinated to some extent suggests that other factors might contribute to substrate discrimination. Deubiquitinating enzymes have previously been shown to sharpen substrate selectivity in ERAD and might also play such a role in the context of Doa10-mediated ERAD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Substrates of Doa10 exhibit a wide range of topologies. They may contain multiple TM segments, such as the misfolded variants of the multi-spanning membrane proteins Pma1 and Ste6, called Pma* and Ste6*, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Huyer et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Wang and Chang, 2003</xref>), or luminal folded domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Vashist and Ng, 2004</xref>). We next asked the question how the presence of an additional luminal polypeptide segment or an interaction with another luminal protein affects retrotranslocation. We appended a streptavidin binding peptide (SBP) to the C-terminus of Ubc6 (Ubc6-SBP), and formed a complex with streptavidin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). When we co-reconstituted this complex with Doa10, we observed no quenching over time upon antibody addition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,B</xref>). When we added biotin, which breaks the high affinity SBP-streptavidin interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Keefe et al., 2001</xref>), we observed Doa10-dependent quenching over time. This was only the case when biotin was used, but much reduced when we used a biotinylated protein, which is still capable of dissociating streptavidin from Ubc6-SBP on the outside of liposomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1, C</xref> to E), but cannot pass the membrane. Together, this shows that a protein-protein interaction on the luminal side of the membrane, mimicking the presence of a folded domain, acts as an anchor and prevents retrotranslocation of Ubc6.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Effect of a Luminal Domain on Retrotranslocation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Retrotranslocation of Ubc6 with a C-terminal streptavidin binding peptide (SBP), reconstituted in complex with streptavidin, was measured by accessibility of a fluorescence quenching antibody to a C-terminal A488 dye on Ubc6, as described <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>. Liposomes were incubated with buffer, biotin or a biotinylated protein prior to addition of the antibody.

Liposomes containing Doa10 and Ubc6-SBP in complex with streptavidin were incubated with ubiquitination mix followed by the addition of Cdc48 complex and anti-A488 antibody. Retrotranslocation occurred depending on polyubiquitination and Cdc48 activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C,D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1F</xref>). In the absence of ubiquitin, when Ubc7 was omitted, or when we used the catalytically inactive Cdc48<sub>E588A</sub>, no fluorescence quenching above background was observed. Importantly, streptavidin remained encapsulated in liposomes in reactions where Ubc6-SBP was extracted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E,F</xref>). Thus, Cdc48 action on the cytosolic side of the membrane leads to dissociation of streptavidin from the SBP-tag in the liposome lumen. As this reaction entails the breaking of bonds that are comparable to the intramolecular interactions that keep a protein folded, we interpret the dissociation of the SBP tag from streptavidin as unfolding. Our results thus show that Doa10 retrotranslocates a luminal protein segment in an unfolded state. Cdc48, acting on cytoplasmic polyubiquitin chains, generates a mechanical force that results in luminal unfolding und drives retrotranslocation. The integrity of the membrane is maintained in this process.</p></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>During extraction of a protein from the membrane, an energetic barrier must be overcome that depends on the hydrophobicity of its TM domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Botelho et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Guerriero et al., 2017</xref>). Our results provide evidence that Doa10 contributes to overcoming the energetic barrier for membrane protein extraction. This is demonstrated by passive movement of a tail-anchored membrane protein into the aqueous phase in the presence of Doa10. In the absence of a folded luminal domain, factors such as Get3 or an antibody that trap the retrotranslocated state are sufficient to drive the reaction, bypassing the requirement for ubiquitination and Cdc48.</p><p>ERAD also entails retrotranslocation of less hydrophobic sequences, such as those in luminal loops or domains, across the hydrophobic core of the membrane. We show that, once dissociated from streptavidin, a 57 amino acid long luminal protein segment that includes the SBP-tag is retrotranslocated by Doa10 without markedly affecting retrotranslocation kinetics. Thus, Doa10 can also accommodate these less hydrophobic sequences in the retrotranslocation process.</p><p>A major unresolved question concerns the fate of luminal domains during retrotranslocation. Some studies suggested that luminal domains cross the ER membrane in a folded state, based either on the observation that substrates containing tightly folded domains were retrotranslocated in the first place or that they were detected in a folded state after retrotranslocation into the cytosol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fiebiger et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Petris et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Shi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Tirosh et al., 2003</xref>). Others suggested that retrotranslocation requires unfolding of luminal protein segments, including reduction of disulfide bonds, prior to retrotranslocation (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ellgaard et al., 2018</xref>). Some of these differences might be explained by the fact that different ubiquitin ligase complexes were involved that might have different requirements for retrotranslocation. Our data show that Doa10 does not accommodate a folded domain during retrotranslocation. Instead, unfolding of polypeptide segments on the luminal side of the membrane is a direct consequence of Cdc48 acting on cytoplasmically attached polyubiquitin chains.</p><p>It is unclear if chaperone-driven retrotranslocation of Ubc6 in the absence of ubiquitination or Cdc48 action also occurs in the cell. Genetic and biochemical experiments in yeast showed that degradation of TM domain containing Doa10 substrates, including Ubc6, strictly depends on Cdc48, Ufd1 and Npl4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Foresti et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Habeck et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Huyer et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Neuber et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Ravid et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Ruggiano et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Wang and Chang, 2003</xref>). In the case of the strongly hydrophobic, multi-spanning Doa10 substrate Ste6*, fractionation experiments also showed that the Cdc48 complex is required for the retrotranslocation step (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Nakatsukasa et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Nakatsukasa and Kamura, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Neal et al., 2018</xref>). However, these experiments do not exclude the possibility that a relatively mildly hydrophobic protein such as Ubc6 retrotranslocates into the cytosol in a Doa10-dependent, but ubiquitination- and Cdc48-independent manner. Speculatively, such a chaperone-stabilized cytoplasmic pool would not be a substrate for proteasomal degradation but rather for chaperone-assisted reinsertion into the ER membrane, and might therefore be difficult to detect. Furthermore, as chaperones would only be able to capture a substrate that has emerged from the membrane, we expect such chaperone-driven retrotranslocation to be sensitive to the overall hydrophobicity of the TM segment. Interestingly, several studies showed that chaperones play an important role in ERAD of membrane proteins at different stages of the ERAD process. In yeast, Hsp70 and Hsp40 chaperones promote ubiquitination of Ste6* and a misfolded variant of Pma1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Han et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Nakatsukasa et al., 2008</xref>). In mammals, the Bag6-Ubl4a-Trc35 chaperone complex facilitates ERAD of membrane proteins by stabilizing a soluble cytoplasmic state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Claessen and Ploegh, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Claessen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ernst et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Wang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Xu et al., 2012</xref>). If such chaperones also act as a sink in a putative Cdc48-independent retrotranslocation process, remains to be determined.</p><p>Using a reconstituted system, we disentangled different ERAD subreactions, that is substrate recruitment, ubiquitination, retrotranslocation, and membrane extraction. This allowed us to identify two activities of Doa10: retrotranslocase and ubiquitin ligase. The interplay of Doa10 and the Cdc48 complex during the extraction process remains to be further explored. Studies showed that Cdc48 is recruited to the Doa10-complex via Ubx2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Neuber et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Schuberth and Buchberger, 2005</xref>). This recruitment is dependent on the ubiquitination activity of Doa10, suggesting that Cdc48-recruitment requires either autoubiquitination of Doa10 or substrate ubiquitination. Moreover, the Derlin Dfm1, which also interacts with Cdc48 through its carboxy-terminal SHP-box, has been shown to be required for degradation of Ste6* (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Neal et al., 2018</xref>). Our experimental system is expandable and can be used to explore how Dfm1, Ubx2 or other factors affect retrotranslocation by Doa10 and Cdc48.</p><p>How exactly Doa10 facilitates release of proteins from the membrane is unclear. Structural information on Doa10 is necessary to further elucidate its mechanism of action. We speculate that TM segments access a binding site in Doa10 through a lateral gate. This might promote delipidation of TM segments and breaking of helix-helix interactions in multi-spanning membrane proteins. Quality control pathways for membrane proteins that require their extraction from the membrane exist not only in the ER, but also in other organelles. In the Golgi, mitochondria and chloroplasts, membrane proteins are removed from the organelle for proteasomal degradation in the cytosol. These processes are dependent on ubiquitination and Cdc48 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Heo et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ling et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Schmidt et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Tanaka et al., 2010</xref>). Moreover, extraction of membrane proteins also occurs by membrane-bound AAA ATPases that often have not only unfolding, but also proteolytic activity. In mitochondria, Msp1 and the FtsH-related AAA metalloproteases m-AAA and i-AAA are examples for membrane-bound AAA ATPases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Glynn, 2017</xref>). For m-AAA mediated extraction into the mitochondrial matrix, a contribution of the TM domain was shown, suggesting a retrotranslocase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Korbel et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lee et al., 2017</xref>). We propose that membrane-bound retrotranslocases generally contribute to AAA protein-driven extraction of membrane proteins.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and

When different Ubc6-variants were compared (Ubc6 vs Ubc6<sub>SybTM</sub>), the line scan values were normalized to the integral of the whole scan (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), to account for different sortase labeling efficiencies. To quantify the kinetics for generation of mono-, di-, tri- and tetraubiquitinated species, each band corresponding to one, two, three and four ubiquitins was quantified for every time point and normalized to the non-ubiquitinated band at the 0 min timepoint (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D</xref>). To calculate the total number of ubiquitins transferred relative to total Ubc6, the values for species modified with 1 to 4 ubiquitins obtained as above were summed up for each timepoint (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2C</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Measuring extraction by the Cdc48-complex</title><p>Proteoliposomes were prepared with protein-free liposomes containing 2 mol% biotinyl-PE and 0.5 mol% Rhd-PE. Fusion and ubiquitination was carried out as described above. To immobilize liposomes after ubiquitination, the ubiquitination reaction was diluted 1:2 to a final lipid concentration of 0.2 mM total lipid (f.c. of 0.05 µM Ubc6) and BSA was added to a f.c. of 0.25 mg/ml. The diluted mix was then added to an equal volume of Pierce Streptavidin Magnetic Beads (Thermo Scientific, prewashed with buffer B). After incubation for 1 hr at RT (rotating), the unbound fraction was removed and the beads were subsequently washed 3 x with buffer B. The beads were then resuspended in the same volume of buffer B and 30 µL of the suspension aliquoted in a PCR-strip. The buffer was removed and the beads resuspended in 1 x extraction mixes or 1 x SDS sample buffer. 1 x extraction mixes contained 0.25 mg/mL BSA and where indicated 0.1 µM Cdc48 (hexamer) and 0.1 µM Ufd1/Npl4. Beads were incubated for 30 min at 30°C. The supernatant was removed (containing extracted and soluble proteins). After washing the beads 3 x with buffer B, the bound proteins were eluted by adding 30 µL of 1x SDS sample buffer. Samples of the supernatant and the elution fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. To quantify the liposome immobilization efficiency, the Rhodamine fluorescence was measured in a Tecan Genios Pro microplate reader using 550/10 nm and 590/20 nm for excitation and emission, respectively. To quantify the protein immobilization efficiency, the DyLight680 (Ubc6/Ub-Ubc6<sub>C87A</sub>) fluorescence was measured using the Odyssey scanner (384-well plate, transparent bottom).</p><sec id="s4-8-1"><title>Analysis of extraction reactions</title><p>To quantify the extraction efficiency of Ub-Ubc6<sub>C87A</sub> relative to its ubiquitination status (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1G</xref>), bands corresponding to Ub-Ubc6<sub>C87A</sub> modified with 1 to 10 ubiquitins were quantified separately and normalized to the corresponding band of the input sample (beads treated with sample buffer).</p><p>To quantify the fraction of Ubc6 in the supernatant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C,D</xref>), the fluorescence intensity for Ubc6 modified with 0–5 ubiquitins and for Ubc6 modified with more than five ubiquitins was quantified by drawing a single rectangular box around the respective area using Image Studio and subsequently normalized to the Input (beads treated with 1 x SDS sample buffer). For Ub-Ubc6<sub>C87A</sub>, the unmodified band was counted as monoubiquitinated.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Experiments with Ubc6-SBP</title><p>To reconstitute Ubc6-SBP into proteoliposomes, Ubc6-SBP was preincubated with a 1.25-fold molar excess of tetrameric streptavidin (NEB) for 15 min at RT in the presence of 0.03% DDM to allow for complex formation. The reconstitution conditions were otherwise the same as for the co-reconstitution of Ubc6 and t-SNARE (with 2 µM Ubc6-SBP and 2.5 µM Streptavidin).</p><p>To assess the orientation of Ubc6-SBP in liposomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>), a TEV protease protection assay was carried out as described above, except that liposomes were diluted 1:5.</p><p>A biotinylated nanobody was used for the biotinylated protein control. To test if the biotinylated nanobody (anti-GFP, construct for expression kindly provided by Dirk Görlich; purified and biotinylated essentially as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Pleiner et al., 2018</xref> is completely biotinylated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>), biotinylated nanobody was supplemented with 0.25 mg/mL BSA and incubated with magnetic streptavidin beads that were prewashed with buffer B or prewashed with buffer B supplemented with 10 mM biotin. After binding for 45 min at RT, samples of input and supernatant fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and stain-free scanning using a GelDoc EZ Imager.</p><p>For the antibody accessibility assay, the fusion reaction was first incubated with 1.5 µM biotin or biotinylated protein for 10 min at RT, before the fluorescence measurements were started as described above. A 6-fold molar excess of biotin/biotinylated protein over streptavidin was used. Fluorescence traces were processed and analyzed as described above.</p><p>To check if biotinylated protein is capable of releasing Streptavidin from Ubc6-SBP, a flotation assay was used. Liposomes containing Ubc6-SBP and t-SNARE were incubated with Streptavidin for 5 min at RT (f.c. 0.9 µM Streptavidin, 1.4 µM Ubc6-SBP). A 10-fold excess of biotin or biotinylated nanobody was then added and after incubation for another 5 min, a sucrose density gradient (40% (w/v), 30% (w/v), 15% (w/v) and buffer T layer) was assembled. Flotation was carried out as described above. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and stain-free scanning using a GelDoc EZ Imager. Streptavidin and Ubc6-SBP levels were quantified using ImageJ. Intensity values for Streptavidin were normalized to Ubc6-SBP levels and subsequently to the buffer control.</p><p>To measure extraction of Ubc6-SBP by the Cdc48-complex using the antibody accessibility assay, fusion and ubiquitination reactions were carried out as described above, except that liposomes were diluted 1:5 instead of 1:10 for the fusion reaction. After 30 min of ubiquitination (total volume of 30 µl with f.c. 0.2 µM Ubc6-SBP, 0.08 µM Doa10, 0.02 µM Cue1, 0.1 µM Uba1, 1 µM Ubc7, 120 µM ubiquitin and 2.5 mM ATP), additional 2.5 mM ATP were added and the fluorescence measurement was started (plate reader preheated to 30°C). After 10 min, anti-A488 antibody (1:15 diluted) and 3 µL of 10 x Cdc48/UN mix were added. 10 x Cdc48/UN mix contained 2 µM Cdc48 (hexamer), 2 µM Ufd1/Npl4 as well as 1 mM ATP. To quantify the fraction of extracted Ubc6-SBP, fluorescence traces were processed as described above and the difference between the normalized values of samples with and without Cdc48/UN 30 min after antibody addition was calculated.</p><p>To test, if streptavidin stays in the liposome lumen during extraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E,F</xref>), samples were floated after the extraction assay in a Nycodenz step gradient as described above. The samples were prepared with the following modifications: To ensure sufficient detection levels, the liposomes were diluted 1:4 for the fusion reaction. The ubiquitination reaction (f.c. 0.3 µM Ubc6, 0.12 µM Doa10, 0.03 µM Cue1, 0.1 µM Uba1, 1 µM Ubc7, 120 µM ubiquitin and 2.5 mM ATP) was carried out as described above. After 30 min of ubiquitination, the extraction assay was performed in the plate reader as described above, in the presence of 0.3 µM Cdc48/UN complex (f.c. Ubc6 = 0.25 µM). After 30 min, 2 mM biotin was added to 50 µL sample, a Nycodenz step gradient was assembled and the flotation carried out as described above. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and stain-free scanning using a GelDoc EZ Imager. Streptavidin levels were quantified using ImageJ.

To detect streptavidin, samples were run on CRITERION TGX stain-free precast gels (Bio-Rad) and scanned with a GelDoc EZ Imager (Bio-Rad). Colloidal Coomassie staining was used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dyballa and Metzger, 2009</xref>). SBP-tagged proteins were analyzed by western blotting where indicated. After transfer on a nitrocellulose membrane using the Trans-Blot Turbo Transfer System (Bio-Rad), the membrane was blocked with 5% skim milk powder (dissolved in TBS-T) for 1 hr at RT. A 1:2500 dilution of anti-SBP antibody (clone 20, mouse monoclonal, MAB10764, Millipore), and a 1:15,000 dilution of secondary antibody (goat anti-mouse, IRDye 800 CW or IRDye 680RD) were used for detection. For the analysis of His-tagged ATP synthase, the nitrocellulose membrane was blocked with 2% (w/v) BSA (dissolved in PBS containing 0.1% (v/v) Tween and 0.1% (v/v) Triton-X-100). A 1:500 dilution of anti-His<sub>6</sub> tag antibody (Dia-900, Clone13/45/31‐2, mouse monoclonal, Dianova), and a 1:15,000 dilution of secondary antibody (goat anti-mouse, IRDye 800 CW) were used for detection. Antibodies were diluted in the respective blocking buffer. Gels were quantified using ImageStudio Lite (Li-Cor). Fiji (ImageJ) was used for quantification of ubiquitin chain profiles (plot profile function) as well as streptavidin (gel analyzer function) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Blanche Schwappach (UM Göttingen, Germany) for providing Get3 constructs, Iris Bickmeyer and Nupur Nupur for technical assistance, and Marina Rodnina, Alex Faesen, Tom Rapoport and Blanche Schwappach for comments on the manuscript.

During this process, misfolded ER lumenal or membrane proteins are retrotranslocated into the cytosol where they are degraded by the proteasome. Previously studies have highlighted the importance of two highly conserved ER-membrane associated ubiquitin ligases, Hrd1 and Doa10 in ERAD in budding yeast. A large body of work suggests that Hrd1 acts as a protein translocase that facilitates the movement of misfolded lumenal and membrane ER proteins into the cytosol for degradation. Comparatively little mechanistic information is available about how Doa10 functions in ERAD. The manuscript by Schmidt et al. makes a major contribution toward this goal by reconstituting Doa10-mediated dislocation of a membrane protein in vitro using purified components. The study provide strong evidence that Doa10 can facilitate passive dislocation of a single transmembrane segment (from the substrate Ubc6) to the cytosol when there is a “trap” to capture it. In the absence of such a trap, the authors show that polyubiquitin on the substrate is used by the cytosolic Cdc48 complex to dislocate the substrate in an ATP-dependent reaction. Finally, the authors provide evidence that the Cdc48-mediated reaction is sufficient to unfold lumenal domains to facilitate their translocation to the cytosol. The study was elegantly designed and the data presented are convincing. The findings represent an important step forward in the field and provide a solid foundation for many future mechanistic studies.</p><p>Revisions:</p><p>The reviewers generally agreed that the study is convincing with the need of only some clarifications, additional explanations, some possible caveats, and some additional discussion. The key major points to be discussed or clarified are as follows:</p><p>1) Two of the reviewers wondered whether a control multi-pass membrane protein (other than Doa10) would similarly allow passive dislocation of Ubc6, perhaps due to some non-specific perturbation of the membrane or artifact of the reconstitution. At issue is whether the release of Ubc6 is highly specific to Doa10. Discussion among the reviewers concluded that non-specific dislocation by any protein seems pretty unlikely, but in the absence of an experiment comparing the dislocation reaction in liposomes containing Doa10 versus another similarly sized multi-pass membrane protein, this possibility should be acknowledged in the text.</p><p>2) The relationship between the passive Doa10-mediated dislocation described here and the role of Cdc48 and ubiquitination should be discussed more thoroughly. Genetic experiments indicate that ubiquitination and Cdc48 are strictly required for dislocation, but the authors nicely show that one can get dislocation without these steps. The authors should therefore place their observations into the context of these earlier studies and explain their thoughts about whether in certain contexts, a membrane protein like Ubc6 can be dislocated without the need for ubiquitination or Cdc48.</p><p>3) The proportion of ubiquitinated protein that is released is relatively small compared to passive release (which is almost complete). This is presumably because there is no Get3 in that experiment. This should be made explicit in the text or legend.</p><p>4) The authors should consider re-wording the statements about unfolding because the experiment didn't really measure this, instead using the dissociation of SBP from streptavidin as a surrogate. This surrogate is quite convincing because the bonds that need to be broken to dissociate Streptavidin and SBP are comparable to the types of intramolecular interactions that keep a protein folded. Thus, if a force from the cytosol can break the SBP interaction, it is easy to imagine unfolding working the same way. This chain of logic should be more explicit.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.56945.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Revisions:</p><p>The reviewers generally agreed that the study is convincing with the need of only some clarifications, additional explanations, some possible caveats, and some additional discussion.

We have therefore performed experiments with ATP synthase as a control protein. This protein contains 20 TM segments and thus has a comparable TM domain as Doa10 (Guo et al., 2019). Using the antibody accessibility assay, we show that presence of ATP synthase does not lead to retrotranslocation of Ubc6 (Figure 1—figure supplement 3). This figure also shows the characterization of ATP synthase liposomes. Of note, the same detergents and reconstitution protocol were used to reconstitute ATP synthase as for Doa10. Thus, we conclude that retrotranslocation of Ubc6 is not due to some non-specific perturbation of the membrane caused by any multipass TM protein (Results paragraph six).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The relationship between the passive Doa10-mediated dislocation described here and the role of Cdc48 and ubiquitination should be discussed more thoroughly.

In the case of the multi-spanning Doa10 substrate Ste6, it was also shown in fractionation experiments that retrotranslocation requires ubiquitination and Cdc48 action (Nakatsukasa et al., 2008; Nakatsukasa and Kamura, 2016). However, our experiments indeed raise the possibility that a mildly hydrophobic substrate such as Ubc6 is retrotranslocated in a Doa10-dependent, but ubiquitination- and Cdc48-independent manner in the cell. Such a cytosolic pool of Ubc6 would probably have a non-degradative fate and be subject to re-insertion. Experimentally, it would be indistinguishable from a Ubc6 pool that has not been inserted into the ER yet (the use of an N-glycosylation tag which leaves a scar after deglycosylation in the cytosol might be an experimental solution to this problem). Further studies are required to test if such a process actually occurs in appreciable amounts.</p><p>We now discuss this point in paragraph four of the Discussion. In this section we also discuss the role of chaperones in the degradation of membrane proteins and the influence of hydrophobicity on passive retrotranslocation, as suggested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The proportion of ubiquitinated protein that is released is relatively small compared to passive release (which is almost complete).

Chaperones or accessory factors such as Ubx2 might increase the efficiency of extraction. We have acknowledged this inefficiency in the text (Results paragraph eight).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors should consider re-wording the statements about unfolding because the experiment didn't really measure this, instead using the dissociation of SBP from streptavidin as a surrogate.
