pharmacotherapy, leading to debilitating neuropathic pain. No effective treatment for CIPN exists, short of dose-reduction which worsens cancer prognosis. Here, we report that stimulation of nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) produced robust neuroprotection in an aggressive CIPN model utilizing the frontline anticancer drug, paclitaxel (PTX). Daily treatment of rats with the first-in-class NAMPT stimulator, P7C3-A20, prevented behavioral and histologic indicators of peripheral neuropathy, stimulated tissue NAD recovery, improved general health, and abolished attrition produced by a near maximum-tolerated dose of PTX. Inhibition of NAMPT blocked P7C3-A20-mediated neuroprotection, whereas supplementation with the NAMPT substrate, nicotinamide, potentiated a subthreshold dose of P7C3-A20 to full efficacy. Importantly, P7C3-A20 blocked PTX-induced allodynia in tumored mice without reducing antitumoral efficacy. These findings identify enhancement of NAMPT activity as a promising new therapeutic strategy to protect against anticancer drug-induced peripheral neurotoxicity.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>neuropathy</kwd><kwd>chemotherapy</kwd><kwd>pain</kwd><kwd>neurotoxicity</kwd><kwd>neuroprotection</kwd><kwd>NAMPT</kwd><kwd>NAD</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006108</institution-id><institution>National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CTRC Pilot Grant P30 CA054174</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Berg</surname><given-names>Kelly A</given-names></name><name><surname>Clarke</surname><given-names>William P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006108</institution-id><institution>National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CTSA Pilot Grant 8UL1TR000149</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Berg</surname><given-names>Kelly A</given-names></name><name><surname>Clarke</surname><given-names>William P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Calico Life Sciences LLC</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Research Grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Berg</surname><given-names>Kelly A</given-names></name><name><surname>Clarke</surname><given-names>William P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008635</institution-id><institution>University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Translational Science Training Program Graduate Student Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>LoCoco</surname><given-names>Peter M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Stimulation of the rate-limiting enzyme in the NAD salvage pathway protected against neurotoxicity and subsequent peripheral neuropathy associated with the widely utilized anticancer drug, paclitaxel.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The microtubule stabilizer, paclitaxel (PTX), is widely used for the treatment of breast, ovarian, lung, and pancreatic cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Rivera and Cianfrocca, 2015</xref>). Despite its clinical effectiveness, however, PTX often produces debilitating, dose-limiting peripheral neuropathy. Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is the most common nonhematologic side effect of anticancer pharmacotherapy that affects up to 90% of cancer patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Grisold et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Miltenburg and Boogerd, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Windebank and Grisold, 2008</xref>). The damage to peripheral sensory neurons resulting from anticancer treatment causes patients to experience stimulus-specific allodynia (i.e. pain in response to innocuous stimuli), tingling pain, numbness, and/or loss of sensory function, that are symmetrically-distributed largely in their hands and feet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Speck et al., 2013</xref>). The pain associated with this neuropathy intensifies with each cycle of chemotherapy and persists beyond the cancer treatment period, often indefinitely, subjugating patients to a substandard quality of life both during and after treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Cavaletti and Marmiroli, 2010</xref>). As there are no effective treatments or preventions for CIPN, potentially life-saving cancer treatment must often be dose-reduced or discontinued, adversely affecting cancer prognosis and survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Rivera and Cianfrocca, 2015</xref>). Consequently, there is an urgent need for approaches to prevent CIPN and thereby improve both cancer treatment and the quality of life of cancer patients.</p><p>Previously, an in vivo phenotypic screen searching for proneurogenic compounds revealed that the aminopropyl carbazole, P7C3, increased the number of newborn neurons in the mouse hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Pieper et al., 2010</xref>). Subsequent experiments demonstrated that rather than increasing neurogenesis, P7C3 reduced apoptosis in differentiating neuronal progenitors, suggesting a neuroprotective effect that promoted survival of the newborn neurons. P7C3-A20, a structural analogue of P7C3, displayed strong neuroprotective efficacy in several models of neurodegeneration, including Parkinson’s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, traumatic brain injury, optic nerve injury, ischemic stroke, and sciatic nerve crush (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">De Jesús-Cortés et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kemp et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Loris et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Oku et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Tesla et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Wang et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Yin et al., 2014</xref>). Recent work identified P7C3-A20 as a first-in-class stimulator of nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT), the rate-limiting enzyme in the nicotinamide adenine nucleotide (NAD) salvage pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). Here, using an aggressive rodent model of CIPN, we report that P7C3-A20 protected peripheral sensory neurons from neurotoxicity induced by PTX and that this protection required NAMPT activity. Importantly, P7C3-A20 did not interfere with the antitumor activity of PTX nor promote tumor growth. These results suggest that enhancement of NAMPT activity with P7C3-A20 may be a promising new therapeutic strategy to protect peripheral afferent sensory neurons against anticancer drug-induced peripheral neurotoxicity.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Aggressive PTX treatment produces peripheral neuropathy and damages peripheral afferent neurons</title><p>To induce peripheral neuropathy, rats were treated with a near maximum-tolerated dose of PTX.

High-dose PTX treatment (cumulative dose of 35 mg/kg, i.p.) produced transient but substantial average weight loss of 16% and average leukocyte depletion of 60%. Indices of general health were poor and attrition due to PTX toxicity (death or weight loss &gt;20%) was 25%. As is typical of CIPN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cata et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Dougherty et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Nahman-Averbuch et al., 2011</xref>), PTX treatment also produced marked peripheral neuropathy evidenced by prolonged changes in the sensitivity to mechanical, cold and heat stimuli, by prolonged degeneration of IENFs, and by increased expression of the neuronal injury marker, ATF3, in the DRG. Daily treatment with P7C3-A20 (≥10 mg/kg/day, i.p.), beginning a few days before PTX administration, greatly reduced or eliminated the behavioral and anatomical signs of peripheral neuropathy. The neuroprotective effects were replicated consistently over several independent, blinded behavioral experiments and across two different species. P7C3-A20 also demonstrated superior efficacy in our aggressive model as compared with PARP inhibitor, A-861696, which previously was shown to protect against cisplatin-, oxaliplatin-, and vincristine-induced peripheral neuropathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brederson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Ta et al., 2013</xref>). P7C3-A20 also improved the overall health of the PTX-treated rats and reduced attrition to zero. Importantly, P7C3-A20 treatment did not reduce the antiproliferative or cytotoxic efficacy of PTX in cell culture models nor its antitumoral activity in an aggressive xenograft model in vivo.</p><p>P7C3-A20 is a first-in-class stimulator of NAMPT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Wang et al., 2014</xref>), the rate-limiting enzyme in the salvage pathway for NAD production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Belenky et al., 2007</xref>). Our data suggest that NAMPT is critical for the neuroprotective efficacy of P7C3-A20 against PTX-induced sensory neuron damage and peripheral neuropathic pain. The effects of P7C3-A20 to prevent PTX-induced allodynia and IENF degeneration were completely blocked by FK866, a well-characterized and selective inhibitor of NAMPT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hasmann and Schemainda, 2003</xref>). Supplementation with the NAMPT substrate, NAM, augmented the efficacy of an ineffective dose of P7C3-A20 to that equivalent to a maximal dose. We found that P7C3-A20 increased NAD production, in an FK866-dependent manner, in neuronal cells depleted of NAD by treatment with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. Furthermore, we determined that P7C3-A20 treatment prevented PTX-induced deficits in peripheral neuron NAD levels in vivo, results consistent with recent work showing that P7C3-A20 stimulated NAD levels in brain tissue following ischemia-induced deficit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Loris et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Wang et al., 2016a</xref>). Taken together, these results are consistent with NAMPT as a target for P7C3-A20.</p><p>There is increasing evidence that stimulation or maintenance of NAD biosynthesis is neuroprotective in a variety of experimental models of neurodegeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cantó et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Verdin, 2015</xref>). For example, due to increased cytosolic levels of chimeric nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferase1, a critical enzyme for NAD biosynthesis, Wld<sup>S</sup> mice exhibit marked protection from injury-induced axonal degeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Araki et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Wang et al., 2005</xref>) and are also resistant to PTX-induced peripheral neuropathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Wang et al., 2002</xref>). Additionally, administration of the NAD precursor, nicotinamide riboside (NR), reduces the sensory neuropathy that occurs in diabetic mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Trammell et al., 2016</xref>) and in female rats treated with PTX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hamity et al., 2017</xref>). Moreover, P7C3 compounds have strong neuroprotective efficacy in several models of neurodegeneration, including Parkinson’s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, traumatic brain injury, optic nerve injury, ischemic stroke, and sciatic nerve crush (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">De Jesús-Cortés et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kemp et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Loris et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Oku et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Tesla et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Wang et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Yin et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Neurons are energetically demanding cells that rely heavily on oxidative metabolism to meet bioenergetic demand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Berndt and Holzhütter, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Van Laar and Berman, 2013</xref>). IENFs in particular have high-energy requirements as they must undergo continuous remodeling to accommodate the constantly changing epidermis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Palay, 1956</xref>) and are especially sensitive to reductions in bioenergy production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bennett et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bennett et al., 2011</xref>). PTX, among many other chemotherapeutic agents, causes substantial mitotoxicity, including deficits in complex I- and II-mediated respiration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Zheng et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Zheng et al., 2012</xref>) and diminished capacity to synthesize ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Duggett et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Janes et al., 2013</xref>). These effects exhaust energy stores that are necessary to sustain neuronal repair mechanisms and maintain viability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Janes et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Zhou et al., 2016</xref>) and coincide with spontaneous discharge of nociceptive and non-nociceptive afferent fibers and progressive degeneration of IENFs that collectively contribute to peripheral neuropathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bennett et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kleggetveit et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Xiao and Bennett, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Xiao et al., 2011</xref>). In our experiments, we observed persistent IENF degeneration in glabrous hindpaw skin biopsies in response to PTX that was completely reversed by treatment with P7C3-A20. Individual animal IENF density correlated very strongly with their respective behavioral responses. We also determined that P7C3-A20 reversed the reduction in NAD<sup>+</sup> levels in glabrous skin by PTX. These results are particularly intriguing in consideration of the high density of mitochondria within IENFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Palay, 1956</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Ribeiro-da-Silva et al., 1991</xref>). However, we cannot rule out the possibility of an indirect effect of P7C3-A20 on IENFs mediated through other cell types in the skin, especially those known to support neurons (e.g. Schwann cells, keratinocytes). Regardless, NAD drives mitochondrial bioenergy production, and thus its availability is absolutely critical to sustain the energy needs of IENFs.</p><p>It is notable that P7C3-A20 reduced, but did not completely prevent, PTX-induced expression of the neuronal injury marker, ATF3. This suggests that P7C3-A20 may not prevent damage to peripheral sensory neurons by PTX but instead, by augmenting NAMPT activity, may maintain metabolic output of damaged neurons to allow time for repair mechanisms to reverse PTX-induced toxic damage and reduce the peripheral neuropathy. We did not observe any change in NAD levels in lumbar DRG assessed at day 10 (6 days after the final injection of PTX), but this does not rule out that effects may occur at time points closer to PTX administration.</p><p>P7C3-A20 did not alter nociceptive thresholds, general health, or IENF density in rats not treated with PTX and it is noteworthy that we did not observe increases in NAD production by P7C3-A20 in normal neuronal cells. Only when NAD was first depleted by treatment with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> or PTX did P7C3-A20 stimulate NAMPT-mediated NAD production back to baseline levels. Similarly, previous reports suggest that robust increases in NAD production in response to P7C3-A20 occurs when NAD is depleted in damaged neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Loris et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Wang et al., 2016a</xref>). These results suggest that P7C3-A20 may only be effective in energy-deficient cells with NAD depletion. Relatively little is known of the mechanisms by which NAMPT is regulated, however, NAMPT activity appears to be tightly regulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Burgos et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Dölle et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Takahashi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Yoon et al., 2015</xref>) and is known to be subject to negative feedback regulation by NAD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Burgos and Schramm, 2008</xref>). Efficacy of P7C3-A20 to stimulate NAD production only in NAD-depleted cells suggests that P7C3-A20 acts as an allosteric regulator to augment NAMPT activity such that NAMPT retains negative feedback sensitivity which would avoid accumulation of excessive NAD levels. The ability of P7C3-A20 to stimulate NAD production when levels are low, while limiting overproduction, would likely limit adverse effects associated with excess NAD such as flushing, itching, erythema, nausea, and hepatotoxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Knip et al., 2000</xref>). Although drugs such as NR, which bypass the regulatory control provided by the rate-limiting function of NAMPT in the NAD salvage pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bieganowski and Brenner, 2004</xref>), may provide similar benefit for treatment of various neurodegenerative conditions, these drugs would be expected to cause overproduction of NAD in most cells, not just those that are energy-compromised.</p><p>Although a plethora of agents have been tested clinically, there still is no effective treatment or prevention of CIPN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hershman et al., 2014</xref>). One possible reason for the failed translation of therapeutics for CIPN is the selection of anticancer drug dose selected for use in the preclinical animal models. Many preclinical models of PTX-induced peripheral neuropathy utilize a low cumulative dose, ranging from 4 to 8 mg/kg (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Authier et al., 2009</xref>), which converts roughly to 28–56 mg/m<sup>2</sup> equivalent human dose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Nair and Jacob, 2016</xref>). These low doses do not produce leukopenia, and thus do not adequately recapitulate clinical symptomatology associated with CIPN. Clinical doses of PTX that exceed 200 mg/m<sup>2</sup> (28.6 mg/kg rat equivalent dose) per single infusion or 1400 mg/m<sup>2</sup> (200 mg/kg rat equivalent dose) cumulatively cause dose-limiting neuropathic pain that interferes with daily activities and reduces quality of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lee and Swain, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Miltenburg and Boogerd, 2014</xref>). Here, we elected to administer an aggressive, but clinically relevant, cumulative dose of 35 mg/kg PTX to the rats. With this dose, we observed significant weight loss and leukopenia that resulted in an attrition rate of 25%. Rats treated with this PTX regimen exhibited differentially altered nociceptive sensitivities to mechanical, cold, and heat stimulation, which is consistent with observations made in patients receiving PTX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cata et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Dougherty et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Nahman-Averbuch et al., 2011</xref>). The development of mechanical and cold allodynia as well as heat hypoalgesia occurred concomitantly with significant IENF degeneration observed in hindpaw biopsies. Clinically, IENF loss corresponds with these same sensory deficits in patients with CIPN as well as in patients with other types of peripheral neuropathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Oaklander, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Petersen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Tai et al., 2004</xref>). Peripheral nerve damage also was apparent in lumbar DRG perikarya as evidenced by up-regulation of ATF3, consistent with earlier studies using higher-dose PTX models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Liu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Peters et al., 2007a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Verheyen et al., 2012</xref>). Collectively, the high cumulative dose of PTX that we utilized clearly produced a severe peripheral neuropathy-like phenotype in the rats that is consistent with the clinical presentation of CIPN. In consideration of the similarities to patient symptoms and histopathology, this work supports the use of higher-dose models for future preclinical evaluation of potential CIPN interventions.</p><p>The PARP inhibitor, A-861696, was ineffective in our model of PTX-induced peripheral neuropathy. In the previous studies where A-861696 displayed some efficacy to reduce peripheral neuropathy, rodents were treated with cumulative doses of vincristine, cisplatin, or oxaliplatin that did not result in significant weight loss or leukopenia and that produced a modest mechanical allodynia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brederson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Ta et al., 2013</xref>). As discussed above, the ineffectiveness of A-861696 here may due to the severity of peripheral neuropathy produced by the aggressive dose of PTX used in our model. However, a recent paper also reported a lack of efficacy using veliparib, the enantiomer of A-861696, in models of optic nerve injury and spinal cord injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Wang et al., 2016b</xref>). This could be a consequence of compartmentalized NAD recovery by A-861696. PARPs predominately localize in the nucleus and rely on activities of NAMPT and NMNAT1 to produce NAD that can be used to generate PAR polymers that coordinate DNA repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Schreiber et al., 2006</xref>). Peripheral sensory neurons can extend over 1 m in length, in which case the distal terminals are far removed from the effects of changes in nuclear PARP inhibition and reduced NAD consumption. NAMPT, however, localizes in the cytosol and potentially in mitochondria as well as in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Belenky et al., 2007</xref>). Thus, the efficacy observed by stimulation of NAMPT with P7C3-A20 may be such that it can elevate NAD concentrations neuron-wide, including in the distal terminals of peripheral sensory neurons where energy repletion may improve IENF vitality.</p><p>An unexpected observation was the clear improvement in the general health of the animals receiving P7C3-A20 with PTX. The indices used to qualitatively assess the animals’ well-being included markers of deficits in sensory and motor function, pain-depressed behaviors, autonomic deficits, and gastrointestinal function. Although not explicitly tested here, it is possible that increased NAD could contribute to the health improvements produced by P7C3-A20. NAMPT-mediated NAD recovery maintains NAD-dependent enzymes that regulate, for example, cellular metabolism or the adaptive responses to oxidative stress that preserve cell vitality and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Garten et al., 2015</xref>). Additionally, increased NAD levels have been shown to facilitate improvements in several tissue types, such as an enhanced oxidative capacity in skeletal muscle of obese mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cantó et al., 2012</xref>), elevated insulin sensitivity in livers of diabetic mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Yoshino et al., 2011</xref>), and improve mineral density in bones of aged mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mills et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, many of the observed improvements from PTX-induced toxicity could be a direct result of enhanced NAMPT activity.</p><p>Increases in cellular NAD levels, produced by overexpression of NAMPT or exogenous application of NAD metabolites, have been associated with enhanced cancer growth and greater resistance to anticancer agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cairns et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Chiarugi et al., 2012</xref>) and inhibition of NAMPT is currently under evaluation as an adjuvant in chemotherapy regimens. If NAMPT is to be a viable target for drugs to prevent CIPN, it is critical to determine whether stimulation of NAMPT with P7C3-A20 enhances tumor growth or whether it interferes with the anticancer activity of PTX. Importantly, we found that P7C3-A20 treatment did not alter the antitumor efficacy of PTX treatment in mice with transplanted xenografts of triple-negative breast cancer (MDA-MB-231 tumors). It is noteworthy that in these tumored mice, P7C3-A20 also completely prevented the mechanical allodynia that occurred in response to PTX. We also examined the effect of P7C3-A20 on growth of 5 distinct cancer cells lines. P7C3-A20 did not alter in vitro cancer growth, with the exception of a slight increase in the growth of MDA-MB-231 cells, which were unaffected by P7C3-A20 treatment in vivo. The overall lack of an appreciable effect on cancer cell growth may be related to the ability of P7C3-A20 to replenish cellular NAD to normal levels, but not to overproduce NAD.</p><p>The effectiveness of P7C3-A20 in our aggressive model of PTX-induced peripheral neuropathy highlights NAMPT-mediated NAD salvage as a new therapeutic target for CIPN. This is of high clinical importance, as cancer patients with debilitating peripheral neuropathy induced by PTX or other anticancer agents must endure diminished quality of life due to the lack of an effective treatment for CIPN. This study also contributes to the increasing evidence that maintenance of cellular NAD supply protects against neuronal damage and neurodegeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cantó et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gerdts et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Verdin, 2015</xref>).

Cells were maintained in serum-free DMEM for 24 hr prior to experimentation. A1A1 cells were then treated with vehicle (ddH<sub>2</sub>O) or 200 μM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> for 30 min. Media was aspirated and replaced with DMEM containing vehicle, P7C3-A20 (0.03, 0.3, 3 μM), or NAM (1 mM) for 60 min. FK866 (10 nM) was included with the second treatment where indicated. Following aspiration of media, cells were washed once with PBS, then 50 μl PBS was added to each well. 50 μl of Detection Reagent from the NAD/NADH-Glo Assay kit (Promega, Madison, WI) was added to each well to measure intracellular NAD levels. A1A1 cells were lysed with the Detection Reagent, which includes a NAD cycling enzyme that converts NAD<sup>+</sup> to NADH. In the presence of NADH, a reductase catalyzes the formation of luciferin from a proluciferin substrate. The Ultra-Glo recombinant luciferase generates a light signal from luciferin that is proportional to the amount of NAD in the cells tested. White backing tape (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA) was attached to the bottom of the plate, followed by luminescence detection (representing intracellular NAD levels) in plate mode with the top optic using a Fluostar Omega Microplate Reader (BMG Labtech, Cary, NC). Relative luminescence units detected per well were normalized to vehicle-treated control wells. For each experiment, treatment conditions were run in quadruplicate. Data represent mean NAD/NADH levels ± SEM expressed as percentage of vehicle of 4–5 experimental replicates.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Tissue NAD<sup>+</sup>determination</title><p>Hindpaw skin biopsies (3.5 mm punch), sciatic nerve (both sides), and L4-L6 DRG (both sides) were dissected as quickly as possible following decapitation and frozen on dry ice. Approximate times to dissect and freeze paw punches, sciatic nerves, and DRG were 2 min, 8 min, and 12 min, respectively. Samples were kept at −80°C until ready for assay. To determine tissue NAD<sup>+</sup> levels, samples were transferred from −80°C to a container with dry ice. Tissue samples were weighed frozen (~5–10 mg), transferred immediately into 2 ml of ice-cold homogenization buffer (0.5% dodecyltrimethylammonium bromide, 100 mM Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>, 20 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, and PBS; pH 10–11), homogenized with a Tissue Tearor (Biospec) for 15–20 s, then placed on ice. Samples were vortexed every 5 min for 15 min then frozen on dry ice until all samples have been completed. 50 μl aliquots from each sample homogenate were added to a clear 96-well microplate. Standards were prepared in the same manner as the samples. To isolate NAD<sup>+</sup>, 25 μl of 0.4 N HCl was added to the samples, then the plate was incubated at 60°C for 15 min in a dry bath. The plate then cooled at RT for 15 min. 25 μl of 0.5 M Trizma base then was added to the NAD<sup>+</sup> samples. 50 μl of each sample or standard then was transferred to a 96-well white-walled microplate. 50 μl of the NAD/NADH-Glo kit (Promega) was added to each well, the plate incubated at RT in the dark for 45 min, then was scanned on the Fluostar Omega Microplate Reader (BMG Labtech). Relative luminescence units for each sample were interpolated to determine the NAD<sup>+</sup> concentration (nmol/l). Protein content (μg/ml) was determined for each sample using the Ionic Detergent Compatibility Reagent (Pierce) with the 660 nm Protein Assay Reagent (Pierce) to normalize tissue NAD<sup>+</sup> levels (nmol/mg protein).</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Anti-proliferation assay</title><p>The sulforhodamine B (SRB) assay was used to determine the effect of P7C3-A20 on the anti-proliferative effects of PTX in various cancer cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Skehan et al., 1990</xref>). Cells were plated in 96-well plates at a density of 2500–5000 cells/well (depending on the individual growth characteristics of each cell line) and incubated for 24 hr. Cells were treated with P7C3-A20 (0.1–5 μM) or vehicle for 1 hr, and then treated with PTX (0.1 nM – 1 μM). After 48 hr of drug exposure, media was removed and cells were fixed with 10% w/v trichloroacetic acid, washed with dH<sub>2</sub>O and then protein stained with SRB dye. After excess dye was removed by washing with 4% acetic acid, the SRB dye was re-suspended in Tris and cell density was determined by measuring the absorbance at 560 nm. The inhibition of cell proliferation over the 48 hr of drug incubation was determined for each concentration of PTX ±P7 C3-A20 utilizing a second plate of cells that was fixed at the time of drug treatment as a time 0 measurement, which is represented as a dashed horizontal line at y = 0. Cell density values less than the time 0 measurement indicate cytotoxic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Monks et al., 1991</xref>). The effect of P7C3-A20 (0.1–5 μM) alone on the growth of each cell line also was compared to the growth of vehicle treated cells over the 48 hr period of drug incubation. Nonlinear regression with a four-parameter logistic curve was used to calculate the IC<sub>50</sub> value for inhibition of cellular proliferation for each independent experiment followed by calculation of the mean pEC<sub>50</sub> ±SD (n = 3) for each cell line tested.</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>Tubulin polymerization assay</title><p>The effects of the compounds on purified porcine brain tubulin polymerization (Cytoskeleton, Inc., Denver, CO) were monitored at 340 nm with a SpectraMax plate reader (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_014789">SCR_014789</ext-link>).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior Editor and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Clifford J Woolf (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This study assesses the ability of the aminopropyl carbazole P7C3-A20 to protect against PTX-induced peripheral neuropathy. The findings show that P7C3-A20 provides robust prevention of PTX-induced behavioral effects of PTX, including mechanical allodynia, and loss of epidermal free nerve endings. The results support the idea that P7C3-A20 acts by enhancing NAD synthesis, although more evidence for this idea is needed. Importantly, P7C3-A20 prevents PTX-induced neuropathy without compromising the anti-tumor efficacy of PTX. The findings suggest that P7C3-A20 co-treatment with the anti-tumor compound PTX may be useful for augmenting NAD synthesis in peripheral neurons thereby preventing chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy. This is an interesting finding that points towards future use of P7C3-A20 or related compounds for prevention of the adverse side effects of PTX.</p><p>Concerns raised in review include a lack of mechanistic insight into how NAMPT or P7C3-A20 protects neurons from PTX toxicity, whether the actions of P7C3-A20 are direct on sensory neurons, and the lack of use of a biologically relevant in vitro model system (DRG neurons vs cortical neurons). Moreover, the study does not include standard pharmacological approaches (dose response, pK and pD measurements).</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Measurements of NAD production in DRG neurons following treatment with P7C3-A20 is required to determine whether the drug is acting on the relevant neuronal population. Ideally, this would be done in vivo, however we appreciate that in vivo measurements would be a challenge and potentially complicated due to non-neuronal cells and other limitations, and so in vitro measurements would be minimally required.</p><p>2) Does PTX lower NAD levels? Related to point 1, it will be important to do enzymatic assays or measure NAD levels in relevant DRG neurons treated with and without PTX is essential. The section showing that P7C3-A20 rescues NAD levels following treatment with H202 seems extraneous in the absence of any data showing that PTX treatment alters NAD levels.</p><p>3) Some dose-dependency and timing of effectiveness of P7C3-A20 for rescue of tactile pain hypersensitivity should be performed.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29626.026</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Measurements of NAD production in DRG neurons following treatment with P7C3-A20 is required to determine whether the drug is acting on the relevant neuronal population.

In response to this concern, we conducted another 12-day experimental paradigm to acquire tissue for NAD<sup>+</sup> analysis. The data have been compiled into a new figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), and we also amended our Discussion points to include these data. Briefly, we found that PTX treatment alone decreased NAD<sup>+</sup> levels in glabrous hindpaw skin and the sciatic nerve, which was prevented by P7C3-A20. Interestingly, NAD<sup>+</sup> levels were unchanged in the DRG by either PTX or P7C3-A20. As expected, P7C3-A20 treatment alone did not affect metabolite values. Although this analysis is representative of only a single point in time, it nevertheless supports our hypothesis that stimulation of NAMPT activity with P7C3-A20 protects peripheral sensory neurons from PTX-induced damage.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Some dose-dependency and timing of effectiveness of P7C3-A20 for rescue of tactile pain hypersensitivity should be performed.</p></disp-quote><p>As we initially set out to assess if P7C3-A20 had any effect on peripheral neuropathy, we optimized the design of the experimental paradigm such that if there were any effect to be seen, we would see it. Accordingly, we began with prophylactic treatment with P7C3-A20 and continued daily injections throughout the 28-day paradigm. We were encouraged to find that P7C3-A20 with this specific treatment schedule reduced behavioral signs of PTX-induced peripheral neuropathy. We kept this prophylactic treatment schedule constant for subsequent studies to pharmacologically characterize P7C3-A20, including dose-response for both the behavioral deficits (i.e., allodynia) and the pathohistologic signatures of nerve damage (i.e., IENF degeneration) induced by PTX treatment. In addition, we used this paradigm to explore mechanistic questions pertaining to NAMPT augmentation by P7C3-A20 and its role in the protection of peripheral neurons from damage.</p><p>We agree that evaluation of P7C3-A20 in the context of a treatment/rescue paradigm is an important question, as positive results would have profound implications for treatment for patients with established CIPN. However, rescue requires a different experimental paradigm whereby PTX is administered first to induce damage of peripheral neurons followed by treatment with P7C3-A20. The timing of when to administer P7C3-A20 would be a matter of trial and error and would take quite some time to complete the study. Accordingly, we respectfully suggest that these experiments be a subject for the next manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
