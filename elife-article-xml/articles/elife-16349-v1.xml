However, the molecular details of how hunger triggers changes in the activity of neural circuits to elicit these adaptive behavioural outcomes remains to be resolved. We show here that AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) regulates neuronal activity to elicit appropriate behavioural outcomes in response to acute starvation, and this effect is mediated by the coordinated modulation of glutamatergic inputs. AMPK targets both the AMPA-type glutamate receptor GLR-1 and the metabotropic glutamate receptor MGL-1 in one of the primary circuits that governs behavioural response to food availability in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. Overall, our study suggests that AMPK acts as a molecular trigger in the specific starvation-sensitive neurons to modulate glutamatergic inputs and to elicit adaptive behavioural outputs in response to acute starvation.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.16349.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.16349.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16349.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Animals often need to adapt to changes in food availability in order to survive. When food is in short supply and animals are starving, their energy reserves are low. To conserve energy, behaviours that are not essential to survival, like mating, are put on hold. Instead, animals channel their energies into foraging strategies that may help them find new food sources. These behavioural changes are likely to be caused by changes in brain activity triggered by starvation.</p><p>It is not entirely clear how starvation changes the brain and consequently how an animal behaves. It is also difficult to study how the brain regulates behaviour in response to environmental changes like food availability in larger animals with more complex nervous systems. Instead, scientists often study less complex animals like a type of worm called <italic>C. elegans</italic>, because this model organism has a simpler nervous system and it is easier to observe its feeding behaviours. Previous observations have revealed that well-fed worms travel backwards when they are hungry, revisiting sites where they have previously found food. Yet, when the worms are starving, they move forward more frequently, presumably to find new sources of food.</p><p>Now, Ahmadi and Roy show starving worms activate an enzyme called AMP-activated protein kinase (or AMPK for short). Worms genetically engineered to lack this enzyme tend to move backward when they are starved, instead of moving forward like typical starving worms. This shows that AMPK triggers a wider search for new food sources. Further experiments showed that AMPK acts to inhibit two receptors, which in turn, affects the activity of two different neurons. These two neurons work together to change the animal’s behaviour and boost the likelihood the animal will be able to find a new food source when food is scarce.</p><p>More complex animals, including humans, also have the receptors and brain cells targeted by AMPK in response to starvation. Future studies are needed to determine whether a similar chain of events occurs in creatures with more complicated nervous systems.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.16349.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.16349.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>AMPK</kwd><kwd>glutamatergic signaling</kwd><kwd>foraging behaviour</kwd><kwd>GLR-1</kwd><kwd>MGL-1</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MOP 84486</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Roy</surname><given-names>Richard</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>AMP-activated protein kinase directly coordinates glutamatergic signalling during starvation in <italic>C. elegans</italic>.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Most organisms are faced with unpredictable fluctuations in their natural environment that often lead to periods of limited food resources. Their ability to adapt to these changes in resource availability is critical for survival and is often a driving force in evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gray et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wang et al., 2005</xref>). When resources are scarce, pathways associated with energy conservation at both the organismal and the cellular levels become activated, and these are often complemented by behavioural modifications that simultaneously enhance foraging efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wang et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ashrafi, 2006</xref>).</p><p>The mammalian central nervous system (CNS) integrates internal and external cues that signal energy demand and availability and coordinately regulates outputs ranging from energy expenditure to feeding and associated locomotory behaviours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cone, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Balthasar et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Belgardt et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dietrich and Horvath, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Yang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aponte et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sternson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dietrich et al., 2015</xref>). In mice, the Agouti-related protein (AGRP)- and Pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC)-expressing neurons in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus form a core circuit to regulate food intake and energy expenditure through the modulation of their neuronal activity in response to hormonal signals linked to metabolic status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cowley et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bewick et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Yang et al., 2011</xref>). The activity of both of these neuronal populations is mediated by engaging signalling pathways that control the strength and/or plasticity of rapid, excitatory glutamatergic transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bito et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Collingridge et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Liu et al., 2012</xref>), but how energy stress results in changes in neuronal activity to elicit adaptive, or even compulsive behaviours are just now beginning to be elucidated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dietrich et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>The many signalling networks that are triggered throughout the nervous system that mediate the action of small molecules, hormones and nutrients on energy balance are of major interest due to their implication in, or treatment of various disorders. One of the key factors of paramount importance for metabolic homeostasis and survival is a highly conserved heterotrimeric protein kinase called AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). AMPK is regulated by the ratio of cellular AMP/ATP and by upstream activating kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hardie, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hardie et al., 2012</xref>). It functions as a ‘fuel gauge’ to monitor cellular energy status by inhibiting anabolic pathways and activating catabolic pathways so as to generate sufficient levels of metabolic substrates required to maintain a minimal threshold of basal cellular activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hardie, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hardie et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hardie and Ashford, 2014</xref>)</p><p>Energy stress has been demonstrated to induce adaptive behaviours in a neuronal AMPK-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lee et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cunningham et al., 2014</xref>). Moreover, accumulating evidence has implicated AMPK in the hypothalamic regulation of metabolic rate and food intake behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kola, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lopez et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lim et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Yang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Schneeberger and Claret, 2012</xref>). However, our understanding of how starvation influences adaptive foraging behaviours in an AMPK-dependent manner is still largely unknown, mostly due to the overwhelming complexity of the response in higher animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dietrich et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>In <italic>C. elegans</italic> these foraging behaviours are comparatively simple, consisting of a series of forward or backward movements, specific turns, or changes in direction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gray et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Piggott et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hendricks, 2015</xref>). Food availability has been demonstrated to affect various aspects of these key elements in <italic>C. elegans</italic> locomotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sawin et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gray et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chalasani et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Flavell et al., 2013</xref>). In the absence of food, well-fed animals reverse frequently, a behavioural pattern that reflects a sensory memory of food that is expressed by the navigation circuit and results in efficient exploration of a limited area. In contrast, starvation suppresses reversals and induces forward movement (runs) that allow animals to explore distal areas; a strategy that is referred to as dispersal behaviour or alternatively, distal exploration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gray et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>The simplicity of the neural circuits and locomotory behaviours in conjunction with its amenability to genetic manipulation makes <italic>C. elegans</italic> an ideal model to investigate the mechanisms through which AMPK regulates neuronal activity and adaptive locomotory behaviour (searching for food) in response to hunger. Unlike most other organisms studied to date, <italic>C. elegans</italic> mutants that lack all AMPK signalling are viable, but show clear phenotypes when subjected to energy stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Narbonne and Roy, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">2009</xref>). Therefore, using calcium imaging, cell type–specific optogenetic techniques, and classic genetic analysis, we identified and characterized the neural circuit in which AMPK functions as a molecular switch. This circuit includes the AIB and AIY interneurons; two neurons that form one of the primary circuits that dictate appropriate food- and odour-evoked behaviours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gray et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chalasani et al., 2007</xref>). We discovered that AMPK modulates AIB and AIY activity through two distinct mechanisms to ultimately ensure that adaptive foraging behaviours are appropriately triggered during periods of starvation. In the AIB interneurons AMPK regulates the abundance of the α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor GLR-1 in the postsynaptic elements, presumably by phosphorylation of serine 907 and 924 resulting in changes in synaptic strength and specific behavioural outputs. In addition, we also demonstrate that AMPK modulates a key metabotropic glutamate receptor called MGL-1 in the AIY interneuron at both mRNA and protein levels leading to an increase in AIY neuronal activity in starved animals. Together, our results indicate that AMPK acts as a starvation-inducible molecular trigger in the nervous system that modulates glutamatergic neuronal activity by at least two distinct mechanisms to modify behavioural outcomes in response to energy stress.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Neuronal AMPK signalling triggers distal exploratory behaviour in starved animals</title><p>AMPK has been implicated in the regulation of feeding behaviours in higher animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Minokoshi et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Yang et al., 2011</xref>) although its essential role in development and cellular homeostasis has made it very difficult to study its role outside this closed circuit. Accordingly, the identification of the neuronal targets of this protein kinase that may be important for these behaviours has been virtually impossible to interrogate. Fortunately, <italic>C. elegans</italic> mutants that completely lack AMPK signalling are viable, thus providing us with an opportunity to investigate how AMPK regulates characteristic foraging behaviours in response to acute periods of starvation.</p><p>We and others found that removal of <italic>aak-2</italic>, the more prominent of two catalytic subunits of AMPK present in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, disrupts most cellular AMPK signalling and affects various aspects of <italic>C. elegans</italic> foraging behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lee et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cunningham et al., 2014</xref>). More specifically, <italic>aak-2</italic> mutants exhibit a behavioural profile in response to acute starvation that is more typical of satiated animals, where animals tend to explore locally rather than foraging in more distant locations. This is reflected by the frequency of body bends; which is considered as a representative readout for locomotory movement away from a nutrient-depleted environment in search of new resources, and reversals; a behaviour most often associated with local exploration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gray et al., 2005</xref>). Both of these behaviours are affected in starved <italic>aak-2</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). These behaviours appear to be regulated predominantly by <italic>aak-2</italic> activity since removal of both catalytic subunits and hence eliminating all AMPK signalling (<italic>aak(0)</italic>) only modestly enhanced the phenotype of <italic>aak-2</italic> mutants in all our behavioural assays suggesting that <italic>aak-2</italic> mutants recapitulate a severe loss of AMPK function.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16349.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Neuronal AMPK regulates distal exploratory behaviour in starved animals.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Starved <italic>aak-2</italic> mutants display defective transition from local to distal exploration indicated by (i) decreased forward locomotion and (ii) increased reversal rate during acute bouts of starvation.

Based on sequence analysis, MGL-1 is a group II metabotropic glutamate receptor that acts as both pre- and postsynaptic detectors of glutamate to reduce neuronal excitation at least partly by inhibition of adenylyl cyclase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dillon et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Niswender and Conn, 2010</xref>).

Our genetic analyses indicate that mutations in <italic>mgl-1</italic> could also significantly, but not completely, suppress the prolonged local exploration typical of <italic>aak-2</italic> mutants whereby a compromise of <italic>mgl-1</italic> in the <italic>aak-2</italic> background results in reduced reversals and increased distal runs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>).

Furthermore, if AMPK does have a specific role in the AIB and the AIY, then what determines its functionality in this subset of AMPK-sensitive neurons? To test if AMPK affects other mediators of glutamatergic inputs we assessed whether AMPK compromise could modify the phenotypes associated with: <italic>nmr-1</italic>, which encodes a NMDA-type ionotropic glutamate receptor subunit; the glutamate-gated chloride channels <italic>avr-14 and mgl-2</italic> which encodes a group I metabotropic glutamate receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chalasani et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Piggott et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dillon et al., 2015</xref>).

To determine the importance of these sites we used the [P<italic>npr-9::glr-1::gfp</italic>] fusion protein as a template to generate a GLR-1::GFP variant with non-phosphorylable AMPK sites. The cytoplasmic domain of GluR has already been described as an important phosphoregulatory target, mostly by kinases such as PKA and PKC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Roche et al., 1996</xref>). Since two conserved AMPK phosphorylation sites were identified within the cytoplasmic domain of GLR-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1F</xref>), we mutated both S907 and S924 to non-phosphorylable alanine residues to evaluate how these sites contribute to the stability of GLR-1 within the AIB neuronal process during periods of starvation. Wild type animals bearing the compound (S907A, S924A) variant transgene demonstrated defective exploratory behaviour that was comparable to <italic>aak-2</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>).

It would therefore be intuitive that an increase in synaptic strength, or input, would result in a consequential increase in reversal frequency. Although we were unable to directly examine the role of AMPK in the regulation of synaptic strength, taken together, our data suggest that AMPK modulates synaptic strength by regulating GLR-1 abundance in the postsynaptic puncta to bias the behavioural readout in response to starvation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>AMPK modulates MGL-1 in the mRNA and protein levels in the AIY interneurons to modify distal exploratory behaviour in response to starvation</title><p>The results of our epistasis analysis between <italic>mgl-1</italic> and <italic>aak-2</italic> are consistent with <italic>mgl-1</italic> acting downstream of <italic>aak-2</italic> to regulate the transition from local to distal exploration in parallel with <italic>glr-1</italic> in response to starvation.

Although we did not observe any change in the levels of <italic>glc-3</italic> mRNA in well-fed or starved animals, we did observe an slight increase in <italic>mgl-1</italic> mRNA levels in well-fed and a more significant increase in starved <italic>aak-2</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B,C</xref>) suggesting that AMPK regulates MGL-1 levels by either blocking its transcription or affecting the stability of <italic>mgl-1</italic> transcripts. The former possibility is less plausible given the short time delay that occurs between the response to food deprivation and the consequent behavioural changes. Since we did not detect any significant change in the <italic>mgl-1</italic> mRNA levels in WT animals, it is likely that AMPK controls the abundance of <italic>mgl-1</italic> transcripts in the AIY and possibly other <italic>mgl-1</italic>-expressing neurons in response to starvation, typical of its function in adapting to energy stress. These results however do not exclude the possible role of AMPK in regulating MGL-1 protein levels directly through phosphorylation, as has been described for some ion channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lang and Föller, 2014</xref>), although this would be in addition to its observed impact on <italic>mgl-1</italic> transcript abundance.</p><p>To further investigate this possibility, we mutated the conserved potential AMPK phosphorylation site in MGL-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1D</xref>) to examine if AMPK also regulates MGL-1 through direct phosphorylation. We noted that mutating serine 234 to alanine (S234A) resulted in a modest, but nevertheless significant reduction in forward locomotion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>), although this mutation did not result in increased MGL-1 levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1E</xref>). This suggests that AMPK regulates <italic>mgl-1</italic> activity by impinging on both mRNA and protein function. The AMPK-mediated phosphorylation of serine 234 in MGL-1 may be required for the modulation of distal exploratory behaviour independent of its regulation of MGL-1 levels. We currently cannot exclude that this post-translational modification could affect some aspect of MGL-1 receptor function. Taken together, our results are consistent with a role for AMPK in modulating <italic>mgl-1</italic> function in the AIY interneurons whereby <italic>mgl-1</italic> activity is attenuated in response to starvation-induced AMPK signalling resulting in increased AIY activity and the consequent suppression of reversals.</p><p>Our results so far suggest that increased GLR-1 and MGL-1 abundance in the AIB and AIY interneurons, respectively, cause the defective distal exploration in starved <italic>aak-2</italic> animals. To further test whether indeed this may be the case we overexpressed GLR-1 and MGL-1 in the AIB and AIY interneurons, respectively, in WT animals to verify if this misexpression could recapitulate the defective distal exploration of starved <italic>aak-2</italic> mutants. The overexpression of MGL-1 in the AIY resulted in a phenotype that was quite similar to that seen in starved <italic>aak-2</italic> mutants whereas overexpression of GLR-1 in the AIB resulted in a more modest, but nevertheless significant, defect in transition between local to distal exploration. This difference can be explained by the fact that the overexpressed GLR-1 is most likely still targeted for endocytosis and degradation while AMPK is present and active, while in <italic>aak-2</italic> mutants there is a defect in GLR-1 endocytosis allowing it to accumulate to functionally critical levels in the puncta. Nevertheless, the overexpression of either of these transgenes results in a behavioural defect which phenocopies that of starved <italic>aak-2</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In most free-living organisms energy stress is often accompanied by characteristic compensatory behaviours that are triggered to increase the probability of encountering a food source (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wang et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gray et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dietrich et al., 2015</xref>). The spectrum of these responses however varies dramatically and naturally reflects both the environment and the physiology of the organism. Humans are characteristically hypersensitive and/or rapidly irritable during periods of acute food deprivation providing a familiar example of how a collection of neural circuits become reproducibly activated or blocked in response to this specific acute stress, culminating in highly predictable behavioural responses. These behavioural changes are achieved in part through synaptic plasticity, which is required for adaptation to varying circumstances in an experience-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bito, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Collingridge et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Liu et al., 2012</xref>).

However, we also noticed that starved <italic>aak-2</italic> animals execute frequent reversals, which might contribute significantly to their defective distal exploration given the antagonistic relationship between the well-characterized forward and backward locomotory circuits. We were able to improve forward locomotion by the targeted expression of <italic>aak-2</italic> in the AIB and AIY interneurons, while consequently reducing the abnormally frequent reversal behaviour typical of AMPK mutants, consistent with the involvement of AIB and AIY in regulating both reversal frequency and the duration of forward movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tsalik and Hobert, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wakabayashi et al., 2004</xref>).

Neuronal activity results from the interplay between synaptic excitation and inhibition.

Remarkably, our results delineate a novel role for AMPK in the modulation of neuronal activity in response to starvation through the simultaneous regulation of glutamatergic inputs mediated by two different receptors: GluR/GLR-1 in the AIB and MGL-1 in the AIY.

Our data demonstrate that the loss of AMPK signalling results in an increase in AIB neuronal activity and a concomitant decrease in AIY activity. This may be rationalized by the fact that <italic>C. elegans</italic> neurons release neurotransmitter in a graded fashion. Like vertebrate rod and cone photoreceptors which show tonic activity in the dark, and are hyperpolarized or depolarized by light, and removal of light respectively, AWC olfactory neurons have been shown to display basal activity in the absence of odour, but are inhibited or stimulated by odour or odour removal, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chalasani et al., 2007</xref>). Therefore, the increased GLR-1 and MGL-1 abundance in the AIB and AIY interneurons could potentially result in responses of longer duration and increased strength upon tonic neurotransmitter release at rest, or upon activation of AWC consequently increasing reversal frequency and shortening runs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16349.031</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>AMPK coordinates neuronal activity of the AIB and AIY interneurons by regulating their glutamatergic synaptic inputs in response to acute starvation.</title><p>The schematic showing the proposed role of AMPK in the AIB and AIY interneurons for regulation of appropriate transition between local to distal exploration during starvation conditions. Green and red colos show depolarized and hyperpolarized neurons, respectively.

AMPK also regulates the MGL-1-dependent synaptic inputs into the AIY interneurons, not only through its effects on <italic>mgl-1</italic> mRNA levels but also by direct phosphorylation of MGL-1 protein. These functions of AMPK within the AIB and AIY interneurons collectively result in the transition between local exploration that occurs in well fed animals to distal exploration that occurs in starved animals, thus allowing them to explore their environment more extensively for energy resources.

We provide several lines of evidence that demonstrate that AMPK regulates GLR-1 abundance, by affecting its ubiquitylation status during conditions of acute starvation. First, the total GLR-1 level is decreased upon starvation. Second, the amplitude and size/width of GLR-1 puncta that are two determinants of GLR-1 abundance are increased in the AIB neuronal process and in the ventral nerve cord in <italic>aak-2</italic> mutants. Third, this elevated GLR-1 accumulation cannot be further enhanced upon the disruption of the various processes required to remove GLR-1 from the membrane suggesting that AMPK and the ubiquitin-mediated internalization of GLR-1 may therefore function in a linear genetic pathway. Fourth, mutating the AMPK phosphorylation sites in GLR-1 results in increased GLR-1 abundance and defective distal exploratory behaviour. Finally, this defect is comparable to that observed in <italic>aak-2</italic> mutants, while crossing the GLR-1 (S907A, S924A) variant into the <italic>aak-2</italic> mutant background did not further exacerbate the distal exploratory behavioural defect. Therefore, consistent with its well-described role in the mouse where it regulates glutamatergic neurotransmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Yang et al., 2011</xref>), AMPK is required to regulate the abundance of GLR-1 in specific glutamatergic neurons. In doing so it modulates glutamatergic inputs and synaptic strength to elicit appropriate behavioural outcomes in response to starvation.</p><p>AMPA receptors are either inserted or removed from postsynaptic membranes in an activity-dependent manner leading to the potentiation or depression of synaptic transmission, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Carroll et al., 1999</xref>). Our findings might be further extended to implicate AMPK in the control of synaptic plasticity that underlies learning and memory as the appropriate regulation of glutamate receptor abundance is critical for long-term memory through habituation in <italic>C. elegans </italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Rose et al., 2003</xref>). Any increase in GluR abundance, and hence signalling, that arises in AMPK-compromised animals is very likely to result in irregular plasticity and abnormal behavioural outcomes, consistent with what is observed in starved AMPK mutants.</p><p>In addition to its regulation of GLR-1 abundance in the AIB, we show that AMPK also regulates glutamatergic inputs by regulating MGL-1 in the AIY. A key function of group II mGlu receptors is to modulate neuronal excitability and synaptic transmission at least partly by inhibiting adenylate cyclase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dillon et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Niswender and Conn, 2010</xref>). Group II mGlu receptors are required in both cognitive and emotional processes, and have been linked to various neuropsychiatric conditions, including anxiety, stress-related disorders, schizophrenia and substance misuse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Niswender and Conn, 2010</xref>). In mammals, activation of mGluR II induces long term depression at GABAergic synapses in the cochlear nucleus magnocellularis neurons where they have been shown to modulate synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lu, 2007</xref>).</p><p>In <italic>C. elegans, mgl-1</italic> regulates a systemic starvation response and fat accumulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Greer et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kang et al., 2009</xref>). Consistent with the inhibitory role of group II mGlu receptors in the vertebrate nervous system, <italic>mgl-1</italic> was recently demonstrated to coordinate environmental sensory cues to modulate the activity of the pharyngeal neural network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dillon et al., 2015</xref>). Although some studies have indicated that metabotropic glutamate receptors can be phosphoregulated by kinases such as PKC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kim et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ko et al., 2012</xref>), our work has uncovered an AMPK-mediated modulation of the MGL-1 in response to acute food deprivation in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. This effect is at least partly achieved by influencing the regulation of <italic>mgl-1</italic> mRNA levels in starved animals. Considering the brief delay between stimulus and response it is most likely that AMPK mediates its effect on <italic>mgl-1</italic> transcript levels through the phosphorylation of key regulators of <italic>mgl-1</italic> mRNA stability as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Yun et al., 2005</xref>). Therefore, in addition to its well-described role in the regulation of ionic channels by affecting their degradation, AMPK may regulate its downstream neuronal effectors by affecting mRNA stability to regulate protein levels.</p><p>In summary, our findings suggest a simple model, in which AMPK coordinately regulates the activity of the AIB and AIY interneurons by modulating their glutamatergic synaptic inputs through two distinct mechanisms. AMPK modulates glutamatergic inputs in both interneurons by impinging on AMPA-type glutamate receptor GLR-1 and metabotropic glutamate receptor MGL-1 which consequently regulate distinct downstream behavioural outputs. The most salient feature of our study is our demonstration that AMPK acts as a molecular switch in the nervous system that is most likely not limited to the circuitries engaged in the regulation of feeding and locomotory behaviours. Given the conserved AMPK phosphorylation sites in GLR-1 and MGL-1, we speculate that AMPK regulates the activity of neural circuits in various organisms at least partly by affecting these two receptor types to modulate a wide range of neuronal outputs that respond to physiological or developmental contexts involving various stresses. Alternatively, its starvation-inducible or pharmacological activation could provide a highly effective, non-invasive means of modifying behavioural outputs.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Strains</title><p><italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> strains were maintained under standard conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brenner, 1974</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and K VijayRaghavan as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>In this paper, Ahmadi and Roy address how the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK, <italic>aak-2</italic>) regulates behavioral response to acute starvation. Because AMPK monitors the status of cellular energy, the findings provide a mechanistic link between physiological and behavioral responses to stress of food-deprivation. The study has identified the key interneurons in a locomotory circuit as the functional targets of the AMPK <italic>aak-2</italic> in response to starvation. It has also found that <italic>aak-2</italic> regulates the stability of two glutamatergic receptors in the interneurons to generate starvation-induced behavioral changes. The study employs multiple experimental approaches to thoroughly support the conclusions.</p><p>The following concerns should be addressed:</p><p>1) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>. While it seems clear that the <italic>aak-2</italic> mutant displays a defect in suppressing reversals when starved, the defects of <italic>aak-2</italic> in locomotory speed do not seem to be specific to starvation. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref> well-fed <italic>aak-2</italic> also moves more slowly than well-fed wild-type animals. Because <italic>aak-2</italic> is also possibly expressed in motor neurons and some pre-motor neurons, <italic>aak-2</italic> may regulate speed under the normal condition. The effect of <italic>aak-2</italic> on starvation-induced decrease in reversal rate is a parameter that is more specific to starvation, which should be the focus for behavioral characterization.</p><p>Along the same line, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, the authors showed that starving the animals for 10 mins is already causing a behavioral phenotype. Are <italic>aak-2</italic> animals with no starvation different from wild type?

AIB activity is known to link with reversals, therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the observed and quantified spontaneous activity in AIB represent &quot;attempts&quot; of reversals. However, it is not clear what the spontaneous activity measured in AIY represents. Some clarification is needed.</p><p>Can one measure the activity of these neurons during animal movements?</p><p>Along the same line, one question is how the imaging trials were selected since it is just spontaneous activity being measured, was the experimenter blinded to the genotype of the animal?</p><p>3) There are some concerns about the reagents and the way the receptor imaging experiments are done. Why are the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> experiments not done in AIB?</p><p>Are the strains used to quantify GLR-1 abundance in AIB or MGL1 in AIY stable integrated transgenes?

While it seems clear that the aak-2 mutant displays a defect in suppressing reversals when starved, the defects of aak-2 in locomotory speed do not seem to be specific to starvation. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref> well-fed aak-2 also moves more slowly than well-fed wild-type animals. Because aak-2 is also possibly expressed in motor neurons and some pre-motor neurons, aak-2 may regulate speed under the normal condition. The effect of aak-2 on starvation-induced decrease in reversal rate is a parameter that is more specific to starvation, which should be the focus for behavioral characterization.</italic> </p><p>Based on our analysis <italic>aak-2</italic> mutants do not show any difference in their rate of forward or backward locomotion when assayed in the presence of food; a situation where AMPK is most likely inactive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Similarly, <italic>aak-2</italic> animals that were previously well-fed or starved display a comparable rate of forward locomotion similarly-treated wild type animals when evaluated on an abundant food source after a short period of time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B, C</xref>). To further examine if <italic>aak-2</italic> mutants display a general dampening of locomotory speed we examined the forward locomotion rate (body bends) of <italic>aak-2</italic> mutants upon exposure to a gentle touch applied to the posterior (just before the anus). We found that <italic>aak-2</italic> mutants show similar locomotory speed compared to WT animals following this touch stimulus suggesting that they do not display any defect in locomotory speed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref> and subsection “Neuronal AMPK signalling triggers distal exploratory behaviour in starved animals”, fourth paragraph). Therefore, it is likely that the basal AMPK activity regulates the observed change in speed specifically in response to food depletion in well-fed animals, while it has a more pronounced effect on behaviour when activated upon prolonged starvation. Since the increased reversal frequency affects the duration of forward movement (Burbea M, Dreier L., 2002; Tsalik and Hobert, 2003 and our <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2E, G</xref>), we believe that the forward locomotion rate in starved <italic>aak-2</italic> animals is very likely to be also affected by the <italic>aak-2</italic>-associated defect in suppressing reversals. This can potentially explain the reason for greater difference in forward locomotion between <italic>aak-2</italic> and WT animals upon 2 hours of starvation compared to 10 minutes off food. Because of the antagonistic relationship between forward and backward locomotion, we always try to include the results for both forward and backward locomotion throughout our study. We pointed this out in the third paragraph of the aforementioned subsection in our description of the data presented in the first figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). We show that the effect of AMPK on locomotory behaviour is largely confined to starved animals, while AMPK also regulates reversal frequency.</p><p><italic>Along the same line, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, the authors showed that starving the animals for 10 mins is already causing a behavioral phenotype. Are aak-2 animals with no starvation different from wild type? In other words, are the aak-2 mutant phenotype caused by developmental deficits?</italic> </p><p>We examined locomotory behaviour in the presence of food and in response to a mechanical stimulus in the posterior region and we conclude that AMPK mutants are not impaired in any apparent way. <italic>aak-2</italic> animals do display a reduced forward rate of locomotion in the absence of food, but not in the presence of a thin layer of bacteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). As previously mentioned, to examine if <italic>aak-2</italic> mutants display a decrease in locomotory speed we monitored the locomotory behaviour of <italic>aak-2</italic> mutants upon exposure to a gentle touch applied to the posterior end of their body. In our opinion this serves as a good control since it is a stimulus that is unrelated to the starvation-sensing circuit. We found that <italic>aak-2</italic> mutants show no difference in locomotory speed compared to WT animals under these conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref> and subsection “Neuronal AMPK signalling triggers distal exploratory behaviour in starved animals”, fourth paragraph), thus suggesting that the locomotory phenotypes we describe in our study are unlikely to be a consequence of any more general developmental defect.</p><p>In addition, when <italic>aak-2</italic>(RNAi) was performed in late L2 stage larvae, well after the majority of motor neurons are generated, we noted a modest but significant reduction in forward locomotion rate upon removal from food (data not shown) that was compounded with an increase in reversal frequency when the animals were starved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref> and in the aforementioned paragraph) suggesting that the reduced locomotory speed caused by AMPK loss of function in starved animals is unlikely to be a consequence of a more general developmental defect that impinges on motor function. This is further corroborated by our optogenetic results where we show that although AIY activation or AIB inactivation in starved WT animals (when AIB is likely inactive and AIY is likely active (Gray et al., 2005)), do not change their locomotory behaviour, while optogenetically activating AIY or inactivating AIB in <italic>aak-2</italic> mutants ameliorates both forward and backward locomotion. Therefore, taken altogether it is unlikely that the reduced locomotory speed in <italic>aak-2</italic> mutants is a consequence of a more general developmental deficit. Rather, it is most probably a consequence of reduced AIY activity and increased AIB activity in starved <italic>aak-2</italic> mutants.</p><p><italic>Can overexpression of GLR-1 in AIB or MGL-1 in AIY mimic the effect of aak-2?</italic> </p><p>This is a great suggestion that could further support our conclusions. We did the experiment and the data have been added to the revised manuscript as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>. Previous studies have shown that overexpression of GLR-1 in the AIB interneurons causes an increase in reversal rate in the absence of food(Chalasani et al., 2007), while a group in Japan has recently reported that <italic>mgl-1</italic> mutants display a reduced reversal rate. Their data indicate that the expression levels of MGL-1 in the AIY interneurons are critical for appropriate chemotaxis toward DA and increased MGL-1 levels result in abnormal choice between the repellant and attractant (Suehiro and Mitani, International <italic>C. elegans</italic> Conference 2015). These results are consistent with our data that demonstrate the accumulation of GLR-1 and MGL-1 in the AIB and AIY interneurons of starved AMPK mutants, respectively. Furthermore, these changes in abundance correlate with changes in the forward and backward locomotion rate and aberrant chemotaxis. In our study, using various approaches, we highlight that the appropriate suppression of reversals that would normally occur during starvation is impaired in <italic>aak-2</italic> mutants and is potentially caused by the increased abundance of GLR-1 and/or MGL-1. To determine whether the increased abundance of these receptors can cause the same phenotype as <italic>aak-2</italic> mutants, we examined the locomotory behaviour of starved animals that overexpress GLR-1 in the AIB, or MGL-1 in the AIY, or in animals that overexpress both transgenes. As we have shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>, overexpressing MGL-1 in the AIY resulted in a phenotype that was quite similar to that seen in starved <italic>aak-2</italic> mutants. The overexpression of MGL-1 in the AIY interneurons was more effective in phenocopying the locomotory defects of starved <italic>aak-2</italic> mutants than the effect of overexpression of GLR-1 in the AIB, which resulted in a modest, but nevertheless significant, defect in transition between local to distal exploration. This can be explained by the fact that overexpressed GLR-1 is most likely still targeted for endocytosis and degradation while AMPK is present and active. In <italic>aak-2</italic> mutants there is a defect in GLR-1 endocytosis allowing it to accumulate in puncta. However, when it is overexpressed there is some accumulation but AMPK is still present to modulate the excess accumulation of the receptor. Nevertheless, overexpression of either of these, or both transgenes results in a similar behavioural defect as that which we report for <italic>aak-2</italic> mutants. We have added these data to the manuscript as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>, and we describe our interpretations in the last paragraph of the subsection “AMPK modulates MGL-1 in the mRNA and protein levels in the AIY interneurons to modify distal exploratory behaviour in response to starvation”.</p><p><italic>2) It seems that the calcium imaging results were collected from animals that were immobilized without any sensory stimulation. AIB activity is known to link with reversals, therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the observed and quantified spontaneous activity in AIB represent &quot;attempts&quot; of reversals. However, it is not clear what the spontaneous activity measured in AIY represents. Some clarification is needed.</italic> </p><p>Two previous studies which measured the calcium levels in the AIY in freely moving animals had shown that the calcium peaks observed in the AIY correlate with termination of reversals and onset and duration of forward runs with gradual increases preceding forward run initiation. This also coincides with point where the locomotory speed is maximal (Flavell et al., 2013; Luo et al., 2014). This information is added to the new text file (subsection “Parallel and opposing function of AMPK in the modulation of AIB and AIY outputs”, first paragraph).</p><p>To further investigate if the defective distal exploration of <italic>aak-2</italic> mutants is a consequence of decreased AIY activity and increased AIB activity in starved <italic>aak-2</italic> mutants and to correlate the locomotory activity with changes in the AIB and AIY neuronal activity, we performed calcium imaging in the AIY and AIB in freely moving WT and <italic>aak-2</italic> animals during starvation. Consistent with previous studies we noted a correlation between the increased Ca<sup>2+</sup> influxes in the AIY with termination of reversals which remains high during forward runs. Moreover, not surprisingly, the frequency and intensity of Ca<sup>2+</sup> influxes/neuronal activity in the AIB increases during reversals. These data further corroborate our findings presented in the original manuscript that showed that the defective transition from local to distal exploration during starvation is a consequence of both decreased AIY activity and increased AIB activity. These new data have been added to this revised manuscript as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>, while we describe this correlation in the text (subsection “Parallel and opposing function of AMPK in the modulation of AIB and AIY outputs”, first and third paragraphs).</p><p><italic>Can one measure the activity of these neurons during animal movements?</italic> </p><p>To examine the correlation between neural activity in AIB and AIY and the locomotory behaviours we describe, we performed calcium imaging in freely moving WT and <italic>aak-2</italic> animals placed on 10% agarose pads as a means to reduce their movement. These data have been included in the revised manuscript as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref> this correlation is described in the text (subsection “Parallel and opposing function of AMPK in the modulation of AIB and AIY outputs”, first and third paragraphs).</p><p><italic>Along the same line, one question is how the imaging trials were selected since it is just spontaneous activity being measured, was the experimenter blinded to the genotype of the animal?</italic> </p><p>Most of our calcium imaging studies were performed in immobilized animals and the experimenter was indeed blind to the genotype of animals. Moreover, every time that this experiment was performed, all the animals placed on the agarose pad were examined unless the animals were unhealthy or moved out of field of view.</p><p><italic>3) There are some concerns about the reagents and the way the receptor imaging experiments are done. Why are the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> experiments not done in AIB?</italic> </p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,B,C</xref> we investigated if AMPK might regulate GLR-1 abundance in the nervous system through effects on the endocytic pathway using two different approaches: first, by using <italic>unc-11</italic> mutants which disrupt the AP2-adaptin complex and endocytosis or secondly, using a GLR-1 transgenic variant in which the critical lysine residues that are targeted by ubiquitylation and which trigger endocytosis are mutated to alanine. Since we showed that AMPK plays an important role in the modulation of GLR-1 abundance in the ventral nerve cord by modulating its endocytosis, we wanted to determine if AMPK might regulate GLR-1 abundance specifically in the AIB neuronal puncta in starved animals through similar mechanisms. To test this we used a non-phosphorylable GLR-1 variant that was expressed specifically in the AIB and found that AMPK indeed regulates GLR-1 abundance in the neuronal process through its effects on the endocytic pathway. Although we discussed the results of our analysis of <italic>aak-2; unc-11</italic>, which we initially performed as a control but did not include it in the final figure, we have now incorporated this result into the final figure and we specifically clarify that this experiment was performed in the AIB, and not the ventral nerve cord, both in the text and in the legend for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>.</p><p><italic>Are the strains used to quantify GLR-1 abundance in AIB or MGL1 in AIY stable integrated transgenes? One problem with this type of imaging experiments is the overexpression effect of transgenes.</italic> </p><p>In these experiments, all the imaging and subsequent quantifications were performed by an experimenter blind to the genotypes.</p><p>In the case of MGL-1 we introduced GFP into the C terminus of <italic>mgl-1</italic> using CRISPR technology. Therefore the GFP signal was initially quantified in the strains that express a single copy of the MGL-1::GFP from endogenous <italic>mgl-1</italic> promoter sequence. However, since <italic>mgl-1</italic> is expressed in the AIY interneurons at much lower levels compared to other <italic>mgl-1</italic>-expressing neurons (data not shown), this signal was very faint and was easily bleached, we repeated and confirmed these results in strains that express MGL-1::GFP in extra chromosomal arrays in order to obtain better quality images and eliminate the problem of rapid photobleaching. To ensure that our observations of the multi-copy transgene are not a consequence of differential expression of the array, 3 independent MGL-1::GFP-expressing strains were examined by an experimenter who was blind to the genotypes of the strains in each case. The results obtained with all three transgenic lines were consistent with our observations made with the CRISPR-introduced allele. We therefore strongly believe that the signal we observe with the extrachromosomal transgenes recapitulates the endogenous situation and indicates that MGL-1 levels vary between starved WT and <italic>aak-2</italic> mutant animals.</p><p>Since we had to assess the GLR-1::GFP signal in the neuronal process of AIB, a single copy transgene was not sufficient to generate a strong and quantifiable signal for our experiments. Therefore, as was the case with the MGL-1::GFP, we generated multiple transgenic lines which were scored by an experimenter who was blind to the genotypes while the images were being acquired and also during subsequent analysis. We obtained reproducible results from all of our transgenic lines that were consistent with GLR-1 being regulated by AMPK in the AIB neuronal process. Moreover, since GLR-1 abundance in the AIB neuronal process was clearly elevated in <italic>unc-11</italic> animals, and which was not further enhanced upon the removal of <italic>aak-2</italic>, we conclude that AMPK must be part of a linear pathway that contributes to the endocytic regulation of GLR-1 abundance. Consistent with this possibility GLR-1 variants that lacked the consensus AMPK phosphorylation sites in GLR-1 accumulated in a manner similar to <italic>unc-11</italic> mutants or in <italic>aak-2; unc-11</italic> doubles. Because we can quantify differences in the levels of GLR-1 and its variants in the various genotypes we have tested, it seems unlikely that the transgenic expression levels contribute significantly to the regulation that we observe. We therefore contend that the AMPK-dependent differences in GLR-1 abundance that we observe in the AIB neuronal process in starved animals are not the result of the increased GLR-1 contributed by the extrachromosomal, multicopy transgenes, but rather due to the regulation of the protein by AMPK and additional regulators of the endocytic degradation pathway.</p></body></sub-article></article>
