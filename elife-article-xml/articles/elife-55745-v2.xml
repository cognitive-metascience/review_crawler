degradation to maintain cell homeostasis. In order to understand whether and how lysosomes alter with age and contribute to lifespan regulation, we characterized multiple properties of lysosomes during the aging process in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. We uncovered age-dependent alterations in lysosomal morphology, motility, acidity and degradation activity, all of which indicate a decline in lysosome function with age. The age-associated lysosomal changes are suppressed in the long-lived mutants <italic>daf-2</italic>, <italic>eat-2</italic> and <italic>isp-1</italic>, which extend lifespan by inhibiting insulin/IGF-1 signaling, reducing food intake and impairing mitochondrial function, respectively. We found that 43 lysosome genes exhibit reduced expression with age, including genes encoding subunits of the proton pump V-ATPase and cathepsin proteases. The expression of lysosome genes is upregulated in the long-lived mutants, and this upregulation requires the functions of DAF-16/FOXO and SKN-1/NRF2 transcription factors. Impairing lysosome function affects clearance of aggregate-prone proteins and disrupts lifespan extension in <italic>daf-2</italic>, <italic>eat-2</italic> and <italic>isp-1</italic> worms. Our data indicate that lysosome function is modulated by multiple longevity pathways and is important for lifespan extension.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>lysosome</kwd><kwd>aging</kwd><kwd>insuin/igf-1 signaling</kwd><kwd>longevity pathways</kwd><kwd>DAF-16/FOXO</kwd><kwd>SKN-1/NRF2</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002855</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2016YFA0500203</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Xiaochen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>3163001</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Xiaochen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>91754203</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Xiaochen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002367</institution-id><institution>Chinese Academy of Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Strategic Priority Research Program XDB19000000</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Xiaochen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Cell biological and genetic studies reveal age-associated alterations of lysosomes and modulation of lysosomal activity by longevity pathways.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Lysosomes are dynamic organelles responsible for macromolecule degradation and catabolite recycling. Lysosomes also serve as a signaling hub to integrate nutritional, energy and growth factor information and coordinate cellular responses through key regulatory modules docked on the lysosomal surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lawrence and Zoncu, 2019</xref>). By acting as centers of degradation, recycling and signaling, lysosomes play crucial roles in a variety of fundamental processes to maintain cell and tissue homeostasis. Lysosomal dysfunction is associated with a number of age-related pathologies, which suggests the importance of lysosome function in the aging process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carmona-Gutierrez et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Aging is considered as a process of gradual deterioration of physiological functions that leads to decreased survival and increased risk of death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">LÃ³pez-OtÃ­n et al., 2013</xref>). One of the most universal hallmarks of aging is the decline in protein homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">LÃ³pez-OtÃ­n et al., 2013</xref>). Studies in a variety of organisms have uncovered age-dependent accumulation of misfolded and damaged proteins, which may impair cell function and homeostasis, leading to the development of age-related diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cuervo and Dice, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Terman and Brunk, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Martinez-Vicente et al., 2005</xref>). Misfolded, aggregated and damaged proteins can be removed by the proteasome or cleared through the autophagy-lysosome pathway. As the key organelle for cellular degradation, lysosomes exhibit age-related changes such as increased size, number and content; increases and decreases in lysosomal hydrolase activity have also been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Truschel et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sarkis et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cuervo and Dice, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hayflick, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bolanowski et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Yoon et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cuervo, 2010</xref>). Moreover, vacuolar acidity reduces during replicative aging in budding yeast, and lysosomal pH appears to increase with age in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> intestine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hughes and Gottschling, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baxi et al., 2017</xref>). In addition, there is evidence for increased lysosomal gene expression with age, which is considered as a compensatory response to altered protein homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">de MagalhÃ£es et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cellerino and Ori, 2017</xref>). Therefore, the causal connection between age-associated lysosomal changes and accumulation of abnormal proteins remains unclear.</p><p>Like many other biological processes, the aging process is subjected to regulation. Intrinsic and extrinsic longevity regulatory pathways have been identified that play evolutionarily conserved roles. One such pathway is the insulin/IGF-1 signaling (IIS) pathway, which controls aging in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, insects and mammals, and extends the lifespan of these organisms when attenuated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anisimov and Bartke, 2013</xref>). In worms, reducing IIS, such as through mutation in the <italic>daf-2</italic> gene, which encodes the sole <italic>C. elegans</italic> insulin/IGF-1 receptor, leads to significantly increased adult longevity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kenyon et al., 1993</xref>). The extension of longevity by reduced IIS involves a phosphorylation cascade that ultimately results in nuclear translocation of the DAF-16/Forkhead box (FOXO) and the SKN-1/Nuclear factor-erythroid-related factor 2 (NRF2) transcription factors and subsequent transcriptional regulation of their target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Murphy and Hu, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tullet et al., 2008</xref>). DAF-16 and SKN-1 have both distinct and overlapping functions in lifespan extension under the condition of reduced IIS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tullet et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ewald et al., 2015</xref>). The heat-shock transcription factor HSF-1 also acts downstream of the IIS pathway. HSF-1 may collaborate with DAF-16 to regulate the expression of chaperone genes, thus contributing to the longevity of <italic>daf-2</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hsu et al., 2003</xref>). In addition to down-regulation of the IIS pathway, increased longevity can be achieved by reducing food intake or impairing mitochondrial function. Both caloric restriction and mild inhibition of mitochondrial respiration extend the lifespan of many organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kenyon, 2010</xref>). In worms, the feeding-defective <italic>eat-2</italic> mutation significantly lengthens the lifespan, and this requires the function of PHA-4/FOXA and SKN-1/NRF2 transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lakowski and Hekimi, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Panowski et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Park et al., 2010</xref>). Reducing mitochondrial function may produce a low dose of stressors such as reactive oxygen species (ROS), which elicit protective adaptive responses and induce pro-longevity effects through DAF-16, SKN-1 and the hypoxia-inducible factor HIF-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Ventura, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Senchuk et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Schmeisser et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lee et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yang and Hekimi, 2010</xref>). The different longevity regulatory pathways are not completely independent but may utilize overlapping mechanisms as they share downstream transcription factors.</p><p>Consistent with the evidence that declining protein homeostasis serves as an aging marker, long-lived worms can preserve their proteome with age. Several hundred proteins with diverse functions have been identified that become more insoluble with age in wild-type <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">David et al., 2010</xref>). The increased protein insolubility and aggregation, however, is significantly delayed or even halted in long-lived <italic>daf-2</italic> worms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">David et al., 2010</xref>). The mechanisms by which <italic>daf-2</italic> mutants maintain protein homeostasis are not fully understood. In <italic>daf-2</italic> animals, there is increased autophagy activity, which is important for lifespan extension in these mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">MelÃ©ndez et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Guo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lapierre et al., 2013</xref>). Lysosome function is essential for clearance of autophagic substrates. Constitutive autophagy activity leads to more severe defects when lysosome function is compromised (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sun et al., 2011</xref>). Overexpression of XBP-1s, the activated form of the UPR<sup>ER</sup> transcription factor, is found to increase lysosome activity to promote clearance of toxic proteins and extend <italic>C. elegans</italic> lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Imanikia et al., 2019</xref>). However, it is unclear whether and how lysosome activity is modulated by longevity-promoting pathways, or how lysosomes contribute to protein homeostasis and lifespan extension.</p><p>In this study, we employed cell biology assays to examine lysosomal changes with age in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. We found that various lysosomal properties are altered, which indicates that lysosome activity declines with age. The age-associated lysosomal changes are suppressed in multiple different long-lived mutant worms, which exhibit increased expression of lysosome genes. Our data suggest that lysosome activity is modulated by longevity pathways and is essential for lifespan extension.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Lysosomes undergo age-associated alternations in <italic>C. elegans</italic></title><p>We examined lysosome morphology using the NUC-1::CHERRY reporter in <italic>C. elegans</italic> adults at different ages.

To examine lysosome dynamics, we measured Pearsonâs correlation coefficient to compare the colocalization of lysosomes in two time-lapse image frames taken 60 s apart. We found a higher level of colocalization in adult hypodermis, resulting in a higher Pearsonâs correlation coefficient than in larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1M,N</xref>). This suggests that lysosomes are less dynamic in adults. Consistent with this, the velocity of lysosomes was higher in larvae than in adults (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1O</xref>). The Pearsonâs correlation coefficient did not change obviously in adults from day 1 to day 9, but the velocity of lysosomes was significantly reduced at days 5 and 9, which suggests that lysosome motility declines with age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1N,O</xref>). We examined lysosome acidity by co-staining with LysoTracker Red (LTR) and LysoSensor Green DND-189 (LSG, pKa 5.2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baxi et al., 2017</xref>). LTR is less sensitive to increased acidity than LSG and is used as a control for normalizing the dye intake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Duvvuri et al., 2004</xref>). The fluorescence intensity ratio of LSG vs LTR (LSG/LTR) is quantified to indicate lysosome acidity. We found that the LSG/LTR ratio in the intestine was reduced in adults at days 3, 5 and 9 compared to day 1, which suggests that lysosome acidity declines in aging adults (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2AâDââ, I</xref>). The tubular lysosomal structures enriched in the hypodermis of aged adults were weakly stained by LysoTracker Red but were not labeled by LysoSensor Green, which suggests that lysosomal tubules may be less acidic than the vesicular ones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1AâD</xref>). Cathepsin L (CPL-1) is synthesized as an inactive pro-enzyme, which is converted to the active mature form in lysosomes through proteolytic removal of the pro-domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Stoka et al., 2016</xref>). The processing of endogenous CPL-1 can be examined by western blot and quantified to indicate the degradation activity of lysosomes. We found that CPL-1 processing reduced significantly in adults at days 5 and 9 compared to day 1, and pro-CPL-1 accumulated with age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2N,O</xref>). These results suggest that lysosomal degradation activity decreases with age.

We found that lysosomes in the <italic>daf-2(e1370ts)</italic> mutant, which has reduced function of DAF-2, appeared as small puncta and short tubules, and they were not obviously changed with age in hypodermis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1EâH</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1B</xref>). <italic>daf-2(e1370ts)</italic> worms contained significantly more vesicular lysosomes than wild type, and these vesicular lysosomes were smaller in size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J,K</xref>).

In the intestine of <italic>daf-2</italic> mutants, the number and mean volume of vesicular lysosomes was similar to that in wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1D,G,H</xref>).</p><p>We found that lysosomes in <italic>daf-2</italic> adults at different ages were more dynamic than in wild type. The Pearsonâs correlation coefficient was lower, and the velocity of lysosomes was higher in <italic>daf-2</italic> adults (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1MâO</xref>). The lysosome velocity in <italic>daf-2</italic> adults was similar to that in wild-type larvae. The fluorescence intensity ratio of LSG/LTR at days 5 and 9 in <italic>daf-2</italic> was higher than in wild type, and it was similar to the LSG/LTR ratio in wild type at day 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2EâI</xref>). This suggests that lysosomal acidity is maintained in <italic>daf-2</italic> worms with age. To further examine this, we fused the pH-sensitive fluorescent protein pHTomato with NUC-1, and transiently expressed NUC-1::pHTomato using the heat-shock promoter. At 24 hr post heat-shock treatment, NUC-1::pHTomato overlapped well with the lysosomal membrane protein SCAV-3, indicating delivery of the fusion protein to lysosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1EâGââ</xref>). pHTomato has a p<italic>K</italic>a close to 7.8 and thus exhibits increased fluorescence when the pH is increased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Li and Tsien, 2012</xref>). The average fluorescence intensity of NUC-1::pHTomato in each lysosome was quantified in the hypodermis.

Collectively, these data suggest that lysosome acidity increases in <italic>daf-2</italic> worms. We next examined CPL-1 processing and found that significantly more mature CPL-1 was produced in <italic>daf-2</italic> worms than in wild type at different ages, which suggests that the degradation activity of lysosomes is increased in <italic>daf-2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2N,O</xref>). To corroborate this, we examined lysosomal degradation activity using the NUC-1::CHERRY fusion protein. When delivered to lysosomes, CHERRY is cleaved from the fusion protein by cathepsins, and the extent of cleavage can be visualized by Western blot and quantified to indicate the degradation activity of lysosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Miao et al., 2020</xref>). Consistent with the CPL-1 processing assay, we found significantly increased CHERRY cleavage in <italic>daf-2</italic> worms compared to wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1I,J</xref>).</p><p>The above results suggest that the properties of lysosomes â including morphology, dynamics, acidity and degradation activity â are well maintained in <italic>daf-2</italic> mutants, but not in wild type, with age. To further test this, we examined lysosomes by high voltage electron microscopy (HVEM). At day 1 of adulthood, 40% of wild-type lysosomes in hypodermis appeared as membrane-enclosed, dense and spherical vesicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B,K</xref>). In addition, around 50% of wild-type lysosomes contained both electron-dense and -lucent contents, with half of them extending electron-lucent tubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D,E,K</xref>). In addition to the above two main classes, a few lysosomal tubules with either dense (1.4%) or lucent (7.1%) contents were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C,F,K</xref>). We found that the ultrastructure of lysosomes changed dramatically in wild type at day 5. The proportion of dense vesicular lysosomes reduced sharply from 40% to 3.7% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3K</xref>). Lysosomes with both dense and lucent contents decreased markedly, and they did not extend tubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3K</xref>). Instead, the majority of hypodermal lysosomes at day 5 (81.4%) were lucent tubules that formed a tubular network, which is in good agreement with the observations by fluorescence microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1A,C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3G,K</xref>). In <italic>daf-2(e1370ts)</italic> mutants, most lysosomes at day 1 (70.8%) appeared as dense spherical vesicles that were significantly smaller than in wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H,L,M</xref>). In addition, vesicular lysosomes with both dense and lucent contents were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J,L</xref>). Importantly, the ultrastructure of lysosomes did not change obviously in <italic>daf-2</italic> worms at day 5, except for a slightly higher percentage of dense tubules (1.4% vs 7.1%) and a lower percentage of the dense-lucent vesicles (27.8% vs 17.1%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3L</xref>).

Our data indicate that lysosomes undergo a series of age-associated alterations in <italic>C. elegans</italic> including shape, size, motility, acidity and degradation activity, which suggest a decline in lysosomal function with age. We found that lysosomes are modulated by multiple longevity regulatory pathways, and lysosome function is essential for lifespan extension.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Various lysosomal properties are altered with age</title><p>Age-related increases in the number and size of lysosomes have been observed previously in several species such as <italic>Paramecium</italic>, nematodes and human cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sundararaman and Cummings, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Epstein, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lipetz and Cristofalo, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brandes et al., 1972</xref>). By employing cell biology assays, we found that lysosomes undergo a series of age-related changes including increased mean and total volume, and decreased motility, acidity and degradation activity. This indicates that the overall function of lysosomes declines with age, which explains in part the age-dependent decline in protein degradation described in various systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cuervo and Dice, 1998</xref>). We observed that lysosomal morphology changes dramatically with age, manifested as greatly increased tubular morphology and a concomitant decrease in vesicular lysosomes. Tubular structures have been observed in the lysosome reformation process when lysosomal contents are retrieved from phagolysosomes or autolysosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gan et al., 2019</xref>). Moreover, stimulation of macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs) with agonists including LPS leads to reorganization of lysosomes into a tubular network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hipolito et al., 2018</xref>). These lysosomal tubules may be induced to fulfil a variety of functions, such as expanding lysosomal volume, promoting phagosome maturation, cargo sorting and exchange, and helping delivery of peptide-loaded MHC-II molecules to the cell surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hipolito et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hipolito et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mantegazza et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Boes et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boes et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chow et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Vyas et al., 2007</xref>). In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, we found previously that catalytically active lysosomal tubules are formed during molting to promote cuticle replacement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Miao et al., 2020</xref>). In aged adults, however, lysosomal tubules are static and are not readily stained by LysoSensor Green (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1N,O</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1BâD</xref>). Lysosome degradation activity, indicated by CPL-1 processing, is obviously reduced in aged adults. Thus, the lysosomal tubules enriched in aged adults are probably catalytically inactive. The HVEM analyses revealed that young adult worms contain electron-lucent tubules emanating from electron-dense granules, consistent with retrieval and/or recycling of lysosomal contents through tubules. In aged worms, the vast majority of lysosomes are seen as electron-lucent tubules that form a tubular network, whereas very few dense vesicular lysosomes are present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G,K</xref>). It is possible that the lysosomal retrieval, cargo sorting and/or catabolite recycling processes occur inefficiently in aged adults, which leads to accumulation of catalytically inactive tubular lysosomal structures. Future studies are needed to understand how lysosomal tubules are formed in aging adults and whether and how they alter degradation, retrieval or recycling of lysosomal contents.</p><p>Consistent with changes in multiple lysosomal properties, we observed an age-related decline in the expression of 43 lysosome-related genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5AâC</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). This affects two main classes of lysosomal proteins, the cathepsin proteases (17 genes) and subunits of the proton pump V-ATPase (15 genes), which may account for the age-associated decline in lysosomal acidity and degradation. We observed that <italic>cpl-1</italic> gene expression declines, but the total CPL-1 protein level appears to increase with age in wild type. The increase in the total CPL-1 protein level is probably caused by reduced CPL-1 processing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2N</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4TâW</xref>) and a decline in CPL-1 protein turnover, consistent with the decline in lysosome activity in aging worms. In addition to decreased expression of 43 lysosome genes, 13 lysosome genes exhibit increased expression with age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). This may reflect a feed-back response caused by reduced lysosomal degradation with age as proposed previously in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">de MagalhÃ£es et al., 2009</xref>). Moreover, expression of 29 lysosome-related genes is unaltered in aging adults (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). Thus, the overall profile of lysosomal transcripts is obviously remodeled, but not all lysosomal gene expression patterns are altered during aging.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Lysosomes are modulated by multiple longevity pathways</title><p>We found that long-lived mutants representing three different longevity pathways all exhibited increased activity and better maintenance of lysosomes with age. Reducing IIS by the <italic>daf-2</italic> mutation suppresses age-associated lysosomal changes. <italic>daf-2</italic> lysosomes maintain their vesicular morphology, ultrastructure, high motility, acidity and degradation activity with age. The maintenance of lysosome activity with age is achieved at least in part through transcriptional regulation of lysosome genes. Loss of <italic>daf-16</italic> and <italic>skn-1</italic> reduces lysosome gene expression in <italic>daf-2</italic> and causes decreased lysosomal acidity and degradation activity. In addition to modulating lysosome gene expression, reducing IIS increases stress resistance and reduces cellular damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Shore and Ruvkun, 2013</xref>). This may reduce substrate loading into lysosomes and thus help to maintain lysosome activity with age. Consistent with this, we found previously that loss of <italic>daf-2</italic> increases stress resistance in the lysosome-defective mutant <italic>scav-3</italic> and suppresses the membrane integrity defects in <italic>scav-3</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Li et al., 2016</xref>). In addition to the IIS pathway, lysosomes are also modulated by caloric restriction and mitochondrial pathways. In the feeding-defective mutant <italic>eat-2</italic> and the mitochondrial mutant <italic>isp-1</italic>, appearance of age-related lysosomal changes is suppressed or delayed, and lysosome gene expression is increased. Thus, lysosomes may serve as a common target of multiple longevity pathways. Notably, only 2 out of the 43 lysosomal genes that are downregulated with age are targeted by all three pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). The IIS and caloric restriction pathways seem to target different sets of lysosome genes, whereas genes upregulated in <italic>isp-1</italic> mutants are mostly shared with the IIS pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). Future studies are needed to understand why and how lysosomal genes are selectively regulated by different pathways.</p><p>We identified DAF-16 and SKN-1 as key factors involved in modulating lysosome gene expression by multiple longevity pathways. By contrast, PHA-4 and HIF-1, the key downstream effectors of the caloric restriction and mitochondrial pathways, respectively, are dispensable for lysosome regulation. DAF-16 is reported to regulate lysosomal pH in the intestine in response to the reproductive cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baxi et al., 2017</xref>). In this process, DAF-16 is activated by the DAF-9/Cytochrome P450 and DAF-12/Vitamin D receptor steroid signaling pathway in the gonad, which leads to increased expression of V-ATPase genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baxi et al., 2017</xref>). In addition, microarray analyses identified several <italic>vha</italic> genes that are upregulated by SKN-1 under non-stress conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Oliveira et al., 2009</xref>). Here we found that loss of <italic>daf-16</italic> and <italic>skn-1</italic> reduces expression of lysosome genes that encode membrane proteins, hydrolases and V-ATPase subunits in <italic>daf-2</italic> and <italic>isp-1</italic>, and these two mutations affect lysosomal acidity and/or degradation activity in a non-additive manner. This suggests that DAF-16 and SKN-1 act in concert to modulate lysosome activity in response to reduced IIS and impaired mitochondrial function. On the other hand, DAF-16 and SKN-1 appear to act in parallel to maintain expression of <italic>vha-12</italic> and <italic>vha-5</italic> in <italic>eat-2</italic> mutants, and loss of their function affects the acidity of <italic>eat-2</italic> lysosomes in an additive manner. Further studies are needed to understand how DAF-16 and SKN-1 cooperate to modulate lysosome gene expression in different conditions.</p><p>The TFEB ortholog HLH-30 influences lifespan extension by multiple pathways via its role in autophagy and lipophagy, but its functions are highly context-dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">O'Rourke and Ruvkun, 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lapierre et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dall and FÃ¦rgeman, 2019</xref>). It was reported recently that DAF-16 and HLH-30 act as a complex to co-regulate longevity-promoting genes in IIS mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lin et al., 2018</xref>). Consistent with this, we found that expression of 6 lysosomal hydrolase genes in <italic>daf-2</italic> is reduced by loss of <italic>hlh-30</italic> and 5 of them are also targeted by DAF-16. The other 8 DAF-16-regulated lysosome genes are not affected by <italic>hlh-30</italic> mutation. The lysosome degradation activity in <italic>daf-2</italic> worms, however, seems to be unaffected by <italic>hlh-30</italic> mutation, and is higher in <italic>daf-16;daf-2;hlh-30</italic> than in <italic>daf-16;daf-2</italic>. We suspect that loss of <italic>hlh-30</italic> causes a decrease in the autophagy level, which may have a beneficial effect on lysosomal activity due to reduced cargo loading into lysosomes.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Lysosome function is essential for lifespan extension</title><p>Our data indicate that lysosome function is essential for lifespan extension induced by multiple mechanisms. Maintenance of lysosome activity and dynamics may promote degradation of lipids, misfolded proteins and damaged organelles, which all accumulate with age. Notably, autophagy capacity declines with age in several species, which may be attributed to impaired activation and progression of autophagy and/or a decline in degradation of autophagic cargo in lysosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hansen et al., 2018</xref>). On the other hand, autophagy activity increases in multiple long-lived mutants and is important for lifespan extension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">MelÃ©ndez et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hansen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lapierre et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">TÃ³th et al., 2008</xref>). It is conceivable that longevity pathways upregulate the functionality of both autophagy and lysosomes to achieve efficient cellular clearance for lifespan extension. However, autophagy and lysosomes may be differentially regulated by longevity pathways. For example, DAF-16 is not required for the increased level of autophagy in <italic>daf-2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hansen et al., 2008</xref>), but is important for lysosome regulation. Moreover, PHA-4 is required for the elevated autophagy in <italic>eat-2</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hansen et al., 2008</xref>), but is dispensable for the upregulation of lysosomal activity. mTORC1 inhibits autophagy activity but is important for lysosomal tubulation in the reformation process and for LPS-induced tubulation of lysosomes in macrophages and DCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Saric et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hipolito et al., 2019</xref>). Inhibition of TORC1 has no effect on either appearance or enrichment of tubular lysosomes in aged <italic>C. elegans</italic> (our unpublished results). Thus, TORC1 activity may not be required for age-associated lysosomal tubule formation in worms. Future investigations are needed to understand how lysosomes are reshaped during aging and how the regulation of lysosomes and autophagy is coordinated in different longevity-promoting pathways. It is worth noting that in our study, the age-associated alterations in lysosomal morphology, motility and acidity were mainly examined in hypodermal and intestinal cells, which are big and amenable to cell biology analysis. We have not been able to examine the age-related changes in lysosomal properties in small-sized cells such as neurons. Further studies are required to understand whether lysosomes make tissue-specific contributions to aging and lifespan extension.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"

yeast. Taking advantage of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> mutants that have increased lifespan, this paper provides convincing evidence that long-living mutants retain lysosome function during aging, unlike their wild-type counterparts. Indeed, increased lifespan of these mutants was reduced upon disruption of lysosome function, suggesting that maintenance of lysosomal activity is required for lifespan extension. The authors demonstrate that expression of lysosomal genes including, cathepsins and V-ATPases is regulated by transcription factors that act downstream of multiple longevity pathways. This study lays the groundwork towards future research in understanding how organelle composition and function changes during aging and the impact of these on organismal lifespan.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Lysosome activity is modulated by multiple longevity pathways and is important for lifespan extension in <italic>C. elegans</italic>&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by David Ron as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In their manuscript, Sun et al. present findings that aging in <italic>C. elegans</italic> leads to reduced acidity, degradative capacity, and motility of lysosomes, as well as transition from vesicular to tubular lysosomes. Interestingly, long-living <italic>C. elegans</italic> mutants (<italic>daf-2</italic>, <italic>eat-2</italic> and <italic>isp-1</italic>) resist this abatement in lysosome function, providing a correlation between longevity and lysosome activity. The authors find that expression of lysosome-related genes (prominent among these are V-ATPases and cathepsins) is reduced with aging. Transcription factors DAF-16/FOXO and SKN-1/NRF2 were required for maintaining lysosomal gene expression and lysosome function in the long-lived mutants. Finally, the authors show that long-living mutants have a higher propensity to clear protein aggregates and that this depended on DAF-16 or SKN-1. Consistent with the idea that lysosome function declines with age, disruption of lysosome function reduced the lifespan of <italic>C. elegans</italic> and &quot;cancelled&quot; the long lifespan of long-living mutants such as <italic>daf-2</italic>.</p><p>Overall, this is a very interesting study, well written and timely that reveals age-associated decline in lysosomal function and the protective effects of longevity mechanisms against this decline.</p><p>The reviewers raise few concerns that must be adequately addressed before the paper can be accepted for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. The reviewers have also suggested changes in manuscript text to avoid extrapolation of the findings presented in the manuscript. Some of the revisions require additional experimentation within the scope of the presented studies and techniques.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Referring to lysosome tubulation as a process of lysosome reformation is problematic, as lysosome tubulation may be a reformation process (as described in Yu et al.) or could also be part of other types of lysosome dynamics that mediate cargo exchange, sorting of cargo, and or other types of function. For example, mammalian macrophages and dendritic cells exposed to LPS become highly tubular (Vyas et al., 2007; and Saric et al., 2016), while tubules form between phagosomes to help mediate cargo exchange (Mantegazza et al., 2014). Additionally, Hipolito et al., 2020, shows that lysosomes undergo remodelling both in shape, size, and the transcription profile encoding lysosomal transcripts in response to macrophage activation. This is not likely an issue of lysosome reformation. Thus, the authors should alter the text to be more nuanced in relation to lysosome tubulation. Please avert referring to tubular lysosomes as &quot;reforming&quot; or &quot;pre-reforming&quot; â this is strictly an assumption at this stage and the authors provide no evidence to support this.</p><p>2) The authors mention in the Discussion &quot;the lysosomal tubules in aged adults are static and are not readily stained by LysoSensor Green&quot; indicating that &quot;the lysosomal tubules enriched in aged adults are probably catalytically inactive&quot;. This should be investigated and quantification of LysoSensor Green staining in tubular lysosomes should be presented.</p><p>3) Figure 4A-L should include quantification of tubular lysosome length. It is also unclear how the tubules for quantification were chosen (Materials and methods) and more details should be provided in the Materials and methods section.</p><p>4) The conclusions on the degradation capacity of lysosomes are mostly based on processing of protein substrate Nuc1-Cherry and CPL-1 processing. Thus, testing lysosomal degradative ability during aging by analysis of an endogenous cargo could be an important addition to the results. If probes such as Magic Red and/or DQ-BSA permeate through <italic>C. elegans</italic> surface, they can be also used to analyze lysosomal degradation capacity.</p><p>5) The authors also need to be more careful about referring to lysosome changes as en block. The manuscript text describes the changes to lysosomes caused by aging, long-living mutants, and those driven by <italic>daf-16</italic>/SKN1 as if all aspects of lysosome function and identity changed. This is clearly not the case as indicated by the RNA expression data presented in the manuscript. While a large number of transcripts encoding lysosomal proteins are reduced with age, there is a substantial number that increase or is unchanged. This is also true for all conditions they examined. In the revised version, the authors should include all lysosomal transcripts that have been analyzed in the supplementary files (and not only the transcripts whose levels are reduced). The findings presented here suggest that lysosomes are remodelled in some way but do not necessarily indicate total disruption of lysosomal function. The authors are thus asked to discuss with greater nuance this issue and to reflect this in the Abstract. This will avoid giving the impression that the lysosomes in their entirety are changing â certainly; this is not supported by their data.</p><p>6) The authors have employed mutants lacking CUP-5 and CPL-1 activity to conclude that lifespan extension in <italic>C. elegans</italic> requires lysosome function. However, whether decline in lysosomal function during aging is comparable to what is observed in the <italic>cup-5</italic> and <italic>cpl-1</italic> mutants is not clear. This can be addressed by functional assays such as cathepsin processing, LSG/LTR ratio tested in any one of the mutants (<italic>cup-5</italic>/<italic>cpl-1</italic>) and compared with worms at day 9.</p><p>7) The authors have shown that ratio of lysosensor to lysotracker is reduced in aging worms, indicating that lysosome become less acidic (Figure 2I). Further the pHTomato experiments also indicate that pH is less acidic in aged worms. It would be very informative if the authors can measure the actual pH of lysosomal compartments to understand the magnitude of pH change during aging. If the lysosomal pH measurement is not feasible in this model system, the findings with the pHTomato probe should be complemented with data that directly report pH change such the LSG/LTR ratio. The latter experiment can be added to Figure 6.</p><p>8) The discussion on metabolism and role in aging and lysosome function begs the question on what happens to mTORC1 activity. Do the long-living mutants have lower mTORC1 activity? If so, could this help explain lower tubulation in long-living <italic>C. elegans</italic>. This may be connected to mTOR modulation of lysosome tubulation and remodelling in mammalian macrophages exposed to LPS (Saric et al., 2016; Hipolito et al., 2020). If nothing else, this possibility could be discussed.</p><p>9) Figure 9C and G, the images of NMY-2::GFP do not appear to be representative for the quantification result shown Figure 9I. Further, NMY-2 GFP appears cytosolic in <italic>daf-2cup-5</italic> mutant (Figure 9H). It is not clear how the authors have quantified punctae (Figure 9K) in this mutant when so much of the protein appears cytosolic.</p><p>10) Total CPL-1 protein levels are increased upon aging in WT (Figures 2N and 4S) but, qPCR results in Figure 5C show reduced <italic>cpl-1</italic> expression at day 5. The authors should provide possible explanation for this difference (for instance, comment upon the CPL-1 protein stability).</p><p>11) From the data shown in Figures 5, 6 and 7, are there any common lysosomal genes that are upregulated in all the three longevity mutants while a corresponding decrease is observed in older worms. These should be highlighted and discussed in the Results.</p><p>12) The end of the Discussion is a bit abrupt. The authors can probably restate the importance of the findings and also it would be of service to the community to highlight specific caveats and shortcomings of the study to avoid excessive extrapolation in future interpretations.</p><p>13) For quantification and statistical analysis of the data, it is not clear to this reviewer if the authors examined all animals for a specific &quot;read-out&quot; in one day or during independent days. For example, the authors state &quot;At least 10 worms were quantified in each strain at each stage&quot; when describing the method to measure tubule length. Were 10 animals all done in one day or over different days? This comment applies elsewhere and it is important to know.</p><p>14) For quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) experiments, it is not clear whether RNA was pooled from multiple worms and if so please state the number.</p><p>15) For quantification of NMY-2::GFP intensity experiment, reasoning for using 20 worms for quantification at day 1 and 50 worms at day 5 is not clear.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.55745.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Referring to lysosome tubulation as a process of lysosome reformation is problematic, as lysosome tubulation may be a reformation process (as described in Yu et al.) or could also be part of other types of lysosome dynamics that mediate cargo exchange, sorting of cargo, and or other types of function.

Consistent with staining in the intestine (Figure 2 A-Dââ, I), we found that the fluorescence intensity ratio of LSG/LTR in hypodermal vesicular lysosomes is reduced significantly at day 5 (Figure 2âfigure supplement 1A-Aââ, C, revised manuscript). Moreover, the percentage of LTR-positive vesicular lysosomes stained by LSG is decreased at day 5 compared with day 1 (Figure 2âfigure supplement 1A-Aââ, C, revised manuscript). The lysosomal tubules in the hypodermis at day 5, however, were not stained by LSG and only weakly labeled by LTR (Figure 2âfigure supplement 1B-Bââ, D, revised manuscript). These data suggest that tubular lysosomal structures may be less acidic than the vesicular ones. These data are presented in Figure 2âfigure supplement 1 in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Figure 4A-L should include quantification of tubular lysosome length.

As suggested by the reviewer, these data are now presented in Figure 4M in the revised manuscript. To quantify tubular lysosome length, confocal fluorescence images of hypodermal lysosomes were taken, and individual lysosomal tubules were selected for quantification. If one lysosomal tubule crossed over another tubule, they were counted as two individual tubules. The length of each lysosomal tubule was quantified by Image J. In the original manuscript, 5 tubules were scored in each animal and 20 animals in total were quantified in each strain at each age. The results were presented in a scatter diagram (Supplementary Figure 3A in the original manuscript). In this diagram, each dot represents the average length of 5 lysosomal tubules in one animal and in total 20 dots (20 animals) were shown in each strain at each age. In the revised manuscript, we increased the sample size. We scored 10 individual lysosomal tubules in each animal and quantified 20 animals in each strain at each age. In the scatter diagram shown in Figures 1I and 4M in the revised manuscript, each dot represents the length of one individual tubule, and in total 200 dots (which represent the lengths of 200 tubules) are shown in each strain at each age. We have explained in detail how the lysosomal tubules are selected and quantified in the Materials and methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The conclusions on the degradation capacity of lysosomes are mostly based on processing of protein substrate Nuc1-Cherry and CPL-1 processing. Thus, testing lysosomal degradative ability during aging by analysis of an endogenous cargo could be an important addition to the results. If probes such as Magic Red and/or DQ-BSA permeate through C. elegans surface, they can be also used to analyze lysosomal degradation capacity.</p></disp-quote><p>We understand the concern raised by the reviewers and agree that analysis of an endogenous lysosomal cargo is important for examining lysosomal degradation ability. In fact, we have tested several possibilities and found that NUC-1::CHERRY cleavage and CPL-1 processing are reliable assays for analyzing lysosomal degradation activity in <italic>C. elegans</italic>.</p><p>1) Magic Red and DQ-BSA are both protein substrates cleaved by cathepsins in lysosomes and are widely used to indicate lysosomal degradation activity in mammalian cells. They were also our first choice for testing lysosome degradation ability in worms. We have tried multiple ways to deliver the probes to lysosomes in live <italic>C. elegans</italic>. Unfortunately, none of the attempts worked. We cannot see Magic Red signal in worms by soaking or injection. DQ-BSA is not taken up efficiently by <italic>C. elegans</italic> even at high concentrations.</p><p>2) As we failed to use Magic Red or DQ-BSA as the lysosomal probe, we sought to find</p><p><italic>C. elegans</italic> substrates whose cleavage in lysosomes can be followed directly and quantified to indicate lysosomal activity. Lysosomes degrade cargo delivered via endocytosis, phagocytosis or autophagy. As lysosomal degradation of phagocytic cargo, such as apoptotic cells, is difficult to follow and quantify directly, we focused on endocytic and autophagic cargoes. LGG-1 is a <italic>C. elegans</italic> homolog of Atg8/LC3, which associates with autophagic structures and intact autophagosomes that are delivered to lysosomes. We previously generated a single-copy insertion strain of GFP::LGG-1 by CRISPR-Cas9, in which GFP::LGG-1 is expressed at an endogenous level (Liu, et al., JCB 2018). By using this strain, we tested whether release of GFP from GFP::LGG-1, detected by Western blot, can be used to indicate lysosome degradation activity. As shown in Author response image 1, using whole worm lysates probed with anti-GFP antibodies, we observed processing of GFP::LGG-1 and release of free GFP. We found that GFP accumulates at a significantly higher level in the lysosome-defective mutants <italic>cup-5</italic> and <italic>cpl-1</italic> than in wild type (Author response image 1A, lanes 6 and 7 compared with lane 1, B). By contrast, no GFP accumulation was observed in <italic>epg-6</italic> mutants that block autophagosome formation (Author response image 1A, lane 5, B). These results suggest that GFP::LGG-1 is delivered to lysosomes through autophagy, followed by release and degradation of GFP in lysosomes. However, as the free GFP level is affected by both autophagy and lysosome activity, GFP release and/or degradation cannot be simply used to indicate lysosome degradation ability. This issue is particularly important when lysosome activity is analyzed during aging and in long-lived mutants. It is reported that autophagy activity declines with age but increases in long-lived <italic>daf-2</italic> worms (Chang et al., <italic>eLife</italic> 2017; Lapierre et al., Curr Biol., 2011; Melendez et al., 2003). We indeed observed reduced GFP accumulation in <italic>daf-2</italic> worms (Author response image 1A, lane 2, B), consistent with increased lysosome activity. However, it is unclear whether and how changes in autophagy contribute to the free GFP level in <italic>daf-2</italic>. In addition, GFP accumulation is reduced in <italic>isp-1</italic> but is unaltered in <italic>eat-2</italic> (Author response image 1A, lanes 3 and 4, B). Whether the changes in <italic>isp-1</italic> worms are caused by changes in autophagy, lysosome or both remains unclear.</p><p>3) Finally, we turned to cargoes delivered to lysosomes via the endocytic pathway. We considered that lysosomal hydrolases are probably the best candidates for this purpose because they are in fact endocytic cargoes destinated for lysosomes. To probe lysosomal activity, we utilized monomeric CHERRY fused to NUC-1, a lysosomal DNase II. The fluorescent protein CHERRY is not quenched in acidic conditions and is thus visible in lysosomes. Moreover, CHERRY can be cleaved from the fusion protein by lysosomal hydrolases, which requires the 11 N-terminal residues of CHERRY (Huang et al., PLOS one, 2014). Unlike GFP which is degraded fast in lysosomes, CHERRY is quite stable in lysosomes. Thus, the level of free CHERRY cleaved from NUC-1::CHERRY can be quantified to indicate lysosome degradation ability. In the previous study, we showed that CHERRY cleavage from NUC-1::CHERRY reduces in <italic>cup-5</italic>, which is defective in lysosomal degradation (Miao et al., 2020). Moreover, CHERRY cleavage increases significantly at molt when lysosomes are upregulated (Miao et al., 2020). In addition to NUC-1::CHERRY, which is expressed from multi-copy insertions, we tested whether processing of cathepsin L (CPL-1), which can be detected by anti-CPL-1 antibodies, may serve as a probe of lysosomal activity at an endogenous level. When delivered to lysosomes via endocytic transport, pro-CPL-1 is converted to the active mature form through proteolytic removal of the pro-domain in an autocatalytic manner or by other cathepsins (Stoka, Turk and Turk, 2016). Thus, processing of pro-CPL-1 to mature CPL-1 can be used to indicate lysosome degradation ability. In line with the NUC-1::CHERRY cleavage assay, CPL-1 processing is reduced significantly in <italic>cup-5</italic> mutants, consistent with defects in lysosome degradation activity (Figure 9âfigure supplement 1). Moreover, <italic>cpl-1</italic> gene expression is not altered in the long-lived <italic>daf-2</italic>, <italic>eat-2</italic> and <italic>isp-1</italic> worms, which makes CPL-1 processing a suitable assay to examine lysosome activity in these mutants.</p><p>Currently, we are not aware of other endogenous cargoes whose delivery to and degradation in lysosomes have been clearly studied in worms. We will continue to optimize both NUC-1::CHERRY and CPL-1 processing assays and to develop other probes to examine lysosome degradation activity in <italic>C. elegans</italic>.</p><fig id="sa2fig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Examination of GFP::LGG-1 cleavage and degradation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Western blot analysis of GFP::LGG-1 cleavage and degradation.

The manuscript text describes the changes to lysosomes caused by aging, long-living mutants, and those driven by daf-16/SKN1 as if all aspects of lysosome function and identity changed. This is clearly not the case as indicated by the RNA expression data presented in the manuscript. While a large number of transcripts encoding lysosomal proteins are reduced with age, there is a substantial number that increase or is unchanged. This is also true for all conditions they examined. In the revised version, the authors should include all lysosomal transcripts that have been analyzed in the supplementary files (and not only the transcripts whose levels are reduced). The findings presented here suggest that lysosomes are remodelled in some way but do not necessarily indicate total disruption of lysosomal function. The authors are thus asked to discuss with greater nuance this issue and to reflect this in the Abstract. This will avoid giving the impression that the lysosomes in their entirety are changing â certainly; this is not supported by their data.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for not explaining our results more clearly in the original manuscript.</p><p>In the original manuscript, data for all 85 tested lysosome transcripts were included in the supplementary files.

However, whether decline in lysosomal function during aging is comparable to what is observed in the cup-5 and cpl-1 mutants is not clear. This can be addressed by functional assays such as cathepsin processing, LSG/LTR ratio tested in any one of the mutants (cup-5/cpl-1) and compared with worms at day 9.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by the reviewer, we examined the acidity and degradation activity of lysosomes in <italic>cup-5</italic> by LSG/LTR and CPL-1 processing assays.

CPL-1 processing was also reduced significantly in <italic>cup-5</italic> compared with wild type and the reduction was observed at all adult ages that were tested (days 1, 3, 5, 9) (Figure 9âfigure supplement 1Y, Z).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The authors have shown that ratio of lysosensor to lysotracker is reduced in aging worms, indicating that lysosome become less acidic (Figure 2I). Further the pHTomato experiments also indicate that pH is less acidic in aged worms. It would be very informative if the authors can measure the actual pH of lysosomal compartments to understand the magnitude of pH change during aging. If the lysosomal pH measurement is not feasible in this model system, the findings with the pHTomato probe should be complemented with data that directly report pH change such the LSG/LTR ratio. The latter experiment can be added to Figure 6.</p></disp-quote><p>The measurement of lysosomal pH is not feasible in live <italic>C. elegans</italic>. We performed the LSG/LTR staining assay as suggested by the reviewer to further support the pHTomato assay. These new data are presented in Figure 6L, Figure 6âfigure supplement 1C-Jââ, Figure 7L and Figure 8L in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) The discussion on metabolism and role in aging and lysosome function begs the question on what happens to mTORC1 activity. Do the long-living mutants have lower mTORC1 activity? If so, could this help explain lower tubulation in long-living C. elegans. This may be connected to mTOR modulation of lysosome tubulation and remodelling in mammalian macrophages exposed to LPS (Saric et al., 2016; Hipolito et al., 2020). If nothing else, this possibility could be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>The TOR signaling pathway regulates longevity in multiple species and inhibition of TOR extends lifespan in model organisms including yeast, <italic>C. elegans,</italic> fruit flies and mice. The TOR pathway has been shown to link to other longevity pathways such as Insulin/IGF-1 signaling (IIS) and dietary restriction (DR). However, it has not been tested directly whether TOR activity alters in long-lived <italic>C. elegans</italic> mutants. On the other hand, mTOR is important for lysosomal tubulation in the reformation process (Yu et al., 2010), and is required for LPS-induced lysosome remodeling in macrophages and dendritic cells (Saric et al., 2016; Hipolito et al., 2019). As suggested by the reviewer, we examined whether TOR is involved in forming lysosomal tubules in aged <italic>C. elegans</italic> adults. We found that knockdown of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> TORC1 components LET-363/mTOR, DAF-15/Raptor or C10H11.8/mLST8 had no effect on lysosomal tubules in adult hypodermis at day 5, while the length of lysosomal tubules in <italic>let-363</italic> RNAi and <italic>daf-15</italic> RNAi worms increased at day 1 (Author response image 2A-J). Moreover, inactivation of <italic>let-363</italic> by RNAi did not affect lysosome tubules in long-lived mutants <italic>daf-2</italic>, <italic>eat-2</italic> and <italic>isp-1</italic> (Author response image 2K-Q). Thus, TORC1 activity may not be required for age-associated lysosomal tubule formation in worms. We have discussed this point in the revised manuscript.</p><fig id="sa2fig2"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Knockdown of <italic>C. elegans</italic> TORC1 components does not disrupt lysosomal tubule formation in aged adults.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) List of TORC1 components that are tested.
