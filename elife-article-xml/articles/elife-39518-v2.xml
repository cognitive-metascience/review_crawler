and transport by binding to specific tRNAs and sensing their aminoacylation state. While the T-box modular structural elements that recognize different parts of a tRNA have been identified, the kinetic trajectory describing how these interactions are established temporally remains unclear. Using smFRET, we demonstrate that tRNA binds to the riboswitch in two steps, first anticodon recognition followed by the sensing of the 3’ NCCA end, with the second step accompanied by a T-box riboswitch conformational change. Studies on site-specific mutants highlight that specific T-box structural elements drive the two-step binding process in a modular fashion. Our results set up a kinetic framework describing tRNA binding by T-box riboswitches, and suggest such binding mechanism is kinetically beneficial for efficient, co-transcriptional recognition of the cognate tRNA ligand.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.39518.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Living organisms depend upon a group of chemicals called amino acids to survive. Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins, and proteins have many important roles within and around cells. Bacteria regulate certain genes to ensure they have the right balance of different amino acids to survive. By controlling the availability of certain proteins that help them to make or collect certain amino acids, bacteria can control their overall amino acid balance.</p><p>Before a protein is made, a molecular machine called RNA polymerase must first copy the information in a gene to make a molecule called a messenger RNA (mRNA). The mRNA is then translated to make the protein from individual amino acids. In this process, each amino acid needs to be first attached to another molecule called a transfer RNA (tRNA). In many bacteria species, the mRNAs involved in making or transporting amino acids contain structures called T-boxes. These structures guide the RNA polymerase to make more of the mRNAs when the levels of the amino acid become too low. A T-box, however, does not sense the level of the amino acid directly. Instead it senses the number of tRNA molecules that do not carry an amino acid.</p><p>Zhang, Chetnani et al. examined a particular T-box interacting with tRNA using pairs of fluorescent dyes to detect distances between molecules. The T-box first recognizes a part of the tRNA called the anticodon to make sure it binds the correct type of tRNA. It then changes its shape to detect whether the tRNA is attached to an amino acid. This two-step process is driven by multiple structural elements within the T-box, and the flexibility of the T-box plays a critical role.</p><p>A cell’s survival depends on it keeping amino acid levels under control. Understanding how bacteria do this could lead to new antibiotic drugs that target the T-box to kill cells. This study also provides insights into the workings of mRNA components like T-boxes – a type of riboswitch – which is an unusual means of controlling gene activity.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>riboswitch</kwd><kwd>T-box</kwd><kwd>smFRET</kwd><kwd>gene regulation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>B. subtilis</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001032</institution-id><institution>Chicago Community Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mondragón</surname><given-names>Alfonso</given-names></name><name><surname>Fei</surname><given-names>Jingyi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The glycine T-box riboswitch recognizes tRNAgly and senses its aminoacylation state by first interacting with the anticodon region and subsequently probing the 3' end of the ligand using both specific structural elements and conformational dynamics.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Riboswitches are <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory RNA elements that recognize and respond to defined external signals to affect transcription or translation of downstream messenger RNAs (mRNAs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Breaker, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Serganov and Nudler, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sherwood and Henkin, 2016</xref>). Riboswitches generally consist of two domains: a sensory or aptamer domain and a regulatory domain or expression platform. The expression platform can adopt different conformations in response to ligand binding to the aptamer, and in this way control gene expression outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Breaker, 2012</xref>). The aptamer of each riboswitch class contains conserved sequence motifs and unique secondary or tertiary structural elements that help distinguish and bind specific ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">McCown et al., 2017</xref>). Bacterial T-box riboswitches represent a unique class of riboswitches that do not bind small molecule ligands, instead they recognize and bind tRNA molecules and sense directly their aminoacylation state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zhang and Ferré-D'Amaré, 2015</xref>). T-box riboswitches serve as excellent paradigms to understand RNA-RNA interactions and RNA-based regulation.</p><p>T-box riboswitches are found in Gram-positive bacteria and are usually located in the region upstream of mRNA sequences encoding aminoacyl tRNA synthetases and proteins involved in amino acid biosynthesis and transport and hence participate directly in amino acid homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zhang and Ferré-D'Amaré, 2015</xref>). In general, the aptamer domain of all T-box riboswitches contains a long stem, Stem I, responsible for specific tRNA binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rollins et al., 1997</xref>). The expression platform can adopt either a terminator or anti-terminator conformation, depending on whether the bound tRNA is charged or uncharged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Henkin, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zhang and Ferré-D'Amaré, 2015</xref>). In most T-box riboswitches, binding of a charged tRNA to the T-box leads to rho independent transcription termination whereas an uncharged tRNA stabilizes the anti-terminator conformation and leads to transcription read-through (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Henkin, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zhang and Ferré-D'Amaré, 2015</xref>). Whereas Stem I and the anti-terminator domain are highly conserved among T-box riboswitches, the region connecting them can vary. The <italic>Bacillus subtilis glyQS</italic> T-box riboswitch, involved in glycine regulation, represents one of the simplest T-box riboswitches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Grundy et al., 2002b</xref>) in which only a short linker and a small stem, Stem III, connect Stem I and the anti-terminator domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.39518.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Secondary and tertiary structures of <italic>B. subtilis glyQS</italic> T-box riboswitch and tRNA<sup>Gly</sup>.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Secondary structure diagrams of the <italic>B. subtilis glyQS</italic> T-box riboswitch and <italic>B. subtilis</italic> tRNA<sup>Gly</sup> used in this study.

The anticodon and elbow regions of the tRNA interact with Stem I directly. Stem I contains several phylogenetically conserved structural motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rollins et al., 1997</xref>), including a K-turn motif, a specifier loop, a distal bulge, and an apical loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rollins et al., 1997</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Bioinformatics and structural analyses have collectively revealed the interactions between Stem I and the tRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Grigg et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lehmann et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zhang and Ferré-D'Amaré, 2013</xref>). Specifically, the co-crystal structures of Stem I/tRNA complexes show that Stem I flexes to follow closely the tRNA anticodon stem and interacts directly with the anticodon loop and the elbow through its proximal and distal ends, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zhang and Ferré-D'Amaré, 2013</xref>). The distal bulge and the apical loop fold into a compact structural module of interdigitated T-loops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Krasilnikov and Mondragón, 2003</xref>), which interact directly with conserved unstacked nucleobases at the tRNA elbow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Grigg et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zhang and Ferré-D'Amaré, 2013</xref>). In addition, the structures revealed that Stem I turns sharply around two hinge regions using a conserved dinucleotide bulge and the K-turn motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Grigg and Ke, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zhang and Ferré-D'Amaré, 2013</xref>). Sensing of the aminoacylation state involves direct binding of the tRNA 3’ end to a highly conserved bulge in the T-box, the t-box sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Grundy et al., 2002a</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). A free NCCA end can base pair with the t-box sequence, enabling the anti-terminator conformation, whereas a charged NCCA end prevents the formation of the NCCA/t-box interactions, leading to the more stable terminator conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Henkin, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zhang and Ferré-D'Amaré, 2015</xref>). Importantly, discrimination between the charged and uncharged tRNA does not require any additional proteins, such as EF-Tu (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Suddala et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zhang and Ferré-D'Amaré, 2014</xref>), and is driven solely by RNA/RNA interactions.</p><p>While Small Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS)-derived models of the entire <italic>B. subtilis glyQS</italic> T-box riboswitch in complex with tRNA are available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chetnani and Mondragón, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fang et al., 2017</xref>), atomic-level structural details on the interactions between tRNA and the anti-terminator region are still lacking. In addition, there is a dearth of information on the kinetics of the binding process. Whereas it is clear that tRNA recognition involves several specific interactions, their binding temporal sequence remains elusive. In addition, it is unclear whether sensing of the 3’ end of the tRNA involves any additional conformational changes in the T-box. Here, by introducing donor-acceptor fluorophore pairs at several locations in the tRNA and the T-box riboswitch, and using single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (smFRET), we demonstrate the temporal order of events in the trajectory of tRNA binding. Our results demonstrate that tRNA binds to the riboswitch in two steps, with its anticodon being recognized first, followed by NCCA binding accompanied with an inward motion of the 3’ region of the T-box riboswitch, including Stem III and the anti-terminator stem, relative to Stem I. In addition, by introducing mutations at different locations of the T-box, we further show that the two-step binding kinetics is regulated by the modular structural elements in the T-box riboswitch.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Binding of cognate tRNA by the <italic>glyQS</italic> T-box results in two distinct FRET states</title><p>To observe directly the binding of tRNA to the T-box, we placed the donor dye (Cy3) on the 3’ end of a T-box fragment (T-box<sub>182</sub>), and the acceptor dye (Cy5) on the 5’ end of the tRNA<sup>Gly</sup>, where the subscript ‘182’ denotes the length of the T-box construct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

T-box<sub>182</sub> spans Stem I, the linker sequence, Stem III and the anti-terminator, but does not contain the terminator sequence, thereby preventing the transition to the terminator conformation.

We did not observe any binding of tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup>-Cy5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), confirming that recognition of the anticodon by the specifier region is required for tRNA binding. In the presence of tRNA<sup>ΔNCCA</sup>-Cy5, we observed a fluctuating signal between 0.4 and 0 FRET (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,D</xref>), with a mean lifetime of the 0.4 FRET state of 3.6 ± 0.6 s and a mean waiting time before binding of 31.3 ± 5.3 s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Taken together with the results from the tRNA<sup>Gly</sup>, tRNA<sup>ΔNCCA</sup> and tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup> binding experiments, we assign the 0.4 FRET state to a partially bound state where only the anticodon interactions have been established.</p><p>To further confirm the assignment of the FRET states, we generated T-box<sub>149</sub>, where the anti-terminator sequence is truncated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Based on the structure model from the SAXS data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chetnani and Mondragón, 2017</xref>) we predicted that a Cy3 dye placed either at the end of Stem III (T-box<sub>149</sub>) or at the end of the anti-terminator stem (T-box<sub>182</sub>) are localized in close proximity in three dimensions, further confirmed by the distance measurement using smFRET (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). Therefore, we expect that if tRNA<sup>Gly</sup>-Cy5 can reach the same fully bound state in T-box<sub>149</sub> as in T-box<sub>182</sub>, a high FRET state centered at 0.7 would be observed. However, using T-box<sub>149</sub>-Cy3(3’) in combination with tRNA<sup>Gly</sup>-Cy5, we again observed transient binding of tRNA<sup>Gly</sup> with a FRET value centered at ~0.4 with the same mean lifetime as observed with the T-box<sub>182</sub>-Cy3(3’) and tRNA<sup>ΔNCCA</sup>-Cy5 combination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C</xref>). Therefore these two complexes (T-box<sub>182</sub> + tRNA<sup>ΔNCCA</sup> and T-box<sub>149</sub> + tRNA<sup>Gly</sup>) represent the same binding state of the tRNA, that is the state where binding of the anticodon to the specifier region has been established, but is unstable without the further interactions between the NCCA and the t-box region.</p><p>Collectively, our results suggest a two-step binding model involving the separate establishment of the interactions with the anticodon and the NCCA. The fact that tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup>, which has a mismatched anticodon, but contains an intact NCCA 3’ end, does not show any binding activity suggests that interactions with the anticodon precede the interactions with the NCCA end of the tRNA and are necessary for the establishment of the NCCA contacts. Without the interaction between the NCCA and the t-box sequence the binding of tRNA<sup>Gly</sup> is not stable. From the binding kinetics of tRNA<sup>ΔNCCA</sup>, we estimated the association rate constant (<italic>k</italic><sub>1</sub>) and the disassociation rate constant (<italic>k<sub>-</sub></italic><sub>1</sub>) for the first binding step to be (5.0 ± 1.6) x 10<sup>5</sup> M<sup>−1</sup>s<sup>−1</sup> and 0.28 ± 0.05 s<sup>−1</sup>, respectively (Figure 5; Figure 6E).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>The transition from anticodon recognition to NCCA binding is rapid for uncharged tRNA</title><p>We classified smFRET traces for T-box<sub>182</sub>-Cy3(3’) in complex with tRNA<sup>Gly</sup>-Cy5 into three types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>): (I) traces stably sampling the 0.7 state (79 ± 4% of total traces), (II) traces transiently transitioning from the 0.7 state to the 0.4 state (9 ± 5%), and (III) traces only sampling the 0.4 state without reaching 0.7 state (12 ± 5%). The low percentage of Type III traces indicates that once the anticodon is recognized, the commitment to the next binding step, NCCA interactions, is high. The majority of the traces showed that the tRNA<sup>Gly</sup> remained mostly in the fully bound state (Type I) until the fluorophore photobleached, with the actual lifetime limited by photobleaching (τ<sub>0.7</sub> &gt; 24 s, where τ<sub>0.7</sub> denotes the lifetime of the 0.7 FRET state) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>). The observation that tRNA<sup>Gly</sup> is able to transit from the fully bound state back to the partially bound state (Type II) suggests that the NCCA/t-box interaction can break occasionally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). We estimated the lifetime of the transiently sampled partially bound state to be 0.35 ± 0.09 s in the presence of full-length tRNA<sup>Gly</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>), ~10 fold shorter than the partially bound state in the presence of tRNA<sup>ΔNCCA</sup>.</p><p>While the majority of the T-box molecules were already bound to tRNA<sup>Gly</sup> before starting data acquisition, we could detect that some molecules show real-time binding during imaging acquisition. We observed only a few traces briefly sampling the 0.4 FRET state from the zero FRET (unbound) state before reaching the 0.7 FRET state, while most traces directly sampled the 0.7 FRET state without a detectable 0.4 FRET, likely due to our imaging time resolution (100 ms per frame). We post-synchronized the FRET traces at the transition point from the zero FRET state to the first sampled 0.4 FRET state, and plotted them in a time-evolved FRET histogram. From the time-evolved FRET histogram (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>), we estimated roughly that the upper limit of the lifetime spent at the 0.4 FRET state is ~100 ms, very rapidly followed by establishment of NCCA/t-box interactions. In contrast, tRNA<sup>ΔNCCA</sup> could not pass the 0.4 FRET state. To capture better real-time binding, we performed a flow experiment, where tRNA<sup>Gly</sup>-Cy5 was flowed into a chamber with immobilized T-box<sub>182</sub>-Cy3(3’) during imaging acquisition. The corresponding post-synchronized time-evolved FRET histogram again shows a fast transition into the fully bound state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>). In addition, the association rate constant of tRNA<sup>Gly</sup> in the real-time flow experiment is (7.5 ± 0.7) x 10<sup>5</sup> M<sup>−1</sup>s<sup>−1</sup>, consistent with the <italic>k</italic><sub>1</sub> of tRNA<sup>ΔNCCA</sup> and confirming that the NCCA end of the tRNA does not participate in the first binding step.</p><p>From the real-time binding kinetics of tRNA<sup>Gly</sup> to T-box<sub>182</sub>, we estimated a transition rate constant from the partially bound state to the fully bound state (<italic>k</italic><sub>2</sub>) to be on the order of 10 s<sup>−1</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>). On the other hand, as transitions back to the partially bound state from the fully bound state were only observed in ~10% traces, we interpreted this to mean that the reverse transition rate constant (<italic>k</italic><sub>-2</sub>) is very small, and the second binding step in the wild-type (WT) T-box with uncharged tRNA<sup>Gly</sup> is close to irreversible (Figure 5; Figure 6E and see Discussion).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Establishment of the NCCA/t-box interaction is accompanied by conformational changes in the T-box riboswitch</title><p>We next investigated whether tRNA binding requires any conformational changes in the T-box itself. Using doubly labeled T-box<sub>182</sub>, with Cy3 at the 3’ end and Cy5 at the 5’ hybridization extension, we observed a high FRET state (centered at ~0.75) in the absence of tRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Based on the structural model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chetnani and Mondragón, 2017</xref>), we estimated the distance between the 5’ and 3’ ends of the T-box<sub>182</sub> to be ~36 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Our measured FRET value is slightly less than the predicted FRET value (~0.90), likely due to the engineered 5’ extension sequence used to immobilize the T-box. No noticeable change was detected upon incubation with unlabeled tRNA<sup>Gly</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), indicating that the 3’ portion (Stem III plus the anti-terminator stem) does not move away from the 5’ portion (Stem I). Given that the measured FRET efficiency of 0.75 is already located beyond the FRET sensitive region, it is unlikely that any inward motion of the 3’ portion relative to the 5’ could be detected. To overcome this limitation, we added extensions at both the 3’ and 5’ ends (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). ITC experiments suggest that addition of a 5’ and/or a 3’ extension sequences to the T-box does not affect tRNA binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). With this intra-T-box FRET scheme, we observed a FRET shift from ~0.5 to~0.65 when tRNA<sup>Gly</sup> was added (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), indicating that the 3’ half of the T-box moves closer to the 5’ half, potentially with the T-box becoming more compact due to the presence of the cognate tRNA<sup>Gly</sup>. Adding non-cognate tRNA<sup>Phe</sup> or tRNA<sup>ΔNCCA</sup> gave similar FRET values as the T-box alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), suggesting that the conformational change is associated with binding of both the anticodon and NCCA, not with anticodon recognition alone (Figure 5).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.39518.017</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Conformational changes following tRNA binding in the <italic>glyQS</italic> T-box riboswitch revealed by an intra-T-box FRET pair.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Intra-T-box FRET scheme.

To ascertain whether the NCCA end of the tRNA also moves relative to the base of Stem I, we measured FRET between a Cy3 placed at the 5’ end of the T-box (T-box<sub>182</sub>-Cy3(5’)) and tRNA<sup>Gly</sup>-Cy5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Using this FRET pair, binding of both tRNA<sup>Gly</sup> and tRNA<sup>ΔNCCA</sup> generated a similar FRET value centered at ~0.35 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B,C</xref>). However, the FRET traces behaved differently for these two tRNA molecules. For tRNA<sup>ΔNCCA</sup>, the signal fluctuated between zero and 0.35 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), with a lifetime of the 0.35 FRET state of 4.5 ± 1.0 s, reminiscent of the 0.4 FRET state using the tRNA/T-box<sub>182</sub>-Cy3(3’) FRET pair (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).

To investigate the latter hypothesis, we generated a T-box mutant (T-box<sub>SIII-Δ4bp</sub>), in which four base pairs in Stem III are deleted to significantly shorten its length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). smFRET studies using T-box<sub>SIII-Δ4bp</sub>-Cy3(3’) with tRNA<sup>ΔNCCA</sup>-Cy5 and tRNA<sup>Gly</sup>-Cy5 revealed insignificant difference in overall kinetics in the first and second step bindings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C–E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>).

We disrupted the K-turn (T-box<sub>ΔKT</sub>) by changing the six bulged nucleotides to three nucleotides (UCA) to replace the K-turn with a three base pair stem (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). In contrast to binding of tRNA<sup>Gly</sup> to T-box<sub>182</sub>, binding to T-box<sub>ΔKT</sub> results in three FRET states centered on ~0.2, 0.4, and 0.7. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). While the exact boundary of each FRET state is difficult to determine accurately from the FRET histogram (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>), a transition density plot (TDP) clearly reveals interconversion between the 0.2, 0.4, and 0.7 states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>), with transitions between the 0.2 and 0.4 FRET states, and between the 0.4 and 0.7 FRET states more populated. Binding of tRNA<sup>ΔNCCA</sup>-Cy5 to T-box<sub>ΔKT</sub>, on the other hand, leads to the loss of population of the 0.7 state; however, both the 0.2 and 0.4 FRET states and fluctuations between these two states are frequently sampled (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3A,B</xref>).</p><p>Comparing the tRNA<sup>Gly</sup> and tRNA<sup>ΔNCCA</sup> binding, we speculate that both the 0.2 and 0.4 FRET states observed in the case of the T-box<sub>ΔKT</sub> represent the partially bound state in which only the anticodon and elbow are recognized. In contrast to T-box<sub>182</sub>, T-box<sub>ΔKT</sub>, with the K-turn replaced by an extension of Stem I, could potentially favor a relaxed conformation of Stem I, as observed in the NMR structure of an isolated K-turn and specifier loop domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wang and Nikonowicz, 2011</xref>), generating a lower FRET value centered at 0.2. However, the sampling of the 0.4 FRET state in the T-box<sub>ΔKT</sub> construct suggests that the interactions between the specifier and anticodon of the tRNA may transiently force open the extended base pair region and bend the T-box to adopt a similar conformation to the one observed in T-box<sub>182</sub>. The lifetimes of the 0.4 state before transition back to the 0.2 state and before transition forward to the 0.7 state are 0.30 ± 0.03 s and 0.13 ± 0.05 s, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3C</xref>), indicating that this forced bent state is energetically unfavorable. However, this 0.4 FRET state is very likely to be required for the NCCA/t-box interaction to occur, as in the presence of tRNA<sup>Gly</sup> the transitions from the 0.2 FRET to the 0.7 FRET state often pass through the 0.4 FRET state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Furthermore, we observed a small region in the TDP corresponding to direct transitions between the 0.2 and 0.7 states. Given the very short lifetime of the 0.4 state, which is close to the time resolution of our experiments, the 0.2 to 0.7 state transition is likely to represent populations whose 0.4 FRET state lifetime is even shorter than the time resolution of the experiment.</p><p>The 3-step kinetic scheme for tRNA binding to T-box<sub>ΔKT</sub> is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3C</xref>. The association rate constant <italic>k</italic><sub>1</sub> ((5.4 ± 2.9) x10<sup>4</sup> M<sup>−1</sup>s<sup>−1</sup>), estimated from binding of tRNA<sup>ΔNCCA</sup> to the T-box<sub>ΔKT</sub>, is ~9 fold smaller than binding to T-box<sub>182</sub>, suggesting that disruption of the K-turn affects anticodon recognition. Considering both the 0.2 and 0.4 FRET state as the partially bound state in T-box<sub>ΔKT</sub>, the apparent dissociation rate from the partially bound state <italic>k<sub>-</sub></italic><sub>1_app</sub> of tRNA<sup>ΔNCCA</sup> to T-box<sub>ΔKT</sub> is 0.21 ± 0.06 s<sup>−1</sup>, similar to that for T-box<sub>182</sub>, suggesting that disruption of the K-turn does not affect the stability of the partially bound state. The 0.7 FRET state observed for T-box<sub>ΔKT</sub> in the presence of tRNA<sup>Gly</sup> is consistent with the FRET value for the fully bound state in the WT T-box, indicating that the NCCA/t-box interactions in T-box<sub>ΔKT</sub> can still be formed. However, tRNA<sup>Gly</sup> bound to T-box<sub>ΔKT</sub> (τ<sub>0.7</sub> = 1.6±0.3 s) is at least 15-fold less stable compared to tRNA<sup>Gly</sup> bound to T-box<sub>182</sub> (τ<sub>0.7</sub> &gt;24 s). Furthermore, in contrast to the signal observed for tRNA<sup>Gly</sup> binding to T-box<sub>182</sub>, in which fewer than 10% of the FRET traces show transitions back to 0.4 FRET, in T-box<sub>ΔKT</sub> the vast majority of the traces show backward transitions to the 0.4 and 0.2 FRET states, contributing largely to the instability of the fully bound state. Based on the transition rates between 0.2, 0.4, and 0.7, we estimated the apparent forward (<italic>k</italic><sub>2_app</sub>) and reverse (<italic>k</italic><sub>-2_app</sub>) transition rates between the partially bound and the fully bound state of the T-box<sub>ΔKT</sub> to be 1.3 ± 0.3 s<sup>−1</sup> and 1.0 ± 0.3 s<sup>−1</sup>, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3C</xref>). The dramatically reduced <italic>k</italic><sub>2_app</sub> and increased <italic>k</italic><sub>-2_app</sub> in T-box<sub>ΔKT</sub> leads to a ~ 150 fold change in the equilibrium constant in the second binding step compared to T-box<sub>182</sub>, implying that inflexibility of the K-turn region largely inhibits the conformational change in the T-box required to form the NCCA/t-box interaction, and strongly destabilizes the fully bound state.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>T-box riboswitches represent a unique class of riboswitches as they recognize a macromolecule and require interactions at multiple spatially separated sites on the ligand, unlike other riboswitches that respond to the binding of small ligands. Previous structural studies suggested that tRNA recognition by a T-box riboswitch is a bipartite process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Grigg and Ke, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zhang and Ferré-D'Amaré, 2013</xref>) with Stem I largely responsible for discriminating non-cognate tRNAs while the t-box sequence in the expression platform senses the charged state of the tRNA. We used smFRET to elucidate the binding kinetics of tRNA<sup>Gly</sup> by the <italic>glyQS</italic> T-box riboswitch. With three FRET pairs between different T-box riboswitch and tRNA ligand constructs, our data collectively reveal a two-step model of uncharged tRNA<sup>Gly</sup> binding to the <italic>glyQS</italic> T-box riboswitch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). The first binding step involves recognition of the anticodon of the tRNA by the specifier sequence located in Stem I of the T-box riboswitch, leading to a partially bound state. In the second step, the 3’ end of the T-box docks into the NCCA end of the tRNA through interactions with the t-box sequence, which leads to a fully bound state. Without the NCCA interaction, the binding of tRNA is unstable, with a mean lifetime of ~4 s, whereas with interactions both with the anticodon and the NCCA end, the binding of tRNA is very stable, with a mean lifetime &gt;24 s. It should be noted that the latter lifetime is likely to be much longer for two reasons: first, the measurement is limited by fluorophore photobleaching, i.e. the loss of signal is more likely to be due to photobleaching rather than the actual tRNA dissociation; second, the Cy5 label placed at the 5’ end of the tRNA reduces the overall binding affinity by ~4 fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), likely because the fluorophore impairs the NCCA/t-box interactions to some extent. In addition, an intra-T-box FRET pair at the 5’ and 3’ ends of the T-box demonstrates that, while the T-box is largely pre-organized in a folded state before tRNA binding, it still exhibits conformational rearrangement in a tRNA-dependent manner. Specifically, the 3’ half of the T-box (including Stem III and the anti-terminator) moves inward relative to the 5’ half (Stem I) of the T-box to accommodate the interaction with the NCCA end in the second binding step.</p><p>While our manuscript was in preparation, Suddala <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Suddala et al., 2018</xref>) reported a related single-molecule study on tRNA binding to the <italic>glyQS</italic> T-box riboswitch and proposed a similar two-step binding model. By using colocalized signals from the bound tRNA and the immobilized T-box, Suddala <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Suddala et al., 2018</xref>) uncovered two binding states distinguished by different dissociation rates of the tRNA, aided by using a Stem I-only mutant that cannot interact with the NCCA end of the tRNA. Specifically, in the model of Suddala <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Suddala et al., 2018</xref>) binding of the anticodon of the uncharged tRNA results in a relatively unstable state (with a lifetime of ~4–5 s), consistent with the partially bound state in our model, while binding both the anticodon and the NCCA end of the tRNA results in a stable state, consistent with the fully bound state in our model. Although both studies propose consistent kinetic models, in the study by Suddala <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Suddala et al., 2018</xref>), the FRET pair dyes are attached at the variable loop of the tRNA and the 3’ or 5’ end of the <italic>glyQS</italic> T-box, and do not generate different FRET signals to distinguish the partially bound state from the fully bound state. Therefore neither transitions between the partially bound and the fully bound states, nor the order of events during tRNA binding can be resolved in the study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Suddala et al., 2018</xref>). In contrast, by employing a FRET pair located at the 5’ end of the tRNA and the 3’ end of the <italic>glyQS</italic> T-box, we observed directly two FRET states corresponding to the recognition of the anticodon (0.4 FRET) and the binding of the NCCA (0.7 FRET), therefore our study allows the discrimination between different states and generates a more complete kinetic framework describing the full trajectory of the tRNA binding process. Our data reveal that anticodon recognition precedes the NCCA end interactions, and that after anticodon recognition the commitment to further establishment of the NCCA/t-box interaction is high. The T-box/tRNA<sup>Gly</sup> complex transits rapidly from the partially bound state to the fully bound state, with a rate constant (<italic>k</italic><sub>2</sub>) on the order of 10 s<sup>−1</sup>. Interestingly, our data also reveal that in the fully bound state the NCCA/t-box interaction is not highly-stable or ultra-stable. Brief disruption of the NCCA/t-box interactions can occur, but transition back to the fully bound state is rapid,~10 fold faster than dissociation of the tRNA from the partially bound state. Therefore tRNA can remain bound during the breaking and reforming of the NCCA/t-box interaction. However, such transient breaking of NCCA/t-box interaction was only observed in ~10% of the total population, suggesting that the reverse transition rate constant (<italic>k</italic><sub>-2</sub>) is overall very small.</p><p>Two-step binding mechanisms have been observed in a variety of protein or nucleic acid mediated biological process, including T-cell receptor (TCR) recognition of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) presenting peptides, where TCRs scan the MHC scaffold first, followed by sensing of specific MHC-presenting peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wu et al., 2002</xref>); interaction of the signal recognition particle (SRP) receptor with the membrane, where SRP receptors interact with the membrane in a dynamic mode followed by an SRP-induced conformational transition into a stable binding mode (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hwang Fu et al., 2017</xref>), DNA interrogation by CRISPR Cas9-crRNA, where Cas9-crRNA recognizes the protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) on the target DNA followed by sensing of the spacer sequence and triggering R-loop formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sternberg et al., 2014</xref>); and RNA-induced silencing complexes (RISCs) binding to their mRNA targets, where dynamic sampling of the ‘sub-seed’ region occurs before targeting stably across the full seed region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chandradoss et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Herzog and Ameres, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Salomon et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Salomon et al., 2016</xref>). In all of these cases, a two-step binding mechanism provides a good balance between sensitivity and specificity. T-box riboswitches fold and function co-transcriptionally in the cell, and hence we propose that a two-step kinetic model is kinetically beneficial during co-transcriptional folding of the T-box and sensing of the tRNA ligand. First, considering that the intracellular concentration of tRNA is on the order of µM in bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Avcilar-Kucukgoze et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dong et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Emilsson and Kurland, 1990</xref>), the binding of the tRNA ligand to the T-box riboswitch is rate limited by the first step. Pausing at Stem III in the presence of NusG in vitro was estimated to last 30–60 s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Grundy and Henkin, 2004</xref>). Assuming an in vivo concentration of tRNA ~1 μM, the apparent tRNA binding rate in the first step is ~0.5 s<sup>−1</sup>, which is sufficient for the uncharged tRNA to reach the partially bound state during the pausing. Second, bacterial RNA polymerase (RNAP) elongates at a rate of 40–50 nt/s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mosteller and Yanofsky, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Vogel and Jensen, 1994</xref>), and the length between terminator and anti-terminator sequences is ~40 nts; therefore the decision between termination and anti-termination needs to be made within ~0.5–1 s. On the one hand, the relatively slow dissociation (<italic>k</italic><sub>-1</sub>) from the partially bound state can ensure the tRNA ligand stays bound until the completion of the anti-terminator sequence. On the other hand, very rapid transition into the fully bound state (<italic>k</italic><sub>2</sub>) helps secure the interaction between the NCCA end of the tRNA and the t-box sequence and trap the T-box in the anti-terminator conformation before completion of transcription of the terminator sequence, which is immediately downstream. Finally, the fully bound state has a lifetime of at least 24 s, allowing RNAP to elongate more than 1000 nts before the tRNA dissociates. Therefore, the second binding step in the WT T-box with uncharged tRNA<sup>Gly</sup> is close to irreversible in such biological setting. It is worth mentioning that Suddala <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Suddala et al., 2018</xref>) revealed that the uncharged T-box/tRNA<sup>Gly</sup> complex exists in two populations: a stable complex, with a tRNA dissociation rate of ~0.03 s<sup>−1</sup>, and an ultra-stable complex, with a tRNA dissociation rate &lt;2.4×10<sup>−4</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>. Our estimation of the lifetime of the fully bound state was limited by the introduction of Cy5 to the 5’ end of the tRNA and fluorophore photobleaching, and therefore our experiments cannot distinguish between the stable and ultra-stable complexes. Nevertheless, both potential configurations in the fully bound state are stable enough to allow transcription read-through.</p><p>Based on the known structures of Stem I in complex with tRNA<sup>Gly</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Grigg and Ke, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zhang and Ferré-D'Amaré, 2013</xref>), it was hypothesized that the intra-T-box conformational change is likely to involve the K-turn region, which sits at the junction between the 5’ and 3’ portions of the T-box. Our observation that the NCCA end of the uncharged tRNA moves towards the anti-terminator stem (revealed by the T-box<sub>182</sub>-Cy3(3’) and tRNA<sup>Gly</sup>-Cy5 FRET), but maintains its relative position to the K-turn region (revealed by the T-box<sub>182</sub>-Cy3(5’) and tRNA<sup>Gly</sup>-Cy5 FRET) during the second binding step is consistent with the role of the K-turn region as the hinge of the intra-T-box conformational change. In addition, such conformational changes mediated by the K-turn region are Mg<sup>2+</sup> dependent, as suggested by Suddala <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Suddala et al., 2018</xref>). Importantly, our results hint at the critical role of the K-turn region in promoting the fast coordination between anticodon sensing and locking of the NCCA end. Crystal structures of the Stem I/tRNA complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Grigg and Ke, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zhang and Ferré-D'Amaré, 2013</xref>) show that Stem I flexes around the K-turn region and that this flexing seems to be important to establish the interactions between the anticodon and specifier sequence. Using a mutant where the K-turn region is removed, our data show that in the absence of the K-turn motif both the first and second binding steps are affected, but with a much more dramatic effect on the second step. In this specific K-turn mutant, where the K-turn is replaced by an extended Stem I helix, the conformational change in the T-box that brings closer the 3’ and 5’ portions becomes highly energetically unfavorable, leading to a ~ 10 fold reduction in <italic>k</italic><sub>2</sub>, and ~15 fold destabilization of the fully bound state. Our kinetic measurement of the K-turn mutant explains the in vivo loss-of-function K-turn mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Winkler et al., 2001</xref>), and emphasizes the importance of the flexing around the K-turn region and the associated conformational changes in the T-box itself in the overall recognition and binding process.</p><p>Our results with various T-box mutants demonstrate that the T-box structural elements involved in tRNA recognition can drive the two-step binding process in a modular fashion. For example, in the first binding step, interactions with Stem I involve both anticodon recognition and the contacts between the interdigitated T-loops in Stem I and the elbow region (D- and T-loops) of the tRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Grigg and Ke, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zhang and Ferré-D'Amaré, 2013</xref>). When introducing a point mutation that impairs the T-loops/elbow region interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zhang and Ferré-D'Amaré, 2013</xref>), we observed a dramatic decrease in the association rate constant and a moderate increase in the dissociation rate constant, leading to an overall ~50 fold reduction on the binding affinity for the first step, however the second step is unaffected. This observation suggests that establishment of the T-loops/elbow interactions is an important part of the Stem I/tRNA recognition process in the first binding step, but does not play any role in NCCA recognition in the second binding step. Similarly, truncation of Stem III has a minor effect on the stability of the fully bound state, but with no influence on the first binding step. Finally, the K-turn region (discussed above), which links the 5’ and 3’ portions of the T-box, plays a key role in coordinating the two binding steps by providing structural flexibility. It is worth mentioning that the impact on the tRNA binding kinetics by mutations in the T-loops, the K-turn, and the Stem III are consistent with the sequence conservation and the in vivo impact on amino acid-mediated transcription read-through using tyrS T-box riboswitches as a model system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Henkin, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rollins et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Winkler et al., 2001</xref>). Mutations in the highly conserved T-loop and K-turn region have a more dramatic influence on the tRNA binding kinetics, translating into a larger in vivo impact. While the less conserved Stem III contributes to the stabilization of the anti-terminator conformation in vitro, deletion of it does not appear to significantly impair the tRNA binding process in vitro. Potentially its major function is to create a pause site to coordinate with the co-transcriptional folding of the T-box (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Grundy and Henkin, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zhang and Landick, 2016</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, our study provides a comprehensive kinetic framework for describing tRNA recognition by the T-box riboswitch. The two-step binding process is driven by the specific structural elements of the T-box, and is likely to be kinetically beneficial for efficient, co-transcriptional recognition of the cognate tRNA ligand. Specific T-box structural elements drive the two-step binding process in a modular fashion, that is the 5’ and 3’ portions of the T-box are responsible for the first and second binding steps, respectively, with the K-turn region coordinating the two binding steps by allowing structural flexibility, providing a guideline for synthetic biology design of RNA regulatory modules, as well as for the development of new antibiotics using critical T-box structural elements as potential targets. Finally, the <italic>glyQS</italic> T-box riboswitch represents one of the simplest members of this class of riboswitches. Other T-box riboswitches are larger and have additional structural elements and can even appear in tandem arrangements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gutiérrez-Preciado et al., 2009</xref>). While the two-step binding kinetics may be common to all T-box riboswitches, it is likely that the process in other T-box riboswitches shows differences modulated by the additional structural elements.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type (species) <break/>or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Gene (<italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic>)</td><td><italic>glyQS</italic> T-box riboswitch</td><td>PMID: 28531275</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Gene (<italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic>)</td><td>tRNA-Gly</td><td>PMID: 9023104</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_008636">SCR_008636</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain <break/>background (<italic>E. coli</italic>)</td><td>DH5α</td><td>Thermo Fisher Scientific</td><td/><td>Catalogue # 18265017</td></tr><tr><td>Recombinant <break/>DNA reagent</td><td>pUC19 Vector</td><td>New England Biolabs</td><td/><td>Catalogue # N3041S</td></tr><tr><td>Peptide, <break/>recombinant protein</td><td>T7 RNA polymerase</td><td>PMID: 3684574</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Peptide, <break/>recombinant protein</td><td>BsaI</td><td>New England Biolabs</td><td/><td>Catalgue #: M0535S</td></tr><tr><td>Peptide, <break/>recombinant protein</td><td>RppH</td><td>New England Biolabs</td><td/><td>Catalgue #: M0356S</td></tr><tr><td>Chemical <break/>compound, drug</td><td>Cyanine5 NHS ester</td><td>Lumiprobe</td><td/><td>Catalogue # 13020</td></tr><tr><td>Chemical <break/>compound, drug</td><td>Cyanine3 hydrazide</td><td>Lumiprobe</td><td/><td>Catalogue # 13070</td></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>Origin 5.0</td><td>Microcal Origin</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_002815">SCR_002815</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>ImageJ</td><td>ImageJ</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_003070">SCR_003070</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>MATLAB</td><td>MATLAB</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_001622">SCR_001622</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>NIS-Elements</td><td>Nikon</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_014329">SCR_014329</ext-link></td><td/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>RNA purification and mutagenesis</title><p>RNA transcription was performed in vitro using His<sub>6</sub>-tagged T7 RNA polymerase using standard protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Milligan et al., 1987</xref>).

In this case, estimation of <italic>k</italic><sub>1</sub> from the selected FRET traces will highly bias for the molecules that bind relatively fast within the photobleaching time of Cy3, therefore significantly overestimating <italic>k</italic><sub>1</sub>. We therefore applied a different approach to estimate <italic>k</italic><sub>1</sub> for the T-box mutants. We counted trace percentage of the T-box mutants (number of FRET traces divided by the number of Cy3 spots) and normalized it to the trace percentage of T-box<sub>182</sub> with tRNA<sup>ΔNCCA</sup>-Cy5 to get the normalized trace percentage (<italic>f</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4</xref>).</p><p>We performed Gillespie simulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gillespie, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gillespie, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gillespie, 2007</xref>) on the observed signal as a function of <italic>k</italic><sub>1</sub> and <italic>k</italic><sub>-1</sub> during the first binding step. The simulated signal mimicked the experiment and imaging processing. As our FRET traces were selected from the maximum intensity projection of the acceptor signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>) regardless of the lifetime of the bound state, as long as there was a binding event during the imaging time window (70 s considering the photobleaching time of the donor dye), it would generate a signal (as a ‘footprint’) that showed in the output image of maximum projection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s5">Figure 6—figure supplement 5A</xref>). For each parameter set, 2000 binding trajectories were simulated, and the fraction of the molecules that generated signal in the maximum intensity projection (referred to as ‘<italic>f</italic>’) within the 70 s time window was calculated.

Your article has been reviewed by Gisela Storz serving as both Reviewing and Senior Editor, a Reviewing Editor, and three reviewers.

These are widespread bacterial riboregulators that employ the charge state of tRNA as a proxy for the intracellular concentration of specific amino acids. Previous genetic, biochemical and structural studies have elucidated the nature of the RNA-RNA interactions that give rise to specific interactions between the T-box and a cognate tRNA. However, the kinetics of the association have remained largely unexplored. In this manuscript, the authors use smFRET to characterize the association of a model T-box with its cognate tRNA. By judicious combination of labeling schemes as well as mutant T-boxes, the authors derive a two-step binding model and provide, for the first time, a quantitative kinetic framework for the association of the two RNAs. The T-box-tRNA interaction is an outstanding model system to elucidate how two non-coding RNAs associate specifically, making this work not only of interest to those who study riboswitches, but to the larger community of scientists who study non-coding RNAs.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Overall, the manuscript is well written and easy to follow, and the interpretations are sound. The highlight of the study is the capture and mechanistic interpretation of the partially bound states, which reflects the strength of single molecule techniques.</p><p>1) As the authors note, a superficially similar paper from the Nikonowicz and Walter labs analyzing T-box-tRNA association was published recently. However, the labeling scheme used by those authors precludes the analysis of T-box conformational accommodation. This is an important distinction, and the current study complements the recently published work from the Nikonowicz and Walter labs in important ways. However, the description of the work by Suddala et al., should be improved, Zhang et al., should discuss more clearly what insights they have obtained and how they extend and complement the experiments from the Nikonowicz and Walter labs. In particular, Suddala et al., carried out colocalization experiments, which are extremely powerful in detecting binding events that do not result in FRET. In addition, they observed Mg<sup>2+</sup> dependence on the switching, providing additional evidence that the K-turn switch may be metal dependent. They also observed three different off rates (k<sup>fast</sup>, k<sup>medium</sup>, and k<sup>slow</sup>). It is unclear how these three rates relate to the two states proposed here. Finally, Suddala et al., provided data that EFTu does not affect binding kinetics, which should likely be cited in this paper.</p><p>2) For broad interest to the bacterial gene regulation and riboswitch communities, the authors should expand on the in vivo consequences of the in vitro kinetics. Specifically:</p><p>- The authors at their own discretion may consider referencing the biological consequences of the mutations that are studied using the single molecule approach (if that information is already available)? For example, what happens in bacteria as a result of K-turn mutation, mutation C56, or stem III truncation? If this information is already in hand, it could help tie together the kinetics results with in vivo consequences for riboswitch regulation.</p><p>- The authors could provide a much more detailed link between their kinetic mechanism and the regulatory consequences given observed rates of transcription and pausing. The authors can potentially put numbers to many of these events. This has been done to some extent in the work by Suddala et al. It would be interesting to see how things change with the kinetics observed here.</p><p>- In general, the authors may undersell the two-step mechanism a bit. In what types of other systems (e.g., Cas9? Ago?) have two step binding mechanisms been observed? Is this potentially a general strategy for promoting fidelity? Would incorporating a proofreading/fidelity step be useful for thinking about biotechnology applications?</p><p>3) The labeling scheme employed in this work places a dye at the 5'-terminus of tRNA. While qualitative, previous biochemical work (Zhang and Ferre-D'Amare, (2014) suggested intimate coaxial stacking between the antiterminator element of the T-box and the acceptor stem of tRNA. Thus, an important control experiment is to show that placing a dye at the 5'-terminus of tRNA does not impact tRNA-T-box association, or to determine what the effect is. An ITC experiment (like the one authors’ report, for other purposes, in Figure 3—figure supplement 2) would be pretty clear in this regard.</p><p>4) The experiment establishing the kink-turn as the hinge point for the conformational change between the partially bound and full complex is on the weak side. The authors claim that the absence of a FRET change in their experiment is evidence that the kink-turn must be the point where flexing occurs. An alternative interpretation of this experiment could be that this just shows that the tRNA is not changing position relative to the anchor point during this transition, rather than pinpointing to where the T-box is bending to form the full complex. An experiment that gives a positive result upon kink-turn bending and full complex formation would be stronger evidence for the claim that the kink-turn is the main source of conformational change.</p><p>5) The authors conclude from their experiments that tRNA binding is a two-step process where the Stem-I interaction occurs first followed by the anti-terminator interaction. This is likely true in vivo where Stem-I emerges from the polymerase first. However, in their system the possibility exists that the anti-terminator interaction occurs first followed by Stem-I. Would the authors be able to discern FRET traces where this occurs using their set-up? Are transitions besides the.4 to.7 state observed? If the anti-terminator is never found to be bound first, can the authors provide a reason?</p><p>6) Subsection “Binding of cognate tRNA by the glyQS T-box results in two distinct FRET states”, it is unclear why some molecules are transitioning here, and others are not. In the recently published T-box paper from the Walter lab, Walter et al., stressed that their T-box was purified under native conditions. While in this work the RNA was denatured. How was the RNA refolded? Have the authors run a native gel of their RNA to detect possible folding heterogeneity that could explain some of these results?</p><p>7) Subsection “Determination of kinetic parameters”, can the authors provide additional information (or a reference or a simulation) for adjusting the fitted kinetic parameter based on the percentage of data observed? Does this really scale strictly as a percentage? How does the error in the fit scale?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.39518.045</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Overall, the manuscript is well written and easy to follow, and the interpretations are sound.

It emphasizes the experiments and conclusions in their study that are different from our studies. To a large extent, both studies are highly complementary and address non-overlapping aspects of T-box/tRNA binding kinetics. We made the following specific changes, as suggested by the reviewers, and included them in the Results section and Discussion section.</p><p>We now mention in the discussion that Suddala et al., used colocalized signals from the bound tRNA and the T-box to study the tRNA binding kinetics. While we did not use colocalization as a way to study tRNA binding, our choice of tRNA labeling positions makes the FRET value high enough (0.4 at least) to use the FRET signal reliably to report on binding. In fact, our k<sub>on</sub> and k<sub>off</sub> estimates from the partially bound state are highly consistent with the numbers reported by Suddala et al., providing further validation for using FRET signal to report binding.</p><p>We now mention the Mg-dependent conformational change reported by Suddala et al., when we discuss the K-turn mutant.</p><p>“In addition, such conformational changes mediated by the K-turn region are Mg<sup>2+</sup> dependent, as suggested by Suddala et al. (Suddala et al., 2018).”</p><p>In addition, in Figure 1—figure supplement 2 we include ITC binding data done at 1mM MgCl2 concentration that shows clearly that tRNA binding at this Mg concentration is completely abolished. This shows that tRNA binding by the T-box is Mg dependent and the T-box is an Mg-dependent switch.</p><p>The lifetime of the fully bound state is consistent with the k<sub>off</sub><sup>medium</sup> in the study by Suddala et al. As we did not perform imaging with low time resolution (e.g. 20 s as in the work by Suddala et al.), we cannot fully distinguish k<sub>off</sub><sup>medium</sup> and k<sub>off</sub><sup>slow</sup> in our results. It is possible that the fully bound state contains two populations with tRNA dissociating with different rates. However, in our model the key conclusion is that the fully bound state is a relatively stable complex with a lifetime of at least 24 s, and probably longer, which is long enough to be functionally important as it allows transcription of the terminator sequence. We include the comparison of the lifetimes obtained in both studies in the Discussion section:</p><p>“By using colocalized signals from the bound tRNA and the immobilized T-box, Suddala et al. (Suddala et al., 2018) uncovered two binding states distinguished by different dissociation rates of the tRNA, aided by using a Stem I-only mutant that cannot interact with the NCCA end of the tRNA. Specifically, in the model of Suddala et al. (Suddala et al., 2018) binding of the anticodon of the uncharged tRNA results in a relatively unstable state (with a lifetime of ~4-5 s), consistent with the partially bound state in our model, while binding both the anticodon and the NCCA end of the tRNA results in a stable state, consistent with the fully bound state in our model.”</p><p>and</p><p>“Finally, the fully bound state has a lifetime of at least 24 s, allowing RNAP to elongate more than 1,000 nts before the tRNA dissociates. Therefore, the second binding step in the WT T-box with uncharged tRNA<sup>Gly</sup> is close to irreversible in such biological setting. […] Nevertheless, both potential configurations in the fully bound state are stable enough to allow transcription read-through.”</p><p>We have now cited the paper in the introduction when mentioned EF-Tu.</p><p> <italic>2) For broad interest to the bacterial gene regulation and riboswitch communities, the authors should expand on the</italic> in vivo <italic>consequences of the</italic> in vitro <italic>kinetics.

While these in vivo studies are on a different T-box, these two regions are highly conserved, therefore it is possible to expect similar in vivo functional attenuation by glyQS T-box riboswitches carrying equivalent mutations. As we indicated previously in the manuscript, the Stem III mutant shows a minor impact on tRNA binding kinetics and hence we speculate that the in vivo relevance of Stem III is related to the promotion of transcriptional pausing during T-box co-transcriptional folding. Unlike the other two regions, Stem III is not highly conserved. We revised the manuscript as below:</p><p>“It is worth mentioning that the impact on the tRNA binding kinetics by mutations in the T-loops, the K-turn, and the Stem III are consistent with the sequence conservation and the in vivo impact on amino acid-mediated transcription read-through using tyrS T-box riboswitches as a model system (Henkin, 2014; Rollins et al., 1997; Winkler et al., 2001). Mutations in the highly conserved T-loop and K-turn region have a more dramatic influence on the tRNA binding kinetics, translating into large in vivo impact. While the less conserved Stem III contributes to the stabilization of the anti-terminator conformation in vitro, deletion of it does not appear to significantly impair the tRNA binding process in vitro. Potentially its major function is to create a pause site to coordinate with the co-transcriptional folding of the T-box (Grundy and Henkin, 2004; Zhang and Landick, 2016).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- The authors could provide a much more detailed link between their kinetic mechanism and the regulatory consequences given observed rates of transcription and pausing. The authors can potentially put numbers to many of these events. This has been done to some extent in the work by Suddala et al. It would be interesting to see how things change with the kinetics observed here.</p></disp-quote><p>Previously we mentioned briefly in the Discussion section the potential impact of the tRNA binding kinetics in the co-transcriptional setting. In the revised manuscript, we have significantly expanded such discussion as follows:</p><p>“T-box riboswitches fold and function co-transcriptionally in the cell, and hence we propose that a two-step kinetic model is kinetically beneficial during co-transcriptional folding of the T-box and sensing of the tRNA ligand. […] Finally, the fully bound state has a lifetime of at least 24 s, allowing RNAP to elongate more than 1,000 nts before the tRNA dissociates. Therefore, the second binding step in the WT T-box with uncharged tRNA<sup>Gly</sup> is close to irreversible in such biological setting.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- In general, the authors may undersell the two-step mechanism a bit.

Would incorporating a proofreading/fidelity step be useful for thinking about biotechnology applications?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this suggestion. We have now included discussion on two-step mechanisms utilized in other biological process as follows.</p><p>“Two-step binding mechanisms have been observed in a variety of protein or nucleic acid mediated biological process, including T-cell receptor (TCR) recognition of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) presenting peptides, where TCRs scan the MHC scaffold first, followed by sensing of specific MHC-presenting peptides (Wu et al., 2002); interaction of the signal recognition particle (SRP) receptor with the membrane, where SRP receptors interact with the membrane in a dynamic mode followed by an SRP-induced conformational transition into a stable binding mode (Hwang Fu et al., 2017), DNA interrogation by CRISPR Cas9-crRNA, where Cas9-crRNA recognizes the protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) on the target DNA followed by sensing of the spacer sequence and triggering R-loop formation (Sternberg et al., 2014); and RNA-induced silencing complexes (RISCs) binding to their mRNA targets, where dynamic sampling of the “sub-seed” region occurs before targeting stably across the full seed region (Chandradoss et al., 2015; Herzog and Ameres, 2015; Salomon et al., 2015, 2016).</p><p>In all of these cases, a two-step binding mechanism provides a good balance between sensitivity and specificity.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The labeling scheme employed in this work places a dye at the 5'-terminus of tRNA. While qualitative, previous biochemical work (Zhang and Ferre-D'Amare, (2014)) suggested intimate coaxial stacking between the antiterminator element of the T-box and the acceptor stem of tRNA. Thus, an important control experiment is to show that placing a dye at the 5'-terminus of tRNA does not impact tRNA-T-box association, or to determine what the effect is. An ITC experiment (like the one authors’ report, for other purposes, in Figure 3—figure supplement 2) would be pretty clear in this regard.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this critical comment. We have performed ITC experiments on the binding of Cy5 labeled tRNA on the 5’ end. This is not an easy experiment as it requires large amounts of labeled tRNA, but we succeeded in making it work. A revised figure (Figure 1—figure supplement 2) showing the new ITC result is now part of the manuscript with the experimental details in the figure caption and in the Materials and methods section. As expected, Cy5 placed at the 5’ end the tRNA modestly affects binding, decreasing the binding constant by ~4 fold and suggesting that the fully bound state should be even more stable than measured. As the Cy5 dye is placed close to the NCCA end of the tRNA, the effect of the label should be limited to the second binding step. The fact that the k<sub>1</sub> and k<sub>-1</sub> of the first binding step in our study are highly consistent with the reported values by Suddala et al., also suggests that the label only affects the second binding step. Overall, the lifetime of the fully bound state is, as we indicate in the manuscript, underestimated not only due to fluorophore photobleaching, but also due to the 5’ label. In this sense, the minor pitfall introduced by the label does not change the overall conclusions. We revised the Discussion section of the manuscript to include this.</p><p>“Without the NCCA interaction, the binding of tRNA is unstable, with a mean lifetime of ~4 s, whereas with interactions both with the anticodon and the NCCA end, the binding of tRNA is very stable, with a mean lifetime &gt; 24 s. It should be noted that the latter lifetime is likely to be much longer for two reasons: first, the measurement is limited by fluorophore photobleaching, which limits long measurements in our experiments; second, the Cy5 label placed at the 5’ end of the tRNA reduces the overall binding affinity by ~ 4-fold (Figure 1—figure supplement 2), likely because the fluorophore impairs the NCCA/t-box interactions to some extent.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The experiment establishing the kink-turn as the hinge point for the conformational change between the partially bound and full complex is on the weak side. The authors claim that the absence of a FRET change in their experiment is evidence that the kink-turn must be the point where flexing occurs. An alternative interpretation of this experiment could be that this just shows that the tRNA is not changing position relative to the anchor point during this transition, rather than pinpointing to where the T-box is bending to form the full complex. An experiment that gives a positive result upon kink-turn bending and full complex formation would be stronger evidence for the claim that the kink-turn is the main source of conformational change.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for pointing out this premature conclusion. We agree with the reviewers that insignificant FRET change between the 5’ end of the tRNA and the base of Stem I is not sufficient to prove that the hinge is at the K-turn region. In order to provide positive evidence for this conclusion, the most straightforward way would be visualize the structures of the Tbox/tRNA complex at the partially bound and fully bound states, which is beyond the scope of the current study. However, as the reviewers suggest, our data show the 5’ end of the tRNA maintains its distance, or configuration, relative to the base of the Stem I during the second binding step. In addition, the kinetics of the k-turn mutant indicate that the flexibility of the k-turn is very important for the transition from the partially bound to the fully bound state. Therefore, we decided to revise the change the subtitle of the related section and also the Discussion section in the manuscript to simply mentioning the possibility that the k-turn is likely to be the hinge region. the new subtitle reads:</p><p>“The NCCA end of the uncharged tRNA maintains its relative position to the K-turn region during the second binding step”</p><p>While the Discussion section was changed as follows:</p><p>“Based on the known structures of Stem I in complex with tRNA<sup>Gly</sup> (Grigg and Ke, 2013; Zhang and Ferre-D'Amare, 2013), it was hypothesized that the intra-T-box conformational change is likely to involve the K-turn region, which sits at the junction between the 5’ and 3’ portions of the T-box. Our observation that the NCCA end of the uncharged tRNA moves towards the anti-terminator stem (revealed by the T-box<sub>182</sub>-Cy3(3’) and tRNA<sup>Gly</sup>-Cy5 FRET), but maintains its relative position to the K-turn region (revealed by the T-box<sub>182</sub>-Cy3(5’) and tRNA<sup>Gly</sup>-Cy5 FRET) during the second binding step is consistent with the role of the K-turn region as the hinge of the intra-T-box conformational change.”</p><p> <italic>5) The authors conclude from their experiments that tRNA binding is a two-step process where the Stem-I interaction occurs first followed by the anti-terminator interaction. This is likely true</italic> in vivo <italic>where Stem-I emerges from the polymerase first. However, in their system the possibility exists that the anti-terminator interaction occurs first followed by Stem-I. Would the authors be able to discern FRET traces where this occurs using their set-up? Are transitions besides the.4 to.7 state observed? If the anti-terminator is never found to be bound first, can the authors provide a reason?</italic> </p><p>We concluded that the two-step binding process samples the 0.4 FRET state first for the following two reasons: (1) due to the imaging time resolution, most of the traces showed singlestep FRET increases from zero to 0.7 during the flow experiment, where we can capture the realtime binding. Nevertheless, we still see traces showing sampling of the 0.4 FRET state before the 0.7 FRET. (2) Perhaps a stronger argument is that we did not observe any transient binding of tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup>, which has an intact and accessible NCCA, but not the correct anticodon. The latter observation supports the model that anticodon binding needs to occur before establishment of the NCCA interaction. We modified the manuscript to make the point more implicit.</p><p>“Collectively, our results suggest a two-step binding model involving the separate establishment of the interactions with the anticodon and the NCCA. The fact that tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup>, which has a mismatched anticodon, but contains an intact NCCA 3’ end, does not show any binding activity suggest that interactions with the anticodon precede the interactions with the NCCA end of the tRNA and are necessary for the establishment of the NCCA contacts.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Subsection “Binding of cognate tRNA by the glyQS T-box results in two distinct FRET states”, it is unclear why some molecules are transitioning here, and others are not. In the recently published T-box paper from the Walter lab, Walter et al., stressed that their T-box was purified under native conditions. While in this work the RNA was denatured. How was the RNA refolded? Have the authors run a native gel of their RNA to detect possible folding heterogeneity that could explain some of these results?</p></disp-quote><p>We have added native gel electrophoresis analysis of the T-box folding as a supplement to Figure 1 (Figure 1—figure supplement 1). There is some folding heterogeneity in the T-box, but not in the tRNA, which is fully folded. The T-box constructs, including the WT and the mutants, all consistently show a 60-75% folding efficiency. Nevertheless, when we mix folded T-box with tRNA using a gel shift assay we do not observe tRNA binding to the misfolded/unfolded fraction or to the T-box that is not put through the refolding process. Therefore, we do not think the unfolded/misfolded fraction affects our smFRET measurement or data interpretation. We do not have a good explanation for the ~10% subpopulation that shows transient back transition into the partially bound state yet. Therefore, we do not provide any biological meaning for that small subpopulation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Subsection “Determination of kinetic parameters”, can the authors provide additional information (or a reference or a simulation) for adjusting the fitted kinetic parameter based on the percentage of data observed? Does this really scale strictly as a percentage? How does the error in the fit scale?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for pointing this out and helping make our analysis more rigorous. We performed a Gillespie simulation on the observed signal as a function of k<sub>1</sub> and k<sub>-1</sub> during the first binding step, which is described in detail in the Materials and methods section. The observed signal in the simulation mimicked the experiment and imaging processing. The simulation shows that the fraction of molecules generating a binding signal is insensitive to k<sub>-1</sub>. The fraction does not scale linearly with apparent k<sub>1</sub> within a range spanning 6 orders of magnitude (10<sup>-7</sup> to 10<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>); however, within the range of our experimental results, a linear relationship is still a good approximation (Pearson’s R = 0.99, see figure below). Nevertheless, we decided to modify the k<sub>1</sub> calculation with a better fit according to the simulation, as described in the Materials and methods section and add a new figure, Figure 5—figure supplement 5. The modified calculation gives very similar results to the previous calculation within the linear approximation, and therefore all conclusions regarding the effects of the mutations still hold.</p></body></sub-article></article>
