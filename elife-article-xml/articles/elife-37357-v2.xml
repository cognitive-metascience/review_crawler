Failure to update behaviour in outcome devaluation and reversal learning procedures are considered canonical deficits following OFC lesions in non-human primates and rodents. We examined the generality of these findings in rodents using lesions of the rodent lateral OFC (LO) in instrumental action-outcome and Pavlovian cue-outcome devaluation procedures. LO lesions disrupted outcome devaluation in Pavlovian but not instrumental procedures. Furthermore, although both anterior and posterior LO lesions disrupted Pavlovian outcome devaluation, only posterior LO lesions were found to disrupt reversal learning. Posterior but not anterior LO lesions were also found to disrupt the attribution of motivational value to Pavlovian cues in sign-tracking. These novel dissociable task- and subregion-specific effects suggest a way to reconcile contradictory findings between rodent and non-human primate OFC research.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>orbitofrontal cortex</kwd><kwd>outcome devaluation</kwd><kwd>reversal learning</kwd><kwd>autoshaping</kwd><kwd>Pavlovian learning</kwd><kwd>outcome identity</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000923</institution-id><institution>Australian Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DP0989027</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Killcross</surname><given-names>Simon</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000923</institution-id><institution>Australian Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DP120103564</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Killcross</surname><given-names>Simon</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The rodent orbitofrontal cortex makes functionally distinct contributions to flexible behavioural control, even within a single putative orbitofrontal subregion, which has important implications for establishing homology between rodent and primate orbitofrontal cortex.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) in rodents and primates is critical for updating behaviour flexibly when outcome contingencies change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Murray et al., 2007</xref>). Compelling evidence for this view comes from studies using outcome devaluation procedures in which the value of a reward is reduced to test whether behaviour is updated to reflect changes in the outcome’s current value. In rodents, OFC lesions disrupt the appropriate reduction in anticipatory responding for a reward that has been paired with illness and has become aversive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gallagher et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pickens et al., 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">2005</xref>). Similar conclusions have been reached in human fMRI studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gottfried et al., 2003</xref>) and non-human primate studies, where OFC function is disrupted by excitotoxic lesions and functional inactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Izquierdo and Murray, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Izquierdo et al., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Machado and Bachevalier, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Rolls, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">West et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Similar to outcome devaluation, reversal learning procedures involve updating behaviour when rewarded and non-rewarded task contingencies change. Although OFC lesions do not impact initial acquisition of rewarded and non-rewarded cues or actions, they significantly disrupt the flexible updating of behaviour following the reversal of these contingencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boulougouris et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Murray et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Schoenbaum et al., 2003</xref>). Both outcome devaluation and reversal learning require flexibly tracking changes in learned contingencies and updating behaviour appropriately when contingencies or outcome values change, and both procedures are disrupted by damage to the OFC.</p><p>A key requirement of any theory of OFC function is to account for the deficits in both outcome devaluation and reversal learning following disruption of OFC function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Delamater, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Murray et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Rudebeck and Murray, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Wikenheiser et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wilson et al., 2014</xref>). However, the generality of these deficits has been questioned. For example, OFC lesions do not disrupt outcome devaluation in instrumental action-outcome learning procedures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Balleine et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ostlund and Balleine, 2007a</xref>), which is in contrast to robust effects in Pavlovian outcome devaluation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Schoenbaum et al., 1999</xref>). Furthermore, reversal deficits are not always reported following OFC lesions, and the nature of the deficit is not always consistent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boulougouris et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Burke et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chudasama and Robbins, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mariano et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">McAlonan and Brown, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Rudebeck and Murray, 2011b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Rudebeck et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Schoenbaum et al., 2003</xref>). Although it is tempting to attribute these differences to different task parameters between studies, we propose that these discrepancies are also likely to be caused by functional heterogeneity within regions classified as OFC.</p><p>Indeed, there is mounting evidence that the OFC is a functionally heterogeneous structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Izquierdo, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mar et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Rudebeck and Murray, 2011a</xref>). Notably, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ostlund and Balleine, (2007a)</xref> used focal lesions of the lateral OFC (LO), which did not disrupt instrumental outcome devaluation, whereas earlier Pavlovian devaluation studies in rodents involved widespread damage to the ventral (VO), lateral (LO), dorsolateral (DLO), anterior agranular insular (AI), and even medial (MO) OFC subregions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gallagher et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pickens et al., 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">2005</xref>). It is therefore unclear which subregions contribute to flexible behavioural control tested by Pavlovian outcome devaluation or reversal learning in rodents.</p><p>Here, we investigate whether the role of OFC in flexible behavioural control is specific to cue-guided (Pavlovian) and not action-guided (instrumental) behaviours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ostlund and Balleine, 2007a</xref>) using focal LO lesions. Then we examine whether there is functional heterogeneity within the anterior-posterior plane of the LO region using Pavlovian outcome devaluation and reversal learning procedures.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Instrumental devaluation by taste aversion</title><p>First, we tested whether the OFC plays a necessary role in guiding flexible action-outcome behaviour in an instrumental outcome devaluation task.

Taste aversion was successfully acquired to the food paired with LiCl, as shown by decreased consumption compared to the food paired with saline injections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), and there were no apparent group differences in acquiring this taste aversion. A mixed Lesion x Devaluation (devalued, non-devalued group) x Pairing (3 pairings) x Injection (LiCl, saline) ANOVA supported the acquisition of taste aversion with significant main effects of Pairing (<italic>F</italic><sub>(2, 56)</sub>=10.55, p&lt;0.001), Injection (<italic>F</italic><sub>(1, 28)</sub>=35.96, p&lt;0.001), and a Pairing x Injection interaction (<italic>F</italic><sub>(2, 56)</sub>=176.17, p&lt;0.001, all remaining <italic>F</italic> &lt; 2.48, p&gt;0.09). Similarly, a significant Pairing x Injection linear trend effect (<italic>F</italic><sub>(1, 28)</sub>=513.68, p&lt;0.001) suggested that consumption of food paired with LiCl significantly decreased across pairings (linear trend across Pairing for LiCl, <italic>F</italic><sub>(1, 28)</sub>=286.92, p&lt;0.001) whereas consumption of the food paired with saline increased (linear trend across Pairing for saline, <italic>F</italic><sub>(1, 28)</sub>=67.57, p&lt;0.001). These findings support previous reports that OFC lesions do not affect initial learning of instrumental lever pressing behaviour, or sensitivity to acquiring taste aversions.</p><p>Devaluation of the instrumental response was then assessed by an extinction test of lever pressing. At test the groups with the devalued instrumental reinforcer performed fewer lever presses than the non-devalued groups (i.e. the groups with the alternative reinforcer devalued), but this was not differentially affected by lesion or sham surgery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). A univariate Lesion x Devaluation ANOVA revealed a significant main effect of Devaluation (<italic>F</italic><sub>(1, 28)</sub>=5.14, p=0.03) that did not significantly interact with Lesion (Lesion x Devaluation <italic>F</italic><sub>(1, 28)</sub>=1.19, p=0.29, main effect of Lesion <italic>F</italic><sub>(1, 28)</sub>=0.21, p=0.65). Therefore, a significant devaluation effect was found across both lesion groups (additional analysis of devaluation performance within the session presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Similar to the devaluation test in extinction, subsequent re-acquisition of the instrumental response with the delivery of the outcome was significantly affected by the acquired taste aversion showing a strong devaluation effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). A univariate Lesion x Devaluation ANOVA revealed a significant main effect of Devaluation (<italic>F</italic><sub>(1, 28)</sub>=181.01, p&lt;0.001) that did not significantly interact with Lesion (Lesion x Devaluation <italic>F</italic><sub>(1, 28)</sub>=0.43, p=0.52, main effect of Lesion <italic>F</italic><sub>(1, 28)</sub>=2.09, p=0.16).</p><p>These findings combine with those of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ostlund and Balleine, (2007a)</xref> to show that the OFC is not necessary for the flexible control of action-outcome behaviour. Furthermore, we rule out the possibility that this discrepancy between Pavlovian and instrumental devaluation effects following OFC is due to differences in the method of devaluation that is taste-aversion or specific satiety.</p><p>Using similar LO lesions we also replicate another finding reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ostlund and Balleine, (2007a)</xref>, no effect of LO lesions on sensory-specific Pavlovian-to-instrumental transfer (sPIT; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1</xref>).

Chemogenetic inactivation of these posterior LO and VO aspects of the rodent OFC have also recently been found to disrupt instrumental outcome devaluation by specific satiety under some training conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Parkes et al., 2018</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Pavlovian devaluation by taste aversion</title><p>An alternative account of the absence of OFC lesion effects on instrumental devaluation, in contrast to robust devaluation deficits by taste aversion in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gallagher et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pickens et al., 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">2005</xref>), is the extent and specificity of OFC lesion damage.

Acquisition of responding to the CSs predicting the to-be devalued and non-devalued USs did not differ within groups but differed between lesion groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) such that responding was lower in the posterior OFC lesion group. A mixed Group x CS (devalued, non-devalued) x DayBlock (4 Blocks of 3 days) ANOVA supported this observation with a significant main effect of Group (F<sub>(2, 41)</sub>=3.67, p=0.03) and DayBlock (F<sub>(3, 123)</sub>=102.14, p&lt;0.001) but all other effects failed to reach significance (Group x US F<sub>(2, 41)</sub>=2.55, p=0.09, Group x US x DayBlock F<sub>(6, 123)</sub>=2.01, p=0.07, all remaining F &lt; 1.00, p&gt;0.44). Bonferroni corrected pairwise comparisons of overall responding revealed that the posterior group had lower performance than the sham group (F<sub>(1, 41)</sub>=7.34, p=0.03), but no significant differences were found between anterior and sham (F<sub>(1, 41)</sub>=2.29, p=0.42), or posterior and anterior groups (<italic><bold>F</bold></italic><sub>(1, 41)</sub>=1.65, p=0.62).</p><p>Taste aversion was successfully acquired by all groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).

Follow up simple effects revealed that consumption of the US paired with LiCl did not differ from saline prior to the first injection (pairing 1 <italic>F</italic><sub>(1, 41)</sub>=0.09, p=0.77), but was significantly reduced relative to saline prior to the second injection (pairing 2 <italic>F</italic><sub>(1, 41)</sub>=59.199, p&lt;0.001). The third injection pairings performed in the test chambers showed successful transfer of the taste aversion to this context in all groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). A Group x Devaluation mixed ANOVA on magazine duration behaviour revealed a significant effect of Devaluation (<italic>F</italic><sub>(1, 41)</sub>=16.16, p&lt;0.001) that did not differ with Group (all remaining <italic>F</italic> &lt; 1.57, p&gt;0.22). Taken together, consumption and approach towards the US paired with LiCl was successfully reduced compared to the US paired with saline injections, but the magnitude of this unique taste aversion did differ between groups.</p><p>Devaluation testing was conducted under extinction to ensure that behaviour was guided by the expected/recalled value of the outcomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). The sham group showed a significant reduction in magazine behaviour to the CS that predicted the devalued relative to the non-devalued US, but this devaluation effect was not evident in the anterior and posterior lesion groups. This pattern of results was supported by a Group x Devaluation mixed ANOVA revealing a significant Group x Devaluation interaction (<italic>F</italic><sub>(2, 41)</sub>=3.46, p=0.04), the main effects of Devaluation (<italic>F</italic><sub>(1, 41)</sub>=3.74, p=0.06) and Group (<italic>F</italic><sub>(2, 41)</sub>=0.41, p=0.41) did not reach significance. Simple effects revealed that this interaction was due to a significant devaluation effect in the sham group (<italic>F</italic><sub>(1, 41)</sub>=7.33, p=0.01), but not the anterior (<italic>F</italic><sub>(1, 41)</sub>=2.06, p=0.16) or posterior groups (<italic>F</italic><sub>(1, 41)</sub>=0.81, p=0.37). This suggests that lesions of the anterior or the posterior LO are sufficient to disrupt Pavlovian devaluation by taste aversion, previously established with much larger OFC lesions in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gallagher et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pickens et al., 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">2005</xref>).</p><p>Next, a US specific reinstatement test was conducted to see if the lesion groups could appropriately reduce behaviour to the devalued cue following a brief reminder of the outcome value. Rats were first exposed to one of the USs, and after a short delay they were presented with the CS that predicted that US (in extinction). All groups remained sensitive to the taste aversion when re-exposed to the USs in the test chamber (uneaten devalued USs observed by experimenter when cleaning the chamber prior to test). A mixed Group x Period (pre, post US delivery) x Devaluation ANOVA on magazine behaviour during US re-exposure (data not shown) revealed a significant effect of Period (<italic>F</italic><sub>(1, 41)</sub>=71.20, p&lt;0.001), Devaluation (<italic>F</italic><sub>(1, 41)</sub>=72.05, p&lt;0.001) and Period x Devaluation interaction (<italic>F</italic><sub>(1, 41)</sub>=79.30, p&lt;0.001, all remaining <italic>F</italic> &lt; 1.33, p&gt;0.28). Simple main effects revealed that magazine behaviour did not differ before US delivery (<italic>F</italic><sub>(1, 41)</sub>=1.23, p=0.02), but was significantly higher after delivery of the non-devalued than the devalued US (<italic>F</italic><sub>(1, 41)</sub>=93.46, p&lt;0.001).</p><p>During the reinstatement test, all groups showed significant evidence of sensitivity to US devaluation in the presence of the CSs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). A mixed Group x Devaluation ANOVA supported this pattern of results with a significant main effect of Devaluation (<italic>F</italic><sub>(1, 41)</sub>=50.73, p&lt;0.001), but no significant effect of Group (<italic>F</italic><sub>(2, 41)</sub>=1.12, p=0.34) or Group x Devaluation interaction (<italic>F</italic><sub>(2, 41)</sub>=1.97, p=0.15). Therefore, re-exposure to the US prior to test elicited a robust devaluation effect in all groups. This suggests that the disruption of the Pavlovian devaluation effect following LO lesions is not caused by a failure to acquire sensory specific cue-outcome associations, not the ability to acquire a sensory specific taste-aversion, nor perseverative responding to any predictive cues. Instead, the deficit is specific to recalling the new value of the devalued outcome and/or integrating it into appropriate behavioural control.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Sign-tracking and reversal</title><p>The finding that posterior LO lesions retarded acquisition of initial Pavlovian conditioned approach behaviour is surprising given that these animals can appropriately modulate their cue driven behaviour based on outcome value when given contact with the US in a reinstatement test. It was hypothesised that this might reflect an impairment in the attribution of value/salience to the Pavlovian cue itself. When a lever is used as a Pavlovian cue, rats will come to approach and engage with the lever cue (sign-tracking) instead of the normal conditioned approach to the magazine (goal-tracking behaviour) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brown and Jenkins, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jenkins and Moore, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Locurto et al., 1976</xref>). Many researchers have argued that sign-tracking behaviour reflects a process by which the lever CS acquires enhanced incentive salience so that the incentive motivational value of the outcome becomes attributed to the cue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Berridge, 2004</xref>). Therefore, it was predicted that the posterior LO group would not attribute incentive salience to a lever cue and show a deficit in sign-tracking. The sham, anterior, and posterior LO lesion groups were retrained on a discriminated sign-tracking procedure in using rewarded (CS+) and non-rewarded (CS-) lever cues (left and right lever, counterbalanced).</p><p>To ensure that any differences in lever pressing are not confounded by differential levels of competing responses, it is important to establish that there are no group differences in baseline magazine behaviour. Mixed Group x DayBlock (4 blocks of 3 days) ANOVAs for the PreCS magazine duration did not differ between groups during acquisition (Group or Group x DayBlock interactions, all <italic>F</italic> &lt; 1.75, p&gt;0.12) or subsequent reversal (all <italic>F</italic> &lt; 2.01, p&gt;0.14, data not shown).</p><p>During acquisition, lever pressing during the CS+ was greater than CS-, but the lesion groups made fewer responses than the sham group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, left panel). A mixed Group x CS (CS+, CS-) x DayBlock (4 blocks of 3 days) ANOVA partially supported the observed differences with a significant main effect of Group (<italic>F</italic><sub>(2, 41)</sub>=3.75, p=0.03) and a 3-way Group x CS x DayBlock interaction (<italic>F</italic><sub>(6, 123)</sub>=3.42, p&lt;0.01, all remaining effects also reached significance <italic>F</italic> &gt; 2.20, p&lt;0.05).

Bonferroni corrected simple effects revealed that there were no group differences in responding to the CS- (DayBlock 3 and 4, all <italic>F</italic> &lt; 4.21, p&gt;0.14), whereas CS +lever pressing was greater in the sham than the posterior group (DayBlock 3 <italic>F</italic><sub>(1, 41)</sub>=9.51, p=0.01, DayBlock 4 <italic>F</italic><sub>(1, 41)</sub>=8.77, p=0.02) but not different between sham and anterior or anterior and posterior lesions (DayBlock 3 and 4, all <italic>F</italic> &lt; 3.87, p&gt;0.17).

CS+ responding was greater than CS- responding, and while responding decreased across days this decline was more rapid to the CS- than the CS+ (main effect of DayBlock <italic>F</italic><sub>(3, 123)</sub>=30.06, p&lt;0.001, and a CS x DayBlock interaction <italic>F</italic><sub>(3, 123)</sub>=5.82, p=0.001).

Follow up Bonferroni corrected comparisons revealed that on DayBlock 4, posterior group magazine responding was greater than the sham group (<italic>F</italic><sub>(1, 41)</sub>=8.12, p=0.02).</p><p>A popular measure of sign-tracking behaviour is the Pavlovian conditioned approach (PCA) index (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Flagel et al., 2011</xref>) which combines a number measures relating to the probability, latency, and relative bias in lever pressing over magazine approach. However, there is no principled justification for the specific choice or relative weighting of these measures, so a data driven alternative was used to quantify sign-tracking behaviour. A Doubly Multivariate ANOVA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Tabachnick and Fidell, 2013</xref>) was employed to directly assess response competition between the lever pressing and magazine duration measures in the sign-tracking procedure. This allowed for the comparison of two fundamentally different measures, lever pressing and magazine duration, which are likely to be correlated due to response competition that is high scores on one measure preclude high scores on the other measure.</p><p>A Group x DayBlock x CS (rewarded, non-rewarded) MANOVA with lever pressing and magazine duration response measures revealed a significant Group x DayBlock x CS interaction (<italic>F</italic><sub>(6, 37)</sub>=2.95, p=0.02). Follow up Group x DayBlock MANOVAs revealed a significant Group x DayBlock interaction for the rewarded CS (<italic>F</italic><sub>(6, 37)</sub>=2.59, p=0.03) but not the non-rewarded CS (<italic>F</italic><sub>(6, 37)</sub>=0.86, p=0.53). This significant multivariate interaction was investigated using a planned composite of the differences between measures (standardised with respect to within group variances and the grand mean) that is lever pressing - magazine duration. This composite reflects the expected competition between responses and was verified (post-hoc) by a discriminant analysis on the final day block of acquisition which revealed standardised coefficients of 0.64 (lever pressing) and −0.56 (magazine duration) associated with the first eigenvalue.</p><p>The difference scores on the standardised variate revealed that during acquisition of responding directed at the rewarded lever, all groups expressed a bias towards magazine responding at the start of training (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). However, by the end of training the sham and anterior groups were responding more to the lever than the magazine whereas the posterior group was responding similarly to both the magazine and the lever. This pattern of observed results was supported statistically. A Group x DayBlock ANOVA on the acquisition of the rewarded lever revealed a significant main effect of Group (<italic>F</italic><sub>(2, 41)</sub>=3.45, p=0.04), DayBlock (<italic>F</italic><sub>(3, 123)</sub>=95.89, p&lt;0.001) and Group x DayBlock interaction (<italic>F</italic><sub>(6, 123)</sub>=3.67, p&lt;0.01). Bonferroni adjusted simple effects revealed that there were no group differences in on DayBlock 1 and 2 (all p&gt;0.17) whereas on DayBlock 3 and 4 the posterior group had significantly lower scores than the sham group (p&lt;0.01, all remaining p&gt;0.15).

Prominent model-based and sensory-specific outcome-expectancy coding accounts of the OFC argue that deficits in outcome devaluation following OFC lesions are due to an inability to access the representation of the specific identity of expected outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Delamater, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Wikenheiser et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wilson et al., 2014</xref>).

However, the absence of an effect of OFC lesions on instrumental devaluation suggests that the representation of the specific properties of instrumental and Pavlovian outcomes are dissociable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ostlund and Balleine, 2007b</xref>). This absence also suggests that organisms represent task states and/or state transitions differently if they are caused by an instrumental action or an external Pavlovian stimulus, a distinction that has recently been incorporated into some model-based reinforcement learning theories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dayan and Berridge, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lesaint et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Zhang et al., 2009</xref>). Consistent with a selective role for the OFC in Pavlovian model-based inferences, there is mounting evidence that the OFC is necessary for making inferences in procedures that require a model-based representation the relationship between external cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jones et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sadacca et al., 2018</xref>). Given that outcome devaluation is considered a canonical deficit following OFC lesions, the absence of a lesion deficit in instrumental outcome devaluation must be incorporated into theories of OFC function.</p><p>In this paper we explored a number of possible reasons for the reported absence of an OFC lesion deficit in instrumental outcome devaluation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ostlund and Balleine, 2007a</xref>). One possibility is that the authors used task parameters that were not appropriate to detect a subtle OFC lesion deficit. For example, the number of distinct responses/outcomes that are trained concurrently affects the sensitivity of instrumental conditioning to outcome devaluation. Behaviour can become insensitive to devaluation (habitual) with overtraining (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dickinson, 1985</xref>) if only a single lever-outcome procedure is used. This overtraining effect is abolished if training procedures allow the animal to experience multiple distinct action-outcome contingencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Colwill and Rescorla, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kosaki and Dickinson, 2010</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ostlund and Balleine, (2007a)</xref> employed two unique levers and outcomes during acquisition, and a simultaneous two-lever choice test following devaluation. We tested whether these parameters, which have been shown to promote devaluation sensitive behaviour, masked a subtle OFC lesion deficit in instrumental devaluation. Our task employed a single lever-outcome design, and a random interval schedule of training, both of which have been shown to encourage the formation of habitual/devaluation insensitive behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dickinson, 1985</xref>). Despite these parameters, both sham and lesion groups exhibited a weak but robust devaluation effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p><p>Another possibility is that the method of devaluation can affect whether OFC lesion deficits are observed in instrumental outcome devaluation. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ostlund and Balleine, (2007a)</xref> used sensory specific satiety rather than lithium-chloride induced taste aversion as the method of devaluation. These two devaluation methods are often used interchangeably in computational models of learning (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Dranias et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Grossberg et al., 2008</xref>) and often yield similar results following lesions of neural regions involved in goal-directed and habitual behavioural control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Coutureau and Killcross, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Killcross and Blundell, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Killcross and Coutureau, 2003</xref>). Our results confirm that the absence of an OFC lesion deficit on instrumental devaluation is not simply due to a difference between lithium-chloride taste aversion and sensory specific satiety devaluation methods.</p><p>In contrast to instrumental devaluation, we found that OFC lesions abolished the appropriate reduction in Pavlovian approach responding when the outcome was devalued by taste aversion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gallagher et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pickens et al., 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">2005</xref>). These findings confirm that focal lesions of LO are sufficient to disrupt Pavlovian devaluation in rodents, previously reported with substantially larger OFC lesions targeting VO, LO, DLO, AI, and MO subregions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gallagher et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pickens et al., 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">2005</xref>).</p><p>Consistent with model-based theories of OFC function, at test LO lesions disrupted the ability to infer the new expected value of the CS that predicted the devalued outcome based. Specifically, OFC is argued to be necessary for inferring ‘hidden’ task states, such as the new value of the expected outcome, when this information is not externally available/signalled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wilson et al., 2014</xref>). Consistent with this prediction, providing a brief re-exposure to the devalued reward immediately prior to test (reinstatement test) allowed LO lesioned animals to successfully integrate the devalued outcome into their anticipatory responding. However, this result must be interpreted with caution as it is possible that re-exposure to the devalued US in the magazine resulted in some form of short-term avoidance to the magazine that persisted throughout the subsequent test session when the devalued CS was presented.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Sign-tracking and reversal learning</title><p>A consistently reported finding is that OFC lesions leave intact the initial acquisition and behavioural expression of either cue-outcome or action-outcome contingencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boulougouris et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chudasama et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chudasama and Robbins, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gallagher et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Rudebeck and Murray, 2011a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Schoenbaum et al., 2002</xref>; but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Walton et al., 2011</xref>). This finding is critical to ruling out many alternative explanations of the effect of OFC lesions on outcome devaluation such as general learning deficits. In the present experiments, anterior LO lesions did not affect instrumental conditioning, Pavlovian conditioning, or taste aversion learning. Unexpectedly, lesions that were focused on the posterior LO region did suppress behavioural responding during Pavlovian acquisition. This effect is not simply a general suppression of activity, as there was no difference in locomotor activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>), nor a change in appetite, as there was no difference in consumption levels at the start of taste aversion learning.</p><p>One possible account of the reduced Pavlovian conditioned approach behaviour in the posterior LO group is that the CS did not acquire incentive salience. Incentive salience refers to the process by which the incentive-motivational properties of the outcome are transferred to the CS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Berridge, 2004</xref>), such that if a lever CS is presented a rat will attempt to ‘consume’ the lever as if it were the pellet that it predicts. This behaviour directed at the lever CS (sign-tracking) comes at the expense of the traditional Pavlovian approach response to the site of reward delivery, the magazine (goal-tracking). Sham control and anterior LO lesions did not affect the propensity to acquire sign-tracking behaviour, whereas sign-tracking was significantly reduced following posterior LO lesions. This finding is consistent with evidence that rats showing stronger sign-tracking tendencies have increased c-fos activity in posterior OFC regions following lever cue presentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Flagel et al., 2011</xref>). This suggests that the posterior but not the anterior LO mediates the attribution of incentive-salience to cues. Alternatively, posterior LO may be involved in resolving response competition when multiple responses are supported by a predictive cue. In the present experiment, extensive Pavlovian training during the outcome devaluation procedure preceded the sign-tracking procedure, which may have resulted in a pre-existing dominant magazine approach response that could not be overcome following posterior LO lesions.</p><p>Surprisingly, extensive LO lesions have also been shown to have no effect on sign-tracking behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chang, 2014</xref>), but did retard subsequent reversal learning when rewarded (CS+) and non-rewarded (CS-) lever cues reversed reward contingencies. The present study found a similar impairment in reversal learning following posterior but not anterior LO lesions. This reversal deficit was not simply due to differences in the acquisition of the sign-tracking response as the posterior LO lesioned animals could reverse their lever approach behaviour. Instead, the deficit was specific to the magazine approach response which failed to extinguish in the posterior LO group when the previously rewarded CS+ was reversed to a non-rewarded CS-.</p><p>It is important to consider the limitations of a pre-training lesion approach to manipulating OFC function. While pre-training lesions guarantee loss of OFC function throughout training, it is possible that other neural regions might compensate for the loss of this function. Pre-training lesions are an important approach for probing deficits in acquisition, but limit inferences about whether these deficits reflect impaired encoding or retrieval. For example, ehile it has been shown that OFC lesions disrupt outcome devaluation when performed before and after training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gallagher et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pickens et al., 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">2005</xref>), the effect of OFC lesions on reversal learning depends on whether they occur before or after initial training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boulougouris et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boulougouris and Robbins, 2009</xref>). Further research is required to clarify the nature and extent of the anterior and posterior LO lesion deficits and how they relate to the function of the orbitofrontal region as a whole.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Rodent and primate homology</title><p>Human and non-human primate OFC can be defined cytoarchitectonically using clear granular, agranular, and dysgranular areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Price, 2006</xref>). In contrast, the rodent OFC only consists of agranular cortical regions, which led <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brodmann, 1909</xref> to conclude that rodents do not have a comparable orbital or frontal cortex. However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Rose and Woolsey, 1948</xref> proposed a different approach to identifying rodent homologs of the orbital and frontal cortex based on similar connectivity between the putative OFC of rabbits and cats and the mediodorsal nucleus of the thalamus (MD). This approach, based on MD connectivity, has been repeatedly extended to other regions of the frontal cortex in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Groenewegen, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Uylings et al., 2003</xref>). However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Price, 2006</xref> noted that Brodmann’s original problem of defining precise homologs between rodent and primate OFC with comparable cytoarchitecture still remains (an argument that some researchers have maintained, for example <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Preuss, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Rolls, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Rudebeck and Murray, 2011a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Wise, 2008</xref>). The solution to this problem has been to base rodent and primate OFC homology on a combination of similar connectivity and functional evidence (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Roesch and Schoenbaum, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Rudebeck and Murray, 2014</xref>).</p><p>The hallmark behavioural consequences of OFC lesions in rodents and primates, critical to establishing cross-species homology, have been questioned. For example, deficits in extinction learning have been cited and form the basis of models of OFC function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Butter, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kolb et al., 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wilson et al., 2014</xref>), but have been poorly replicated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Burke et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Panayi and Killcross, 2014</xref>). The two behavioural disturbances following OFC damage that have dominated the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Murray et al., 2007</xref>) are impaired reversal learning and outcome devaluation deficits. Recently, the robustness of reversal learning deficits following OFC lesions in primates has been challenged as an artefact of aspiration lesions which can cause unintended damage to neighbouring white matter tracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Rudebeck et al., 2013</xref>). Fibre sparing excitotoxic lesions fail to replicate reversal learning deficits but do significantly disrupt outcome devaluation in primates. This finding has important implications for questions of homology between primate and rodent OFC as it suggests very few functional similarities exist. However, the apparent lack of functional similarities may be a consequence of poor OFC subregion specificity within the rodent and primate literature.</p><p>Our findings provide the first evidence of a dissociation of devaluation and reversal learning deficits within anterior and posterior regions of the lateral OFC subregion. Specifically, both anterior and posterior LO are necessary for updating behaviour based on the current value of expected outcomes (i.e. disrupt devaluation performance), but only posterior LO appears to be necessary for rapidly updating behaviour when predictive cue-outcome contingencies change (i.e. reversal learning deficits). Recently <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Murray et al. (2015)</xref> provided similar demonstrations of functional dissociations between anterior (area 11) and posterior (area 13) macaque OFC in Pavlovian outcome devaluation. Together these data suggest the importance of anterior-posterior differences in OFC subregions that complement the growing literature on functional differences between medial and lateral OFC subregions in both rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Balleine et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bradfield et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Corwin et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Izquierdo, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mar et al., 2011</xref>) and primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bouret and Richmond, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Noonan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Rudebeck and Murray, 2011a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Walton et al., 2015</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Theoretical accounts of OFC function</title><p>The importance of differentiating OFC subregions has implications for theories of OFC function. One class of theories of OFC function proposes that the OFC represents information about the sensory specific properties of expected outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Burke et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Delamater, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Schoenbaum and Esber, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Schoenbaum et al., 2009</xref>). During Pavlovian conditioning in normal animals, a stimulus may form associations with multiple features of a reward such as its general motivational properties and sensory specific properties; Associative activation of these different properties can lead to different classes of responses such as general preparatory or specific consummatory responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Delamater, 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dickinson and Dearing, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hall, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Konorski, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wagner and Brandon, 1989</xref>). Here, the OFC is proposed as the neural substrate of the associatively activated representation of an expected reward’s sensory specific properties. For example, if an animal learns that a tone stimulus predicts lemon flavoured sucrose reward, then in the presence of the tone and in anticipation of reward delivery the OFC might represent information about the lemon flavour, viscous fluid properties, and sweet taste of the upcoming reward. This theory accounts for the effect of OFC lesions in outcome devaluation since an animal needs to know which outcome is predicted (outcome identity) to selectively reduce anticipatory responding for a no-longer valuable outcome.</p><p>Model-based theories of OFC function can be considered modern extensions of these sensory-specific encoding accounts. When the sensory-sensory associations formed between a CS and the sensory properties of a reward are relevant to solving a task (as in outcome devaluation), they can be interpreted more generally as forming part of the task structure. We propose that our lesioned animals could represent the specific properties of the expected outcome but could not use this representation/underlying task-structure to access the current motivational value of that outcome. This proposal is in line with sensory specific outcome expectancy theories of OFC function but suggests a limited role for the anterior LO in accessing the current/updated expected value of an outcome based on its sensory properties and using this to modulate behaviour accordingly. It may be that a unified representation of an expected outcome, such as predicted likelihood, taste, location, hedonic value, and motivational value is represented across multiple OFC subregions.</p><p>Further evidence for the distribution of these representations across multiple OFC subregions in rodents comes from recent studies showing similar dissociations. For example, we replicated the absence of an effect of anterior LO lesions on sensory specific Pavlovian-to-instrumental transfer (sPIT, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ostlund and Balleine, 2007a</xref>), a procedure that requires inferences between a number of hidden task states. In contrast, larger pre-training lesions encompassing both LO and VO do disrupt the sPIT effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Balleine et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Scarlet et al., 2012</xref>), but not instrumental outcome devaluation. Recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Parkes et al. (2018)</xref> showed that chemogenetic disruption of posterior LO and DLO can disrupt instrumental devaluation under certain training conditions. Together, these findings suggest that the role of the OFC as a whole may be to generate a cognitive map of underlying task structure. However, the encoding and subsequent use of these underlying task structures to guide behaviour appears to be distributed amongst the many orbital subregions.</p><p>A similar conclusion is reached by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Murray et al. (2015)</xref> in macaques, who found that temporary inactivation of anterior OFC (area 11) disrupted satiety devaluation when inactivation occurred at test but not when inactivation occurred during the satiety devaluation procedure prior to test. In contrast, posterior OFC (area 13) inactivation only disrupted performance when inactivated during the satiety procedure but not at test. This suggests that posterior OFC in macaques is necessary for updating the value of expected rewards, whereas anterior OFC is critical for translating this knowledge into behaviour. This parallels our suggested role for the anterior LO in rodents in accessing the current value of an expected outcome to guide behaviour. Furthermore, this potential homology predicts that posterior LO in rodents might be important for value updating. Our findings provide prima facie evidence for this prediction, showing that posterior LO lesions suppress overall levels of Pavlovian learning, and extinction of learnt value during reversal learning, consistent with impoverished value updating. However, direct tests of this dissociation are still needed to confirm this homology between rodent and non-human primate OFC.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>Rats were housed four per cage in ventilated Plexiglass cages in a temperature regulated (22 ± 1°C) and light regulated (12 hr light/dark cycle, lights on at 7:00 AM) colony room.

Sessions were separated by at least 2 hr.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Experiment 1. instrumental devaluation by LiCl taste aversion</title><p>All animals received 2 separate sessions of training each day with the pellet and sucrose rewards, an instrumental lever training session (lever extended) and a magazine training (lever retracted) session with non-contingent reward delivery to provide equivalent exposure to the alternative reward. The order of training sessions and the identity of the instrumental and alternate reward were fully counterbalanced across all groups. All training session were separated by a period of at least 2 hr.</p><p>First, animals were familiarised with lever training using a fixed ratio 1 schedule (FR1, reward delivered on each lever press), for 60 mins or until a maximum of 25 rewards were earned. The alternative, non-instrumental, reward was delivered on an RT30s (random time 30 s) schedule for 1 hr or until 25 rewards had been delivered.</p><p>Instrumental acquisition training occurred on the following 3 days. Instrumental training sessions lasted until 40 rewards were achieved and lever pressing was rewarded on a RI30s schedule (random interval 30 s such that on average every 30 s a reward becomes available to reward the next lever press). The alternate reward session involved an RT30s schedule for 40 rewards. The use of interval and time based schedules of reinforcement was designed to match the instrumental and alternate reward sessions so that all experiences were identical except for the presence (and response requirement) of the lever in the instrumental session.</p><p>Following devaluation of the reward by taste aversion, all animals were tested with the instrumental lever to assess devaluation. The test was conducted under extinction and the lever was extended for 10 mins. On the following day, all animals were given a 20 min re-acquisition test to assess devaluation in the presence of the instrumental reinforcer (RI30s schedule).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Taste aversion</title><p>Following instrumental training all animals received taste aversion training on one of the reinforcers. Half the animals in each surgery condition (sham and lesion) were allocated to a devalued or a non-devalued group after being matched on their level of instrumental performance. The devalued groups received pairings of the instrumental reinforcer paired with 0.15M LiCl injections i.p. (15 mL/Kg) after 30 mins of individual access to that reinforcer in the devaluation chamber. The non-devalued groups received similar LiCl injections following access to the alternate (i.e. non-instrumental) reinforcer. On alternating days (order counterbalanced) all groups received 0.9% w/v saline injections (15 mL/Kg) following 30 mins access to the reinforcer that was not paired with LiCl. This procedure was repeated over 6 days such that all animals received 3 reinforcer-LiCl pairings and 3 reinforcer-saline pairings. Therefore, all animals had one reinforcer devalued with LiCl such that in the devalued groups it was the instrumental reinforcer and in the non-devalued groups it was the alternate reinforcer.</p><p>All animals were given an additional day without injections at the end of the taste aversion procedure before any further behavioural testing was conducted. This minimised the possibility of nausea persisting at test after the final LiCl injection, and ensured that all animals were at a comparable level of hunger at test.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Experiment 2: pavlovian devaluation by LiCl taste aversion</title><sec id="s4-9-1"><title>Histology and lesion group allocation</title><p>Lesion damage is depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>. Lesion extent was judged by a trained observer blind to group allocation. Once approximate lesion extent was drawn, a second trained observer (also blind to surgical conditions) independently verified the extent of the drawn lesions and the grounds for exclusion. Animals were excluded if there was only unilateral OFC damage, evidence of damage to the dorsal part of the anterior olfactory nucleus ventral to OFC or if there was extensive damage to the white matter of the forceps minor of the corpus callosum. Seven animals were excluded due to the presence of infection that was evident across the entirety of the frontal cortex, and a further two animals were excluded due to illness throughout behavioural training. Three animals were excluded due to insufficient bilateral damage to OFC structures. Seven animals were excluded based on significant unilateral or bilateral damage to the dorsal part of the anterior olfactory nucleus. One animal was excluded due to almost complete unilateral damage to primary and secondary motor areas M1 and M2, ventral to the OFC. Final group numbers were sham <italic>n</italic> = 13, lesion <italic>n</italic> = 31 (<italic>N</italic> = 44).</p><p>The lesion drawings were then analysed to establish the extent of damage to the subregions of the OFC from which two distinct lesion groups could be formed. OFC lesions were predominantly confined to LO and DLO as in previous experiments and were distributed across a large anterior-posterior range. This observation was quantified by estimating the percentage of bilateral damage across all OFC structures at 7 coronal planes (+5.20 to +2.20 mm from bregma in steps of 0.50 mm). At each coronal plane the total area of each orbital structure and the total area of lesion damage were estimated (number of pixels counted using Adobe Photoshop CS; San Jose, CA). Bilateral damage was defined by comparing the hemisphere with the smallest lesion area for each orbital subregion and the total area of the structure in that hemisphere. Total OFC damage at each section was defined by the sum of damaged area relative to the sum of the total area of each orbital structure that is % Bilateral OFC damage = <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:mn>100</mml:mn> <mml:mi/><mml:mi>x</mml:mi> <mml:mi/><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi>T</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi> <mml:mi/><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi> <mml:mi/><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>T</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi> <mml:mi/><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>b</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi> <mml:mi/><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>u</mml:mi><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>u</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi> <mml:mi/><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:math></inline-formula>. The OFC structures included in this analysis were LO, DLO, VO, AI, AId and AIv, however the damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) was relatively confined to LO and DLO. Most animals had OFC damage at +3.70 mm from bregma, so anterior and posterior lesions were based on comparing relative lesion volume anterior (+5.20, +4.70, +4.20 mm) and posterior (+3.20, +2.70, +2.20) to this point. Animals with a greater lesion damage anterior to +3.70 were assigned to the anterior OFC lesion group, and animals with greater lesion damage posterior to +3.70 were allocated to the posterior OFC group. While these criteria for anterior and posterior OFC were based on the present sample, these criteria also define the anterior-posterior split that defines DLO and AId/AIv, and the presence of the forceps minor of the corpus callosum, which supports the external validity of these criteria.</p><p>Final lesion group numbers were anterior <italic>n</italic> = 16, posterior <italic>n</italic> = 15. A Group (anterior, posterior) x Plane (+5.20, +4.70, +4.20, +3.70, +3.20, +2.70, +2.20) mixed ANOVA analysing the percentage bilateral lesion volume (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) revealed no significant overall effect of Group (<italic>F</italic><sub>(1, 29)</sub>=0.21, p=0.65) but a significant main effect of Plane (<italic>F</italic><sub>(6, 174)</sub>=64.07, p&lt;0.001) and Group x Plane interaction (<italic>F</italic><sub>(6, 174)</sub>=17.70, p&lt;0.001).

These differences indicate that the grouping criteria were effective at creating partially overlapping but distinct lesion groups.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Acquisition</title><p>Pavlovian acquisition training occurred over 12 days involving one session of training per day. Each session consisted of 32 trials with a 90 s ITI, 15 s CS duration co-terminating with the delivery of a single reward. Two CS (5 Hz click and 78 dB white noise) and US (grain pellet and lemon sucrose) relationships were maintained throughout training such that rats always experienced 16 of each unique CS-US pairings each session (counterbalanced).</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Taste aversion</title><p>Taste aversion to one of the rewards (counterbalanced) was achieved by pairing reward consumption with nausea induced by Lithium Chloride (LiCl; Sigma-Aldrich, Switzerland). All rats received 3 pairings of one reward with an i.p. injection of 0.15 M LiCl (15 mL/Kg) and 3 pairings of the other reward with saline (0.9% w/v; Sigma-Aldrich, Switzerland). The first 2 food-injection pairings occurred immediately after providing rats with 30 mins free access to the reward in the devaluation chambers. The final food-injection pairings occurred in the test chamber after rats were exposed to a magazine training session with one of the reinforcers (reward delivered randomly on an RT60 s schedule for 16 rewards). The order of food-injection pairings was counterbalanced and alternated across the 6 days of taste aversion training. The final food-injection pairings in the test chamber were conducted to ensure that the taste aversion transferred between the devaluation chambers and the testing chambers. All animals were given an additional day without injections at the end of the taste aversion procedure before any further behavioural testing was conducted. This minimised the possibility of nausea persisting at test after the final LiCl injection, and ensured that all animals were at a comparable level of hunger at test.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Devaluation test</title><p>Devaluation testing was identical to Pavlovian acquisition training except that it was performed under extinction that is no rewards were delivered throughout the session. The identity of the first and second cue and was predetermined at test to allow for counterbalancing. Animals were tested again on the following day with the identity of the first cue changed to fully counterbalance the test procedure.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>US specific reinstatement</title><p>After the final devaluation test, all rats received a US-specific reinstatement test to verify whether any failure of devaluation was due to impaired retention of the acquired taste aversion. On each day animals were pre-exposed to a single US type within the test chamber before being tested with 8 presentations in extinction of the CS that predicted the US. Exposure sessions involved a 5 min baseline period in which nothing happened in the chamber, followed by a reward delivery every 5 for 30 s (6 rewards), and then a post reward period of 5 mins. After the session, rats were temporarily returned to their home cage to allow for any remaining rewards to be collected for counting later and thorough cleaning of the reward site. Rats were then returned to the testing chamber for a test consisting of 8 CS presentations (90 s ITI) in extinction with the CS that predicted the recently delivered US. The order of outcome testing across both days was fully counterbalanced.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Re-acquisition</title><p>After reinstatement testing, all rats received 3 days of re-acquisition training. These were identical to Pavlovian acquisition training except that only the CS paired with the non-devalued CS was presented for all 32 trials.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Autoshaping</title><p>Following the reacquisition training, all animals were trained for 12 days on a discriminated autoshaping procedure where the non-devalued reward continued to serve as the US. Each session consisted of 32 trials with a 90 s ITI and 15 s CS duration, 16 rewarded CS+ trials and 16 non-rewarded CS- trials. The CS+ and CS- involved the insertion of the lever on the left or right hand side of the magazine (counterbalanced). Responding on the lever had no programmed consequences but was recorded for analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Reversal</title><p>Autoshaping was followed by reversal training for 12 days such that the CS+ and CS- contingencies were reversed that is the rewarded lever cue no longer predicted reward and the non-rewarded lever cue predicted reward.</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>Locomotor screening</title><p>All animals were tested for locomotor activity before surgery, and again at the end of training, to verify the absence of any effects on locomotor activity in a within-subjects design.</p></sec><sec id="s4-18"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Baseline responding.

PreCS responding was operationalized as the duration of responding during the 15 s immediately preceding the 15 s CS and was used as a measure of baseline responding to the testing context. All data were analysed with mixed ANOVAs, and significant interactions of interest were followed up with ANOVAs on the relevant subset of data.

It is likely that the increased responding to the pellet reinforcer is a result of the use of magazine frequency as a measure as we routinely observe the opposite pattern when using magazine duration as a measure (e.g. Experiment 2). Unfortunately, magazine duration data were not recorded during this experiment to determine whether the difference between sham and lesion groups was only present on this measure. Furthermore, it is important to note that this measure of Pavlovian conditioning is conflated with consummatory responses since the USs were delivered at random times throughout the CS, and as such it is hard to draw clear conclusions about any observed differences in responding.</p><p>Instrumental acquisition did not differ between groups, a pattern supported by a mixed Group x Day (12 days) ANOVA finding a significant main effect of Day (<italic>F</italic><sub>(11, 143)</sub>=58.15, p&lt;0.001) but no significant effect of Group (<italic>F</italic><sub>(1, 13)</sub>=1.62, p=0.23) or Group x Day interaction (<italic>F</italic><sub>(11, 143)</sub>=1.10, p=0.36).

Your article is being evaluated by three peer reviewers, and overseen by Geoffrey Schoenbaum as the Reviewing Editor and Sabine Kastner as the Senior Editor.</p><p>Given the list of essential revisions, including new experiments, the editors and reviewers invite you to respond within the next two weeks with an action plan and timetable for the completion of the additional work. We plan to share your responses with the reviewers and then issue a binding recommendation.</p><p>Overall the reviewers felt that the experiments addressed an extremely interesting and important set of questions, yielding intriguing and valuable results. However, all three reviewers had major concerns about the core experiment in Figure 2, claimed to show that the orbitofrontal cortex is not necessary for devaluation by satiety and, by extension, the authors strong conclusions that the orbitofrontal cortex is therefore not representing information about outcome identity. The reviews express the variety of these concerns, but perhaps the most critical is that the negative effect there comes against a backdrop of a very weak positive effect in controls. So, after discussions, it was felt that even with appropriate caveating and consideration of alternatives, it was not possible to accept this experiment. Two solutions were discussed.</p><p>1) Remove this experiment and focus the paper on the important and novel findings in Figure 4, Figure 5 and Figure 6. This would obviously mean extensive changes to the framing of the paper and the claims based on the negative results in Figure 2. However, this is not new experimental work. And it would allow the publication of what all the reviewers agreed were well-done and important and novel results.</p><p>2) Repeat experiment 2, ideally using a within subjects design where each animal is tested under both forms of devaluation or in a way that differences in lesion location are not an issue, and with rewards that differ only in sensory and not motivational properties. This would represent substantially more work, but would directly test the question at issue, without confounds of lesion or others noted. If this were done, it would obviously address the concerns and would be a great experiment, assuming the effects (positive or negative) were statistically robust and clear.</p><p>The reviewers felt that it was worth hearing a response from the authors before making a final decision.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>In this study the authors aim to clarify the role of central/lateral orbitofrontal cortex in a variety of different behaviors – instrumental versus Pavlovian behavior, illness versus satiety induced devaluation, and also reversal learning and sign tracking. In the process, they show that neurotoxic lesions of rat orbitofrontal cortex do not affect instrumental devaluation (between subjects) or Pavlovian devaluation by specific satiety (within subjects). They confirm that orbital lesions do affect Pavlovian devaluation by illness (within subjects), whether lesions were &quot;anterior&quot; or &quot;posterior&quot;, and they extend this finding by showing that presentation of the outcomes prior to testing restores normal behavior (somewhat like satiety). In addition to these results, they show that specific transfer is sensitive to satiety effects. And they produce novel data suggesting that their more posterior lesions also cause deficits in allocation of behavior in a sign tracking task, both during acquisition and reversal learning. From these results, the authors draw fairly strong conclusions regarding this collection of areas. Overall, I think the areas of conflicts the authors have tried to address are important, and the data they provide are valuable. They represent a wealth of diverse and very interesting results. However, the designs and how the studies fit together are not ideal, and as a result I am uncomfortable with the strong conclusion and framework the authors put on their data. I think their results with regard to Pavlovian devaluation are open to a variety of other interpretations that are basically not acknowledged. I also think that the paper would be simpler and clearer if it were divided into two. That is, the points regarding devaluation are dissociable from the points regarding reversal learning and sign tracking.</p><p>Regarding the devaluation experiments, the main conclusion is that the orbitofrontal cortex is not involved in representation of information about the sensory features of expected outcomes. This is based on two pieces of information: (1) the finding that pre-training orbitofrontal lesions did not affect Pavlovian devaluation by selective satiation, whereas similar lesions do affect Pavlovian devaluation by illness (here and elsewhere) and (2) the idea that satiety, unlike illness, can affect responding either through a change in the desirability of the outcome or via a sort of habituation effect on the sensory representation of the outcome. The authors seem to be proposing that the orbitofrontal cortex (writ large) is doing the former but not the latter. I have several problems with basing this strong conclusion on these data.</p><p>First, I think that to the extent there is a second way that satiety (because of its proximity to testing) but not illness (because of its distance) can affect behavior, the results may show that the area lesioned is not required for this sensory habituation mechanism, but they cannot show that the area is not involved in the representation of the information. And it is clear from numerous studies that value-neutral information about predicted events is represented in the areas targeted here, in rats, monkeys and humans. Given this, the strong conclusion, expressed even in the title, seems unwarranted.</p><p>Second, I think the authors are ignoring causal studies that suggest the information about upcoming sensory events in orbitofrontal cortex is necessary for behavior, at least in some circumstances. For example, inactivation of this area affects performance and learning that depends on such information in a sensory preconditioning task (Jones et al., 2012). Also, while pre-training lesions do not affect specific transfer, post-training lesions or post-training manipulations of afferents from amygdala do affect specific transfer (Lichtenberg et al., 2018; Ostlund and Balleine, 2007). The authors do not discuss these results, but I think they are quite important. At a minimum they show that if the brain is allowed to learn normally, the orbitofrontal cortex is in fact necessary for using information about identity. Perhaps the intact performance here reflects how the lesioned brain learns the original information, rather than some dichotomy in how information about reward identity is used in devaluation by illness versus satiety.</p><p>In any event, in light of these other studies, I think the failure to affect satiety here ends up looking more like a special case or an exception to the rule than a strong demonstration that orbitofrontal cortex either does not represent this information or has it but is not using it.</p><p>In addition, I think there are other differences between illness and satiety that are relevant and not considered. One is simply the strength of the effect. Illness is presumably stronger than satiety in changing behavior, both generally and in the two studies that are compared here. Perhaps it is this weakness that supports the negative finding and not a fundamental difference in the areas involvement in devaluation by satiety. Another difference is that satiety is something that can be experienced previously during training, since over the course of training the rats gain experience with the cues in various stages of satiation. This prior experience could allow for the adjustment of behavior to some extent without the sort of processing proposed to depend on orbitofrontal cortex. Illness induced devaluation is not subject to this potential confound. Third it seems to me that the two outcomes used here differ not only in their sensory properties but also in their motivational basis. Pellets satisfy hunger, whereas sucrose satisfies hunger and thirst. Possibly the selective satiation affects behavior through these motivational mechanisms and that is what is not dependent on orbitofrontal cortex? Any or some combination of these proposals could explain the negative effects.</p><p>Finally, I think there are also differences in the lesions in the satiety and devaluation experiments – at least it looks to me like the lesions in figure 4 are larger and more lateral, which I think would be more likely to yield effects. Hindsight is easy, but a within subjects design for this critical comparison would have been better. As it stands, there are key lateral areas that seem to be more involved in the experiment where there are lesion effects.</p><p>Despite these issues, I do regard the individual experiments as well done and the overall topic is excellent and worth investigating, so I think the authors have valuable results that can help inform future work. I could imagine a different manuscript that more fairly considers these and perhaps other alternatives.</p><p>My preference would also be to separate the devaluation studies from those on reversal and sign tracking data. I fewer issues with these data and their interpretation, maybe because their conclusions are less strong and more alternatives are considered. But I think their presence detracts from a full consideration of the other data.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>This manuscript presents data from several experiments in rats that focus on the effects of orbitofrontal cortex lesions on devaluation. Individual experiments vary in the type of devaluation (specific satiety, taste aversion), lesion location (anterior, posterior), or learning (Pavlovian, instrumental). The main conclusion is that OFC does not represent sensory features of the outcome. This is based primarily on the finding that OFC lesions only diminish Pavlovian devaluation by taste aversion but not specific satiety (in conjunction with the assumption that habituation, leading to an inability to represent outcome features, is the defining difference between the two devaluation methods). In addition, there is evidence regarding a functional differentiation between anterior and posterior OFC.</p><p>This manuscript is well written and presents a large amount of interesting experimental data. My overall concern is that the conclusions are not well justified. They are based on a combination of null results and qualitative comparisons between different experiments which differ in more than one factor. For instance, the two key experiments (Figure 2 and Figure 4) differ not only in devaluation method but also in lesion location (and there is evidence that this may be important). In addition, besides habituation, there are other differences between the two devaluation methods that may explain the current findings and considering these would change the conclusions.</p><p>1) The main conclusion that OFC does not represent specific outcome properties is based on an assumption about the key difference between devaluation by specific satiety and taste aversion. Because specific satiety involves repeated exposure to the US, it &quot;involves habituation of the sensory systems required to represent the sensory properties of the outcome.&quot; There are two issues with this assumption. (1) Even if specific satiety induces habituation of the sensory systems, it is unclear whether this would also diminish representations of predicted sensory features in OFC and the ability to retrieve the updated value of these outcomes. (2) There are more prominent differences between the two forms of devaluation that may explain the current results. Most importantly, whereas specific satiety slightly reduces the value of the US, taste aversion involves a much more dramatic change in value and can thus be expected to result in a relatively stronger devaluation effect. Indeed, comparing the effects of the two devaluation methods on behavior in the Sham group shows that taste aversion reduces magazine activity by about 40% (Figure 4F), whereas specific satiety changes behavior by only about 20% (Figure 2C). Thus, differences between the two methods could simply result from differences in their effectiveness. If the effect of devaluation by specific satiety is too small in the Sham group, the probability to detect differences between groups decreases.</p><p>2) In line with this, effects of Pavlovian devaluation by satiety were modest (Figure 2C). The authors report a significant main effect of devaluation, but are the effects within each group (Sham and lesion) individually significant? The devaluation effect in the OFC group appears smaller compared to the Sham group. Is it possible that the devaluation effect is driven by the Sham but not the Lesion group, and that the experiment was underpowered to find group differences?</p><p>3) The conclusion that OFC lesions affect Pavlovian devaluation by taste aversion, but not specific satiety is based on a positive and a null result from different experiments. However, the lesions for Pavlovian devaluation by satiety were more anterior compared to the lesions in the taste aversion experiment (Figure 2A and Figure 4A). Thus, the two experiments differ not only in the devaluation method but also in lesion location. Given that the results of Pavlovian devaluation by taste aversion may depend on where the lesion is made in OFC, this difference should not be taken lightly. To convincingly demonstrate that the devaluation method matters, both methods should be compared directly within the same experiment and with the same lesion location.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>In this report, the effects of lateral OFC lesions on a variety of behavioral tasks are presented. First, replicating previous results, pre-training LO lesions are shown not to affect sensitivity of instrumental responding to devaluation, suggesting intact action-outcome signaling. In contrast to previous reports, LO lesions are shown not to affect sensitivity of a Pavlovian CR to devaluation induced by sensory-specific satiety. The expression of specific PIT is shown to be sensitive to sensory-specific satiety, which the authors interpret as an indication that sensory-specific satiety acts via habituation of the sensory-specific features of the outcome and, thus, that LO is not required for representing such features. The most interesting and clear finding is the dissociability of anterior v. posterior OFC necessity for sensitivity of the Pavlovian response to devaluation, sign-tracking, and reversal learning. This report has many strengths including the thorough statistical reporting, multi-faceted behavioral analysis, combination of behaviors, and anterior v. posterior OFC analysis. The anterior v. posterior OFC lesions effects are especially exciting. Enthusiasm is somewhat diminished by the lack of clear support for many of the main conclusions (described below) and the limitations of the lesion approach used here. The relevance of this data to the broad readership of <italic>eLife</italic> over a more specialized journal is also not immediately clear, though this could be remedied.</p><p>1) My primary concern is that many of the conclusions in this report do not appear to be fully supported.</p><p>a) &quot;[…] directly confirm the dissociable role of the rodent OFC in Pavlovian but not instrumental behavioural flexibility following outcome devaluation&quot;. While I don't totally disagree, this is not directly shown here because there is no direct comparison between instrumental and Pavlovian CR sensitivity to the same form of devaluation within subjects with the same lesions. Indeed, the extent of the lesion, esp. in the lateral and posterior domains was different between the data in Figure 1 and Figure 2 and Figure 4. I suggest removing or tempering this language.</p><p>b) &quot;OFC lesions in rodents only disrupt the Pavlovian outcome devaluation effect when outcome value is manipulated by taste aversion but not specific satiety.&quot; This cannot be interpreted here for two reasons. First, this was not directly assessed between subjects with similar lesions. Indeed, the extent of the lesion is quite different for the subjects in Figure 2 v. Figure 4 and that is a major important finding that more posterior but not anterior lesions disrupt sensitivity of the Pavlovian CR to devaluation, leaving open the possibility that more posterior OFC lesions would also disrupt sensitivity to devaluation by sensory-specific satiety. Second, the efficacy of the sensory-specific satiety manipulation was not confirmed here with post-test consumption. Indeed, the sensory-specific satiety devaluation effect is not very convincing here in control subjects.</p><p>c) &quot;Using a specific PIT test, we establish that, unlike taste aversion devaluation, specific satiety devaluation can act via a reduction in the efficacy of sensory specific outcome properties&quot;. While it is intriguing that PIT is sensitivity to sensory-specific satiety devaluation, to support this interpretation the authors would have to show that with their specific PIT procedures that PIT is not sensitive to taste aversion devaluation. It remains plausible that these findings indicate that during PIT subjects are using the CS to retrieve a representation of the outcome and its current value then determines whether the rat will press or not. Moreover, that these graphs lack any indication of error or variance makes these data difficult to interpret and, on top of this, the PIT effect size at ~1 press/min is much smaller than previous reports, including most of the reports cited as previous evidence for lack of PIT sensitivity to taste aversion, likely owing to the different procedures used.</p><p>d) The title: &quot;The rodent lateral orbitofrontal cortex represents expected Pavlovian outcome value but not identity&quot;. Loss of function studies cannot tell you what information is represented or especially what information is not represented, this would require recordings. Moreover, that all the lesions were pre-training further confounds ability to interpret their effects on initial learning, updating, v. retrieval of stimulus-outcome memories. I suggest changing the title to better reflect the type of assessment provided by the data.</p><p>2) The difference in taste aversion and specific satiety results here is hypothesized to result from the possibility of sensory-specific satiety acts via habituation of the sensory-specific features of the outcome. This becomes crucial for the interpretation of the lesion results. But there are other differences between taste aversion and sensory-specific satiety. Taste aversion is certainly more severe; it is also a permanent, consolidated memory. This possibility and its relevance to interpretation of the OFC lesions results should be considered.</p><p>3) There are several previous findings that are seemingly contradictory to these results that are not, but should be discussed here, including data showing the representation of reward features and identity in human lateral OFC (see recent work from Kahnt and O'Doherty labs), evidence that post-training OFC lesions disrupt expression of specific PIT (Ostlund and Balleine), and evidence that inactivation of amygdala projections to lateral OFC disrupts both specific PIT and sensitivity of the Pavlovian CR to sensory-specific satiety devaluation (recent Wassum lab paper). These recording papers are also of relevance to the interpretation here: Mcdannald et al., 2014 Stalnaker et al., 2014.</p><p>4) The lesions here are purported to be &quot;focal LO&quot; lesions. By my eye they include VLO and this should be clarified.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Functional heterogeneity within the rodent lateral orbitofrontal cortex dissociates outcome devaluation and reversal learning deficits&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.

Most important were issues #1 and 3 raised by reviewer 3.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>In this revised and more focused report the authors replicate previous findings that lOFC lesions disrupt sensitivity of Pavlovian conditional responding to devaluation, but do not disrupt instrumental devaluation. They nicely demonstrate the Pavlovian devaluation effect for both anterior and posterior lOFC lesions. They also show that posterior lOFC lesions disrupt acquisition of a sign-tracking conditional response and the reversal of this response, whereas anterior lOFC lesions spare this behavior. The report provides a nice addition to the OFC literature. I do have a few remaining concerns regarding the interpretation and discussion of the data.</p><p>1) The data in Figure 2G are interpreted as demonstrating that the anterior and posterior lOFC lesions did not cause &quot;a failure to acquire sensory specific cue-outcome associations&quot; and that the deficits in Pavlovian devaluation are &quot;specific to recalling the new value of the devalued outcome and/or integrating it into appropriate behavioural control&quot;. See subsection “Outcome Devaluation”, subsection “Rodent and primate homology” and subsection “Theoretical accounts of OFC function”. I don't think this claim can be made for two reasons. (1) During this test the animals get feedback about their entries that will change the likelihood that they will enter subsequently. Thus, they need not have learned the specific cue-outcome relationships to show reduced performance during the devalued CS in this task. (2) The lesion was not restricted to training or test, thus making it impossible to distinguish learning v. recall effects- of which both are likely at play. Thus, it cannot be concluded that the lOFC is selectively important for recalling the new value or outcome information, or with a &quot;selective role for the OFC in Pavlovian model-based inferences&quot;. To be clear, I do not disagree that the lOFC is important for retrieving outcome information, there are clear data that support its function in this regard, but the pre-training lesion data here cannot be used to support a selective role in retrieval or inference and not one in encoding.</p><p>2) It remains the case that the findings of deficits in initial acquisition from posterior lOFC lesions makes it difficult to interpret a reversal learning deficit here.</p><p>3) There is very little consideration of the limitations of the pre-training lesion approach selected here. Encoding v. retrieval, compensatory mechanisms, etc. These limitations are important to understanding the present results and should be discussed. Also, in my opinion the discussion is too long. It reads more like a review paper than a discussion of the present results. I suggest making it much shorter.</p><p>4) Figure 1D.

We note here that bilateral damage was mostly confined to LO. Bilateral damage to VO was minimal when present. We examined whether there were any specific correlations between our estimates of damage to any of the OFC subregions and devaluation/sign-tracking/reversal effects but found no significant relationships that might indicate that damage to any of these other regions might be important for these effects.</p><p>It is also of note that the designation of VLO is not always used. This region was originally demarcated as the orbital surface directly above the ‘orbital notch’ (Krettek and Price, 1977). This places the structure half-way between VO and LO (which we have distinguished as medial and lateral to the orbital notch). Close inspection of a number of lesion and neuroanatomical projection studies indicate that VLO may not be a unique structure, and most effects attributed to this structure are driven by damage to VO e.g. an attentional circuit appears to exist between VO, dorsocentral striatum, and posterior parietal cortex (Burcham et al., 1997; Cheatwood, Corwin and Reep, 2005; Cheatwood, Reep and Corwin, 2003; Conte et al., 2008; Corwin et al., 1994; Corwin and Reep, 1998; King, Corwin and Reep, 1989; Reep, Cheatwood and Corwin, 2003; Reep, Corwin and King, 1996; Reep et al., 1994; Reep and Corwin, 1999, 2009; Van Vleet et al., 2000; VanVleet et al., 2002; Vargo et al., 1988). However, we have not directly tested or dissociated the adjacent VO/LO regions, so we can only rely on secondary sources to support this conclusion. It is clear that our understanding of neuroanatomical and functional distinctions within the rodent OFC is still quite poor.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>[…] 1) The data in Figure 2G are interpreted as demonstrating that the anterior and posterior lOFC lesions did not cause &quot;a failure to acquire sensory specific cue-outcome associations&quot; and that the deficits in Pavlovian devaluation are &quot;specific to recalling the new value of the devalued outcome and/or integrating it into appropriate behavioural control&quot;.

This limitation has been acknowledged when discussing this result:</p><p>“However, this result must be interpreted with caution as it is possible that re-exposure to the devalued US in the magazine resulted in some form of short-term avoidance to the magazine that persisted throughout the subsequent test session when the devalued CS was presented.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) It remains the case that the findings of deficits in initial acquisition from posterior lOFC lesions makes it difficult to interpret a reversal learning deficit here.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the acquisition deficit does make the reversal deficit harder to interpret, but in general reversal learning procedures are quite complex and any deficit is hard to interpret without pursuing simpler follow up tasks to probe the nature of the deficit.
