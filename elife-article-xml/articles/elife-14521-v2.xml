Here, using MEG we directly investigated how these visual signals interact with rhythmic brain activity in participants listening to and seeing the speaker. First, we investigated coherence between oscillatory brain activity and speaker’s lip movements and demonstrated significant entrainment in visual cortex. We then used partial coherence to remove contributions of the coherent auditory speech signal from the lip-brain coherence. Comparing this synchronization between different attention conditions revealed that attending visual speech enhances the coherence between activity in visual cortex and the speaker’s lips. Further, we identified a significant partial coherence between left motor cortex and lip movements and this partial coherence directly predicted comprehension accuracy. Our results emphasize the importance of visually entrained and attention-modulated rhythmic brain activity for the enhancement of audiovisual speech processing.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.14521.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.14521.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14521.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>People are able communicate effectively with each other even in very noisy places where it is difficult to actually hear what others are saying.

In a dialogue, a large range of dynamic signals are exchanged between interlocutors including body posture, (emotional) facial expressions, head and eye movements, gestures and a rich acoustic speech signal. Movements of the lips contain sufficient information to allow trained observers to comprehend speech through visual signals. Even for untrained observers and in the presence of auditory signals, lip movements can be beneficial for speech comprehension when the acoustic signal is degraded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Peelle and Sommers, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sumby and Pollack, 1954</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">van Wassenhove et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zion-Golumbic and Schroeder, 2012</xref>). Dynamic lip movements support disambiguation of syllables and can provide temporal onset cues for upcoming words or syllables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chandrasekaran et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Grant and Seitz, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kim and Davis, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Schroeder et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schwartz and Savariaux, 2014</xref>).</p><p>However, it has remained unclear how dynamic lip movements during continuous speech are represented in the brain and how these visual representations interact with the encoding of the acoustic speech signal. A potential underlying mechanism for the visual enhancement of hearing could be the synchronization of brain rhythms between interlocutors, which has been implicated in the encoding of acoustic speech (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Giraud and Poeppel, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hasson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pickering and Garrod, 2013</xref>). Indeed, continuous speech and the associated lip movements show temporal modulations at the syllabic rate (3–8 Hz) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chandrasekaran et al., 2009</xref>). These signals produced in the speaker’s motor system supposedly lead to resonance in the listener’s brain that facilitates speech comprehension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Giraud and Poeppel, 2012</xref>). The hallmark of such a process is the synchronization of brain activity at the frequency of dominant rhythmic components in the communication signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Schroeder et al., 2008</xref>). Consistent with this idea, previous studies have demonstrated the frequency-specific synchronization between brain activity and continuous auditory speech signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahissar et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ding and Simon, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gross et al., 2013b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Luo and Poeppel, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Peelle et al., 2013</xref>) at frequencies below 10 Hz. This synchronization was found to be stronger for intelligible than non-intelligible speech and facilitated by top-down signals from left inferior frontal and motor areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ding and Simon, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kayser et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Park et al., 2015</xref>) as well as during attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zion-Golumbic and Schroeder, 2012</xref>).</p><p>The correlated temporal dynamics of the acoustic and lip signals raise the possibility that lip-mediated benefits for hearing rely on similar entrainment mechanisms in the observer as the acoustic component. This is plausible as the auditory speech entrainment and speech intelligibility are enhanced when congruent visual speech is present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Crosse et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zion Golumbic et al., 2013</xref>). Still, the neural representations of dynamic lip signals and their dependence on attention and the acoustic speech component remain unclear.</p><p>Here we directly tested four hypotheses: First, we hypothesized that rhythmic components in visual speech entrain brain activity in the observer. Second, to test whether benefits arising from seeing the speaker’s lip movements are mediated through mechanism other than those implicated in auditory entrainment, we asked whether and which brain areas synchronize to lip movements independently of auditory signals. Third, we hypothesized that the synchronization between visual speech and brain activity is modulated by attention and congruence of visual and auditory signals. Finally, we tested whether any observed synchronization is relevant for speech comprehension.</p><p>We recorded MEG signals while participants perceived continuous audiovisual speech. To dissociate the synchronization to attended and unattended visual and acoustic signals, we manipulated the congruency of visual and acoustic stimuli in four experimental conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14521.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Experimental conditions and behavioral results.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Four experimental conditions. ‘A’ denotes auditory stimulus and ‘V’ denotes visual stimulus.The number refers to the identity of each talk.

The areas include early visual (V1; Calcarine sulcus) and auditory (A1; Heschl’s gyrus) areas as well as inferior frontal gyrus (IFG; BA 44) (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref> for the other conditions at 1 Hz).</p><p>However, since the speech envelope and lip movements are coherent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), it may be that this lip entrainment is induced by speech entrainment and not by lip movements per se. Thus, we performed the same coherence analysis for the sound speech envelope. In accordance with previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gross et al., 2013b</xref>), we observed an extensive auditory network including Heschl’s gyrus and superior/middle temporal gyri bilaterally and left frontal areas (p&lt;0.05, FDR corrected; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>)(see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref> for different frequencies [2–5 Hz]). Statistical comparison of lip movement entrainment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) to sound speech entrainment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>) revealed significantly stronger lip entrainment in bilateral visual areas and stronger sound speech coherence in right superior temporal gyrus (p&lt;0.05, FDR corrected; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). This demonstrates significant entrainment of brain activity to the lip movements irrespective of entrainment to the acoustic speech signal. In addition, we found significant lip movement entrainment in visual areas in the absence of a congruent auditory stimulus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>). These results demonstrate for the first time the entrainment of cortical brain oscillations to lip movements during continuous speech.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Lip entrainment is modulated by attention and congruence</title><p>Next, we compared visual lip entrainment across conditions to test our hypothesis that entrainment changes with attention and the congruence of audiovisual stimuli. We focused our analysis on AV congruent condition where a distracting auditory speech stream is presented to one ear. Compared to the All congruent condition, AV congruent demands additional attention to visual speech because the visual signal is informative to disambiguate the two incongruent auditory streams. We therefore contrasted AV congruent with All congruent condition to capture the effect of visual attention. We also contrasted AV congruent condition with All incongruent condition to capture the effect of congruence.</p><p>Since lip and sound speech signals are coherent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), it is difficult to disentangle visual and auditory contributions to the lip movement entrainment. To measure lip-specific entrainment effects more directly, we computed partial coherence between lip movement signals and brain activity while removing the contribution of acoustic speech signals. This provides an estimate of entrainment by lip movement signals that cannot be explained by acoustic speech signals and allowed us to test our second hypothesis that lip entrainment is not mediated via acoustic entrainment. However, we repeated the same analysis using coherence instead of partial coherence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>First, we identified the frequency band showing the strongest attention effect by averaging voxels across visual cortex (superior/middle/inferior occipital gyri) defined from AAL (Automated Anatomical Labeling) ROI (Region-of-Interest) map.

For example, a recent study has demonstrated that the identity of different audiovisual movie stimuli can be decoded from delta-theta phase in occipital MEG sensors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Luo et al., 2010</xref>). In the auditory domain, this stimulus-specificity is at least partly due to a phase synchronization of rhythmic brain activity and the auditory speech envelope (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gross et al., 2013b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Peelle et al., 2013</xref>). Recent studies have shown that congruent visual stimulation facilitates auditory speech entrainment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Crosse et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zion Golumbic et al., 2013</xref>). Here, we extend these results by showing low-frequency phase synchronization between speakers’ lip movements and listeners’ brain activity. This visual entrainment is clearly distinct from auditory entrainment for three reasons. First, some areas show stronger entrainment to the visual compared than to the auditory stimulus. Second, removing the auditory contribution using partial coherence still results in significant visual entrainment. Third, we report visual entrainment in the absence of a congruent auditory stimulus. Together, this establishes the existence of a visual entrainment mechanism for audiovisual speech in addition to the well-studied auditory entrainment. In correspondence to the auditory domain, this effect relies on the quasi-rhythmic nature of visual speech that is particularly prominent in the subtle but salient lip movements.</p><p>Our coherence analysis reveals an extensive network comprising speech processing areas such as bilateral primary sensory areas (V1 (Calcarine sulcus; BA 17) and A1 [Heschl’s gyrus; BA 41]), extended sensory visual (BA 18/19) and auditory areas (superior/middle temporal gyri; BA 21/22/42), and posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS) as well as inferior frontal gyrus (IFG; BA 44/6). Although these areas show synchronization to lip movements, there is large overlap with areas showing synchronization to sound envelope. This is not surprising because both stimulus signals are coherent. But as expected, in occipital areas visual entrainment is significantly stronger compared to auditory entrainment.</p><p>An interesting asymmetry emerges in auditory areas in the comparison of lip entrainment to speech entrainment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). The right superior temporal cortex is significantly stronger coupled to speech envelope than to lip movements while there is no significant difference in left superior temporal cortex. This seems to suggest that visual speech predominantly entrains left temporal areas (in addition to visual areas). This is consistent with a recent fMRI study demonstrating preferential processing of visual speech in left superior temporal areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blank and von Kriegstein, 2013</xref>).</p><p>In summary, we find that visual areas are entrained by lip movements and left and right auditory areas by lip movements and speech envelope with only the right auditory cortex showing a stronger coupling to speech envelope compared to lip movements.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Attention and congruence modulate audiovisual entrainment</title><p>We studied the effect of attention in an ecologically valid scenario with congruent audiovisual speech when a distracting auditory stimulus was present (AV congruent condition) or absent (All congruent condition). While we did not explicitly manipulate attention in our paradigm, the distracting auditory stimulus in the AV congruent condition renders the visual speech relevant and informative. Attention to visual speech is known to help to disambiguate the competing auditory inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sumby and Pollack, 1954</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zion Golumbic et al., 2013</xref>). This condition was compared to the All congruent condition where attention to the visual stimulus is not required for speech comprehension.</p><p>Interestingly, attention to lip movements leads to significantly increased coupling in left hemispheric visual areas. Previous studies have demonstrated that observers process audiovisual speech preferentially based on information from the left side of a speaker’s face (observers’ right visual hemifield) as compared to the right side (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Behne et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Campbell et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Smeele et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Swerts and Krahmer, 2008</xref>) (but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nicholls and Searle, 2006</xref>). This has been related to an attentional bias to the observers’ right visual hemifield due to the left hemisphere dominance for speech processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Thompson et al., 2004</xref>). Since the right visual hemifield is represented in the left visual cortex, this attentional bias could explain the observed lateralization of entrainment.</p><p>While visual areas show both coherence and partial coherence to lip movements, temporal areas only emerge from coherence analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). This seems to suggest that the temporal alignment of auditory cortex activity to lip movements is not independant of the congruent acoustic speech stimulus and therefore speaks against a direct entrainment of auditory cortex activity by lip movements. However, the informativeness of lip movements still modulates significantly the coherence between lip movements and right temporal brain areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B,C,D</xref>) and indicates an indirect effect of visual attention. Similarly, left posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS) shows a significant effect of congruence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>) that is only evident in coherence and not in partial coherence map. This is consistent with previous reports of pSTS as a locus of multisensory integration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hocking and Price, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Noesselt et al., 2012</xref>) with particular relevance for visual speech recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beauchamp et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blank and von Kriegstein, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Werner and Noppeney, 2010</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Motor areas are entrained by speaking lips</title><p>Attended audiovisual speech leads to significant entrainment in left inferior precentral gyrus corresponding to the lip representation in motor cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C,D</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Giraud et al., 2007</xref>). In addition, partial coherence analysis where the effect of speech envelope on lip entrainment is removed reveals a more superior left lateralized motor area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B,C,D</xref>). Partial coherence in this area is modulated by congruence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>) and attention (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>) and predicts comprehension accuracy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). There is ample evidence for the activation of left motor cortex during audiovisual speech perception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Evans and Davis, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Meister et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mottonen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Watkins et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wilson et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Ylinen et al., 2015</xref>). Our results indicate that left motor areas are not only activated but also entrained by audiovisual speech. This establishes a precise temporal coupling between audiovisual sensory inputs and sensory and motor areas that could temporally coordinate neuronal computations associated with speech processing. As part of a proposed dorsal auditory pathway, motor areas could provide access to an internal forward model of speech that closely interacts with auditory sensory systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bornkessel-Schlesewsky et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rauschecker and Scott, 2009</xref>). During speech production, an efference copy is sent to auditory areas to allow for efficient monitoring and control. During speech perception, sensory signals could be used to constrain the forward model in simulating the speaker’s motor program and predicting upcoming sensory events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arnal and Giraud, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bornkessel-Schlesewsky et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lakatos et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Indeed, a recent study has demonstrated direct top-down control of left auditory cortex from left motor cortex during continuous speech processing.

This suggests that the motor cortex plays a predictive role in speech perception consistent with recent demonstrations of its contribution to the temporal precision of auditory speech perception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Morillon et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wilson et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Visual speech <italic>per se</italic> is not critical for speech comprehension, however, it facilitates auditory speech processing as it aids temporal prediction and can prime the auditory system for upcoming concordant auditory input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Peelle and Sommers, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">van Wassenhove et al., 2005</xref>). Overall, left motor cortex seems to be an important area for facilitating audiovisual speech processing through predictive control in auditory active sensing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Meister et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Morillon et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>In summary, our study provides the first direct evidence that lip movements during continuous speech entrain visual and motor areas, and that this entrainment is modulated by attention and congruence and is relevant for speech comprehension. This adds to similar findings in the auditory domain and provides a more comprehensive view of how temporally correlated auditory and visual speech signals are processed in the listener’s brain. Overall, our findings support an emerging model where rhythmic audiovisual signals entrain multisensory brain areas and dynamically interact with an internal forward model accessed via the auditory dorsal stream to form dynamically updated predictions that improve further sensory processing. Through these mechanisms brain oscillations might implement inter-subject synchronization and support the surprising efficiency of inter-human communication.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Participants</title><p>Data were obtained from 46 healthy subjects (26 females; age range: 18–30 years; mean age: 20.54 ± 2.58 years) and they were all right-handed confirmed by Edinburgh Handedness Inventory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Oldfield, 1971</xref>).

The talks were originally taken from TED talks (www.ted.com/talks/) and edited to be appropriate to the stimuli we used (e.g. editing words referring to visual materials, the gender of the speaker).</p><p>Eleven video clips were filmed by a professional filming company with high-quality audiovisual device and recorded in 1920 x 1080 pixels at 25 fps (frame per second) for video and sampling rate of 48 kHz for audio.</p><p>In a behavioral study, these videos were rated by 33 participants (19 females; aged 18–31 years; mean age: 22.27 ± 2.64 years) in terms of <italic>arousal, familiarity, valence, complexity, significance (informativeness), agreement (persuasiveness), concreteness, self-relatedness, and level of understanding</italic>. Participants were instructed to rate each talk on these 9 items using Likert scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Likert, 1932</xref>) 1 to 5 (for an example of concreteness, 1: very abstract, 2: abstract, 3: neither abstract nor concrete, 4: concrete, 5: very concrete). Talks with excessive mean scores (below 1 and over 4) were excluded and 8 talks were selected for the experiment.</p><p>There were four experimental conditions: All congruent, All incongruent, AV congruent, AV incongruent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In each condition, one video recording was presented and two (identical or different) auditory recordings were presented to the left and the right ear, respectively.</p><p>All congruent condition. Natural audiovisual speech condition where auditory stimuli to both ears and visual stimuli are congruent (from the same movie; e.g. A1, A1, V1 – where the first A denotes stimulus presented to the left ear, second A denotes stimulus presented to right ear and V denotes visual stimulus. The number refers to the identity of each talk.).</p><p>All incongruent condition. All three stimuli are from different movies (e.g. A2, A3, V4) and participants are instructed to attend to auditory information presented to one ear.</p><p>AV congruent condition. Auditory stimulus presented to one ear matches the visual information (e.g. A5, A6, V5). Participants attend to the talk that matches visual information.</p><p>AV incongruent condition. Auditory stimulus presented to one ear matches the visual information (e.g. A7, A8, V8). Participants attend to the talk that does not match the visual information.</p><p>The color (yellow or blue) of a small fixation cross which was overlaid on the speaker’s lip indicates the side of attention (left or right talk, e.g. “If the color of fixation cross is yellow, please attend to left ear talk.”). The functional meaning of the color of fixation cross was counterbalanced across subjects. In All congruent condition (natural audiovisual speech), participants were instructed to ignore the color and just to attend to both sides. Participants were instructed to fixate on the speaker’s lip all the time in all experimental conditions even if they found it difficult to do so in some conditions (e.g. incongruent conditions; All incongruent and AV incongruent). The fixation cross was used to guide participants’ fixation on the speaker’s lip. Furthermore, the gaze behavior was monitored by an eye tracker. The importance of eye fixation on the speaker’s lip was stressed at the task instruction and they were notified that their eye fixation would be monitored by an eye tracker.</p><p>There were two groups (22 subjects each). Participants in one group attended to left ear talk and participants in another group attended to right ear talk in the experiment (for all four conditions). Since the attended side is the same within subjects, in order to avoid presenting all the same color of fixation cross (e.g. yellow) within subjects and to prevent them from sensing that they always attend to one side (left or right), the All congruent condition was always presented in the middle (second or third) among the four conditions using color of fixation cross indicating opposite side (e.g. blue). As expected there was no significant difference in comprehension accuracy between groups (two sample <italic>t</italic>-test, df: 42, p&gt;0.05) and for the questions addressed here data was pooled across both groups.</p><p>In order to prevent talk-specific effects, we used two sets of stimuli consisting of different talks in the combination of audiovisual talks and these two sets were randomized across subjects (each set 1 and 2 was used for a half of subjects (22 subjects)). For example, talks used for AV incongruent condition in the set 1 were used for All incongruent condition in the set 2.</p><p>To assess the level of comprehension, we designed questionnaires for each talk. Each questionnaire consists of 10 questions about the talk and tests general comprehension of the talk (e.g., “What is the speaker’s job?”). These questionnaires were also validated from another set of participants (16 subjects; 13 females; aged 18–23 years; mean age: 19.88 ± 1.71 years) to ensure the same level of difficulty (accuracy) across questionnaires for the talks and the length (word count) of the questionnaires also matched across all the questionnaires. The attended 4 talks (in the 4 conditions) were counterbalanced across conditions in the two sets, thus comprehension of 4 talks were validated. Three participants who showed poor performance (below 60% accuracy) were excluded from the analysis. There were no significant differences in the comprehension accuracy between the talks (mean ± s.e.m. accuracy (%) for talk 1: 84.62 ± 2.91; talk 2: 87.69 ± 2.31; talk 3: 90.77 ± 2.39; talk 4: 85.38 ± 2.43; p&gt;0.05 at all pair-wise <italic>t</italic>-tests between talks).</p><p>In order to recombine audiovisual talks for the four experimental conditions and to add fixation cross, we used Final Cut Pro X (Apple Inc., Cupertino, CA).</p><p>The stimuli were controlled with Psychtoolbox (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brainard, 1997</xref>) under MATLAB (MathWorks, Natick, MA). Visual stimuli were delivered with a resolution of 1280 x 720 pixels at 25 fps (mp4 format). Auditory stimuli were delivered at 48 kHz sampling rate via a sound pressure transducer through two 5 meter-long plastic tubes terminating in plastic insert earpieces.</p><p>Each condition (continuous audiovisual speech) lasted 7–9 min. After each condition, comprehension questionnaire was performed about the attended talk. Here we measured both accuracy and response time and participants were asked to respond as accurately and quickly as possible. After the experiment, post-experimental questionnaire was administered to obtain participants’ feedback about the experiment.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Data analysis</title><p>The analysis of MEG data was performed using the FieldTrip toolbox (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Oostenveld et al., 2011</xref>) and in-house MATLAB codes according to guidelines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gross et al., 2013a</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Lip speech (visual) signal processing</title><p>We used in-house Matlab code to extract lip contour of the speaker for each frame of each movie (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). From the lip contour we computed area information (area within lip contour), major axis information (horizontal axis within lip contour) and minor axis information (vertical axis within lip contour). For our analysis we used area information of lip contour (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A,B,C</xref> for details) although use of vertical axis leads to qualitatively similar results. This signal was resampled at 250 Hz to match the sampling rate of the preprocessed MEG signal.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Sound speech (auditory) signal processing</title><p>We computed the amplitude envelope of sound speech signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chandrasekaran et al., 2009</xref>). We constructed eight frequency bands in the range 100–10,000 Hz to be equidistant on the cochlear map (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Smith et al., 2002</xref>). Then sound speech signals were band-pass filtered in these bands using a fourth-order Butterworth filter (forward and reverse). Hilbert transform was applied to obtain amplitude envelopes for each band. These signals were then averaged across bands and resulted in a wideband amplitude envelope. Finally, these signals were downsampled to 250 Hz for further analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>MEG-MRI co-registration</title><p>MR image of each participant was co-registered to the MEG coordinate system using a semi-automatic procedure. Anatomical landmarks such as nasion, bilateral pre-auricular points were manually identified in the individual’s MRI. Based on these three points, both coordinate systems were initially aligned. Subsequently, numerical optimization was achieved by using the ICP algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Besl and McKay, 1992</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Source localization</title><p>Individual head model was created from structural MRI using segmentation routines in FieldTrip and SPM8. Leadfield computation was based on a single shell volume conductor model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nolte, 2003</xref>) using a 8-mm grid defined on the MNI (Montreal Neurological Institute) template brain. For spatial normalization to the standard template, the template grid was transformed into individual head space by linear spatial transformation. Cross-spectral density matrices were computed using Fast Fourier Transform on 1-s segments of data after applying multitaper. Source localization was performed using DICS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gross et al., 2001</xref>) and beamformer coefficients were computed sequentially for the frequency range from 1–10 Hz.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Coherence between lip movement signals and MEG signals</title><p>In this study, we used coherence as a frequency-domain measure of dependency to study how rhythmic components in lip movements in continuous speech entrain neuronal oscillations.</p><p>First, frequency-specific brain activation time-series were computed by applying the beamformer coefficients to the MEG data filtered in the same frequency band (fourth order Butterworth filter, forward and reverse, center frequency ± 3 Hz). The lip speech signals were filtered in the same frequency band. Then, coherence was computed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rosenberg et al., 1989</xref>) between the lip speech signal and source-localized brain signal for each voxel and each frequency band across 1-s-long data segments overlapping by 0.5 s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>). This computation resulted in a volumetric map describing lip-entrained brain oscillations for each frequency band in each individual. This computation was performed for all experimental conditions: All congruent, All incongruent, AV congruent, AV incongruent.</p><p>In addition, surrogate maps were created by computing coherence between brain signals and 30 s-shifted lip speech signals for each of the four experimental conditions, thus destroy existing temporal dependencies between the two signals. This surrogate data serves as control data as computations use the same data after controlled manipulation that destroys the effect of interest (here the temporal shift removes temporal dependencies in coherence measure). Surrogate data therefore provide an estimate of coherence that can be expected by chance for each condition.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Partial coherence</title><p>In audiovisual speech, auditory and visual inputs are coherent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chandrasekaran et al., 2009</xref>) (also shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). The main purpose of this study was to investigate whether visual signals (lip movements) entrain/modulate brain activity and where this entrainment occurs. In order to rule out functional coupling (coherence) explained by auditory signals, here we additionally computed partial coherence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rosenberg et al., 1998</xref>), i.e., the coherence partialling out sound speech signals. The analysis process was identical to the process for the coherence above. This partial coherence provides entrained brain activity explained by lip movements that cannot be accounted for by auditory speech signal.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Coherence between lip movements and speech signals</title><p>As explained above, in natural audiovisual speech, auditory and visual information are robustly correlated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chandrasekaran et al., 2009</xref>). Here we computed the coherence between lip speech (visual) and sound speech (auditory) signals in all experimental conditions except All incongruent (All incongruent does not have matching lip-sound signals). Further, we computed coherence between non-matching lip and sound signals in all conditions except All congruent (All congruent does not have non-matching lip-sound signals).</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Statistics</title><p>Statistical analysis was performed on the data of all 44 participants using non-parametric randomization statistics in FieldTrip (Monte Carlo randomization). Specifically, individual volumetric maps were smoothed with a 10-mm Gaussian kernel and subjected to dependent samples <italic>t</italic>-test. We compared each condition with corresponding surrogate data and other experimental conditions. The null distribution was estimated using 500 randomizations and multiple comparison correction was performed using FDR (False Discovery Rate) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Genovese et al., 2002</xref>). Only significant results (p&lt;0.05, FDR corrected) are reported.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Regression analysis using behavioral data</title><p>To study the relationship between lip movement entrainment and behavioral performance, we performed regression analysis across subjects using comprehension accuracy from each individual as regressors on the partial coherence map. In this regression analysis, we detected brain regions positively predicted by comprehension accuracy. To maximize sensitivity of this analysis, we compared AV congruent condition to the condition that showed strongest difference in behavioral performance – AV incongruent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). We performed the regression analysis for each condition, then <italic>t</italic>-values at each brain voxel from the regression analysis were transformed to standard <italic>Z</italic>-values to be compared between conditions. Then the <italic>Z</italic>-values were subtracted between the two conditions (p&lt;0.005).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>JG is supported by the Wellcome Trust (098433).

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Lip movements during speech entrain observers' low-frequency brain oscillations&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been favorably evaluated by Jody Culham as the Senior editor and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary of the work:</p><p>This study examines the role of visual input during speech comprehension. The authors use MEG to show that cortical activity is entrained to lip movements, and that the synchronized activity is modulated by the congruence between visual and auditory inputs and possibly by attention. In addition to showing that entrainment in auditory and speech areas depends on the congruence of the auditory and visual speech signals, they found that activity in visual cortex and left motor cortex is synchronized to lip movements independently of auditory speech signals, and that the motor cortex coherence predicts comprehension accuracy. Although neural phase tracking (measured via coherence to external signals) in the low frequency domain during speech perception is a well-studied phenomenon, and previous work has demonstrated neural entrainment to visual stimuli, this study represents an important step forward by extending research in this field to the more ecologically valid condition of lip reading.</p><p>Essential revision requirements:</p><p>While the reviewers found the results compelling and concluded that they provide valuable insights into the way the brain responds to audiovisual speech, they identified the following concerns.</p><p>1) The reviewers felt that the paper would benefit from a stronger theoretical underpinning. At present, it is structured as an investigation into brain oscillations, which makes it hard to keep track of what are the main questions and findings. Some reorganization of the paper would help here.</p><p>2) The claim made at several points in the manuscript that lip movements entrain activity in auditory cortical areas does not appear to be justified. Although increased coherence was found there in the AV congruent vs. All incongruent condition, indicative of an interaction between the two modalities, lip movements in the absence of auditory speech (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>) or with the contribution of speech signals removed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) do not entrain auditory cortical activity. Thus, the effects on auditory cortex are only present during speech. The use of a partial correlation analysis to demonstrate that neural entrainment to lip movements is not an artifact caused by neural entrainment to the sound is very important and should be used throughout, not just toward the end of the Results.</p><p>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D, E</xref> shows results at 1 Hz while <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> shows the contrast at 4 Hz. It is stated that <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D, E</xref> focused on 1 Hz since significant entrainment was seen &quot;especially at 1 Hz&quot;. Does that mean stronger coherence or broader activation? It would be helpful to show the coherence spectrum of representative areas or to show the source distribution at several frequencies. Additionally, for the source-space plots, showing the differences between the actual coherence values could be more informative.</p><p>4) Visual attention was not explicitly manipulated in this study. It is assumed that visual attention is enhanced when a competing sound is presented. Although this is a reasonable interpretation, it is not appropriate to report the auditory masking effect quite so definitively as a visual attention effect. Furthermore, the All incongruent condition should be the most attention demanding condition since there are two independent distractors, yet no regions show this in the contrast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Please comment on this. Is this true for the all incongruent vs. all congruent contrast?</p><p>5) Comparison with the behavioral data is based on the contrast between the AV congruent condition and the AV incongruent condition. Why did you not examine the contrast between AV congruent and the All incongruent condition? Was regression done on the contrast or was the contrast done on the regression results? It is not clear either why further analysis then relies on the AV congruent condition rather than the contrast. Were other conditions also analyzed?</p><p>6) The analysis is done purely in the spectral domain. It would also be of interest to know, e.g., the latency of the visual tracking effect and whether congruent visual information shortens the latency of auditory entrainment. Such analysis would help to link the current study with the previous literature on AV integration.</p><p>7) Although the relationship shown in Figure 5 between coherence in the left motor cortex and speech comprehension is very interesting, this does not show that the &quot;motor cortex component contributes to speech comprehension&quot; (Discussion), which would require demonstrating that disruption of activity in motor cortex affects speech comprehension.</p><p>8) Does the motor cortex activity include the lip regions? Please provide appropriate citations to justify this.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14521.018</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) The reviewers felt that the paper would benefit from a stronger theoretical underpinning. At present, it is structured as an investigation into brain oscillations, which makes it hard to keep track of what are the main questions and findings. Some reorganization of the paper would help here.</italic></p><p>We are grateful to the reviewers for the overall positive feedback to our manuscript. We have revised the logical foundation, organization and presented analyses within the revised manuscript according to the reviewer’s suggestions. Importantly, we now provide a stronger theoretical underpinning by opening the Introduction with an introduction to the multisensory phenomena related to lip reading. Then, we lead over to the potential relevance of brain oscillations in this context and outline the main four hypotheses that we test in this study. These four hypotheses provide a clear structure for the presentation of the analyses and the discussion.</p><p><italic>2) The claim made at several points in the manuscript that lip movements entrain activity in auditory cortical areas does not appear to be justified. Although increased coherence was found there in the AV congruent vs. All incongruent condition, indicative of an interaction between the two modalities, lip movements in the absence of auditory speech (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>) or with the contribution of speech signals removed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) do not entrain auditory cortical activity. Thus, the effects on auditory cortex are only present during speech. The use of a partial correlation analysis to demonstrate that neural entrainment to lip movements is not an artifact caused by neural entrainment to the sound is very important and should be used throughout, not just toward the end of the Results.</italic></p><p>We agree with the reviewers that we currently have no direct evidence that lip movements entrain auditory brain areas. Although coherence between lip movements and right auditory cortex increases significantly for AV congruent compared to All congruent condition, similar effects are absent in the partial coherence analysis. In response to the reviewers comment we have removed this claim from the revised manuscript. Instead we have added a short speculative comment about the coherence increase (AV cong &gt; All cong) to the Discussion section. The relevant part reads:</p><p>“While visual areas show both coherence and partial coherence to lip movements, temporal areas only emerge from coherence analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). […] However, the informativeness of lip movements still modulates significantly the coherence between lip movements and right temporal brain areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B, C, D</xref>) and indicates an indirect effect of visual attention.”</p><p>We have also addressed the reviewers’ comments that partial coherence should be used throughout. Specifically, we have moved <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> (coherence results) to Supplemental Materials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>) and directly focus on the partial coherence results in the main analysis. Still, we believe that traditional coherence maps convey essential information and this information is still available as Supplemental Materials.</p><p><italic>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D, E</xref> shows results at 1 Hz while <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> shows the contrast at 4 Hz. It is stated that <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D, E</xref> focused on 1 Hz since significant entrainment was seen &quot;especially at 1 Hz&quot;. Does that mean stronger coherence or broader activation? It would be helpful to show the coherence spectrum of representative areas or to show the source distribution at several frequencies. Additionally, for the source-space plots, showing the differences between the actual coherence values could be more informative.</italic></p><p>We now realise that the statement ‘especially at 1 Hz’ is misleading. This frequency was selected because the lip movement signal shows the strongest power at this frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The power spectrum for sound speech signals (for all the auditory stimuli we used) also shows the peak at 1 Hz as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Author response image 1</xref>.<fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14521.012</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.14521.012">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.14521.012</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-14521-resp-fig1-v2"/></fig></p><p>We have now rephrased the corresponding part in the revised manuscript:</p><p>“We first compared natural audiovisual speech condition (All congruent) and surrogate data for the frequency that showed strongest power in the lip signal (1 Hz).

It is assumed that visual attention is enhanced when a competing sound is presented. Although this is a reasonable interpretation, it is not appropriate to report the auditory masking effect quite so definitively as a visual attention effect. Furthermore, the All incongruent condition should be the most attention demanding condition since there are two independent distractors, yet no regions show this in the contrast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Please comment on this. Is this true for the all incongruent vs. all congruent contrast?</italic></p><p>We fully agree that we have not manipulated visual attention explicitly but only indirectly through the use of a competing sound. We have now clarified this point in the Discussion section of the revised manuscript. The relevant part reads:</p><p>“We studied the effect of attention in an ecologically valid scenario with congruent audiovisual speech when a distracting auditory stimulus was present (AV congruent condition) or absent (All congruent condition). […] This condition was compared to the All congruent condition where attention to the visual stimulus is not required for speech comprehension.”</p><p>We believe that the All incongruent condition is not the most attention demanding condition because participants were instructed to always attend to auditory stimuli (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> where red letters represent attended stimulus). So there is no benefit for attending to the visual input in the All incongruent condition. This is different for the AV congruent condition where the congruent visual input facilitates comprehension of the attended auditory stream in the presence of another distracting auditory stream. Amongst all conditions the visual input is therefore likely most relevant and informative in the AV congruent condition. We have therefore used this condition for analysis of the ‘visual attention’ effect.</p><p><italic>5) Comparison with the behavioral data is based on the contrast between the AV congruent condition and the AV incongruent condition. Why did you not examine the contrast between AV congruent and the All incongruent condition? Was regression done on the contrast or was the contrast done on the regression results? It is not clear either why further analysis then relies on the AV congruent condition rather than the contrast. Were other conditions also analyzed?</italic></p><p>The analysis of the behavioural relevance of lip entrainment results was based on the rationale that this effect should be strongest when we compare our main condition (AV congruent) to the condition with the largest difference in behavioural performance, which is the AV incongruent condition (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). We performed the regression analysis for each condition and then t-values at each brain voxel from the regression analysis were transformed to standard z-values to be compared between conditions. Then the z-values were subtracted between the two conditions. We have now described the procedure in more detail in the Methods section of the revised manuscript. The relevant section reads:</p><p>“To study the relationship between lip movement entrainment and behavioral performance, we performed regression analysis across subjects using comprehension accuracy from each individual as regressors on the partial coherence map. […] Then the <italic>Z</italic>-values were subtracted between the two conditions (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.005).”</p><p>The contrast between AV congruent and AV incongruent condition already establishes a correlation between lip-entrainment and behavioural performance. Yet, to obtain further insights into this relation we performed additional analysis on the AV congruent condition, as it is the condition where the visual input is most relevant and informative for comprehension.</p><p><italic>6) The analysis is done purely in the spectral domain. It would also be of interest to know, e.g., the latency of the visual tracking effect and whether congruent visual information shortens the latency of auditory entrainment. Such analysis would help to link the current study with the previous literature on AV integration.</italic></p><p>Thank you for raising this important and interesting point and we have looked at the latencies of visual and auditory tracking in each condition and the effect of congruence.</p><p>We first checked the lag between lip (visual) and sound (auditory) speech signals. We performed cross-correlation analysis to estimate the delay between two signals. We computed this cross-correlation for both matching and non-matching signals used in the study. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Author response image 4</xref>, visual signals lead auditory signals by about 70 ms (here negative latency indicates lip speech (visual) signals lead sound speech (auditory) signals) for matching signals, however as expected there’s no effect for non-matching signals.<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14521.015</object-id><label>Author response image 4.</label><caption><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.14521.015">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.14521.015</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-14521-resp-fig4-v2"/></fig></p><p>Next, we performed the cross-correlation analysis between speech signals and brain responses to measure visual and auditory tracking lag and how they change across conditions. We computed cross-correlation for both lip speech-visual cortex signals (visual tracking) and sound speech-auditory cortex signals (auditory tracking). Here the visual and auditory cortices were selected from the maximum voxels in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref> (left visual cortex (MNI coordinates = [-28 -88 8]), right STG (MNI coordinates = [44 -32 16])).</p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Author response image 5</xref> the latency indicates the lag between signals in visual or auditory cortex and the lip or sound speech signals (brain signals following the speech signals). The mean lag across conditions is around 100 ms for all conditions as can be expected from studies of temporal response functions (e.g. Crosse et al., 2015). Congruent visual speech reduces the mean lag of auditory entrainment as can be seen in the comparison of ‘All cong A’ and ‘All incong A’. This is consistent with previous findings (van Wassenhove et al., 2005). But the difference is not significant and performing this analysis on narrow-band (filtered) data is not without problems. We therefore prefer to address this question in a separate study.<fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14521.016</object-id><label>Author response image 5.</label><caption><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.14521.016">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.14521.016</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-14521-resp-fig5-v2"/></fig></p><p><italic>7) Although the relationship shown in Figure 5 between coherence in the left motor cortex and speech comprehension is very interesting, this does not show that the &quot;motor cortex component contributes to speech comprehension&quot; (Discussion), which would require demonstrating that disruption of activity in motor cortex affects speech comprehension.</italic></p><p>We agree with the reviewers that this statement was too strong since we did not demonstrate a causal contribution of activity in the left motor cortex to comprehension.

Please provide appropriate citations to justify this.</italic></p><p>The area in the motor cortex showing significant lip-brain coherence (now <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C, D</xref>) is consistent with the lip/tongue representation in motor studies (see for example Giraud et al., 2007; Simonyan and Horwitz, 2011). In addition, a second area in left motor cortex emerged from the partial coherence analysis. This area was found in upper strip of primary motor cortex (maximum MNI coordinates in the partial coherence results for congruence effect (AV cong &gt; All incong in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>): [-52 -8 56]; for attention effect (AV cong &gt; All cong in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>: [-44 -16 56]; both clusters are extending over 10 mm radius). This is consistent with our previous finding from a different study that the same area exerts top-down control of left auditory cortex at the theta frequency band (Park et al., 2015). Although this second area appears to be located more superior compared to the classical lip/tongue motor representation, it still overlaps with motor areas that have been reported in fMRI studies of lip movements (Morillon et al., 2010; Table 1 in Fukunaga et al., 2009; lip panel in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> in Lotze et al., 2000) and articulatory movements of the lips (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> in Pulvermuller et al., 2006; this region was found to have causal influence on comprehending single spoken words in the TMS study (Schomers et al., 2015)). Further, this area is also consistent with areas observed in the study demonstrating essential role of motor cortex by disrupting it with TMS which leads to impaired speech perception (phonetic discrimination task) (Table 1 in Meister et al., 2007). Thus, we think that the motor cortex found by partial coherence analysis plays an important role in speech perception as we suggested in the Discussion (subsection “Motor areas are entrained by speaking lips”).</p></body></sub-article></article>
