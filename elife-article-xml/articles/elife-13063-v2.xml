gastrointestinal smooth muscle contraction is critical for proper nutrient absorption and is altered in a number of medical disorders. In this work, we demonstrate a critical role for the RGD-binding integrin α8β1 in promoting nutrient absorption through regulation of gastrointestinal motility. Smooth muscle-specific deletion and antibody blockade of α8 in mice result in enhanced gastric antral smooth muscle contraction, more rapid gastric emptying, and more rapid transit of food through the small intestine leading to malabsorption of dietary fats and carbohydrates as well as protection from weight gain in a diet-induced model of obesity. Mechanistically, ligation of α8β1 by the milk protein Mfge8 reduces antral smooth muscle contractile force by preventing RhoA activation through a PTEN-dependent mechanism. Collectively, our results identify a role for α8β1 in regulating gastrointestinal motility and identify α8 as a potential target for disorders characterized by hypo- or hyper-motility.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.13063.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.13063.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13063.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Animals absorb nutrients from the food they eat in a complicated process that involves multiple steps. In the mouth, teeth break down the food into smaller chunks. Then the food passes through the stomach and small intestine, where enzymes break it down into individual molecules that are small enough to be absorbed by cells that line the small intestine. These cells then package the molecules and release them into the bloodstream so that they can be distributed to the rest of the body.</p><p>Muscles in the wall of the small intestine control how quickly food travels through this part of the gut. If food moves too quickly, the cells that line the intestine have less time to absorb the food molecules and may fail to absorb enough nutrients. If the food moves too slowly, an individual may experience nausea or vomiting, or the contents of their stomach may spill into their lungs.</p><p>In 2014, researchers reported that a protein in breast milk called Mfge8 helps to boost the number of fat molecules absorbed from food. Now, Khalifeh-Soltani et al. – including some of the same researchers involved in the earlier work – show that Mfge8 also slows the rate at which food travels through the small intestine in mice. Mfge8 binds to another protein called integrin α8β1 to control how often the intestine muscles contract. Genetically engineered mice that lacked integrin α8β1 developed diarrhea and food passed through their intestines more quickly than in normal mice. Furthermore, these mice did not gain as much weight as normal mice when they were fed a high-fat diet.</p><p>Khalifeh-Soltani et al.’s findings show that Mfge8 has a dual role in controlling the absorption of food molecules in the small intestine. The next challenge is to find out whether drugs that alter the activity of integrin α8β1 could be used to help treat patients with diseases in which food moves too quickly, or too slowly, through the gut.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.13063.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.13063.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>integrin</kwd><kwd>Mfge8</kwd><kwd>PTEN</kwd><kwd>nutrient absorption</kwd><kwd>gastrointestinal motility</kwd><kwd>smooth muscle</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000062</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Atabai</surname><given-names>Kamran</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000968</institution-id><institution>American Heart Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Khalifeh-Soltani</surname><given-names>Amin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005331</institution-id><institution>American Brain Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Khalifeh-Soltani</surname><given-names>Amin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007901</institution-id><institution>American Stroke Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Khalifeh-Soltani</surname><given-names>Amin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The milk protein Mfge8 promotes fat uptake and slows gastrointestinal motility to optimize nutrient absorption.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Coordinated gastrointestinal motility orchestrates nutrient absorption by mixing ingested food with digestive enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Armand et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kong and Singh, 2008</xref>) and by propelling the food bolus from the stomach to the small intestine, the primary site of nutrient absorption. Dysfunctional gastrointestinal motility occurs in a number of common disease processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ambartsumyan and Rodriguez, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fan and Sellin, 2009</xref>), is difficult to treat, and is characterized by either accelerated motility leading to rapid intestinal transit times, diarrhea, and malabsorption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Spiller, 2006</xref>) or delayed motility leading to nausea, vomiting, and aspiration of stomach contents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Enweluzo and Aziz, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Janssen et al., 2013</xref>). A better understanding of the molecular mechanisms that regulate gastrointestinal motility has significant clinical implications for disorders characterized by hypo- or hyper-motility.</p><p>Milk fat Globule Epidermal Growth Factor like 8 (Mfge8) is an integrin ligand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Atabai et al., 2009</xref>) that is highly expressed in breast milk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Atabai et al., 2005</xref>). Mfge8 coordinates absorption of dietary fats by promoting enterocyte fatty acid uptake after ligation of the αvβ3 and αvβ5 integrins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Khalifeh-Soltani et al., 2014</xref>). Mfge8 also modulates smooth muscle contractile force (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kudo et al., 2013</xref>). In mice deficient in Mfge8 (<italic>Mfge8<sup>-/-</sup></italic>), airway and jejunal smooth muscle contraction are enhanced in response to contractile agonists after these muscle beds have been exposed to inflammatory cytokines but not under basal conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kudo et al., 2013</xref>). Contraction of antral smooth muscle is a key determinant of the rate at which a solid food bolus exits the stomach and transits through the primary site of nutrient absorption, the small intestine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Haba and Sarna, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kelly, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Burks et al., 1985</xref>). Since Mfge8 promotes enterocyte fatty acid uptake and can regulate smooth muscle contraction, we were interested in examining whether Mfge8 reduces the force of basal antral smooth muscle contraction, thereby slowing gastrointestinal motility and allowing a greater time for nutrient absorption.</p><p>α8β1 is a member of the RGD-binding integrin family that is prominently expressed in smooth muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zargham et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zargham and Thilbault, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Schnapp et al., 1995</xref>). The most definitive in vivo role described for α8β1 is in kidney morphogenesis where deletion of this integrin subunit leads to impaired recruitment of mesenchymal cells into epithelial structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Müller et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Humbert et al., 2014</xref>). Osteopontin, fibronectin, vitronectin, nephronectin, and tenascin-C have all previously been identified as ligands for α8β1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Schnapp et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Denda et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kiyozumi et al., 2012</xref>). In this work we show that Mfge8 is a novel ligand for α8β1 and that Mfge8 ligation of α8β1 reduces the force of gastric antral smooth muscle contraction, the extent of gastric emptying, and the rate at which a food bolus transits through the small intestine. We further show that mice with smooth muscle-specific deletion of α8 integrin subunit (<italic>Itga8<sup>flox/flox</sup>—Tg(Acta2-rtTA, TetO-Cre</italic>) fail to properly absorb ingested fats and carbohydrates and are partially protected from weight gain in a model of diet-induced obesity. α8β1 slows gastrointestinal motility by increasing the activity of Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) leading to reduced activation of the Ras homolog gene family member A (RhoA).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Mfge8 regulates gastrointestinal motility</title><p>To determine whether Mfge8 regulates the force of antral smooth muscle contraction, we isolated gastric antral rings and measured the force of antral contraction in a muscle bath.

The thickness of antral smooth muscle was not different when comparing Mfge8<sup>-/-</sup> and WT mice indicating that the enhanced contraction was not due to smooth muscle hypertrophy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>). Incubation with recombinant Mfge8 (rMfge8), but not a recombinant construct where the integrin-binding RGD sequence was mutated to RGE, rescued enhanced contraction indicating that the effect of Mfge8 on gastric smooth muscle was integrin-dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). Induction of Mfge8 expression in the smooth muscle of <italic>Mfge8<sup>-/-</sup>—Tg(Acta2-rtTA, TetO-Mfge8)</italic> transgenic mice, abbreviated Mfge8<sup>-/-</sup>sm<sup>+</sup>, where Mfge8 expression was driven by a tetracycline-inducible Mfge8 transgene coupled with an α-smooth muscle-rtTA transgene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>) also rescued enhanced contraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>).

We initially focused on α8β1 because of its high expression in smooth muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Schnapp et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kitchen et al., 2013</xref>). To determine if α8β1 is a receptor for Mfge8, we used a solid-phase assay to analyze the direct binding of Mfge8 to purified α8. We included purified αvβ3 and α5β1 as positive and negative controls, respectively. Mfge8 bound to α8β1 and αvβ3, but not to α5β1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). To further confirm this interaction, we evaluated cell adhesion of SW480 cells, a human colon cancer cell line, transfected with α8 or β3 to Mfge8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Control SW480 cells express the Mfge8 ligand αvβ5 as well as α5β1 and bind Mfge8 in an αvβ5-dependent manner. Mock-transfected control SW480 cells adhered to Mfge8 and adherence was blocked by anti-β5 antibody (ALULA). In the presence of ALULA, β3-transfected cells adhered to Mfge8 (αvβ3 is a known receptor for Mfge8, as above), and adherence was blocked by an anti-β3 antibody (LM609). α8-transfected SW480 cells also adhered to Mfge8 in the presence of ALULA, and adherence was blocked by the addition of an α8 blocking antibody (YZ3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nishimichi et al., 2015</xref>). The YZ3 antibody blocks both human and mouse α8. These results indicate that α8β1 specifically mediates cell adhesion to Mfge8. Next we analyzed adhesion of α8-transfected SW480 cells to Mfge8 at various concentrations in the presence of ALULA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). The α8-transfected cells adhered to Mfge8 in a dose-dependent fashion.

Simultaneous blockade of the αv and α8 integrins had a significantly greater effect on adhesion than blocking each integrin individually (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). To determine whether Mfge8 and the α8integrin colocalize in gastric smooth muscle, we injected <italic>Mfge8</italic>-/- mice with our recombinant Mfge8 protein containing a human FC domain, prepared tissue sections, and probed with an anti-Fc and anti-α8 antibody.

Smooth muscle-specific deletion of α8 results in an increase in gastric antral contractile force, more rapid gastric emptying, and faster small intestinal transit times coupled with impaired absorption of both fats and carbohydrates and increased stool energy content. α8sm<sup>-/-</sup> mice are partially protected from weight gain on a HFD and have reduced body weight on a CD. We further show that the milk protein Mfge8 is a novel ligand for α8β1and that binding of Mfge8 to α8β1 is responsible for the effects of this integrin on gastrointestinal motility.</p><p>The α8 integrin forms heterodimers with the β1 integrin and was initially identified in axon tracts where the integrin promotes axonal growth during embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bossy et al., 1991</xref>). Previous work has shown expression of α8 in both vascular and visceral smooth muscle including the muscularis mucosa of the GI tract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Schnapp et al., 1995</xref>). In vitro studies suggest that α8 promotes smooth muscle proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zargham et al., 2007</xref>) and maintains vascular smooth muscle in a differentiated, contractile, non-migratory phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zargham et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zargham and Thilbault, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zargham et al., 2007</xref>). In vascular smooth muscle, α8 has been shown to co-immunoprecipitate with RhoA and siRNA knockdown of α8 leads to less membrane localization and thereby less active RhoA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zargham et al., 2007</xref>). shRNA-mediated knockdown of α8 in intestinal epithelial cells has also been reported to lead to reduction in active RhoA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Benoit et al., 2009</xref>). In contrast to these findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zargham et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Benoit et al., 2009</xref>), we found that in gastric smooth muscle, Mfge8 ligation of α8β1 prevents RhoA activation and that this effect is mediated by opposing the activity of PI3K. It is unclear to us why α8β1 has opposing effects on RhoA activation in different cell types. RhoA becomes activated by GTP loading and reverts to an inactive state when GDP-bound. The activation status of RhoA is regulated by a large family of RhoA GTPase Activating Factors (RhoGAPs) and RhoA GTPase guanine nucleotide exchange factors (RhoGEFs) which convert GTP to GDP or load or RhoA would GTP respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Puetz et al., 2009</xref>). We speculate that the most likely explanation for α8β1 preventing RhoA activation in gastric smooth muscle while presumably favoring RhoA activation in vascular smooth muscle and intestinal epithelial cells is differential effects of the α8β1 on and/or differential expression of RhoGAPs and RhoGEFs in specific cell types. These data suggest that the role for the α8β1 integrin in regulation of RhoA and contractility can vary depending on the context within which the integrin is activated. Support for an α8β1-PI3K-RhoA axis regulating motility is evidenced by the ability of the PI3K inhibitor wortmannin to abrogate the exaggerated antral contraction in <italic>Mfge8<sup>-/-</sup> </italic>and α8sm<sup>-/-</sup> antral rings coupled with the increase in AKT phosphorylation and RhoA activation in <italic>Mfge8<sup>-/-</sup> </italic>and α8sm<sup>-/-</sup> antral rings. We also found that PI3K inhibition after Mfge8 ligation of α8β1 occurs through an increase in the activity of the phosphatase PTEN which directly opposes PI3K by converting PIP3 to PIP2. Furthermore, PTEN activity in antral samples had an inverse correlation with the extent of gastric emptying and rate of SIT suggesting an essential role for PTEN in regulating gastrointestinal motility.</p><p>Identification of α8β1 as a new binding partner for Mfge8 that slows gastrointestinal motility coupled with malabsorption in α8sm<sup>-/-</sup> mice indicate that the effect of Mfge8 on promoting absorption of dietary fats occurs through dual cooperative mechanisms. Mfge8 slows gastrointestinal motility thereby increasing the time for absorption of dietary fats and directly induces enterocyte fatty acid uptake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Khalifeh-Soltani et al., 2014</xref>). Since Mfge8 is a secreted molecule, we cannot rule out an effect on antral contraction secondary to Mfge8 binding of integrin receptors on local neurons in the gastrointestinal tract. However, the fact that α8sm<sup>-/-</sup> mice phenocopy the motility phenotype of <italic>Mfge8<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice strongly suggests that the dominant effect of Mfge8 on antral contractility is mediated through ligation of integrin receptors on smooth muscle. The relative contribution of altered motility versus impaired fatty acid uptake to the malabsorption phenotype in <italic>Mfge8<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice is difficult to parse out from our data. After 12 weeks on a HFD, <italic>Mfge8<sup>-/-</sup></italic> gained approximately 50% less weight than WT controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Khalifeh-Soltani et al., 2014</xref>) while α8sm<sup>-/-</sup> mice gained approximately 40% less weight than WT controls. One interpretation of this data is that the dominant mechanism underlying protection from weight gain in <italic>Mfge8<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice on a HFD is accelerated motility. However the elevated stool TG content in <italic>Itgb3</italic><sup>-/-</sup><italic>::Itgb5</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice suggests a critical contribution of lipid absorption to steatorrhea since these mice have impaired enterocyte fatty acid uptake but normal motility. Another possibility is that ligands in addition to Mfge8 can bind α<sub>8</sub>β<sub>1</sub> leading to inhibition of gastrointestinal motility and resulting in a relatively greater malabsorption phenotype secondary to altered motility in α8sm<sup>-/-</sup> mice than in <italic>Mfge8<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice. Of note, a recent publication looking at global α8 null mice and global α8 null mice in the ApoE background assessed body weights in each of these mouse lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Menendez-Castro et al., 2015</xref>). Consistent with our findings in α8sm<sup>-/-</sup> mice on a control diet, global α8 null mice and global α8 null mice in the ApoE background had reduced body weight as compared with control mice. In global α8 null mice, there was no statistically significant difference in body weights (by our calculation a P value of 0.059), but it is important to note that these mice do not appear to have reached the age at which we saw significant differences in body weights in α8sm<sup>-/-</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Menendez-Castro et al., 2015</xref>). Furthermore, though no statistical significance was reported in the comparison of body weights of the global α8 null mice in the ApoE background at 1 year of age, a 2-tailed t-test of the presented data comparing mice homozygous for the α8 null mutation with wild type mice (both in the ApoE no background) produced a P value of 0.016 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Menendez-Castro et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Consistent with accelerated motility as the cause of malabsorption, α8sm<sup>-/-</sup> mice had increased stool triglyceride and 2NBDG levels after gavage with olive oil/2NBDG respectively. Unlike primary enterocytes from <italic>Mfge8<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice, primary enterocytes from α8sm<sup>-/-</sup> mice did not have impaired fatty acid, further supporting altered motility as the cause of steatorrhea inα8sm<sup>-/-</sup> mice. We previously reported that serum glucose levels after gavage of a liquid glucose/PBS mixture were similar in <italic>Mfge8<sup>-/-</sup></italic> and WT mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Khalifeh-Soltani et al., 2014</xref>). To assess whether exaggerated antral contraction in <italic>Mfge8<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice led to impaired absorption of glucose, we administered 2NBDG in a mixture with methylcellulose. Unlike the previously used liquid glucose mixture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Khalifeh-Soltani et al., 2014</xref>), the 2NBDG/methylcellulose provides a semisolid substrate that depends on antral contraction for propulsion along the small intestinal tract. As with α8sm<sup>-/-</sup> mice, <italic>Mfge8<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice had increased stool 2NBDG levels. However, when we gavaged mice with 2NBDG in a liquid form in PBS, stool 2NBDG levels were similar in <italic>Mfge8<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice as compared with WT control mice suggesting that the effect of Mfge8 on enterocyte glucose uptake is through altered motility rather than direct uptake.</p><p>One interesting observation from our work is the opposing effects Mfge8 has on PI3K activation in smooth muscle cells as compared with adipocytes. Mfge8 slows gastrointestinal motility by increasing PTEN activity leading to inhibition of PI3K activity while Mfge8 increases fatty acid uptake by activating PI3K (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Khalifeh-Soltani et al., 2014</xref>). The effect on fatty acid uptake and PI3K activation is mediated through the αvβ3 and αvβ5 integrins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Khalifeh-Soltani et al., 2014</xref>) while the effect on gastrointestinal motility and PI3K inhibition is mediated through the α8β1integrin. Of note, both the αvβ3 and αvβ5 integrins are expressed on gastric smooth muscle. However, even though Mfge8 is a ligand for both of these integrins, single and double knockouts of αvβ3 and αvβ5 did not have the gastric smooth muscle phenotype of Mfge8<sup>-/-</sup> mice, suggesting that even if Mfge8 binds these integrins on smooth muscle cells, binding does not lead to alterations in calcium sensitivity and smooth muscle contractility. Furthermore, in relation to modulation of PI3K activity, our data suggest that in smooth muscle cells the effect of Mfge8 ligation of α8β1is dominant over any effect that Mfge8 ligation of αvβ3 and αvβ5 may havesince baseline phosphorylated AKT levels (reflecting PI3K activation) are increased in antral tissue from <italic>Mfge8<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice as compared with WT controls. Furthermore, rMfge8 treatment reduces AKT phosphorylation in antral rings while it increases AKT phosphorylation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Khalifeh-Soltani et al., 2014</xref>). Finally, we have ruled out the possibility that Mfge8 is a ligand for any other RGD-binding integrin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Atabai et al., 2009</xref>) other than αvβ1 and non-integrin receptors that have not been identified for Mfge8.</p><p>Another interesting observation that comes from our data is that oral administration of Mfge8 by gavage successfully prolongs small intestinal transit time and reduces the extent of gastric emptying. We have shown that recombinant Mfge8 reaches the smooth muscle by immunofluorescence. However, we are not entirely sure how Mfge8 gets to the smooth muscle layer. One possibility is that it is absorbed into the bloodstream and takes a hematogenous route to the smooth muscle. In our previously published work, oral Mfge8 gavage did not lead to discernible serum Mfge8 levels 30 min after gavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Khalifeh-Soltani et al., 2014</xref>). While this would argue against a hematogenous route to the smooth muscle, it is possible that blood levels are below the sensitivity of the Mfge8 ELISA. Alternatively, measurement of serum levels at earlier time points may show recombinant protein in the bloodstream. Another possibility is that the epithelium takes up the recombinant Mfge8 and secretes it from the basal side and that Mfge8 reaches the smooth muscle either directly or through entering the circulation on the basal side.</p><p>From a therapeutic viewpoint, our findings provide new targets for treatment of diseases associated with altered gastrointestinal motility. Activation of the pathway we describe with recombinant Mfge8 could be used to treat disorders characterized by increased gastrointestinal transit time and malabsorption such as short bowel syndrome. Blockade of the α8β1 integrin could be used as a treatment for gastroparesis secondary to conditions such as diabetic neuropathy, medication side effects, and a number of neurological diseases. Dissociation of the dual effects of Mfge8 at the receptor level provides flexibility for designing therapeutic strategies that can target only the effect on fatty acid uptake or gastrointestinal motility or both simultaneously. In addition, our data provides preliminary proof of principle evidence to support evaluation of α8 blockade as a therapy for gastroparesis.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p>All animal experiments were approved by the UCSF Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee in adherence to NIH guidelines and policies.

We then gavaged mice with 250 μl Carmine meal (6% Carmine red and 0.5% methylcellulose in water). 15 min after administration of gavage, we euthanized mice and dissected out the small intestine from the pylorus to the ileocecal junction, identifying the location to which the meal had traversed, and securing that position with thread to avoid changes in the length of the transit due to handling. The small intestinal transit (SIT) was calculated from the distance traveled by Carmine meal divided by total length of the small intestine multiplied by 100. In experiments using rMfge8 and RGE constructs, we administered each construct by gavage (50 μg/kg body weight in a total volume of 200 μl in PBS) before administration of the Carmine meal to mice. Y-27632 was administered IP (100 nm) 15 min prior to gavage. In the α8 blocking antibody experiment (in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2L</xref>) we injected 10 mg/kg IP α8 blocking antibody 30 min before administration of Carmine meal to mice.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Primary enterocytes isolation</title><p>We collected primary enterocytes by harvesting the proximal small intestine from anesthetized mice, emptying the luminal contents, washing with 115 mM NaCl, 5.4 mM KCl, 0.96 mM NaH2PO4, 26.19 mM NaHCO3 and 5.5 mM glucose buffer at pH 7.4 and gassing for 30 min with 95% O2 and 5% CO2.

We collected feces from 20 min to 4 hr after 2NBDG was administered. We homogenized 50 mg of feces in PBS containing 30 mM HEPES, 57.51 mM MgCl2 and 0.57 mg ml<sup>−1</sup> BSA with 0.5% SDS and sonicated for 30 s; we then centrifuged at 1000 g for 10 min. We transferred supernatants to 96-well plates and measured fluorescence values immediately using a fluorescence microplate reader for endpoint reading (Molecular Devices). We then subtracted baseline fluorescence from untreated mice from measured fluorescence. We also measured enterocytes’ 2NBDG content after isolation of primary cells as described above, using excitation and emission wavelengths of 488 nm and 515 nm, respectively. For rhodamine-PEG, the excitation and emission wavelengths were 575 nm and 595 nm, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Serum and fecal triglycerides measurement</title><p>We fasted 6–8 week old mice for 4 hr and administered 200 μl olive oil by oral gavage or IP injection and collected tail vein blood at indicated times. Serum TG concentration was determined by Wako L-Type TG determination kit (Wako Chemicals USA). We collected the feces from 20 min to 4 hr after Olive oil administration. 50 mg of feces were homogenized with chloroform/methanol (2:1) in a 20:1 v/w ratio, the whole mixture was incubated overnight at 4°C with gentle shaking.

Either recombinant α8, αvβ3, or α5β1 were attached to the plates and purified Mfge8 was added for 2 hr at room temperature in the presence or absence of 10mM EDTA. For α5β1, 1 mM MgCl<sup>2+</sup> and 1 mg/mL CaCl<sup>2+</sup> was added to activate β1. Following 5 washes with PBS + 1% BSA and 0.05% Tween, the extent of Mfge8 binding was detected using a biotinylated antibody against Mfge8 (1:1000, 1 hr at 37°C). Then streptavidin-HRP was added for 20 min at room temperature followed by 3,3’,5,5’ tetramethylbenzidine substrate solution.

Antrum samples were removed 30 min post-gavage and fixed with paraformaldehyde and paraffin-embedded or immediately frozen. Sections (5–10 µm) were cut and stained for α-smooth muscle actin (Sigma-Aldrich), integrin α8 (YZ3) and human FC (Rockland). The recombinant Mfge8 consists of a fusion protein containing full length Mfge8 and a human Fc domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Atabai et al., 2009</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Quantification of muscle thickness</title><p>Five images were taken per antrum section and each image was divided into fifths. Thickness of individual muscle layers was quantified at each point using a scale of 314 pixels to 100 µm.

Briefly, we dissected out the gastric antrum, gently removed the mucosal layer and incubate them with methacholine (100 μm) for 15 min and then homogenized the muscle layer in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.5 M NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, and protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Thermo). Human Gastric Smooth Muscle Cells (HGSMC) were treated with 5-hydroxytryptamine (100 μM) for 15 min and then lysed. We collected the supernatants after centrifugation and incubated with GST-Rhotekin bound to glutathione-agarose beads at 4°C for 1 hr. We washed the beads with a wash buffer containing 25 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 30 mM MgCl2, and 40 mM NaCl. GTP-bound RhoA was detected by immunoblotting.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>PTEN activity assay</title><p>We isolated antral lysates or human gastric smooth muscle cell lysates and measured conversion of PI(3,4,5) P3 to PI(4,5)P2 (PTEN activity ELISA, Echelon) after incubation with recombinant proteins (rMfge8, RGE, Fibronectin, or Vitronectin, R&amp;D Systems, Inc. 10 μg/ml) or blocking antibodies against α8, β3, and β5 (10 g/ml). In this competitive ELISA, we incubated lysates on a PI(4,5)P2 coated microplate and then added a PI(4,5)P2 detector protein. PI(4,5)P2 produced by PTEN in lysate binds to the detector protein and thus prevents it from binding immobilized PI(4,5)P2 on the plate. We then used a peroxidase-linked secondary to measure PI(4,5)P2 detector protein binding to the plate in a colorimetric assay where the colorimetric signal is inversely proportional to the amount of PI(4,5)P2 produced by PTEN.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Western blots</title><p>We lysed tissues in cold RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) supplemented with complete miniprotease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Pierce, Rockford, IL). We incubated lysates at 4°C with gentle rocking for 30 min, sonicated on ice for 30 s (in 5 s bursts) and then centrifuged at 12,800 rpm for 15 min at 4°C. We determined protein concentration by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). We separated 20 μg of protein by SDS-PAGE on 7.5% resolving gels (Bio-Rad) and transblotted onto polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (Millipore). We incubated the membranes with a 1:1,000 dilution of antibodies against Akt (catalog 9272, Cell Signaling), phospho-Akt Ser473 (clone 193H12, Cell Signaling), MLC (catalog 3672S Cell Signaling) phospho-MLC (clone 519, Cell Signaling), MYPT (catalog 2634S, Cell Signaling) phospho-MYPT (catalog 5163, Cell Signaling), RhoA (clone 67139, Cell Signaling), PTEN (clone 138G6, Cell Signaling), or GAPDH (clone 14C10, Cell Signaling) followed by a secondary HRP-conjugated antibody. For evaluation of total Akt, MLC or MYPT we stripped and reprobed membranes that had been blotted for phospho-versions of these proteins.

We used a two-sided Student's t-test for comparisons between 2 groups. For analysis of weight gain over time in mice, we used a two-way ANOVA for repeated measures. We used GraphPad Prism 6.0 for all statistical analyses. We presented all data as mean ± s.e.m. We selected sample size for animal experiments based on numbers typically used in the literature. We did not perform randomization of animals.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This research was supported by US National Institutes of Health grant P30 DK 063-7202 and the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) Diabetes and Endocrinology Research Center and UCSF Cardiovascular Research Institute startup funds (KA), and an Award from the American Heart Association Western States Affiliate and the American Brain Foundation (#14POST18580033) (AKS).

While these seem to have been well cited, the possibility of Mfge8 as a ligand for specific or multiple Integrins should be discussed, along with a rationale for why one particular interaction might be relevant for gastric smooth muscles.</p><p>Mfge8 is known to bind both the αvβ3 and αvβ5 integrins. Therefore our first investigations were focused on understanding whether these integrins mediated the effect of Mfge8 on smooth muscle contraction. As presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5— figure supplement 1</xref>, we did an extensive in vivo evaluation of both single and double knockouts of each of these integrins and found that the knockouts did not phenocopy the Mfge8 knockout. Of the remaining RGD binding integrins, we have previously published that Mfge8 does not bind αvβ6, αvβ8 or α5β1 (Atabai et al., J Clin Invest 2009) and therefore focused on α8β1 given its extensive smooth muscle expression. While it is possible (and likely) that Mfge8 binds αvβ3 and αvβ5 on smooth muscle, our data supports the conclusion that the effect on smooth muscle calcium sensitivity and contraction is mediated through ligation of 1. It is interesting to note that while we show in this work that Mfge8 ligation of α8β1 leads to inhibition of PI3 kinase activity, we have previously shown that Mfge8 binding of the αvβ3 and αvβ5 increases PI3 kinase activity in enterocytes (Khalifeh-Soltani et al., Nat Med 2014). Therefore one possibility is that the effect of α8β1 in smooth muscle on PI3 kinase activity dominates any effect seen through ligation of αvβ3 and αvβ5. Alternatively, there may be different adapter proteins at play in enterocytes than in smooth muscle cells that dictate how integrin ligation modulates PI3 kinase activity. We have expanded our discussion of this point in the Discussion section of the manuscript (second paragraph).</p><p>2) Please demonstrate whether Mfge8 and α8 integrin co-localize in antral smooth muscles, in support of the notion that they physically interact.</p><p>We have performed immunofluorescence experiments on antral tissue isolated from Mfge8 KO and α8 smooth muscle KO mice that show that after gavage with recombinant Mfge8, double immunofluorescent staining demonstrates co-localization of Mfge8 with α8 in antral smooth muscle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Please note that we used gavage with recombinant Mfge8 in the Mfge8 KO background because of the relatively poor anti-Mfge8 antibodies available for immunofluorescence. The recombinant Mfge8 allowed us to target the fused human-Fc domain with an anti-Fc antibody which provides more reliable staining.</p><p>3) Can the authors rule out an indirect effect on antral smooth muscle contraction due to interaction of Mfge8 with Integrins present on local neurons? Such a possibility should be experimentally addressed and/or discussed.</p><p>Since Mfge8 is a secreted molecule, a tissue-specific knockout or tissue specific-transgenic mouse expressing Mfge8 in the knockout background will not effectively rule out the possibility that in addition to ligation of integrin receptors on smooth muscle, interactions with integrin-expressing local neurons may contribute to the contraction phenotype. However, since mice with smooth muscle-specific deletion of the α8 integrin phenocopy the antral contraction phenotype observed in global Mfge8 knockouts, we can be confident that the dominant effect of Mfge8 on gastric smooth muscle contraction is due to ligation of the α8 integrin on smooth muscle. We have added a paragraph of the discussion addressing this issue (Discussion section, third paragraph).</p><p>4) Do smooth muscles develop normally in Mfge8<sup>-/-</sup> mice, given the absence of Mfge8 during neonatal development? Histological or other evidence should be provided to rule out potential alternate mechanisms such as muscle hypertrophy that might also explain enhanced muscle contractility in these mice.</p><p>We have addressed this issue by morphometric analysis of gastric smooth muscle in the adult Mfge8 KO and WT mice. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, there is no significant increase in smooth muscle thickness, indicating that smooth muscle hypertrophy is not contributing to enhanced contraction in the absence of Mfge8. This is also consistent with our previous evaluation of airway smooth muscle (Kudo et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 2013).</p><p>5) The authors should also discuss how Mfge8 that is externally administered via gavaging could penetrate the epithelial and mucosal layers to access smooth muscle Integrin receptors at a deeper location.</p><p>To address this experimentally, we gavaged Mfge8 KO mice with recombinant Mfge8 and then stained for rMfge8 in antral smooth muscle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). We found positive staining of exogenously administered recombinant Mfge8 throughout the antral smooth muscle. We speculate that Mfge8 is reaching the smooth muscle either through the bloodstream or by being taken up by the epithelial layer and subsequently being secreted from the basal surface towards the smooth muscle or entering the bloodstream from the basal side. In our previous publication using the same dose of oral Mfge8 (as used in this manuscript) to increase fat absorption, we were unable to measure detectable serum Mfge8 levels by ELISA 30 minutes after gavage<sup>2</sup>. These data would suggest that either oral Mfge8 does not get into the bloodstream or, if it does, it is below the detection level of the currently available ELISA. We have added a paragraph of the discussion addressing this issue (Discussion section, sixth paragraph).</p><p>6) PTEN activity assay in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> needs to show conversion of PIP3 to PIP2 using TLC or some other appropriate assay. PIP2 levels can vary in response to activity of many different enzymes, therefore extrapolation of PIP2 levels alone to PTEN activity is not sufficient.</p><p>The PTEN activity ELISA we utilized (Echelon cat # K-4700) specifically detects the amount of the phosphoinositide product (PI(3,4,5)P3 to PI(4,5)P2) produced in tissue lysates. The standard TLC assay also measures conversion of PIP3 to PIP2 and therefore provides no additional information beyond the assay that we used. Furthermore, many of the older assays measure the release of phosphate and therefore are less specific than the assay which we used. We agree that in theory the PIP2 produced in the lysate could be the result of another phosphatase in the tissue. However, PTEN is the main known phosphatase that mediates this reaction. In addition, the fact that siRNA knockdown of PTEN lead to enhanced calcium sensitivity and RhoA activation that was not rescued by the addition of recombinant Mfge8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G, H</xref>) gives us further confidence that PTEN is the key phosphatase modulating this pathway.</p><p>7) Farias et al. (BBRC, 2005) showed that signaling via α8 integrin promoted PI3 kinase activation. In this study the authors describe that signaling via α8 integrin inhibits PI3 kinase activity. This should be discussed.</p><p>We appreciate that our data is in opposition to what has been published in vascular smooth muscle and epithelium. We speculate that this is likely due to differences in intracellular modulators of PI3K activity. As requested, we have added further discussion of this topic in the Discussion section of the manuscript (fifth paragraph).</p><p>8) α8sm<sup>-/-</sup> mice of this study are protected from weight gain compared to wild types even on control diet after 14 weeks. On the other hand the weights of α8 integrin deficient mice or α8 integrin deficient mice crossed with ApoE deficient mice do not differ from wild types as shown by Menendez-Castro et al. (J Pathol 2015) This should be discussed.</p><p>We have addressed this issue in the Discussion section (third paragraph). In the paper by Menendez-Castro (Menendez-Castro et al., J Pathol 2013), the authors evaluated global α8 knockout mice as well as α8 knockout mice in the ApoE null background. As best as we can tell from the Methods section, the weights reported in table 1 for the global α8 knockouts are from mice that are likely between 10-16 weeks of age. We are making this estimation based on the fact that the authors state that male mice of 18 g in weight were studied and we presume this is in the c57bl/6 background (though this is not specifically stated). Our mice of that strain and sex and weight are typically 6-8 weeks of age. Then, the mice were sacrificed either 4 or 8 weeks after carotid artery ligation, but it is not clear to us which of these time points are presented in table 1. It does seem safe to conclude that the mice at their oldest would have been 16 weeks of age. Though there are no statistically significant differences in weights reported in table 1, there does appear to be a trend towards reduced weight in the α8 global knockout with the homozygotes weighing less than the heterozygotes which weigh less than the wild types. Furthermore, when we perform a 2-tailed t-test on the presented data in table 1 comparing the wild type with the global α8 knockout, we get a P value of 0.059. In our dataset, we only observe a statistically significant difference in body weight in male mice that are 21 weeks of age on a normal chow diet and the difference is quite modest. Therefore, we believe that our data is consistent with the published data. In table 2 of the paper by Menendez-Castro, the authors show that the weights of α8 KOs in the ApoE null background are no different than wild type. However,, there does appear to be a difference in weights with the ApoE null in the wild type background weighing 34.34 g with a standard deviation of 0.8 and the global α8 KOs in the ApoE null background weighing 31.54 g with a standard deviation of 0.65. Of note, these mice were studied at one year of age and the latter group developed evidence for renal disease. Whether renal disease led to retention of fluid thereby influencing body weights was not experimentally addressed and body composition was not reported. Therefore, it is somewhat difficult to compare the results of these body weights with the smooth muscle specific knockouts, we studied. That being said, we believe that the trend towards reduced body weight in the α8 KO in the ApoE null background is consistent with our findings and appeared to be quite close to reaching statistical significance based on the reported standard deviation. In fact, when we perform a 2-tailed t-test comparing ApoE null in the wild type background with the α8 KO in the ApoE null background using the reported body weights, sample size, and standard error of the mean we get a P value of 0.016 indicating that in fact there is statistical significance between body weights.</p><p>References:</p><p>1) Atabai, K., et al.
