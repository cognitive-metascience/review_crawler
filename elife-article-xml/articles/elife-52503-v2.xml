primary visual cortex (V1), which allows subsequent recovery from amblyopia. Previously we showed that perisynaptic proteolysis by MMP9 mediates the enhancement of plasticity by LRx in binocular adult mice (Murase et al., 2017). However, it was unknown if a visual system compromised by amblyopia could engage this pathway. Here we show that LRx to adult amblyopic mice induces perisynaptic MMP2/9 activity and extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation in deprived and non-deprived V1. Indeed, LRx restricted to the amblyopic eye is sufficient to induce robust MMP2/9 activity at thalamo-cortical synapses and ECM degradation in deprived V1. Two-photon live imaging demonstrates that the history of visual experience regulates MMP2/9 activity in V1, and that DE lowers the threshold for the proteinase activation. The homeostatic reduction of the MMP2/9 activation threshold by DE enables visual input from the amblyopic pathway to trigger robust perisynaptic proteolysis.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>amblyopia</kwd><kwd>MMP9</kwd><kwd>dark exposure</kwd><kwd>light reintroduction</kwd><kwd>two-photon</kwd><kwd>chronic monocular deprivation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000053</institution-id><institution>National Eye Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01EY016431</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Quinlan</surname><given-names>Elizabeth M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000055</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01DC009607</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kanold</surname><given-names>Patrick O</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Dark exposure lowers the MMP9 activation threshold, and subsequent light stimulation to an amblyopic eye is sufficient to induce proteolysis at thalamo-cortical synapses in deprived mouse visual cortex.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>An imbalance in the quality of visual inputs between the two eyes during development induces amblyopia, a developmental disorder affecting up to 4% of the world’s population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Levi et al., 2015</xref>). In animal models, prolonged monocular deprivation induces severe amblyopia, characterized by a significant decrease in the strength and selectivity of neuronal responses in the deprived visual cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fong et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Harwerth et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Montey et al., 2013</xref>) and a significant loss of spatial acuity through the deprived eye (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Harwerth et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Liao et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Montey et al., 2013</xref>). In rats, spatial acuity in the deprived eye is undetectable following chronic monocular deprivation (cMD) initiated at eye opening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Eaton et al., 2016</xref>). Additionally, following prolonged monocular deprivation, neurons in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) that project to deprived binocular visual cortex have lower metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kennedy et al., 1981</xref>) and smaller somata (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Duffy et al., 2018</xref>). cMD also significantly decreases the density of dendritic spines on pyramidal neurons in deprived binocular primary visual cortex (V1b) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Montey and Quinlan, 2011</xref>) and induces a 60% decrease in the thalamic component of the visually evoked potential (VEP, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Montey and Quinlan, 2011</xref>]).</p><p>The loss of synaptic plasticity in the primary visual cortex with age is thought to significantly impede the reversal of amblyopic deficits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tailor et al., 2017</xref>). Strong evidence demonstrates that developmental changes in the induction of synaptic plasticity in V1 are regulated by the maturation of fast-spiking basket interneurons (INs) that express the Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding protein parvalbumin (PV) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Morishita et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Stephany et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sun et al., 2016</xref>). PV<sup>+</sup> INs mediate the perisomatic inhibition of pyramidal neurons, thereby exerting powerful control of neuronal excitability and spike-timing dependent synaptic plasticity. Developmental changes in synaptic plasticity are also associated with the composition and density of the ECM, comprised of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) and hyaluronic acid, linked via cartilage link protein and tenascins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Carulli et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Celio and Chiquet-Ehrismann, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Morawski et al., 2014</xref>). Importantly, ECM molecules condense into perineuronal nets (PNNs) around a subset of PV<sup>+</sup> INs, limiting their structural and functional plasticity by imposing a physical constraint and providing binding sites for molecules that inhibit neurite outgrowth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dickendesher et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Frantz et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Stephany et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Vo et al., 2013</xref>). PNNs also accumulate molecules that regulate PV<sup>+</sup> IN excitability and maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beurdeley et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hou et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Manipulations that reduce the integrity of the ECM/PNNs have been repeatedly shown to enhance plasticity in V1 and elsewhere. Treatment of adult V1 with the bacterial enzyme chondroitinase ABC (ChABC), which cleaves the CS side chains from the CSPGs, reactivates robust plasticity in rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Pizzorusso et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Pizzorusso et al., 2002</xref>). However, recovery from MD is incomplete in cats that receive ChABC following eye opening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Vorobyov et al., 2013</xref>). Enhancement of synaptic plasticity following ChABC treatment has also been demonstrated in many other brain regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carstens et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carstens and Dudek, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gogolla et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kochlamazashvili et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Romberg et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zhao et al., 2007</xref>). Genetic ablation of cartilage link protein (Crtl1/Halpn1), which prevents the condensation of ECM molecules into PNNs, prevents the closure of the critical period for ocular dominance plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Carulli et al., 2010</xref>). Dark rearing from birth produces a parallel delay in the maturation of ECM/PNNs and the closure of the critical period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lander et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mower, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Pizzorusso et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>However, robust juvenile-like synaptic plasticity can be restored in adults by complete visual deprivation through DE followed by LRx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">He et al., 2006</xref>). Our previous work demonstrated DE/LRx induces an increase in perisynaptic activity of MMP9 and subsequent proteolysis of extracellular targets in binocular adult mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Murase et al., 2017</xref>). The proteinase activity induced by LRx is perisynaptic and enriched at thalamo-cortical synapses.Importantly, the reactivation of structural and functional plasticity by DE/LRx is inhibited by pharmacological blockade and genetic ablation of MMP9. Although <italic>Mmp9<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice are resistant to enhancement of plasticity by DE/LRx, treatment with hyaluronidase activates structural and functional plasticity in adults.</p><p>In adult rats rendered severely amblyopic by cMD from eye opening to adulthood, DE followed by reverse occlusion enables recovery of the VEP amplitude and dendritic spine density in deprived V1b (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">He et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Montey and Quinlan, 2011</xref>). Subsequent visual training promotes a full recovery of visual acuity in the deprived eye (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Eaton et al., 2016</xref>). A similar reactivation of plasticity by DE has been reported in several species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Duffy and Mitchell, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Stodieck et al., 2014</xref>). However, it is not known if the reactivation of plasticity in the amblyopic cortex is dependent on MMP9 activity or if this pathway can be engaged by the severely compromised visual system of an amblyope. Here we use a biomarker that reports the activity of MMP2/9 in vivo to examine the effects of DE/LRx on extracellular proteolysis in amblyopic mice. We show that DE lowers the threshold for activation of MMP2/9 by light, such that LRx to the deprived eye is sufficient to induce perisynaptic proteolysis at thalamo-cortical synapses and ECM degradation in deprived visual cortex.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>LRx activates perisynaptic MMP2/9 activity at thalamo-cortical synapses in deprived and non-deprived V1b</title><p>To test the hypothesis that LRx to amblyopic mice induces an increase in perisynaptic proteinase activity in V1b, we employed an exogenous MMP2/9 substrate in which fluorescence emission is quenched by intramolecular FRET when the substrate is intact (DQ gelatin; D12054; excitation/emission = 495/519 nm). Proteolysis of the substrate interrupts FRET and allows fluorescence emission, thereby reporting enzymatic activity. MMP9 has highly overlapping substrate specificity with MMP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Szklarczyk et al., 2002</xref>), and therefore the exogenous substrate(hereafter called biomarker) reports the activity of both metalloproteinases. However, our previous work demonstrated that LRx does not induce an increase in biomarker expression in <italic>Mmp9<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Murase et al., 2017</xref>). The MMP2/9 biomarker was delivered to V1b in vivo 24 hr prior to the onset of LRx (2 mg/ml, i.c. via cannula implanted 3 weeks prior to injection; 4 μl at 100 nl/min) and fluorescence emissionwas quantified in layer 4 of V1b 4 hr after LRx. Ex vivo imaging revealed punctate MMP2/9 activity in the deprived and non-deprived V1b (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) that was similar in size, density and fluorescence intensity as previously described in binocular adult mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Murase et al., 2017</xref>).

The robust induction of MMP2/9 activity by reintroduction to ambient light, therefore, suggests that DE may lower the threshold for MMP2/9 activation. To test this prediction, we used two-photon live imaging of the MMP2/9 biomarker in awake binocular mice. In these experiments, visual deprivation must be maintained during i.c. delivery of the MMP2/9 biomarker and during two-photon imaging following DE. To achieve this, we designed a novel imaging chamber containing an aperture for the placement of the objective on the cranial imaging window without light exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). In addition, we employed a small peptide MMP2/9 biomarker (A580, Mw: 1769, Anaspec) that diffuses ~1 cm from the injection site, which allowed delivery at the cranial window margin. The biomarker is a synthetic substrate for MMP2/9, containing a C-terminal fluorescent donor carboxy-tetramethyl-rhodamine (TAMRA) and an N-terminal non-fluorescent acceptor QXL (quencher) for intramolecular FRET. In the absence of MMP2/9 activity intramolecular FRET (from TAMRA to QXL) quenches fluorescence emission following excitation at 547 nm. If the peptide is cleaved by MMP2/9, intramolecular FRET is interrupted. We cfirst onfirmed the fluorescence emission peak (Em max = 585 nm) following excitation at 545 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>) in vitro, demonstrating that the biomarker reports the activation of recombinant MMP. In vivo 2P live imaging of biomarker was acquired simultaneously with GFP in pyramidal neurons following AAV-CAMKII-GFP delivery. Adult mice received DE for 10 d prior to 40 s of light stimulation (470 nm LED, 1 Hz flash). Dual imaging of biomarker and GFP revealed that both signals remained stable in the absence of visual stimulation (light intensity = 0 cd/m<sup>2</sup>). In contrast, stimulation with moderate intensity light (300 cd/m<sup>2</sup>; equivalent to luminance in the laboratory) induced an increase in raw fluorescence and biomarker ΔF/F of the biomarker, but not co-localized GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Population data reveals a significant increase in biomarker fluorescence in DE subjects following moderate intensity light stimulation (repeated measure ANOVA, F<sub>(1, 22)</sub>, p&lt;0.001; n = 12 puncta from three subjects; *p&lt;0.001, Tukey-Kramer <italic>post hoc</italic> test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>).

Co-delivery of MMP9 inhibitor (MMP9i, 5 nM 4 μl at 100 nl/min) with biomarker 24 hr prior to LRx inhibited the increase in biomarker fluorescence by high intensity light (n = 13 puncta from 3 subjects for 0 and 150,000 cd/m<sup>2</sup>; Student’s T-test; p=0.13).

Indeed, in the adult visual cortex, the threshold for activation of MMP2/9 is high and basal activity is low, favoring stability over plasticity. Brief dark-adaptation does not modify the basal activity of MMP2/9, consistent with the stability of the ECM over the light/dark cycle. In contrast, prolonged DE lowers the threshold for the induction of perisynaptic MMP2/9 activity, allowing for moderate light stimulation to trigger proteolysis in V1b. Following prolonged DE, LRx restricted to the amblyopic eye is sufficient to induce a robust and widespread increase in MMP2/9 activity, including at thalamic inputs to cortical neurons, which is blocked by a potent and specific inhibitor of MMP9. These observations, in conjunction with our previous demonstration that MMP2 activity was unchanged following LRx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Murase et al., 2017</xref>) indicate that the induction of MMP9-dependent perisynaptic proteolysis at thalamic inputs to cortical neurons by ambient light is enabled in the amblyopic visual by DE/LRx.</p><p>Prolonged DE induces several changes in the composition of function of synapses in the primary visual cortex that may influence the activation threshold for MMP2/9. For example, during DE, the NMDA subtype of glutamate receptor reverts to the juvenile form, characterized by the presence of high levels of GluN2B subunit and an increase in the temporal summation of NMDAR-mediated EPSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">He et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">He et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Yashiro et al., 2005</xref>). The change in NMDAR composition and function predicts that the threshold for Hebbian synaptic plasticity is lowered by DE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cooper and Bear, 2012</xref>). Indeed, following 3 days of DE, spontaneous activity is sufficient to induce an GluN2B-dependent potentiation of excitatory synapse strength in V1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bridi et al., 2018</xref>). However, prolonged DE alone does not induce a change in MMP2/9 biomarker expression or ECM integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Murase et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>It is well-appreciated that Hebbian plasticity is reduced at thalamo-cortical synapses early in postnatal development, and this loss is associated with the closure of critical periods in barrel, visual and auditory cortices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Crair and Malenka, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Glazewski and Fox, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kirkwood et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sun et al., 2018</xref>). The sparse co-localization of MMP2/9 biomarker with VGluT2 in binocular and amblyopic adults demonstrates that baseline activity of the protease is also low at thalamo-cortical synapses. Indeed, MMP2/9 activity is 3X higher in VGluT1<sup>+</sup> cortico-cortical synapses than VGluT2<sup>+</sup> thalamo-cortical synapses in binocular adult mice reared in a normal light:dark cycle. DE alone does not increase MMP9 activity at thalamo-cortical synapses or change the amplitude of optogenetically-evoked thalamo-cortical EPSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Petrus et al., 2014</xref>). In contrast, LRx induces an increase in perisynaptic MMP2/9 activity that is highly enriched at thalamo-cortical synapses in V1b in binocular and amblyopic adult mice. LRx stimulates a 2X increase in MMP2/9 activity at VGluT2<sup>+</sup> relative to VGluT1<sup>+</sup> synapses, consistent with different trheshold for activation at different classes of synapses. We have previously shown that the LRx induced perisynaptic proteolysis at thalamic inputs to PV<sup>+</sup> INs is coincident with a decrease in the visually-evoked activity in FS INs in binocular adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Murase et al., 2017</xref>). However, the LRx-induced increase in MMP2/9 activity in PV<sup>+</sup> and PV<sup>-</sup> locations predicts enhanced plasticity at thalamic inputs to multiple classes of neurons in the adult cortex.</p><p>Several mechanisms could contribute to the activity-dependent homeostatic regulation of MMP9. MMP9 is activated following cleavage from the inactive pro-MMP9 by other proteases, including plasmin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Davis et al., 2001</xref>) and inhibited endogenously by tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1 (TIMP1, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Candelario-Jalil et al., 2009</xref>]). Although TIMP1 is co-released from vesicles with MMP9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sbai et al., 2008</xref>), activity-dependent stimulation of synaptic mRNA translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dziembowska et al., 2012</xref>) could perturb the ratio of MMP9 to TIMP1 at thalamo-cortical synapses. Alternatively, the activation of MMP9 at thalamo-cortical synapses by LRx may be due to synapse-specific release of tissue activator of plasminogen (tPA, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lochner et al., 2006</xref>]) or synapse-specific Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling, as inhibition of CaMKII blocks depolarization-induced proteolysis by MMP9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Peixoto et al., 2012</xref>). Indeed, tPA levels increase following MD in the visual cortex during critical period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mataga et al., 2004</xref>). However, the tPA-induced increase in dendritic spine motility is occluded by MD only in extragranular and infragranular layers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Oray et al., 2004</xref>), indicating that endogenous tPA activity may be weak in thalamo-recipient granular layer.</p><p>The role of MMP9 in the promotion of synaptic plasticity has been best described in the hippocampus. LTP-inducing tetanic stimulation of CA1 neurons in slices from adult rats increases perisynaptic MMP9 activity at CA3 neuron dendritic spines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bozdagi et al., 2007</xref>). Similarly, an increase in perisynaptic MMP9 activity has been shown to be coincident with the enlargement of dendritic spines induced by a chemical LTP protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Szepesi et al., 2014</xref>). MMP9 activity has also been correlated with synaptic weakening and synaptic loss in the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bemben et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Peixoto et al., 2016</xref>). Interestingly, in kindling-induced epilepsy, MMP9 activity is associated with the pruning of dendritic spines and aberrant synaptogenesis after mossy fiber sprouting in hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wilczynski et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>MMP9 has been implicated in the response to MD during the critical period, in which a rapid, NMDAR-dependent depression of synapses serving the deprived eye is followed by a slow potentiation of synapses serving the non-deprived eye. Accordingly, non-deprived eye strengthening may compensate for deprived eye weakening to maintain activity levels in the deprived visual cortex. The similarity in ECM integrity in the visual cortex contralateral versus ipsilateral to the chronically deprived eye supports this idea Accordingly, non-deprived eye strengthening may compensate for deprived eye weakening to maintain activity levels in the deprived visual cortex. The similarity in ECM integrity in the visual cortex contralateral versus ipsilateral to the chronically deprived eye supports this idea. Deprived eye depression persists following short-term pharmacological inhibition of MMP9 in rats, but non-deprived eye strengthening is inhibited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Spolidoro et al., 2012</xref>). However, both deprived eye weakening and non-deprived eye strengthening were compromised following brief MD during the critical period in the <italic>Mmp9<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kelly et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Our previous work demonstrates that the full recovery from cMD in adulthood requires reverse deprivation and subsequent visual training after DE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Eaton et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">He et al., 2007</xref>). However, asynchronous activity through the reverse deprived eye could depress deprived eye synapses and transfer amblyopia to the originally non-deprived eye (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mitchell, 1991</xref>). Here we employed a light-occluding eye patch to block the low spatial frequency vision that persists during monocular lid suture. Interestingly, we observed no change in perisynaptic MMP2/9 activity or ECM integrity in V1b contralateral to the occluding patch.</p><p>An array of homeostatic mechanisms have been described in the central nervous system that serve to maintain the range of circuit function following changes in activity patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abraham, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Keck et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Li et al., 2019</xref>). In response to a severe reduction in activity, the strength of inhibitory synapses onto excitatory neurons decreases, while the strength of excitatory synapses on excitatory neurons and intrinsic excitability increase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blackman et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Desai et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Turrigiano et al., 1998</xref>). In contrast, a reduction in excitatory drive lowers the threshold for Hebbian plasticity, promoting the potentiation of active synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cooper and Bear, 2012</xref>). Here we expand the list of synaptic parameters that are regulated homeostatically by demonstrating the lowereing of the threshold for light-induced activation of MMP2/9 following DE. In vivo live imaging of the MMP2/9 biomarker revealed that ambient light was sufficient to induce perisynaptic MMP2/9 activity only after prolonged DE. However, 18 hr of dark adaptation induced response to high intensity light. The LRx induced increase in biomarker fluorescence was blocked by a potent and specific inhibitor of MMP9.</p><p>Importantly, LRx through the amblyopic eye is sufficient to trigger perisynaptic MMP2/9 activity and reduce ECM integrity, suggesting that deprived eye stimulation contributes to the reactivation of plasticity in amblyopic V1. The homeostatic regulation of the threshold for activity-dependent activation of MMP2/9 at thalamo-cortical synapses allows recruitment of this pathway by vision compromised by amblyopia.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Subjects</title><p>C57BL/6J mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME).

A total volume of 4 μl at 100 nl/min was delivered via a Hamilton syringe attached to a Microsyringe Pump Controller (World Precision Instruments). DQ-gelatin and A580 are exogenous FRET substrates for MMP2/9 in which fluorescence emission is blocked by intramolecular quenching (DQ gelatin; D12054; excitation/emission = 495/519 nm). Proteolysis of the substrate relieves the quenching, such that fluorescence emission reports enzymatic activity. A580 MMP Substrate 1 (AnaSpec) is a 1768 D synthetic peptide ((QXL 570 - KPLA - Nva - Dap(5 - TAMRA) - AR - NH2), containing a C-terminal fluorescent donor carboxy-tetramethyl-rhodamine (TAMRA; 5-TAMRA (547/574 nm Abs/Em) and an N-terminal non-fluorescent acceptor QXL (quencher; Abs 570 nm) for intramolecular FRET. When the molecule is intact, intramolecular FRET (from TAMRA to QXL) quenches fluorescence emission following excitation at 547 nm. However, when the peptide is cleaved by MMP2/9, intramolecular FRET is interrupted, resulting in fluorescence with Em max = 585 nm at Ex = 545 nm. As FRET from donor to acceptor quenches fluorescence, there is no FRET signal resulting from direct activation of the acceptor molecule.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Antibodies</title><p>The following antibodies/dilutions were used: mouse anti-parvalbumin (PV, Millipore) RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2174013">AB_2174013</ext-link>, 1:2000; rabbit anti-aggrecan (Agg, Millipore) RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_90460">AB_90460</ext-link>, 1:500; rabbit anti-MMP9 (Cell Signaling) RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2144612">AB_2144612</ext-link>, 1:2000; mouse anti-β-actin (Sigma-Aldrich) RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_476744">AB_476744</ext-link>, 1:2000; guinea pig anti-VGluT2 (Millipore) RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_1587626">AB_1587626</ext-link>, 1:2000; followed by appropriate secondary IgG conjugated to Alexa-488, 546 or 647 (Life Technologies) RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2534089">AB_2534089</ext-link>, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2534093">AB_2534093</ext-link>, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2535805">AB_2535805</ext-link>, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2534118">AB_2534118</ext-link>, 1:1000.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Immunohistochemistry</title><p>Subjects were anesthetized with 4% isoflurane in O<sub>2</sub> and perfused with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS.

visual cortex, a process called amblyopia. However, subsequent reduction of vision in both eyes (dark rearing) can restore plasticity, permitting recovery of function. Previously, the authors showed that recovery of function requires activation of a metalloproteinase. The authors add to their earlier study by showing that the visual experience required to restore cortical plasticity by activating this metalloproteinase can occur through the amblyopic eye. This has important implications for clinical treatment of this disorder. In addition, the authors demonstrate a novel FRET assay for perisynaptic proteolysis in vivo.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Homeostatic regulation of perisynaptic MMP9 activity in the amblyopic visual cortex&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>It is potentially suitable as a Research Advance following your previous study, but only if the claims of the manuscript can be further substantiated. In this case, the core observations need additional clarification and documentation, and probably additional experiments. In the discussion between the reviewers and editors, there was overall enthusiasm for the paper and so we encourage a resubmission, provided the core issues can be addressed. In addition to providing edited versions of the full reviews below, we have tried to indicate the strengths of the study and the key issues that need to be addressed in the revision.</p><p>Overall strengths of the study:</p><p>The authors add to their earlier study by showing that the visual experience required to restore cortical plasticity by activating matrix metaloprotease activity can occur through the amblyopic eye. This has important implications for clinical treatment of this disorder. In addition, the authors attempt to demonstrate a novel FRET assay for perisynaptic proteolysis in vivo. This latter portion of the study potentially increases its impact, but is not compelling in its present form.</p><p>Overall revision plan:</p><p>The key clarifications or additional experiments needed involve:</p><p>1) measurements that calibrate the 2-photon FRET imaging and that convincingly demonstrate a significant increase (e.g. the time course of that increase) after light exposure. Calibration (cited or done themselves) is needed to give us confidence that the sensor actually detects what it claims (other than the words on the manufacturer's website). It seems (from checking the manufacture's website) that they are activating the FRET by stimulating the GFP but it is not stated. The following questions need an answer: How was the DF/F calculated relative to the GFP signal, or biomarker signal? What evidence do we have that the imaging conditions were similar across the conditions?</p><p>2) More rigorous analysis of the co-localization including estimates that colocalization would be obtained by chance.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>The article by Murase et al. describes that one of the molecular mechanisms that is induced by light recovery following dark exposure (activation of MMP9), occurs in amblyopic animals just as it does in typically-raised animals (shown by Murase et al., 2017). In addition, the article provides evidence that expression of MMP9 occurs after dark exposure followed by light exposure at medium intensities (300 cd/m^2; matching a typical LCD computer monitor) or bright intensities (150k cd/m^2, about daylight) after either dark exposure or a shorter-duration (18 hours) dark exposure.</p><p>There are several methodological problems that will need correction.</p><p>First, the colocalization analysis is not rigorous. In order for the colocalization rates to be accurately reported, one would need to establish the expected rate of empirically counting a colocalization when there is not a synapse. In cortico-cortical synapses and in retina, confocal techniques are hopeless for this, as the density of synapses is higher than the resolution of the technique. It is possible that this is acceptable given the density of thalamocortical synapses, but no analysis is given that says this is the case. A relative increase can be argued based on the data here, but it is not <italic>eLife</italic>-quality in my opinion.</p><p>Second, the 2-photon imaging is poorly documented and poorly described. What is the FRET calibration? Apparently we are to take some δ F / F as evidence of some signal. Showing the signal over time (maybe measured every 1-2 minutes) would be one way to show convincingly that the signal increases in a meaningful way. Showing that the green signal is constant would also be helpful, but it would be better to quantify the FRET. Is there a citation where this is all given that is missing?</p><p>Third, it is important to give some comparisons for the light source. The luminance is described in units appropriate for a point source, but a surface is shown in Figure 5A. I imagined that 300 cd/m^2 is similar to a computer monitor in a dark room, and that 150k cd/m^2 is like daylight. This begs the question as to why 18 hours of darkness followed by typical daylight exposure might not be useful therapeutically? Perhaps this is an interesting discovery to be explored further?</p><p>Fourth, like 5% of scientists, I am red-green color-blind and can hardly make heads or tails of the red/green figures. It would be better to replace red with magenta (magenta = red + blue).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>In this manuscript by Murase et al., the authors expand on their previous finding outlining a case for a role of matrix metalloproteinases in restoring visual cortical plasticity with light reintroduction after dark exposure published in <italic>eLife</italic> in 2017. In the current study, the authors present compelling evidence that some of the same mechanisms (activation of MMP9) can be induced in a mouse model of amblyopia. The effect appears to be a robust one, with impressive differences in staining for their biomarker of MMP activity and for various extracellular matrix components throughout the cortical depth upon light reexposure. This Research Advance has important translational relevance in that it provides pre-clinical evidence that such a strategy could be promising as a way of restoring normal visions to patients with amblyopia. The data support the conclusions drawn. As the experiments were performed in a rigorous way, with methods similar to what the authors have published previously in <italic>eLife</italic>, I have only a few suggestions and requests for clarification [minor comments not shown].</p><p>[Editors’ note: what now follows is the decision letter after the authors submitted for further consideration.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Homeostatic regulation of perisynaptic MMP9 activity in the amblyopic visual cortex&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Andrew King as the Senior Editor, Sacha Nelson as the Reviewing Editor, and two peer reviewers.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>The reviewers and editors agreed that the additional control for the analysis of co-localization (outlined below) is straightforward to implement, could be done quickly and would strengthen the paper.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The manuscript is much improved and addresses most of the concerns very well.</p><p>I am a bit concerned that the 90 degree rotation as a control for the co-localization analysis doesn't really address the issue of chance co-localization. There are some regions of the image that correspond to cell bodies, which are practically without any label, so rotating the synaptic label onto these regions will naturally result in lower co-localization.

It seems (from checking the manufacture's website) that they are activating the FRET by stimulating the GFP but it is not stated.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the opportunity to clarify: the biomarker employed for 2P live imaging A580 MMP Substrate 1 (AnaSpec) is a 1768 D synthetic peptide substrate for MMP 2/9 ((QXL 570 – KPLA – Nva – Dap(5 – TAMRA) – AR – NH2), containing a C-terminal fluorescent donor carboxy-tetramethyl-rhodamine (TAMRA; 5-TAMRA (547/574 nm Abs/Em) and an N-terminal non-fluorescent acceptor QXL (quencher; Abs 570 nm) for intramolecular FRET. When the molecule is intact, i.e. in the absence of MMP 2/9 activity, intramolecular FRET (from TAMRA to QXL) quenches fluorescence emission following excitation at 547 nm. However, when the peptide is cleaved by <italic>MMP2</italic>/9, intramolecular FRET is interrupted, resulting in fluorescence with Em max = 585 nm at Ex = 545 nm (Figure 5B). In FRET applications that involve transfer from a fluorescent donor to a fluorescent acceptor, calibration is necessary to measure the fluorescence emission of the acceptor in the absence of FRET (i.e. direct activation of the acceptor during excitation of the donor), as a baseline to which all FRET signals are calibrated. However, the MMP biomarker peptide employed here, the FRET acceptor is non-fluorescent, such that FRET from donor to acceptor quenches fluorescence. In this case there is no FRET signal resulting from direct activation of the acceptor molecule, deeming calibration unnecessary. This is now included in the Materials and methods (subsection “MMP2/9 biomarkers and MMP9 inhibitor”).</p><p>In new Figure 5B, we present the fluorescent emission spectrum of the MMP 2/9 biomarker cleaved in vitro by recombinant active MMP9 with Em max = 585 nm at Ex = 545 nm. As described in the Materials and methods, in our 2P live imaging, the laser was tuned to 940 nm, the excitation wavelength conventionally used for dual acquisition of GCaMP and mRuby (Ex max for GCaMP=490 nm, for mRuby=558 nm, (Rose et al., 2016)), in order to simultaneously excite GFP and A580 (Ex max for GFP=490 nm, for A580=547 nm). The emission was separated into two channels using a dichroic mirror (cut off at 562 nm). In our experiments, we imaged 150 – 250 µm from the brain surface, using minimum laser power (59 mW) and PMT gain (60 for green, 100 for red). With this setting, the bleed-through from green to the red channel was negligible. This is now included in the Materials and methods (subsection “Two-photon imaging”).</p><p>In response to the second comment, we have performed new experiments that quantify the time-course of the light-induced increase in MMP biomarker fluorescence. Specifically, we show in the absence of light stimulation (0 cd/m<sup>2</sup>) in a single DE subject raw fluorescent intensity (pixels) and DF/F are unchanged for 50 seconds. Similarly, there is no change in the simultaneously acquired GFP signal over this time course. In contrast, light stimulation (300 cd/m<sup>2</sup>) induces a ~ 40% increase in raw fluorescent intensity (pixels) and DF/F of the biomarker from -10 seconds to +40 seconds of visual stimulation, but no change in simultaneously acquired GFP (new Figure 5C). Population data (12 puncta from 3 subjects; new Figure 5D) shows that the increase in biomarker DF/F induced by 300 cd/m<sup>2</sup> light stimulation is significantly differently from no light control (0 cd/m<sup>2</sup>), repeated measures ANOVA, F<sub>(1, 22)</sub>, *p&lt;0.001). In addition, we demonstrate the specificity of the biomarker for reporting MMP9 activity in new Figure 5E, in which the increase in biomarker DF/F induced by visual stimulation at 150,000 cd/m<sup>2</sup> is blocked by pre-treatment with a potent and specific inhibitor of MMP9 (MMP9 inhibitor I, CAS 1177749-58-4; IC50=5 nM); 5 nM 4 µl at 100 nl/min) p=0.13 Student’s T-test.

In addition, the article provides evidence that expression of MMP9 occurs after dark exposure followed by light exposure at medium intensities (300 cd/m^2; matching a typical LCD computer monitor) or bright intensities (150k cd/m^2, about daylight) after either dark exposure or a shorter-duration (18 hours) dark exposure.</p><p>There are several methodological problems that will need correction.</p><p>First, the colocalization analysis is not rigorous. In order for the colocalization rates to be accurately reported, one would need to establish the expected rate of empirically counting a colocalization when there is not a synapse. In cortico-cortical synapses and in retina, confocal techniques are hopeless for this, as the density of synapses is higher than the resolution of the technique. It is possible that this is acceptable given the density of thalamocortical synapses, but no analysis is given that says this is the case. A relative increase can be argued based on the data here, but it is not eLife-quality in my opinion.</p></disp-quote><p>To control for false positive co-localization of VGluT2 and MMP biomarker, we re-quantified colocalization after 90-degree rotation of the biomarker image.

What is the FRET calibration? Apparently we are to take some δ F / F as evidence of some signal. Showing the signal over time (maybe measured every 1-2 minutes) would be one way to show convincingly that the signal increases in a meaningful way. Showing that the green signal is constant would also be helpful, but it would be better to quantify the FRET.
