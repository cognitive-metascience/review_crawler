In CA1 pyramidal neurons of the hippocampus two types of AMPARs predominate: those that contain subunits GluA1 and GluA2 (GluA1/2), and those that contain GluA2 and GluA3 (GluA2/3). Whereas subunits GluA1 and GluA2 have been extensively studied, the contribution of GluA3 to synapse physiology has remained unclear. Here we show in mice that GluA2/3s are in a low-conductance state under basal conditions, and although present at synapses they contribute little to synaptic currents. When intracellular cyclic AMP (cAMP) levels rise, GluA2/3 channels shift to a high-conductance state, leading to synaptic potentiation. This cAMP-driven synaptic potentiation requires the activation of both protein kinase A (PKA) and the GTPase Ras, and is induced upon the activation of β-adrenergic receptors. Together, these experiments reveal a novel type of plasticity at CA1 hippocampal synapses that is expressed by the activation of GluA3-containing AMPARs.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>hippocampus</kwd><kwd>AMPA-receptor</kwd><kwd>plasticity</kwd><kwd>GluA3</kwd><kwd>cAMP</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003246</institution-id><institution>Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>821.02.016</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kessels</surname><given-names>Helmut W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003246</institution-id><institution>Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>864.11.014</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kessels</surname><given-names>Helmut W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A novel form of hippocampal synaptic plasticity is expressed by a change in channel function of GluA3-containing AMPA-receptors.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>AMPA-type glutamate receptors (AMPARs) are responsible for fast excitatory synaptic transmission in the brain. AMPAR channels are formed through the assembly of four AMPAR subunits. In excitatory neurons of the mature hippocampus, the majority of AMPARs consist of subunits GluA1 and GluA2 (GluA1/2 heteromers) or GluA2 and GluA3 (GluA2/3 heteromers) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wenthold et al., 1996</xref>). Each subunit has its individual properties based in part on the structure of the cytoplasmic C-terminal tail (C-tail). As an integral part of heteromeric AMPARs, the GluA2 subunit allows interactions with cytoplasmic proteins that control AMPAR transport to the cell surface and the endocytosis of AMPARs upon the induction of long-term depression of synapse strength (LTD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Anggono and Huganir, 2012</xref>). The GluA1 subunit has a unique C-tail that largely excludes GluA1-containing AMPARs from entry into synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Shi et al., 2001</xref>). Upon the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) or upon learning GluA1-containing AMPARs traffic into synapses, whereas a selective blockade of GluA1-trafficking prevent the expression of LTP and impairs memory formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kessels and Malinow, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mitsushima et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rumpel et al., 2005</xref>). In line with this, LTP and the formation of fear memories are severely impaired in GluA1-deficient mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Humeau et al., 2007</xref>). The GluA1 C-tail contains several unique phosphorylation sites by which the trafficking of GluA1 to synapses can be regulated. For instance, the C-tail of GluA1 can be phosphorylated by protein kinase A (PKA) upon a rise in the levels of intracellular cyclic AMP (cAMP), which promotes GluA1-trafficking, lowers the threshold for LTP and facilitates the formation of memories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Crombag et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Esteban et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Qian et al., 2012</xref>). A recent study extended the AMPAR subunit-specific plasticity rules by showing that the N-terminal domain (NTD) of AMPAR subunits controls the anchoring of AMPARs at synapses, with a more stable anchoring of by the GluA2 NTD compared with the GluA1 NTD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Watson et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Whereas the roles of GluA1 and GluA2 in hippocampal synaptic plasticity are well established, the significance of GluA3 has remained enigmatic. Although CA1 neurons express substantial amounts of GluA3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kessels et al., 2009</xref>), GluA3-containing AMPARs contribute little to synaptic and extra-synaptic AMPAR currents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Meng et al., 2003</xref>). In hippocampal neurons that lack GluA3 LTP and LTD are intact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Meng et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Humeau et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Reinders et al., 2016</xref>) and the capacity of GluA3-deficient mice to acquire memories is comparable to wild-type congenics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adamczyk et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Humeau et al., 2007</xref>), inferring that GluA3-containing AMPARs do not play a prominent role in plasticity mechanisms that underlie memory formation. When recombinant GluA2/3s are expressed in CA1 neurons of hippocampal slices, they are continuously delivered to synapses independent of neuronal activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Shi et al., 2001</xref>). GluA2/3s that are expressed in neurons of the cortex become enriched at synapses when these neurons are deprived of experience-dependent input, implying a role for GluA2/3s in the homeostatic scaling of synaptic strength (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Makino and Malinow, 2011</xref>). Interestingly, the presence of GluA3 is required for amyloid-β, the prime suspect to cause Alzheimer’s disease, to mediate synaptic and memory deficits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Reinders et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>In this study we show that GluA3-containing AMPARs are present at CA1 synapses in hippocampal slices, but transmit no or low currents upon glutamate binding under basal conditions. However, upon an increase in intracellular cAMP, for instance upon the activation of β-adrenergic receptors, GluA3-containing AMPARs become functional, leading to a novel type of synaptic potentiation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>cAMP selectively increases currents through GluA3-containing AMPARs</title><p>To examine the contribution of GluA3 to the pool of extra-synaptic AMPARs, we recorded currents evoked by puffing AMPA onto outside-out membrane patches excised from cell bodies of CA1 pyramidal neurons in organotypic hippocampal slices prepared from wild-type, GluA3-deficient or GluA1-deficient mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>).

Consistent with previous results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Andrásfalvy et al., 2003</xref>), GluA1-deficient outside-out patches contained relatively few functional AMPAR channels, and those that were present had a low single-channel conductance and open channel probability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>). As a result, currents were 83% smaller in the absence of GluA1 (t-test, p&lt;0.0001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), indicating that under basal conditions the majority of extra-synaptic AMPAR currents are derived from GluA1-containing AMPARs.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25462.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>cAMP increases currents of extrasynaptic GluA3-containing AMPARs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Experimental setup, example traces and averages of AMPAR amplitudes in response to AMPA puffs onto outside-out patches from WT CA1 cell bodies without (black; n=15) or with (gray; n=24) cAMP in pipette, GluA3-KO without (dark blue; n=20) or with (light blue; n=20) cAMP, and GluA1-KO without (dark red; n=18) or with (light red; n=10) cAMP.

To study how cAMP modifies AMPARs, we recorded AMPA-evoked currents from outside-out patches with or without cAMP in the solution of the recording pipette, while blocking cAMP degradation by phosphodiesterases (PDEs) with IBMX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We note that IBMX by itself did not change the amplitude of the response to AMPA puffs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). In somatic membrane patches from wild-type neurons the amplitudes of the responses to AMPA puffs were 2-fold higher in the presence of cAMP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In GluA3-deficient somatic patches cAMP failed to change AMPAR currents <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In GluA1-deficient CA1 patches AMPAR currents increased 4.5-fold in the presence of cAMP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), which occurred as a function of an increase in the estimated number of functional channels, channel conductance and open-channel probability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>). As a result, GluA3-containing AMPARs in GluA1-deficient patches activated by cAMP reached conductance levels comparable to those of GluA1-containing AMPARs in GluA3-deficient patches, the channel properties of which were not modified by cAMP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>). These experiments suggest that cAMP selectively potentiated currents through extra-synaptic GluA3-containing AMPARs, revealing a novel type of AMPAR plasticity.</p><p>To examine whether GluA3-dependent plasticity involves trafficking of GluA3 to the cell surface, we introduced recombinant GluA3 into GluA3-deficient CA1 neurons using Sindbis virus. As a means to quantify the surface levels of recombinant GluA3, the subunit was tagged with super ecliptic phluorin (SEP), a GFP variant that is only fluorescent at neutral pH, i.e. when present in the ER, cis-Golgi or at the cell surface, but not at acidic pH in late endosomes or lysosomes. We visualized the pH-sensitivity of SEP-GluA3 by acutely washing in ACSF buffered at pH 5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Whereas SEP-GluA3 expression in GluA3-deficient neurons did not alter outside-out AMPAR currents, washing in both the adenylyl cyclase activator forskolin and PDE inhibitor IBMX rescued the cAMP-driven potentiation of AMPAR currents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), indicating that recombinant GluA3 responds similarly to a rise in cAMP as endogenous GluA3. However, the SEP fluorescence levels remained unchanged at the surface area of both dendrites and cell bodies upon the forskolin/IBMX wash-in (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), suggesting that cAMP-driven GluA3-plasticity does not result from trafficking of GluA3-containing AMPARs from endocytic compartments to the cell surface.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>cAMP increases the open-channel probability of GluA3</title><p>We examined whether cAMP-signaling can activate GluA2/3-channel function by performing single-channel recordings under cell-attached configuration from soma of CA1 pyramidal GluA1- or GluA3-deficient neurons from organotypic hippocampal slices, while adding AMPA to the recording pipette. AMPARs can have different conductance states depending on the number of AMPAR subunits that effectively bind glutamate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gebhardt and Cull-Candy, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rosenmund et al., 1998</xref>). Three different open states could be distinguished in our single-channel AMPAR recordings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>). Single-channel currents of AMPARs recorded from GluA3-deficient neurons did not change in the presence of forskolin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), indicating that the channel properties of GluA1-containing AMPARs remained unchanged upon a rise in cAMP. In contrast, GluA2/3s at the surface of GluA1-deficient neurons had a low open-channel probability under basal conditions and remained largely stuck in open state 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). In the presence of forskolin the open-channel probability was on average six-fold higher and GluA3-containing AMPARs more often reached open states 2 and 3. Their average conductance increased without modifying the conductance level per open state. These experiments indicate that GluA3-containing AMPARs are largely electrically quiet under basal conditions, but become functional upon a rise in cAMP by increasing their capacity for glutamate-gated channel opening.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25462.005</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>cAMP increases the open-channel probability of GluA3-containing AMPARs.</title><p>(<bold>A, B</bold>) Single channel recordings under cell-attached configuration showing example traces, open probability, fraction of time spent in each open state, average conductance and conductances of each open state.

Forskolin incubation significantly increased AMPA/NMDA ratios evoked by stimulating Schaffer collateral inputs onto synapses of wild-type CA1 neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Consistent with the notion that the potentiation effect of forskolin is predominantly postsynaptic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sokolova et al., 2006</xref>), forskolin did not affect presynaptic glutamate release, since paired pulse ratios did not change (ANOVA: WT: p=0.8, KO: p=0.9; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) and the quantal content of evoked glutamate release determined by a variance analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>) did not increase.

AMPAR responses of approximately 50 pA in amplitude were evoked while holding the CA1 neuron at −60 mV. The same stimulation intensity was maintained at +40 mV to measure NMDAR responses, which were significantly smaller in the presence of forskolin (t-test, p=0.03), leading to increased AMPA/NMDA ratios (t-test, p=0.01). By applying a variance analysis on these AMPAR and NMDAR responses, we quantified the average quantal content of glutamate release by determining the inverse square of the coefficient of variation (1/CV<sup>2</sup>). The 1/CV<sup>2</sup> depends on the presynaptic release probability (P<sub>r</sub>) and number of effective synapses (N), but not on postsynaptic quantal size, as: 1/CV<sup>2</sup>=N×P<sub>r</sub> ⁄ (1 − P<sub>r</sub>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kerchner and Nicoll, 2008</xref>). In the presence of forskolin the 1/CV<sup>2</sup> of both AMPAR and NMDAR responses was significantly lower (AMPAR: t-test, p=0.001; NMDAR: t-test, p=0.04). Thus, a lower quantal content induced proportionally lower NMDAR responses but similarly sized AMPAR responses when forskolin was present. One explanation for this observation is that forskolin caused a decrease in P<sub>r</sub>, which was reflected by lower NMDAR responses but not AMPAR responses, because it was accompanied by an increase in the postsynaptic AMPAR response to glutamate. However, a lower P<sub>r</sub> does not match the increased mEPSC frequency in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>. A more plausible explanation therefore is that on average fewer synapses need to be stimulated in the forskolin condition to evoke synaptic AMPAR responses of the same amplitude, and this lower number of stimulated synapses led to correspondingly lower NMDA currents. In both scenarios, forskolin increased postsynaptic AMPAR currents without substantially changing NMDAR currents, and did not increase the presynaptic release probability. Forskolin incubation did not change the relative quantal content measured from AMPAR and NMDAR responses (t-test, p=0.7), which suggests that the activation of GluA2/3-plasticity in WT neurons did not involve the unsilencing of synapses.

Re-introducing GluA3 in GluA3-deficient CA1 neurons by acute viral expression of GFP-GluA3 and allowing it to be expressed for 24 hr partially rescued the forskolin-driven synaptic potentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). GluA3-dependent synaptic potentiation was also induced by directly infusing cAMP into CA1 neurons with PDEs blocked by IBMX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). Neurons that are deficient in both GluA1 and GluA3 virtually lacked mEPSC events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), indicating that synaptic AMPAR currents recorded from GluA1-deficient CA1 neurons predominantly stem from GluA3-containing AMPARs. Whereas these GluA1/GluA3 double deficient neurons were insensitive to forskolin, forskolin did elevate the mEPSC frequency in GluA1-deficient neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). To determine whether the cAMP-driven synaptic potentiation could be explained by increased single-channel conductance, we conducted peak-scaled non-stationary fluctuation analyses from mEPSCs. The synaptic AMPAR single-channel conductance was significantly increased by forskolin only when cells express GluA3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E,F</xref>). These experiments indicate that postsynaptic currents of GluA3-containing AMPARs increase upon a rise in cAMP. A postsynaptic potentiation of GluA2/3 currents that is reflected by an increase in frequency rather than average amplitude may be explained by mEPSCs rising above the detection limit for mEPSC analysis. The distribution of mEPSC amplitudes recorded from GluA1-deficient CA1 neurons suggests that indeed a substantial proportion of mEPSC events fell below the 5 pA detection limit, and this proportion appeared smaller in the presence of forskolin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>).</p><p>GluA3-containing AMPARs obligatorily exist as heteromers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Coleman et al., 2016</xref>), likely because structural constraints at their N-terminal domain prevent GluA3s from efficiently forming homomers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Herguedas et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sukumaran et al., 2011</xref>).

Unlike GluA2-containing AMPARs, GluA2-lacking AMPARs are rectifying: they conduct more easily at negative potentials. GluA1-deficient neurons displayed non-rectifying currents both in the absence and presence of forskolin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>).

Historically, AMPARs of hippocampal neurons have been assumed to predominantly consist of GluA1/2s with only a small proportion of GluA2/3s. This notion was based on the observations that mRNA levels of GluA3 are 10-fold lower compared with GluA1 and GluA2 mRNA levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tsuzuki et al., 2001</xref>) and that GluA2/3s contribute little to synaptic and extrasynaptic AMPAR currents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Andrásfalvy et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lu et al., 2009</xref>). However, the total protein levels of GluA3 in the hippocampus were shown to be substantial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Schwenk et al., 2014</xref>), and it was estimated that the AMPAR population in CA1 dendrites is composed of equivalent amounts of GluA1/2s and GluA2/3s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kessels et al., 2009</xref>). We here unify these seemingly contradictory findings by showing that GluA3-containing AMPARs are present at synapses and on the cell surface; however, they are electrically quiet under basal conditions.</p><p>GluA3-mediated currents substantially increase when intracellular cAMP levels are increased in CA1 neurons. Our single-channel recordings indicate that these increased currents are a consequence of an improved capacity of glutamate to open the AMPAR channel. GluA1-containing AMPARs opened their channels independently of cAMP levels, suggesting that this type of AMPAR channel plasticity is an exclusive feature of GluA2/3s. The activation of GluA2/3-plasticity by cAMP is fast, since outside-out patches were pulled from whole-cell configuration after allowing cAMP to flow inside the cell for less than ~10 s. Our experiments indicate that PKA activation is insufficient for the cAMP-driven activation of GluA2/3-plasticity but requires the activation of both PKA and Ras. A cAMP-dependent signaling pathway that depends on both PKA and Ras activation is the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Li et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Enserink et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ambrosini et al., 2000</xref>). However, whether PKA either promotes Ras-Erk signaling or inhibits Erk (thereby possibly skewing Ras activation towards an alternative Ras-signaling pathway) is dependent on the levels of additional signaling factors and on cell type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Smith et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Qiu et al., 2000</xref>). Which downstream targets of PKA/Ras activate GluA2/3-plasticity in CA1 neurons and how they alter GluA2/3-channel function remains to be established. Future structural studies may reveal whether PKA/Ras signaling triggers a putative conformational change within the GluA3 subunit that allows either glutamate to access the ligand binding site or glutamate binding to open the channel.</p><p>The cAMP-driven activation of GluA2/3s at the surface of cell bodies mirrors GluA2/3-plasticity at synapses: both increased approximately two-fold in currents upon a rise in cAMP. These results imply that similar to its total levels at CA1 dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kessels et al., 2009</xref>) approximately half of the synaptic and extrasynaptic AMPAR population consists of GluA2/3s. When recombinant GluA3 was acutely expressed in GluA3-deficient CA1 neurons of organotypic slices, the newly formed GluA3-containing AMPARs were inserted onto to the surface and into synapses without a change in synaptic or extrasynaptic AMPAR currents. However, upon a rise in cAMP they showed increased currents at both synaptic and extrasynaptic sites without a change in GluA3 levels at synapses or at the cell surface. Our results therefore indicate that GluA3-containing AMPARs constitutively traffic into synapses in an inactive state and only contribute to synaptic currents after cAMP levels have risen. In contrast, GluA1-containing AMPARs are largely kept out of the synapse under basal conditions and require LTP-like activity to traffic into synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kessels et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Makino and Malinow, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Shi et al., 2001</xref>). A recent study showed that LTP can be expressed by the insertion of both GluA1-containing and GluA1-lacking AMPARs into synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Granger et al., 2013</xref>). Although this study did not show whether this is also the case for GluA2/3s, our finding that GluA2/3s are electrically dormant under basal conditions may explain why LTP is not visible in GluA1-deficient hippocampal slices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Granger et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Humeau et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zamanillo et al., 1999</xref>). A previous study showed that a slowly arising LTP can be seen in GluA1-deficient slices when a theta-burst stimulation is paired with a postsynaptic depolarization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Frey et al., 2009</xref>). We speculate that upon this stimulation protocol a gradual increase in cAMP levels may have activated GluA2/3-plasticity.</p><p>In our experiments a postsynaptic change in AMPAR currents was reflected more prominently by a change in mEPSC frequency than by a change in mEPSC amplitude, which has been observed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Watson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lee et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rumbaugh et al., 2006</xref>) and is a consequence of a large proportion of mEPSCs recorded from CA1 neurons falling below the 5 pA detection limit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). An increase in mEPSC frequency rather than mEPSC amplitude upon the activation of GluA2/3-plasticity may be further explained by the findings that GluA1/2s and GluA2/3s are differentially distributed at CA1 synapses. Whereas GluA3 is uniformly distributed within synapses, GluA1 tends to be more concentrated towards their edges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jacob and Weinberg, 2015</xref>) and large CA1 synapses are particularly enriched in GluA1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Shinohara and Hirase, 2009</xref>). When a mEPSC is generated by the release of a single vesicle onto a micro-domain within a synapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">MacGillavry et al., 2013</xref>) that predominantly contains GluA2/3s, its amplitude may only surpass the detection limit after a rise in cAMP. Reversely, glutamate binding to a micro-domain that contains mainly GluA1 and little GluA3 may produce mEPSCs that are detectable under basal conditions, but the amplitude of such mEPSCs will benefit only little from GluA2/3-plasticity. In such a scenario, the frequency of mEPSC events increases more than their average amplitude. Similarly, CA1 neurons, in which either GluA1 or GluA3 are depleted, are mostly affected in mEPSC frequency and little in amplitude (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lu et al., 2009</xref>). We therefore propose that variations in mEPSC frequency, if not caused by a change in presynaptic vesicle release or the number of functional synapses, can be a manifestation of a postsynaptic AMPAR subunit-specific effect.</p><p>Besides the hippocampus, GluA3-containing AMPARs are present in most other brain regions, including the cortex, amygdala, striatum, thalamus, brain stem, olfactory bulb, nucleus accumbens and cerebellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Breese et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Reimers et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Schwenk et al., 2014</xref>), suggesting that GluA2/3-plasticity may be operative throughout the brain. GluA3-deficient mice show a number of physiological and behavioral abnormalities, which may putatively depend on GluA2/3-plasticity in different brain regions. For instance, GluA3-deficient mice show increased social and aggressive behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adamczyk et al., 2012</xref>), a reduced alcohol-seeking behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sanchis-Segura et al., 2006</xref>), impaired auditory processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">García-Hernández et al., 2017</xref>), and altered electroencephalographic patterns in the cortex during sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Steenland et al., 2008</xref>). Based on the findings in this study, we examined the role of GluA3-dependent plasticity at synapses onto Purkinje cells (PCs) of the cerebellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gutierrez-Castellanos et al., 2017</xref>). We found that the AMPAR-subunit specific rules for synaptic plasticity in PCs were reversed compared with CA1 neurons: motor learning and the expression of LTP did not require GluA1, but critically depended on GluA3. Similarly as at CA1 synapses, synaptic potentiation was accomplished by the activation of GluA3-channel function upon a rise in cAMP. An interesting difference is that GluA3-dependent plasticity in PCs is mediated by Epac/Rap1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gutierrez-Castellanos et al., 2017</xref>). Since Ras and Rap1 trigger similar downstream (Erk) signaling pathways with different temporal patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Li et al., 2016</xref>), Ras and Rap1 may activate a transient or persistent form of GluA2/3-plasticity respectively. Thus, GluA2/3-plasticity may have different functions contingent on the cell type and brain regions in which it is expressed.</p><p>The activation of β-ARs at CA1 neurons of the hippocampus can stimulate two independent forms of AMPAR plasticity in parallel. First, PKA phosphorylation of GluA1-containing AMPARs facilitates their trafficking to synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Man et al., 2007</xref>), thereby facilitating memory formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hu et al., 2007</xref>). We identified a second cAMP-dependent form of AMPAR plasticity. Our data show that GluA2/3s at synapses increase their currents upon β-AR activation. Other signaling pathways that influence intracellular cAMP levels, like for instance those activated by dopamine, serotonin or acetylcholine release, may theoretically influence GluA3-containing AMPARs as well. It will be interesting to assess under which conditions GluA3-containing AMPARs in the hippocampus are activated and how GluA2/3-plasticity influences the formation and retrieval of contextual memories.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p>The <italic>Gria3</italic>-deficient (GluA3-KO) and wild-type littermate colony was established from C57Bl/6 × 129P2-Gria3tm1Dgen/Mmnc mutant ancestors (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/MMRRC_030969-UNC">MMRRC_030969-UNC</ext-link>) (MMRRC, Davis, CA), which were at least 6 times backcrossed to C57Bl/6 mice. <italic>Gria1</italic>-deficient (GluA1-KO) mice were a kind gift from Dr. R.

During mEPSC recordings, TTX (1 μM; Tocris) and picrotoxin (100 μM; Sigma) were added to the bath. Where indicated, the following drugs were added to the perfusion solution: forskolin (50 μM; Sigma), IBMX (50 μM; Tocris), KT5720 (4 μM; Tocris), PKI (2 μM; Calbiochem), ESI05 (10 μM; Biolog); Salirasib (10 μM; Tocris); or inside the recording pipette: cAMP (100 μM; Sigma), N002 (100 μM; Biolog), 8-CPT (20 μM; Tocris). During evoked recordings, a cut was made between CA1 and CA3, and picrotoxin (50 μM) and 2-chloroadenosine (4 μM; Tocris) were added to the bath. Two stimulating electrodes, (two-contact Pt/Ir cluster electrode, Frederick Haer), were placed 100 μm apart between 100 and 300 μm down the apical dendrite and 200 μm apart laterally. AMPAR-mediated EPSCs were measured as the peak inward current at −60 mV directly after stimulation. Paired pulse ratios were determined with an inter pulse interval of 50 ms. NMDAR-mediated EPSC were measured as the mean outward current between 40 and 90 ms after the stimulation at +40 mV, and corrected by the current at 0 mV. Rectification was calculated as the ratio of the peak AMPAR current at −60 and +40 mV, corrected by the current at 0 mV, in the presence of D-APV (100 μM; Tocris) in the bath and Spermine (0.1 mM; Sigma) in the intracellular solution. EPSC amplitudes were obtained from an average of at least 30 sweeps at each holding potential. Acute hippocampal slices were prepared from 3 to 5 week-old mice. Dissection was done in ice-cold sucrose cutting solution containing (in mM): 2.5 KCl, 1.25 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 26 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 10 D-glucose, 230 Sucrose, 0.5 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 MgSO<sub>4</sub>, bubbled with 95%O<sub>2</sub>/5%CO<sub>2</sub>. Brain slices (400 μm) were cut using a vibratome (Thermo Scientific) and placed in a holding chamber containing ACSF supplemented with (in mM) 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 20 glucose and bubbled with 95%O<sub>2</sub>/5%CO<sub>2</sub>. They were allowed to recover at 34°C for 40 min then at room temperature for at least 40 min. Whole-cell recordings (3–5 MΩ pipettes, R<sub>access</sub> &lt; 26 MΩ, and R<sub>input</sub> &gt; 10 x R<sub>access</sub>) were made in ACSF containing TTX (1 μM) and picrotoxin (50 μM) at 28°C. To block Ras, 3 μg/ml the OP01 Anti-v-H-Ras (Ab-1) Rat mAb (Y13-259, Millipore; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_565094">AB_565094</ext-link>) or Rat IgG1 isotype control (MA1-90035, Invitrogen; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_10984952">AB_10984952</ext-link>) was included in the intracellular solution. After obtaining whole-cell configuration the antibody was allowed to diffuse in the cell for 5 min before recording. After 10 min FSK was added to the perfusion and allowed to wash in for 5 min. Data was acquired using a Multiclamp 700B amplifier (Molecular Devices). mEPSC data are based on at least 100 events or 5 min of recording, with exception of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref> (1 min). Data were analyzed with MiniAnalysis (Synaptosoft). Individual events above a 5 pA threshold were manually selected. Evoked recordings were analyzed using pClamp 10 software (Molecular Devices).</p><p>Non-stationary noise analysis of outside-out patches traces was carried out following previously described methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alvarez et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hartveit and Veruki, 2007</xref>). Peak aligned AMPA-evoked currents recorded over 10–15 sweeps per outside out patch, were binned in 10 equally sized bins of 150 ms each and for each bin, the mean amplitude and variance was calculated. The data distribution resulting after plotting amplitude versus variance was fitted with the following equation: <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mi>σ</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msup><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msup></mml:mrow><mml:mi>N</mml:mi></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>σ</mml:mi><mml:mi>b</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msubsup></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>, where the variance (σ<sup>2</sup>) of the amplitude of the current (I) obtained at each time point is explained as a function of the single unitary current (i) and the number of functionally conducting channels (N) with an offset given by the variance of the baseline noise (σ<sup>2</sup><sub>b</sub>). From the derivative at I=0, the relative number of functional channels was extracted as well as the single channel conductance which was calculated by dividing the unitary current by the applied voltage with respect to the reversal potential (V<sub>holding</sub>-E<sub>reversal</sub>, −60 mV and 0 mV respectively). The peak open probability (P<sub>o</sub>), corresponding to the fraction of available functional channels open at the time of the peak current (I<sub>peak</sub>), can be calculated from the following equation: <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf2"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>k</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>N</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>x</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>, where N<sub>max</sub> represents the theoretical maximum of available channels opened at the point where the theoretical maximum amplitude reaches the minimum variability (σ<sup>2</sup><sub>b</sub>) in the given parabola fit. Single channel activity was analyzed using ClampFit (Molecular Devices). Three detection thresholds were used to detect O1 (1.5 pA), O2 (3 pA) and O3 (4.5 pA) openings in single channel AMPARs in steady baseline recordings (no holding current fluctuations). Events with latency shorter than 0.3 ms were ignored to prevent noise from being recognized as openings. Non-stationary noise analyses for the mEPSC events were based on peak scaled mEPSCs.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Two-photon laser scanning microscopy</title><p>Wild-type organotypic hippocampal slices were sparsely infected with Sindbis virus expressing SEP-GluA1 or SEP-GluA3 together with tdTomato as cytoplasmic marker, and were used in experiments 20–28 hr after viral infection. Three-dimensional images were collected on a custom-built two-photon microscope based on a Fluoview laser-scanning microscope (Femtonics). The light source was a mode-locked Ti:sapphire laser (Chameleon, Coherent) tuned at 910 nm using a 20× objective. During imaging, slices were kept under constant perfusion of aCSF (in mM: 118 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 26 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 1 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, supplemented with 4 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 4 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 20 glucose) at 30°C, gassed with 95%O<sub>2</sub>/5%CO<sub>2</sub>. Images were captured every 1 μm from infected CA1 pyramidal cell bodies or apical dendrites past the point of bifurcation of primary to secondary dendrites, approximately 300 μm from the cell body. Fluorescence intensity was quantified from projections of stacked sections using ImageJ software (NIH). For photobleaching experiments, apical dendrites were imaged 100–300 μm from the cell body (pixel size x,y,z 0.1 × 0.1 × 0.5 μm). Photobleaching of SEP-fluorescence on spines was achieved by prolonged xy scanning for 30 s. The cytoplasmic tdTomato signal recovered immediately after photobleaching (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). To determine the photon recovery after photobleaching (FRAP), background-subtracted and leak-corrected red and green fluorescence were quantified and the mean signal intensity of spines was normalized to that of the dendrite and compared across time.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Stereotactic hippocampal viral injections and E-injection</title><p>Adeno-associated virus (AAV) with a titer between 10<sup>12</sup>–10<sup>13</sup> particles/ml were produced from AAV5-pSynapsin1-GFP and AAV5-pSynapsin1-CreGFP. 3 week-old <italic>Gria3<sup>lox/lox</sup></italic> mice were anesthetized with isofluorane (induction 5%, maintenance 2%) and positioned in a stereotaxic apparatus, kept on a heating pad. Bilateral hippocampal injections of viral solutions (3 injection sites per side; 400 nl per site; AP: −1.5, –1.7, −1.9; L: ±1.5; DV: 1.2 mm) were delivered with a glass micropipette through a hole drilled in the skull by pressure application (Nanoject II, Auto-Nanoliter Injector, Drummond Scientific). E-injection experiments were performed with <italic>Gria3<sup>lox/lox</sup></italic> mice 3 weeks after viral injections, or with WT, GluA3-KO or GluA1-KO littermate mice at 3–4 weeks of age. (±)-Epinephrine hydrochloride (0.5 mg/kg, Sigma-Aldrich) and (±)-Propranolol hydrochloride (20 mg/kg, Sigma-Aldrich) were dissolved in saline (0.9%, NaCl) and injected intraperitoneally (5 ml/kg). 10 min after E-injection mice were place in a novel environment for 2 min and the locomotion of the mice was measured as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kopec et al., 2007</xref>) or they were sacrificed to acutely isolate brain slices.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Statistics</title><p>A power analysis was performed prior the experiments to estimate the average sample size. For power analyses 2-sample, two-sided tests were used with the assumption of equal variance, a power of 0.8 and a Type I error (alpha) of 0.05 were used. If effect sizes could not be estimated based on prior experiments a minimal effect size of 0.2 was used. For all experiments biological replication of effect was obtained by the use of slices from at least three different litters of mice. Experiments that are depicted in the same graph were performed in parallel and with hippocampal slices of littermate mice. Data sets were Log-transformed and normal distributions were obtained. All data were analyzed using two-tailed Student <italic>t</italic> tests to compare 2 conditions (unpaired, unless indicated paired t-test) or with ANOVAs with post-hoc Tukey comparisons for more than 2 conditions. Reported p-values are post hoc contrasts, unless overall ANOVA was not significant. Repeated-Measures ANOVAs were used to assess effects over time. <italic>P</italic> values below 0.05 were considered statistically significant.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous. Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The reviewers and editors all recognized the interesting core result regarding the increase in open probability of hippocampal AMPA receptors upon exposure to PKA. They also noted, however, a number of technical questions, internal inconsistencies, relatively small sample sizes with respect to the variance, and possible alternative interpretations. Because it would take substantial additional experiments to address these points and resolve all the associated questions, we cannot consider this work further. (Although some points in the reviews brought up new types of experiments and the relation of this study to previous work, these issues were not the basis for our decision.) The full reviews are included below.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The manuscript by Renner et al. tests whether increasing cAMP levels in pyramidal neurons reveals a role of GluA3 in synaptic transmission. Understanding the mechanisms by which second messengers like cAMP regulate the properties of AMPA receptors and fast synaptic transmission is critical. The authors by using a series of electrophysiological and imaging experiments argue that under basal conditions GluA3 channels have very little contribution in synaptic transmission due to their low conductance and probability opening. However, when cAMP levels are elevated GluA3 shifts to a high-conductance state allowing them to contribute to point-to-point transmission in hippocampus. Importantly, this shift in the GluA3 mode is not due to PKA or EPAC, two well-established effectors of cAMP, but rather through Ras activation.</p><p>Although the authors' findings provide a new insight in regards to the regulation of AMPA receptors in hippocampus, there are concerns with this work.</p><p>1) Throughout, the authors use FSK or direct application of high levels of cAMP to test whether cAMP can increase the activity of AMPA receptors and in this work GluA3. It would have been important to also test whether the same effect occurs when cAMP is elevated through β-adrenergic receptors, a more physiologically relevant means to increase cAMP levels in hippocampus. In general it's unclear whether the effects are a result of a very large cAMP stimulus.</p><p>2) They then argue that cAMP exerts its effects through Ras. Considering that, they also show that cAMP can induce its effects in outside-out patches, – is Ras associated with GluA3? How do the authors know whether Ras directly activates GluA3 channels rather than regulate the relationship between TARPs or cornichons and GluA3; auxiliary AMPA receptor subunits known to control the biophysical properties of AMPA receptors? These questions should have been addressed in order to provide a mechanistic insight on how cAMP-Ras control AMPA receptors. Importantly, it would have been important to test the proposed cAMP and Ras mechanism in an expression system that does not natively express AMPA receptors, like HEK293 cells.</p><p>3) The authors argue that application of FSK in slices increased the AMPA and NMDA ratio presumably due to potentiation of postsynaptic GluA3 receptors, as GluA3 null neurons do not show this increase in the AMPA/NMDA ratio. They argue against any presynaptic effects of FSK, as PPR did not change in the presence of FSK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). However, they then show that FSK increases mEPSC frequency in the GluA3 null neurons, although not to the same extent as in control neurons. This would then suggest that FSK has presynaptic effects, which are not controlled in this work. Additionally, previous work has also shown that cAMP changes NMDA receptor activity (Raman et al. 1996; Westphal et al. 1999), as such the AMPA/NMDA ratio is difficult to quantitatively interpret in the presence and absence of FSK/cAMP.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript Renner et al. reported that cAMP/FSK enhances GluA3-containing AMPAR-mediated currents in hippocampal neurons, similar to their finding in cerebellar Purkinje cells published earlier this year in Neuron (Gutierrez-Castellanos et al., 2017). Using outside-out patches and single channel recording of somatic membrane of CA1 neurons derived from WT, GluA1 or GluA3 KOs, they concluded that this enhancement is due to an increase in open probability of GluA3-containing AMPARs. Similar enhancements were observed at the synaptic level when analyzing AMPAR-mediated mEPSCs. The authors further explored signaling pathways underlying cAMP/FSK enhanced synaptic currents pharmacologically using inhibitors. This manuscript identifies a novel regulation of GluA3-containing AMPARs. However, due to the complexity of the effects of cAMP and some internal discrepancies in the data it is difficult to come to the simple conclusions presented by the authors. Specific comments are listed as the following:</p><p>1) Assuming AMPARs in hippocampus are predominately in forms of GluA1/2 and GluA2/3, the authors compared cAMP/FSK-induced currents in WT (which contains both GluA1/2 and GluA2/3), GluA1 KO (which contains GluA2/3 only) and GluA3 KO (which contains GluA1/2 only). Since the GluA3 KO cells did not respond to cAMP/FSK like the WT and GluA1 KO did, the authors concluded that cAMP/FSK selectively potentiate currents from GluA&quot;2/3&quot; type of AMPARs. The Effect of cAMP could actually be on GluA2 when combined with GluA3. The title of this manuscript &quot;Synaptic Plasticity through activation of AMPA-receptor subunit GluA3&quot; is therefore somewhat misleading, as they did not show a direct effect of cAMP/FSK on GluA3 subunit nor provide its role in synaptic plasticity. Further evidence is required to make GluA3-specific claims and its effects on synaptic plasticity.</p><p>2) The trafficking experiments done by live imaging of SEP-GluA3 delivered by sindbis virus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), as well as transfected SEP-GluA1 or SEP-GluA3 in CA1 neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) are not convincing as these subunits when overexpressed alone tend to form homomers (GluA1/1 or GluA3/3) and may not reflect trafficking events of endogenous AMPARs (Sin et al., 2001). GluA3/3 in particular were reported to be absent in synapses even though it can be observed in spines. Alternative methodology examining endogenous AMPAR subunits such as isolation of PSD fraction of AMPARs or immunostaining of synaptic AMPARs would be a better approach.</p><p>3) AMPA/NMDA ratio results are confusing. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>, the major effect of FSK in WT cells appears to decrease NMDAR current, but leave AMPAR current unchanged. If so, what is the explanation? Is loss of the FSK effect on A/N ratio in GluA3 KO NMDAR-related?</p><p>4) The rescue experiment, in which GFP-GluA3 is reintroduced into GluA3 KO to evaluate GluA3-specific manipulation in synaptic transmission, is not convincing. While the FSK-induced frequency increase in WT cells is ~4 fold (1 to 4 Hz), the magnitude in GluA3 KO is ~2 fold (1 to 2Hz, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) similar to the magnitude obtained from the rescue condition (~ 2 fold, 0.75 to 1.5 Hz, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, GFP-GluA3 infected). The author should plot <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C and E</xref> using the same scale for the ease of comparison of the frequency graphs. Similarly, the absence of FSK-induced potentiation in amplitude in GluA3 KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, GluA3 KO) was not rescued in GFP-GluA3 infected GluA3 KO neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, GFP-GluA3 infected).</p><p>5) FSK is well known to potentiate GluA1-containing AMPARs and FSK induced mEPSC frequency can be observed in WT, GluA3 KO and GluA1 KO neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C and D</xref>), the pharmacology and antibody effects on mEPSC frequency done in WT cells (all experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) are difficult to interpret. Further experiments using KO neurons are required to make a clear claim.</p><p>6) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, the basal (FSK-/PKI+) mEPSC frequency in RAS-IgG neurons seems to be higher than the Ctrl-IgG. However, the basal (FSK-/PKI-) mEPSC frequency seems comparable between Ctrl-IgG and RAS-IgG neurons. If RAS-IgG neurons with PKI treatment do show a higher frequency than the Ctrl-IgG neurons, this would be an occlusion effect of PKI but not a blocking effect of RAS-IgG.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>Renner et al. propose a novel mechanism of cAMP-mediated AMPA receptor current potentiation. By using AMPA receptor knockout mice, they dissect the contribution of the two AMPA subunits GluA1 and GluA3 to this effect. With recordings of extrasynaptic currents they show that cAMP alters conductance states of Glu3 but not of GluA1 channels. Recordings of synaptic currents and FRAP experiments suggest that this increase in GluA3 conductance rather than increased insertion of AMPA receptors into synapses is responsible for the cAMP-mediated synaptic potentiation. Finally, they describe that RAS activity is required for the cAMP-mediated synaptic potentiation.</p><p>The study is interesting as it identifies how &quot;dormant&quot; GluA3 channels are activated by cAMP. This finding, however, is not novel. The authors published this year another study on a very similar mechanism in Purkinje cells of the cerebellum (Gutierrez-Castellanos et al., Neuron 2017). There are some differences in the findings of the two studies (e.g. Epac vs. Ras dependency), but the main novelty of the current study is that cAMP influences GluA3 also in the hippocampus. Similar to the previous study, the authors provide high quality results of several experiments that very convincingly show the influence of cAMP on extrasynaptic GluA3 channels. However, results of extrasynaptic recordings are less convincing (see below). Finally, it would be important to show if and how much a cAMP-mediated increase in GluA3 currents contributes to a more physiological form of synaptic plasticity. In conclusion, the study is still preliminary in its present form and needs additional experiments for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>1) Variability of mEPSC frequencies across experiments is very high. This precludes comparing results from the different experiments and drawing conclusions about the contribution of GluA1 or GluA3 from those comparisons. For example, mEPSC frequency in wildtype neurons without treatment differ by 0.7 Hz (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>: 0.7; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>: 1.4 Hz). In addition, the FSK-mediated increase is very different in wildtype neurons (+3.2 Hz in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> and 1.2 Hz in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). In fact, the FSK-mediated increase shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref> is similar to the increase in GluA3 knockout mice shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> (+ 1 Hz). Results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref> strongly suggest that GluA3 channels play a role for the increase in synaptic strength in wildtype neurons. However, the contribution is most likely small (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> +0.6 Hz, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref> +0.3 Hz). Again, the high variability of mEPSC frequency in the different experiments makes a direct comparison very difficult. Thus, my major concern is that experiments shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref> do not allow drawing conclusions about the relevance of cAMP-mediated increase in GluA3 function for synaptic plasticity in CA1 neurons. That is for example in contrast to the study of Gutierrez-Castellanos et al. (Neuron 2017) that convincingly showed that GluA3 channels and the novel GluA3 plasticity play a role for synaptic function of Purkinje cells (mEPSC frequency, amplitude, LTP) and mouse behaviour (VOR).</p><p>2) What was the rational to use acute brain slices from 3-5 weeks old mice in some experiments and organotypic slices of newborn mice in others? The mechanisms of FSK potentiation of synaptic currents might very well differ in the two preparations.</p><p>3) The conclusion that Ras plays a role in GluA3-plasticity and competes with PKA-mediated GluA1-plasticity is not convincing. Except for the small increase in mEPSC amplitude, Ras-IgG have no influence on mEPSCs. In addition, experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref> are again very difficult to interpret since variability is high. Thus, is the lack of an effect of FSK explained because RAS-IgG increases mEPSC frequency in the -FSK control condition? mEPSC frequency in the presence of FSK is very similar irrespective of presence or absence of PKI or RAS-IgG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6 B and C</xref>). In addition, what was the rational to compare Fold-changes in frequency in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6 B-C</xref> instead of mEPCS frequency as in all other experiments? Finally, the number of neurons analyzed should be increased. In fact, I am surprised that the small difference in Fold-change in 6C reaches significance with an N of 5 and I am pretty sure that there would be no significant difference in the FSK-mediated increase in mEPSC frequency between IgG and RAS-IgG.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what now follows is the decision letter after the authors submitted for further consideration.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Synaptic Plasticity through activation of GluA3-containing AMPA-receptors&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Gary Westbrook (Senior Editor), a Reviewing Editor, and two reviewers.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>Remaining revisions:</p><p>Both reviewers acknowledged the value of the additional experiments but both brought up areas in which the interpretation of experiments should be constrained or clarified. Specifically,</p><p>1) The experiments directly activating β-adrenergic receptors are interesting but the experiments were done under extreme (with IBMX) or nonspecific (with i.p.) conditions. The reviewers recognize that these are useful as proof of principle, but we suggest that the limitations of the experiment be made clear, particularly in discussions of the literature (e.g. extent to which these results can reconcile other studies).</p><p>2) Also, the analysis of mEPSCs raised questions regarding the specificity/magnitude of the GluA3 contribution to the effect of blocking RAS/PKA. Please interpret/explain the data in context of the difference in baseline rates between wild-type and KO, and curtail and/or clarify the conclusions accordingly.</p><p>The full comments of the reviewers are given below to place the comments in context. We expect that these points can be addressed with textual/figure revisions.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This is a revised manuscript by Renner et al. showing that high concentrations of cAMP facilitates AMPA receptors through GluA3 subunits. The authors have performed several new experiments that clarify and support their previous conclusions. However, one of my previous concerns was the use of very high concentrations of cAMP or the use of FSK. To address this they tested whether activation of β-adrenergic receptors – a more physiologically relevant experiment – can also lead to GluA3 mediated plasticity. They indeed demonstrate that application of ISO evokes GluA3 potentiation, however only when PDEs are blocked. This suggests that the proposed GluA3 plasticity might take place under non-physiological conditions. They also show that i.p. injection of EPI in mice could lead to GluA3 AMPA receptor potentiation. This experiment is very difficult to interpret, as global activation of b-adrenergic receptors will initiate multiple downstream signaling pathways. Due to these reasons my enthusiasm for this work is still dampened.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>Renner and colleagues added a substantial number of new experiments that clarified some concerns. In particular the experiments shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> increased the novelty of the study and provided evidence that physiological stimuli can induce cAMP-mediated activation of GluA3-containing AMPA-receptors. In conclusion, the comprehensive study of Renner et al. is largely convincing and suitable for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>I am still not convinced by the mEPSC data as the high variability of mEPSC frequency within one genotype precludes drawing conclusions about the contribution of GluA3 during cAMP mediated changes in synaptic function. A calculation of fold-change in frequency is not really helpful for an estimation of the contribution of GluA3. Absolute changes in frequency have to be compared for such an estimation. The very small increase in mEPSC frequency in GluA1 KO mice (approx. 0.1 Hz in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">figure 6</xref>) compared to the much bigger increase in wt mice (approx. 0.5 Hz also in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) suggests that the contribution of GluA2/3 heteromers is rather small.

Within this time frame, outside-out patches were pulled, which showed increased AMPAR currents. Thus, within seconds cAMP triggered intracellular signaling leading to increased AMPAR currents. When we repeated this experiment without adding cAMP in the recording pipette, but instead we pulled inside-out patches and used direct application of cAMP onto these inside-out patches, we did not observe an activation of GluA3-dependent plasticity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). This experiment argues against cAMP directly activating proteins associated with the AMPAR complex.</p><p>We have expanded our experiments on the dependency of Ras of the activation of GluA3-plasticity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> in revised manuscript). These experiments reveal that both Ras and PKA activation need to be blocked to prevent synaptic potentiation of GluA3-containing AMPARs. We discuss the implications of these findings in the second paragraph of the Discussion section.</p><p>The PKA/Ras signaling pathway has been described previously in non-neuronal cells. Our study is the first to show a functional consequence of PKA/Ras signaling in neurons. How PKA/Ras signaling leads to the activation of GluA2/3 channels we will address during the next years in collaboration with experts on PKA/Ras signaling and with experts on AMPAR structure/function relationships.</p><p><italic>3) The authors argue that application of FSK in slices increased the AMPA and NMDA ratio presumably due to potentiation of postsynaptic GluA3 receptors, as GluA3 null neurons do not show this increase in the AMPA/NMDA ratio. They argue against any presynaptic effects of FSK, as PPR did not change in the presence of FSK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). However, they then show that FSK increases mEPSC frequency in the GluA3 null neurons, although not to the same extent as in control neurons. This would then suggest that FSK has presynaptic effects, which are not controlled in this work. Additionally, previous work has also shown that cAMP changes NMDA receptor activity (Raman et al. 1996; Westphal et al. 1999), as such the AMPA/NMDA ratio is difficult to quantitatively interpret in the presence and absence of FSK/cAMP.</italic></p><p>The main conclusion of our manuscript is that a rise in cAMP increases postsynaptic GluA3-dependent currents. That a rise in cAMP besides postsynaptic changes, also produces presynaptic plasticity, is not challenged by us. Nevertheless, in our experimental preparations forskolin predominantly produced postsynaptic effects in CA1 neurons, which is in line with a previous study (Sokolova et al., 2006). This conclusion is based on the following observations/analyses:</p><p>- Forskolin produced an increase in AMPA/NMDA ratio in WT neurons, but not in GluA3-KO neurons. A variance analysis on our recordings of AMPA/NMDA ratios in WT neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>) indicates that:</p><p>a) forskolin did not detectably increase the presynaptic release probability;</p><p>b) forskolin increased AMPAR currents without a change in NMDAR currents.</p><p>This analysis indicates that the effects of forskolin on synapses in our experiments were in large part postsynaptic in nature. The detailed explanation of these conclusions based on the variance analysis is provided in the legend of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>.</p><p>- A change in mEPSC frequency does not necessarily reflect a change in presynaptic plasticity, but can also reflect a postsynaptic change in AMPAR currents as shown in previous studies (e.g.: Watson et al., 2017; Lee et al., 2014; Lu et al., 2009; Rumbaugh et al., 2006). We plotted the distribution of mEPSC amplitudes recorded from GluA1-KO neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>), and this suggests that a substantial proportion of mEPSC events fell below the 5 pA detection limit. In the presence of forskolin the proportion that reached above detection limit appeared to become larger (i.e. a rightward shift in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). A further explanation of this notion is provided in the fourth paragraph of the Discussion section.</p><p>- We added a non-stationary noise analysis of scaled mESPCs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E and 3F</xref> of the revised manuscript. This analysis demonstrates that forskolin triggered an increase in postsynaptic single-channel conductance at synapses only when neurons express GluA3.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2: […] 1) Assuming AMPARs in hippocampus are predominately in forms of GluA1/2 and GluA2/3, the authors compared cAMP/FSK-induced currents in WT (which contains both GluA1/2 and GluA2/3), GluA1 KO (which contains GluA2/3 only) and GluA3 KO (which contains GluA1/2 only). Since the GluA3 KO cells did not respond to cAMP/FSK like the WT and GluA1 KO did, the authors concluded that cAMP/FSK selectively potentiate currents from GluA&quot;2/3&quot; type of AMPARs. The Effect of cAMP could actually be on GluA2 when combined with GluA3. The title of this manuscript &quot;Synaptic Plasticity through activation of AMPA-receptor subunit GluA3&quot; is therefore somewhat misleading, as they did not show a direct effect of cAMP/FSK on GluA3 subunit nor provide its role in synaptic plasticity. Further evidence is required to make GluA3-specific claims and its effects on synaptic plasticity.</italic></p><p>To address this issue, we expressed GFP-GluA2Q in GluA3-deficient neurons. GluA2Q forms predominantly GluA2/2 homomers and constitutively traffics into synapses, similar to GluA2/3s (Shi et al., 2001; Makino and Malinow, 2011). Notably, GluA2Q-expressing neurons reacted similarly to forskolin compared with GluA3-expressing ones: both showed an increased mEPSC frequency upon forskolin application to a similar extent (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>).</p><p>These data suggest that the cAMP-driven increase in AMPAR-channel conductance is not an exclusive feature of GluA3, but may also be held by GluA2. This is perhaps not surprising, considering that GluA2 and GluA3 are quite homologous in amino acid composition and structure. GluA1/2 heteromers do not show an increase in channel conductance upon a rise in cAMP, implying that GluA1 may suppress the ability of GluA2 to increase currents when cAMP levels rise. However, this needs further investigation. Because we feel this further investigation falls beyond the scope of this manuscript, we decided to not include this experiment in the current manuscript. However, if the reviewers prefer, we are happy to include this figure in the revised manuscript.</p><p>Based on this experiment, we have adapted our wording throughout the manuscript. We have changed the title into: “Synaptic Plasticity through Activation of GluA3-containing AMPA-receptors”. In addition, through the revised manuscript we use the terminology of either ‘GluA3-dependent plasticity’ or ‘GluA2/3-plasticity’, instead of ‘GluA3-plasticity’.</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><p>mEPSC frequency and amplitude of GluA3-deficient neurons, infected with GFP-GluA3 (blue) or GFP-GluA2Q (yellow) in the absence (even) or presence (blocked bar) of forskolin.</p></caption><p>Both GFP-GluA3 (ctrl: n=7, FSK: n=11) and GFP-GluA2Q (ctrl: n=15, FSK: n=15) show a significant increase in mEPSC frequency upon forskolin (ANOVA: GluA3, p=0.039, GluA2Q, p&lt;0.0001).</p><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-25462-resp-fig1-v2"/></fig><p><italic>2) The trafficking experiments done by live imaging of SEP-GluA3 delivered by sindbis virus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), as well as transfected SEP-GluA1 or SEP-GluA3 in CA1 neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) are not convincing as these subunits when overexpressed alone tend to form homomers (GluA1/1 or GluA3/3) and may not reflect trafficking events of endogenous AMPARs (Sin et al., 2001). GluA3/3 in particular were reported to be absent in synapses even though it can be observed in spines. Alternative methodology examining endogenous AMPAR subunits such as isolation of PSD fraction of AMPARs or immunostaining of synaptic AMPARs would be a better approach.</italic></p><p>We agree that it would be preferable if we could complement our data with alternative methodology like immunohistochemistry. In collaboration with the lab of Prof. Guus Smit, we have tested a set of commercially available GluA3 antibodies in immunohistochemistry and immunoprecipitation experiments. Unfortunately, all of these antibodies showed substantial staining in GluA3-KO samples and showed cross-reactivity in immunoprecipitation experiments.</p><p>To assess whether the overexpression of GluA3 leads to the formation of GluA3/3 homomers, we expressed GFP-GluA3 in GluA3-KO neurons through sindbis infection and measured the rectification index of AMPAR currents in the presence of FSK. The AMPAR currents were in fact significantly <italic>less</italic> rectifying compared with uninfected GluA3-deficent neurons in the same slices.

In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>, the major effect of FSK in WT cells appears to decrease NMDAR current, but leave AMPAR current unchanged. If so, what is the explanation? Is loss of the FSK effect on A/N ratio in GluA3 KO NMDAR-related?</italic></p><p>We apologize for the poor explanation of the variance analysis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>. This experiment in fact demonstrates that FSK did not change NMDAR currents.</p><p>In this experiment we stimulated WT neurons to achieve AMPAR responses of approximately 50 pA. At this stimulation strength, NMDAR currents were subsequently measured. These were significantly smaller in the FSK condition, resulting in an increased AMPA/NMDA ratio. This can be the result of 1) increased AMPAR currents or 2) decreased NMDAR currents. To assess whether the increased AMPA/NMDA ratio is a consequence of increased AMPAR currents or decreased NMDAR currents, we performed a variance analysis to determine the quantal content (QC) of glutamate release. The QC can be calculated based on the coefficient of variation (CV) and depends on both presynaptic release probability (Pr) and on the number of active synapses (N) that are stimulated, but not on postsynaptic quantal size (q), as shown in the following equation:</p><p><italic>1/CV<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref></sup> = N x Pr/(1-Pr)</italic></p><p>In the presence of FSK, a significantly lower QC is sufficient to achieve 50 pA AMPAR responses. However, the NMDAR responses are lower proportional to a lower QC in the presence of FSK (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Interpretation of these results:</p><p>A lower QC can mean either a lower Pr, or a lower N. Irrespectively, these data indicate that forskolin increased postsynaptic AMPAR strength, since AMPAR amplitude of 50 pA were achieved despite a lower P<sub>r</sub> or N.</p><p>It is unlikely that FSK substantially <italic>lowered</italic> presynaptic release probability, since we show that forskolin led to synaptic potentiation expressed by increased mEPSC frequency and amplitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>).</p><p>Thus, the change in QC is most likely reflects a change in ‘N’. Specifically, fewer synapses (approximately two-fold lower N) were stimulated to reach 50 pA AMPAR responses. When stimulating these ~2-fold fewer synapses, ~2-fold lower NMDAR currents were measured.</p><p>Based on this analysis we propose that FSK led to an on average ~2-fold increase in postsynaptic AMPAR currents, without a significant change in NMDAR currents and without an increase in presynaptic release probability.</p><p><italic>4) The rescue experiment, in which GFP-GluA3 is reintroduced into GluA3 KO to evaluate GluA3-specific manipulation in synaptic transmission, is not convincing. While the FSK-induced frequency increase in WT cells is ~4 fold (1 to 4 Hz), the magnitude in GluA3 KO is ~2 fold (1 to 2Hz, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) similar to the magnitude obtained from the rescue condition (~ 2 fold, 0.75 to 1.5 Hz, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, GFP-GluA3 infected). The author should plot <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C and E</xref> using the same scale for the ease of comparison of the frequency graphs. Similarly, the absence of FSK-induced potentiation in amplitude in GluA3 KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, GluA3 KO) was not rescued in GFP-GluA3 infected GluA3 KO neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, GFP-GluA3 infected).</italic></p><p>We generally observe variations in average basal transmission of CA1 neurons between slices from different animals. In order to make comparisons across different experiments, we therefore normalize the experimental effects to their matched control conditions.</p><p>In the revised manuscript we only use data in which the experimental condition (e.g. cAMP application, forskolin, isoproterenol) has been performed in the same sets of slices as the control condition recorded on the same day, and in each experiment we use slices from multiple animals. In the original <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, the WT and GluA3-KO inadvertently contained mEPSC recordings in which the ctrl and forskolin condition were obtained from different animals. We have corrected this in the revised manuscript. Due to the variation in basal transmission we assess the ability of cAMP to increase in synaptic transmission in different genotypes by comparing the fold change of the forskolin condition compared to control condition.</p><p>In the rescue experiment, the effect of GFP-GluA3 expression was tested as soon as 24 hrs after viral infection, and at this time point the forskolin-driven fold increase in mEPSC frequency was already partially rescued. The rescue experiment is particularly well-controlled since all conditions (GluA3-KO with and without GFP-GluA3 and with and without forskolin) were recorded on the same day on the same preparations of slices.</p><p><italic>5) FSK is well known to potentiate GluA1-containing AMPARs and FSK induced mEPSC frequency can be observed in WT, GluA3 KO and GluA1 KO neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C and D</xref>), the pharmacology and antibody effects on mEPSC frequency done in WT cells (all experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) are difficult to interpret. Further experiments using KO neurons are required to make a clear claim.</italic></p><p>We have expanded the experiments with antiRas-IgG infusion in WT neurons and have repeated these experiments in GluA1-KO neurons, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> of the revised manuscript. These new experiments now show that the forskolin-driven potentiation of GluA2/3 currents depends on the activation of both Ras and PKA. The blockade effect of Ras and PKA was indeed most pronounced when GluA2/3 currents are isolated in GluA1-KO slices.</p><p><italic>6) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, the basal (FSK-/PKI+) mEPSC frequency in RAS-IgG neurons seems to be higher than the Ctrl-IgG. However, the basal (FSK-/PKI-) mEPSC frequency seems comparable between Ctrl-IgG and RAS-IgG neurons. If RAS-IgG neurons with PKI treatment do show a higher frequency than the Ctrl-IgG neurons, this would be an occlusion effect of PKI but not a blocking effect of RAS-IgG.</italic> </p><p>We have analyzed the effects of infusion of antiRas-IgG and ctrl-IgG and of PKI on basal transmission in both WT and GluA1-KO CA1 neurons, and this analysis shows that they do not significantly affect synaptic currents, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref> of the revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3: […] 1) Variability of mEPSC frequencies across experiments is very high. This precludes comparing results from the different experiments and drawing conclusions about the contribution of GluA1 or GluA3 from those comparisons. For example, mEPSC frequency in wildtype neurons without treatment differ by 0.7 Hz (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>: 0.7; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>: 1.4 Hz). In addition, the FSK-mediated increase is very different in wildtype neurons (+3.2 Hz in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> and 1.2 Hz in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). In fact, the FSK-mediated increase shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref> is similar to the increase in GluA3 knockout mice shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> (+ 1 Hz). Results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref> strongly suggest that GluA3 channels play a role for the increase in synaptic strength in wildtype neurons. However, the contribution is most likely small (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> +0.6 Hz, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref> +0.3 Hz). Again, the high variability of mEPSC frequency in the different experiments makes a direct comparison very difficult. Thus, my major concern is that experiments shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref> do not allow drawing conclusions about the relevance of cAMP-mediated increase in GluA3 function for synaptic plasticity in CA1 neurons. That is for example in contrast to the study of Gutierrez-Castellanos et al. (Neuron 2017) that convincingly showed that GluA3 channels and the novel GluA3 plasticity play a role for synaptic function of Purkinje cells (mEPSC frequency, amplitude, LTP) and mouse behaviour (VOR).</italic></p><p>We observed that the variability between experiments is a consequence of differences in basal synaptic transmission between animals. In the revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, we only compare control and forskolin condition between neurons of slices of the same age and obtained from the same animal. To allow us to compare between experiments, we calculate the ‘fold change’ (forskolin relative to control). These experiments demonstrate that the forskolin-mediated synaptic potentiation is in large part dependent on the presence of AMPAR subunit GluA3.</p><p>In the revised manuscript we added a new set of experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) showing that β-adrenergic signaling in the hippocampus induces GluA3-dependent synaptic potentiation in CA1 neurons, thereby providing a more physiological form of this type of plasticity.</p><p>In all experiments throughout the revised manuscript we consistently show that GluA3 significantly contributes to the cAMP-mediated AMPAR potentiation.

In addition, we added a new experiment in which we show that selectively knocking-out GluA3 in CA1 neurons in a conditional GluA3-KO model prevents synaptic potentiation upon NE-release in the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>), indicating that the absence of a cAMP-mediated synaptic potentiation is not a consequence of aberrant neuronal developmental.</p><p><italic>2) What was the rational to use acute brain slices from 3-5 weeks old mice in some experiments and organotypic slices of newborn mice in others? The mechanisms of FSK potentiation of synaptic currents might very well differ in the two preparations.</italic></p><p>The rational for using acute brain slices in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> is that these experiments require whole cell recordings to be stable for up to 30 minutes, which in our hands are somewhat more efficient when performed in acute slices compared with organotypic slices.</p><p>We note that our findings in acute brain slices closely match those in organotypic slices.

Except for the small increase in mEPSC amplitude, Ras-IgG have no influence on mEPSCs. In addition, experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref> are again very difficult to interpret since variability is high. Thus, is the lack of an effect of FSK explained because RAS-IgG increases mEPSC frequency in the -FSK control condition? mEPSC frequency in the presence of FSK is very similar irrespective of presence or absence of PKI or RAS-IgG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6 B and C</xref>). In addition, what was the rational to compare Fold-changes in frequency in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6 B-C</xref> instead of mEPCS frequency as in all other experiments? Finally, the number of neurons analyzed should be increased. In fact, I am surprised that the small difference in Fold-change in 6C reaches significance with an N of 5 and I am pretty sure that there would be no significant difference in the FSK-mediated increase in mEPSC frequency between IgG and RAS-IgG.</italic></p><p>We have increased the N in our recordings from WT CA1 neurons, and we have repeated this experiment in GluA1-KO neurons to isolate the effect of Ras and PKA blockade on GluA2/3 currents.

The authors have performed several new experiments that clarify and support their previous conclusions. However, one of my previous concerns was the use of very high concentrations of cAMP or the use of FSK. To address this they tested whether activation of β-adrenergic receptors – a more physiologically relevant experiment – can also lead to GluA3 mediated plasticity. They indeed demonstrate that application of ISO evokes GluA3 potentiation, however only when PDEs are blocked. This suggests that the proposed GluA3 plasticity might take place under non-physiological conditions. They also show that i.p. injection of EPI in mice could lead to GluA3 AMPA receptor potentiation. This experiment is very difficult to interpret, as global activation of b-adrenergic receptors will initiate multiple downstream signaling pathways. Due to these reasons my enthusiasm for this work is still dampened.</italic></p><p>We agree with the reviewer that GluA2/3-plasticity requires a robust increase in cAMP. Our finding that isoproterenol (ISO) by itself failed to induce GluA2/3-plasticity is actually not that surprising, considering that ISO is known generate a very weak rise in intracellular cAMP [Chay et al., 2016; Bruss et al., 2008]. This is because β-AR activation, besides adenylyl cyclase, also triggers the activation of PDEs, leading to a negative feedback loop, which significantly inhibits cAMP downstream signaling [Houslay and Baillie, 2005; Bruss et al., 2008]. This explains why we could only observe GluA2/3plasticity upon exposure of CA1 neurons to ISO when PDEs were inhibited.</p><p>The idea is that a robust increase in cAMP is only achieved when β-AR activation coincides with a rise in Ca<sup>2+</sup> (e.g. upon NMDAR activation), which catalyzes cAMP production [Chetkovich and Sweatt, 1993; Wayman et al., 1994; Chay et al., 2016]. A short description of these considerations, including references, are added to the Results subsection “β-adrenergic signaling triggers the activation of GluA2/3-plasticity”.</p><p>We regret that this reviewer cannot bolster more enthusiasm for our experiments in which we show that β-AR activation in vivo upon Epi-injection is sufficient to trigger GluA2/3-plasticity.

A calculation of fold-change in frequency is not really helpful for an estimation of the contribution of GluA3. Absolute changes in frequency have to be compared for such an estimation. The very small increase in mEPSC frequency in GluA1 KO mice (approx. 0.1 Hz in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">figure 6</xref>) compared to the much bigger increase in wt mice (approx. 0.5 Hz also in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) suggests that the contribution of GluA2/3 heteromers is rather small.
