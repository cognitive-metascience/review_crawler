Herein, we present the giant Bodo saltans virus (BsV), the first characterized representative of the most abundant group of giant viruses in ocean metagenomes, and the first isolate of a klosneuvirus, a subgroup of the <italic>Mimiviridae</italic> proposed from metagenomic data. BsV infects an ecologically important microzooplankton, the kinetoplastid <italic>Bodo saltans</italic>. Its 1.39 Mb genome encodes 1227 predicted ORFs, including a complex replication machinery. Yet, much of its translational apparatus has been lost, including all tRNAs. Essential genes are invaded by homing endonuclease-encoding self-splicing introns that may defend against competing viruses. Putative anti-host factors show extensive gene duplication via a genomic accordion indicating an ongoing evolutionary arms race and highlighting the rapid evolution and genomic plasticity that has led to genome gigantism and the enigma that is giant viruses.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33014.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>In oceans, rivers and lakes, there are about a million viruses in every milliliter of water. Most of these viruses are tiny, often 10 or 100 times smaller than bacteria. However, a few reach a similar size and complexity to bacteria, and so stand out as relative giants.</p><p>Relative to other viruses, Giant Viruses have much more DNA in their genome, which in turn provides the genetic template to produce the proteins that allow viruses to reproduce largely independently of its host. Typically, more than half of the genes encoded by Giant Viruses have no evident similarity to genes from other viruses or cellular life. Sequencing DNA from ocean water suggests that Giant Viruses are abundant and ecologically important; yet, few have been isolated from the microbes that they infect. Without being able to study Giant Viruses in the laboratory, little can be known about their biology, the way they infect their hosts, and their broader influence on aquatic life.</p><p>Deeg et al. have now isolated and characterized the giant Bodo saltans virus (BsV), a Giant Virus that infects an ecologically important microbe commonly found in aquatic environments. Sequencing the genome of BsV revealed many previously unknown genes, as well as several unusual features. For example, the genome contains movable genetic elements that might help to fend off other giant viruses by cutting their genomes. In addition, the set of genes used by BsV to translate mRNA templates into proteins differs from those found in other giant viruses, implying that they are not derived from a more complex common ancestor.</p><p>The size of the genome appears to have grown rapidly by the duplication of genes at the end of the genome – a feature known as a genomic accordion. The identity of the duplicated genes suggests that there is an evolutionary arms race with its host that forces genome expansion. Further studies of the BsV genome could help researchers to understand the origin of gigantism in the genomes of giant viruses.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Bodo saltans</kwd><kwd>NCLDV</kwd><kwd>Giant Viruses</kwd><kwd>Bodo saltans virus</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038</institution-id><institution>Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>05896</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Suttle</surname><given-names>Curtis A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000196</institution-id><institution>Canada Foundation for Innovation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>25412</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Suttle</surname><given-names>Curtis A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100007711</institution-id><institution>British Columbia Knowledge Development Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Suttle</surname><given-names>Curtis A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007631</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institute for Advanced Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Suttle</surname><given-names>Curtis A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001655</institution-id><institution>German Academic Exchange Service</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Deeg</surname><given-names>Christoph M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Tula Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chow</surname><given-names>Cheryl-Emiliane T</given-names></name><name><surname>Suttle</surname><given-names>Curtis A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Bodo saltans virus defines the most abundant giant viruses in the ocean and highlights the genomic plasticity, rooted in evolutionary arms races, that gave rise to giant viruses.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Viruses are the most abundant biological entities on the planet and there are typically millions of virus particles in each milliliter of marine or fresh waters that are estimated to kill about 20% of the living biomass each day in surface marine waters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Suttle, 2007</xref>). This has major consequences for global nutrient and carbon cycles, as well as for controlling the composition of the planktonic communities that are the base of aquatic foodwebs. Although the vast majority of aquatic viruses are less than 100 nm in diameter and primarily infect prokaryotes, it is increasingly clear that a subset of the viruses in aquatic ecosystems are comparative Leviathans that have been colloquially classified as giant viruses.</p><p>The first isolated giant virus in the family that later became known as the <italic>Mimiviridae</italic>, infects a marine heterotrophic flagellate that was initially identified as <italic>Bodo</italic> sp.

As infection progressed, the Golgi apparatus disappeared and the nucleus degraded, as evidenced by the loss of the nucleolus and heterochromatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,C</xref>); yet, the kinetoplast remained intact, as indicated by the persistence of the characteristic kDNA structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A,C</xref>). Virus factories were first observed at 6 hr post-infection (p.i.) as electron-dense diffuse areas in the cytoplasm. By 12 h p.i., the virus factory had expanded significantly and reached a maximum size of about one-third of the host cell, taking up most of the cytoplasm. The first capsid structures appeared at this time. At 18 h p.i., the first mature virus particles were observed, coinciding with the first free virus particles observed by flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). By 24 h p.i., most infected cells were at the late stage of infection with mature virus factories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,D</xref>). During virus replication, membrane vesicles were recruited through the virus factory where capsid proteins accumulated and disrupted the vesicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mutsafi et al., 2013</xref>).

Once the capsid was completed, the viral genome was packaged into the capsid at the vortex opposite to the putative stargate structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,D</xref>).

(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jackson et al., 2016</xref>); this suggests the absence of large scale horizontal gene transfer with the host in recent evolutionary history. The genome encodes 1227 predicted open-reading frames (ORFs) with a coding density of 85%, with the ORFs distributed roughly equally between the two strands consistent with the constant GC-skew (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Unlike ApMV, BsV does not display a central peak in GC skew and therefore does not have an organized bacterial like origin of replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Raoult et al., 2004</xref>). The genomic periphery has a slightly skewed GC ratio due to the tandem orientation of repeated ORFs. Codon preference is highly biased toward A/T-rich codons and the amino acids Lysine, Asparagine, Isoleucine, and Leucine (10, 9.8, 9.6, 8%), which are preferentially encoded by A/T only triplets. The translation of the predicted ORFs resulted in proteins ranging from 43 to 4840 aa in length with an average length of 320 aa. Promotor analysis revealed a highly conserved early promotor motif ‘AAAAATTGA’ that is identical to that found in mimiviruses and CroV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fischer et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Priet et al., 2015</xref>). A poorly conserved late promotor motif ‘TGCG’ surrounded by AT-rich regions was also observed. ORFs are followed by palindromic sequences, suggesting a hairpin-based transcription termination mechanism similar to ApMV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Byrne et al., 2009</xref>). Several non-coding stretches rich in repetitive sequences were observed, but no function could be attributed to them. Based on a BLASTp analysis, 40% of ORFs had no significant similarity to any other sequences and remained ORFans (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Most proteins (27%) matched sequences from eukaryotes; two % of these matched best to sequences from isolates of <italic>B. saltans</italic>. The next largest fraction (22%) were most similar to viruses in the nucleocytoplasmic large DNA viruses (NCLDV) group, while the remaining ORFs were most similar to bacterial (9%) or archaeal (1%) sequences. In gene cluster analysis, only 45% of protein-coding gene clusters are shared with related viruses such as CroV and klosneuviruses, highlighting the low number of conserved core genes amongst these viruses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Coding sequences for proteins associated with all classes of DNA repair mechanisms were identified including DNA mismatch repair (MutS and Uvr helicase/DDEDDh 3'−5' exonucleases), nucleotide excision repair (family-2 AP endonucleases), damaged-base excision (uracil-DNA glycosylase and formamidopyrimidine-DNA glycosylase) and photoreactivation (deoxyribodipyrimidine photolyase). The repair pathways are completed by DNA polymerase family X and NAD-dependent DNA ligase. Sequences were also found that code for proteins involved in DNA replication, including several primases, helicases, and an intein-containing family-B DNA polymerase, as well as replication factors A and C, a chromosome segregation ATPase, and topoisomerases 1 (two subunits) and 2. Sequences associated with proteins mediating recombination were also identified including endonucleases and resolvases, as well as the aforementioned DNA repair machinery.</p><p>There were 47 sequences identified that matched enzymes involved in protein and signal modification, with the majority being serine/threonine kinases/phosphatases. These are potentially involved in host cell takeover.</p><p>The genome of BsV is rich in coding sequences involved in transcription. An early transcription factor putatively recognizing the highly conserved AAAAATTGA motif and a late transcription factor putatively targeting TGCG were identified, whereas the target sequence of a third transcription factor is unknown. Further, a TATA-binding protein, a transcription initiation factor (TFIIIB) and a transcription elongation factor (TFIIS) were identified that should aid transcription. As well, RNA polymerase subunits a,b,c,e,f,g and I were identified and are assisted by DNA topoisomerases Type 2 and 1B. BsV encodes amRNA specific RNase III, a poly A polymerase, several 5’ capping enzymes and methyl transferases. Transcription is presumably terminated in a manner similar to that described in ApMV, since hairpin structures were detected in the 3’ UTR of most transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Priet et al., 2015</xref>). They are probably recognized and processed by the viral encoded RNase III in a manner similar to ApMV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Byrne et al., 2009</xref>). After hairpin loop cleavage, the poly-A tail is added by the virally encoded poly-A polymerase. The 5’ capping is accomplished by the virus-encoded mRNA capping enzyme, as well as several cap-specific methyltransferases. The extensive cap modification suggests that BsV is independent of the trans-splicing of splice-leader mRNA containing cap structures found in kinetoplastids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Stuart et al., 1997</xref>).</p><p>BsV also encodes several enzymes associated with nucleic-acid transport and metabolism, including several AT-specific nucleic-acid synthesis pathway components. For instance, adenylosuccinate, thymidylate and pseudouridine synthetases and kinases, as well as ribonucleoside-diphosphate reductase were evident. Other ORFs were associated with nucleotide salvaging pathways, including nucleoside kinases, phosphoribosyl transferases, and cytidine and deoxycytidylate deaminase. A mitochondrial carrier protein was identified that, similar to ApMV, likely provides dATP and dTTP directly from the kinetoplast to the virus factory, as evident from electron microscopic observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Monné et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Several genes were identified that are involved in membrane trafficking. A system based on soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor (NSF) attachment proteins (SNAPs) and the SNAP receptors (SNAREs) appears to have been acquired from the host by horizontal gene transfer in the recent evolutionary past. In combination with several NSF homologues, including the vesicular-fusion ATPases that also seems to have been acquired from the host. Other proteins putatively involved in membrane trafficking are rab-domain containing proteins, ras-like GTPases, and kinesin motor proteins.</p><p>The BsV genome encodes four major capsid proteins. One of these proteins contains several large insertions between conserved domains shared among all four capsid proteins, and with 4194 aa boasts a size almost seven times that of its paralogs. This enlarged version of the major capsid protein might be responsible for creating the halo around the virus particles observed by TEM, by producing shortened fibers similar to those observed in ApMV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Xiao et al., 2009</xref>). Further, the genome contains two core proteins, several chaperones and glycosylation enzymes suggesting that proteins are highly modified before being incorporated into the virus particle.</p><p>There were numerous ORFs that were similar to genes encoding metabolic proteins, like enzymes putatively involved in carbohydrate metabolism. However, no one continuous metabolic pathway could be assembled and therefore these enzymes likely complement host pathways. BsV also encodes coenzyme synthetases such as CoA and NADH and to meet the demand for amino acids that are rare in the host, BsV encodes the key steps in the synthesis pathways of glutamine, histidine, isoleucine, and asparagine.</p><p>Another group of genes putatively mediate competitive interactions, either directly with the host, or with other viruses or intracellular pathogens. These include genes involved in the production of several toxins such as a VIP2-like protein as well as antitoxins containing BRO domains. Further, a partial bleomycin detox pathway was found, as well as multidrug export pumps and partial restriction modification systems.</p><p>While BsV encodes a complex translation machinery, it differs markedly from those described in other members of the <italic>Mimiviridae</italic> and shows the largest turnover of these genes resulting in a net contraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Eukaryotic translation initiation factors include the commonly seen eIF-2a, eIF-2b, eIF-2g, eIF-4A-III and eIF-4E, as well as several pseudogenes related to eIFs. Eukaryotic elongation factor 1 is also present as is eukaryotic peptide chain release factor subunit 1. Notable is the absence of eIF-1; instead, BsV encodes a version of IF-2 that appears to have been acquired from the host and is functionally analogous to eIF-1 in kinetoplastids. The most striking difference to other NCLDVs is the absence of tRNAs. Uniquely among NCLDVs, BsV encodes several tRNA repair genes. These genes include putative RtcB-like RNA-splicing ligase, putative CAA-nucleotidyltransferase, tRNA 2'-phosphotransferase/Ap4A_hydrolase, putative methyltransferase, a TRM13-like protein, pseudouridine synthase and tRNA ligase/uridine kinase. Most of these genes appear to have been recently acquired from the host (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). Other translation modification enzymes found in BsV and other NCLDVs include tRNA(Ile)-lysidine synthase, tRNA pseudouridine synthase B and tRNA 2'-phosphotransferase. Similar to the tRNAs, there are few aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRS) in BsV. Three of the recognizable aaRS are pseudogenes and show signs of recent nonsense mutations or ORF disruptions by genome rearrangements (aspRS, glnRS, and asnRS). The only complete aaRS proteins are isoleucine-tRNA synthetase, found in all members of the <italic>Mimivridae</italic>, and a phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Repeat regions</title><p>Genes in the genomic periphery have undergone massive duplication, with 148 copies of ankyrin repeat proteins, mostly present in directional tandem orientation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). These sequences are quite variable and encode between 4 and 17 ankyrin-repeat domains. There is evidence of very recent sequence duplication resulting in direct or inverted repeat regions that contain complete ankyrin-repeat coding sequences and further expand the repeat clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Interestingly, the 5’ coding region of many ankyrin-repeat containing protein ORFs contain fragments of catalytic domains of essential viral genes such as DNA polymerases or the MutS repair protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Genomic mobilome</title><p>In contrast to described giant virus genomic mobilomes consisting of virophages and transpovirons, the BsV genome is dominated by inteins, autocatalytic proteinases, and self-splicing group 1 introns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Desnues et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fischer and Suttle, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Santini et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">La Scola et al., 2008</xref>). These mobile elements spread by targeting the DNA coding regions of essential genes for virus replication by deploying unrelated homing endonucleases encoded by internal ORFs nested within the elements (red ORFs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Inteins that are closely related to those in <italic>Mimiviridae</italic> and <italic>Phycodnaviridae</italic> are found in the BsV DNA polymerase family B gene, while other unrelated inteins are found in the DNA-dependent RNA polymerase subunits A and B genes (polr2a and polr2b: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). The inteins in the RNA polymerase genes seem to be devoid of an active homing endonuclease, and are therefore fixed, suggesting an evolutionary ancient invasion. The intein in DNA pol B may be an exception, as an HNH endonuclease is located in close genomic proximity and could promote homing in a trans-acting fashion.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33014.014</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Invasion of RNA polymerase genes by selfish genetic elements.</title><p>Organization of self-splicing group 1 introns (grey) and inteins (black) within genes polr2a and polr2b (green).

Subsequent to the initial integration of introns containing endonucleases (e.g. polr2a-i1b in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), these homing endonucleases seeded ‘offspring’ introns within the same gene (e.g. polr2a-i1a and –i1c in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). These secondary introns show conserved secondary RNA structure, but lack the homing endonuclease of their parental intron. Therefore, the secondary introns probably rely on the trans-homing of their parental introns’ endonucleases. The highly conserved sequence for some of the offspring introns (94.4% sequence identity for polr2a-i1a and -i1c, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>) suggests that these have spread relatively recently, while other introns that only show conservation in their secondary structure probably represent older invasions.

BsV groups with the klosneuviruses and is separate from CroV and the <italic>Acanthamoeba</italic> infecting mimiviruses, and falls within the proposed ‘Megavirinae’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). A separate subfamily was proposed for the metagenomic klosneuviruses, the ‘Klosneuvirinae’, which would make BsV as the first isolate and the type species of this subfamily (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schulz et al., 2017</xref>). The high representation of the klosneu- and BsV-like viruses in metagenomic reads from the TARA oceans survey is consistent with BsV being representative of the most abundant group of <italic>Mimiviridae</italic>, and possibly all icosahedral giant viruses in the oceans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hingamp et al., 2013</xref>). The initial detection of the klosneuviruses in low complexity fresh water metagenomes further supports the global prevalence of this group.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>BsV has acquired a host mechanism to facilitate membrane fusion, presumably employed during infection and virion morphogenesis</title><p>The SNAP/SNARE membrane fusion system found in BsV appears to have been recently acquired from the bodonid host via horizontal gene transfer. This system could mediate membrane fusion in a pH-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Itakura et al., 2012</xref>). Accordingly, we propose a phagocytosis-based infection strategy for BsV: As described for ApMV, BsV is ingested through the cytostome and is phagocytosed in the cytopharynx before being transported in a phagosome toward the posterior of the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mutsafi et al., 2010</xref>); here the viral SNAP/SNARE interacts with the host counterparts to initiate the fusion of the inner virus membrane with the phagolysosomal membrane upon phagolysosome acidification, releasing the viral genome into the cytoplasm. This scenario is supported by the localization of the virus factory at the posterior of the cell and virus particle structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B–C</xref>). According to this hypothesis, SNAP/SNARE proteins must be present in membranes of the mature virus particles and only get exposed after the stargate opens. The SNAP/SNARE system might also be involved in recruiting membrane vesicles from host organelles to the virus factory during maturation of the virus particle as has been described for pox viruses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Laidlaw et al., 1998</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>The BsV possesses an arsenal of mechanisms that could be involved in interference competition</title><p>As a representative of environmentally highly abundant viruses, BsV might regularly experience competition for host resources. The putative toxin-antitoxin systems observed in BsV might be involved in competing with other parasites of viral or prokaryotic nature for these resources, by inhibiting their metabolism or damaging their genome as proposed for ApMV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boyer et al., 2011</xref>). Most remarkable, however, are the site-specific homing endonucleases encoded by the self-splicing group 1 introns and inteins that have invaded several genes essential for BsV replication. These invasions also seem to be part of the competitive arsenal of BsV, fending off related virus strains competing for abundant and common hosts such as bodonids. During superinfection of two related viruses, having selfish elements encoding homing endonucleases targeting essential genes might be a competitive advantage. As the two competing virus factories are established in the cytoplasm, the endonucleases encoded within the intron or intein cleave the unoccupied locus in the genome of the intron/intein-free virus. The intron or intein containing virus’ genome stays intact, since the target sequences of the endonucleases within its genes are masked by the insertion of the intron or intein. Thus, the intron/intein-containing virus is reducing the ability of the competing virus to replicate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). A similar mechanism has been described for competing phages in which an intron-encoded or derived homing endonuclease mediates marker exclusion during superinfection, causing selective sweeps of genes in the vicinity of the endonuclease through the phage population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Belle et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Goodrich-Blair and Shub, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kutter et al., 1995</xref>). More credence to this hypothesis is given by the RNA polymerase sequences encoded by the proposed catovirus and klosneuvirus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schulz et al., 2017</xref>). These genes (polr2a and polr2b) are fragmented in a manner similar to that observed in BsV, and also appear to encode homing endonucleases between gene fragments, suggesting the presence of self-splicing introns is common in the relatives of BsV such as the klosneuviruses. Since the hosts for klosneuviruses are unknown, it is possible that they compete with BsV for the same hosts, or at least experience similar competition. The presence of non-fixed inteins in other giant viruses hints to past invasions and selection for inteins in a manner resembling the hypothesis proposed here for introns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Culley et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gallot-Lavallée et al., 2017</xref>). The retention of fixed inteins in BsV and other giant viruses suggests that there are still viruses in the environment that encode the relevant endonucleases that apply selective pressure to retain the inteins. A similar situation might explain the presence of an intein in the DNA polymerase of <italic>Pandoravirus salinus</italic>, but not in <italic>P. dulcis</italic>. Thus, pandoraviruses may be an excellent model to experimentally explore the proposed mechanism of intron homing endonuclease mediated competition.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33014.021</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Intron/intein encoded endonuclease-mediated interference completion between related viruses.</title><p>(1) Two related viruses infect the same host cell.

This might be an adaptation to the unusual RNA modification found in kinetoplastids that also encompasses tRNA editing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alfonzo and Lukeš, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Stuart et al., 1997</xref>). Similarly, Trypanosoma mitochondrial tRNAs are exclusively nuclear encoded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hancock and Hajduk, 1990</xref>). BsV likely cannot replicate this unusual editing, and thus relies on using host tRNAs. Hence, BsV encodes tRNA repair genes to compensate for the lack of tRNA synthesis and to maintain the available tRNA pool in the host cell. Most of these genes appear to have been recently acquired from the host (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). Like the tRNAs, most virus-encoded aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases might not recognize the highly modified tRNAs present in the host and are therefore degrading in the absence of positive selective pressure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplements 2</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">3</xref>). The presence of three recognizable pseudogenes of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases is especially remarkable in this context and argues for an evolutionary recent degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). This turnover in translational machinery components in BsV and the klosneuviruses, combined with the apparent diverse origin of these genes, suggests that the translation machinery found in giant viruses is the result of rapid adaptation by gene acquisition via horizontal gene transfer, as has been recently proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schulz et al. (2017)</xref>. BsV demonstrates that such genes can be readily purged from the virus genome if they are not required in a new host. Thus, BsV provides further evidence that the translation machinery encoded by NCLDVs is a homoplasic trait and need not be ancient in origin.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>An inflated genomic accordion due to evolutionary arms races is responsible for genome gigantism in BsV and sheds light on giant virus evolution</title><p>The 148 copies of ankyrin-repeat domain proteins in the genomic periphery of BsV are telltale signs of an expanded genomic accordion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Elde et al., 2012</xref>). The observation of almost identical sequences in the very periphery of the genome is consistent with the genomic accordion hypothesis, in which the most recent duplications are closest to the genome ends (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). The genomic recombinations causing the gene duplications can also lead to the disruption of coding sequences that might explain the comparatively low coding density of BsV. Proteins with ankyrin-repeat domains are multifunctional attachment proteins that in pox viruses determine host range by inhibiting host innate immune system functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Camus-Bouclainville et al., 2004</xref>). Further ankyrin-repeat domain proteins are used by bacterial intracellular pathogens like Legionella to manipulate eukaryotic host cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pan et al., 2008</xref>). The presence of fragments of the catalytic domains of essential viral genes in many ankyrin-repeat containing genes is of further importance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). This suggests a decoy defense mechanism, where these fusion proteins mimic the targets of host antiviral defense systems disrupting essential viral functions. By acting as decoy targets, they immobilize the proposed host factors upon binding via their ankyrin-repeat domains similar to what occurs in vaccinia virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Elde et al., 2009</xref>). The immobilized host factors might even be degraded in a ubiquitin-dependent manner reminiscent of the situation in pox viruses as suggested by the presence of several ubiquitin conjugating enzymes encoded in the BsV genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sonnberg et al., 2008</xref>). An ankyrin-repeat-based defense system might explain the observation of cells surviving or avoiding infection that can persist in the presence of the virus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Alternatively, the protein-protein interaction mode of ankyrin repeat proteins might aid attachment and induction of phagocytosis as the bodonid host cells have changing surface antigens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jackson et al., 2016</xref>). Whatever the true function of the ankyrin-repeat proteins might be, they clearly highlight the importance of the genomic accordion in giant virus genome evolution driven by evolutionary arms races and complement previous observations of a contracting genomic accordion in ApMV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boyer et al., 2011</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Summary</title><p>Bodo saltans virus (BsV) has the one of the largest sequenced genome of the <italic>Mimiviridae</italic> and is representative of the most abundant members of this family in aquatic ecosystems. BsV is also the first described DNA virus that infects kinetoplasts, or any member of the supergroup Excavata, a major evolutionary lineage of eukaryotes, and is the first isolate of a subfamily within the <italic>Mimiviridae</italic> that was based only on metagenomic data. BsV highlights the genomic plasticity of giant viruses via the genomic accordion, which allows for large-scale genome expansions and contractions via non-homologous recombination. The recent duplications in BsV demonstrate genome expansion in action and exemplifies the mechanisms leading to genome gigantism in the <italic>Mimiviridae</italic>. Further, the function of the expanding genes suggests that strong evolutionary pressure is placed on these viruses by a virus-host arms race that has driven genomic expansion. Genomic plasticity is further apparent in the translational machinery, which shows signs of recent gene loss and rapid adaptation to its bodonid host. This emphasizes that the translational machinery of giant viruses is an acquired homoplasic trait not derived from a common ancestor. An invasion of selfish elements in essential genes suggests interference competition among related viruses for shared hosts.

An Optiprep (Sigma) gradient was created by underlaying a 10% Optiprep solution in 50 mM Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 2 mM MgCl2 with a 30% solution followed by a 50% solution and was equilibration over night at 4°C. One ml of viral concentrate from the 40% cushion was added atop the gradient and the concentrate was fractionated by ultracentrifugation in an SW40 rotor for 4 hr at 25,000 rpm and 18°C. The viral fraction was extracted from the gradient with a syringe and washed twice with 50 mM Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> followed by centrifugation in an SW40 rotor for 20 min at 7200 rpm and 18°C and were finally collected by centrifugation in an SW40 rotor for 30 min at 7800 rpm and 18°C. Purity of the concentrate was verified by flow cytometry (SYBR Green (Invitrogen Carlsbad, CA) vs SSC on a FACScalibur (Becton-Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ). High-molecular-weight genomic DNA was extracted using phenol-chloroform-chloroform extraction. Length and purity were confirmed by gel electrophoresis and Bioanalyzer 2100 wit the HS DNA kit (Agilent Technology). PacBio RSII 20 kb sequencing was performed by the sequencing center of the University of Delaware. Reads were assembled using PacBio HGAP3 software with 20 kb seed reads and resulted in a single viral contig of 1,384,624 bp, 286.1x coverage, 99.99% called bases and a consensus concordance of 99.9551% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chin et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Cleaned up Illumina reads were mapped to the PacBio contig to confirm the PacBio assembly as well as extending the contig’s 5’ end by 1245 bp to a total viral genome length of 1,385,869 bp.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Annotation</title><p>Open-reading frames were predicted using GLIMMER (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_011931">SCR_011931</ext-link>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Delcher et al., 2007</xref>) with a custom start codon frequency of ATG, GTG, TTG, ATA, ATT at 0.8,0.05,0.05,0.05,0.05 as well as stop codons TAG, TGA, TAA, minimum length 100 bp, max overlap 25, max threshold 30.</p><p>Promoter motives were analyzed by screening the 100 bp upstream region of CDS using MEME (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_001783">SCR_001783</ext-link>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bailey et al., 2009</xref>). tRNAs were predicted with tRNAscanSE (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_010835">SCR_010835</ext-link>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lowe and Eddy, 1997</xref>). Group 1 introns were predicted by disruptions in coding sequences and secondary RNA structure was predicted using S-fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ding et al., 2004</xref>). Intron splicing was confirmed using RT-PCR and Sanger sequencing with gene-specific primers designed to span the predicted splice sited predicted by S-fold. Functional analysis of CDS was performed after translation with BLASTp against the nr database with an e-value threshold of 10<sup>−5</sup> as well as rps conserved domain search against CDD v3.15.

Available whole genome sequences of NCLDV from NCBI were downloaded. We first performed gene clustering using OrthoMCL (42) with standard parameters (Blast E-value cutoff = 10<sup>−5</sup> and mcl inflation factor = 1.5) on all protein-coding genes of length ≥100 aa. This resulted in the definition of 3001 distinct clusters. Gene clusters are available in source file ‘Source_data_Fig4_S3_all-Mimi_COGs’, ‘Source_data_Fig4C_translation-Mimi_COGs’, ‘Source_data_Fig6A-Fig4C_orthoMCL_groups’, and ‘Source_data_Fig6A_gene-clusters’.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Diethard Tautz as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: James Van Etten (Reviewer #1); Eugene Koonin (Reviewer #2); Grieg Steward (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The reviewers all agree that this manuscript and work are important but feel that the inferences about its exact phylogenetic position are not sufficiently supported to justify some of the statements and that there are many small editorial fixes needed as found below in the detailed reviews.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The uncertainty with the phylogenies seems to be the main problematic issue with this manuscript. This can be resolved by simply making various statements about the abundance and phylogeny more cautious and some additional phylogeny analysis as described in reviews 2 and 3.</p><p>2) Addressing the editorial revisions requested in the detailed reviews below.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>This manuscript describes the isolation and characterization of a giant virus (BsV) that infects the ecologically important microzooplankton, the kinetoplastid Bodo saltans. The manuscript is important for several reasons including: i) BsV has the largest genome of viruses included in the <italic>Mimiviridae</italic> family, ii) BsV is the first virus to be isolated and characterized in one of the 3 subclades of the <italic>Mimiviridae</italic> (the other members in this subclade only exist from metagenomic sequences), iii) this subclade of viruses appear to be the most common viruses in the ocean after bacteriophage, iv) BsV is claimed to be one of the few <italic>Mimiviridae</italic> members that does not infect amoeba (note, even though the authors make this claim, it is not clear if they actually tried to infect an amoeba), and v) the genome has some interesting features, including the absence of tRNA genes, it has several homing endonuclease-encoding self-splicing introns and many apparent gene duplications of ankyrin repeat encoding genes.</p><p>The experiments appear to be carefully conducted by an established research group that works in the area of giant viruses and viruses in the marine environment. I only have a few comments to make about the manuscript.</p><p>1) The authors claim that BsV has a stargate structure, which has been extensively studied in the prototype Mimivirus APMV. In the last paragraph of the subsection “Virus morphology and Replication Kinetics”, they refer to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>. This seems like a very awkward way to refer to a supplemental figure. Figure This awkward notation appears throughout the text). More importantly, the stargate structure is not immediately obvious to me in the two figures cited. Maybe they have better images to illustrate the stargate structure. This is important for another reason in that in the aforementioned paragraph, they say that BsV packages its DNA in the particle at the vertex on the opposite side of the stargate structure. However, it is not obvious to me how they draw that conclusion from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>.</p><p>2) The authors state in the first paragraph of the subsection “Virus morphology and Replication Kinetic”, that the virion has 6 layers that engulf the virion and refer to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>. The authors should use arrows or arrow heads to point these out.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>The isolation and characterization of a novel, highly abundant giant virus of the family <italic>Mimiviridae</italic> from a marine protist is of major interest and value. It is particularly important that the actual virus has been obtained given that the related Klosneuviruses so far have been identified only from metagenomic sequences. This report will be of interest to all virologists, and I believe, also to a broader audience of biologists.</p><p>I do have certain concerns regarding the genome analysis described in the manuscript and the authors' interpretation.</p><p>My first and probably most important problem is with the phylogeny of the NCLDV shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C, D</xref>. I find the tree topologies to be rather suspicious. In the tree of 5 concatenated NCVOGs (6C), BsV forms a long branch, and there is only 65% bootstrap support for the &quot;<italic>Aquavirinae</italic>&quot;. The DNAP tree (6D) does not agree, here BsV falls within the Klosneuvirus group. In this situation, I think there is little confidence in the exact position of BsV within the <italic>Mimiviridae</italic>, and also in the position of CroV at the base of the &quot;<italic>Aquavirinae</italic>&quot; as opposed to outside of the MImi-Klos clade as observed in the Schul et al. paper on Klosneuviruses. I find it desirable to invest some more effort into phylogenetic analysis, in particular, analyze Bayesian trees, perform tree topology tests (e.g. AU) and present trees for individual core NCLDV genes. Unless such additional analyses substantially increase the confidence in the tree topology (and I am not entirely optimistic), I think it is best to be much more circumspect regarding the phylogeny of the <italic>Mimiviridae</italic> in general and the position of BsV, in particular.</p><p>Second, and related to my first concern, the tree topology affects the conclusions regarding gene gain and loss. The authors indicate in the Abstract and other parts of the article that much of the translation machinery has been lost by BsV. Qualitatively, this is likely to be true but how much, critically depends on the tree topology. Furthermore, I find it highly desirable to perform a formal reconstruction of gene gain and loss using COUNT or GLUM software. Without such an analysis, claims of gene gain and loss remain poorly substantiated. Finally, on the subject of gene loss, to me, one of the most interesting findings here is the presence in BsV of pseudogenes of 3 aaRS pseudogenes and one translation factor. This finding does indeed imply that the translation system could be &quot;on its way out&quot;, and in my opinion, should be emphasized stronger.</p><p>Third, and less important, I find it strange that the authors claim that BsV has the largest number of genes among the <italic>Mimiviridae</italic>, 1227. Two of the Klosneuviruses are bigger.</p><p>Fourth, and least important, but still essential, the authors should be more cautious with taxonomy, especially, given the aforementioned uncertainties with the phylogeny. It is fine to propose Aquavirinae but it should not be 'a distinct evolutionary group [what's that?] <italic>Aqauvirinae</italic>' but rather 'a provisional subfamily &quot;Aquavirinae&quot; with the family <italic>Mimiviridae</italic>'.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>This paper describes a new viral isolate within the <italic>Megaviridae</italic> and its genomic content. The work is noteworthy for several reasons: 1) the size of the viral genome, which is the largest yet described for an isolate within this family, 2) the unusual functional features of the genome relative to other members of the family, and 3) the lineage of the host, since it is the first DNA virus known to infect a member of the Excavata. This is a noteworthy discovery with lots of interesting tidbits including the absence of tRNAs and the presence of parasitic genetic elements (inteins and introns) that would seem to confer competitive advantage during co-infection with other viruses. The science looks sound. My main general recommendation is that the authors be more careful with the wording, specifically properly qualifying statements about the abundance and phylogenetic position of this virus and its relatives. Also, I would recommend being more circumspect in the phrasing of the headings in the Discussion (and perhaps title), many of which read as statements of fact but are inferences and hypotheses.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33014.035</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>[…] 1) The authors claim that BsV has a stargate structure, which has been extensively studied in the prototype Mimivirus APMV.
