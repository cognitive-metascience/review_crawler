It remains an open question, however, how the large number of connections needed to form a novel network arise over evolutionary time. Here, we address this question using the network controlled by the fungal transcription regulator Ndt80. This conserved protein has undergone a dramatic switch in function—from an ancestral role regulating sporulation to a derived role regulating biofilm formation. This switch in function corresponded to a large-scale rewiring of the genes regulated by Ndt80. However, we demonstrate that the Ndt80-target gene connections were undergoing extensive rewiring prior to the switch in Ndt80’s regulatory function. We propose that extensive drift in the Ndt80 regulon allowed for the exploration of alternative network structures without a loss of ancestral function, thereby facilitating the formation of a network with a new function.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.23250.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.23250.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd><italic>C. albicans</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>P. pastoris</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>S. stipitis</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>K. lactis</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>C. lusitaniae</italic></kwd><kwd>regulatory network</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 GM037049</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nocedal</surname><given-names>Isabel</given-names></name><name><surname>Mancera</surname><given-names>Eugenio</given-names></name><name><surname>Johnson</surname><given-names>Alexander D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000854</institution-id><institution>Human Frontier Science Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mancera</surname><given-names>Eugenio</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>UC-MEXUS</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mancera</surname><given-names>Eugenio</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Rapid evolutionary rewiring of the meiosis transcription network facilitated a switch in the function of a master regulator from regulating meiosis to regulating biofilm formation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title><bold>I</bold>ntroduction</title><p>The emergence of novel traits has long fascinated evolutionary biologists, with many intriguing examples observed across the tree of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pigliucci, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rieppel, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Shubin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wagner and Lynch, 2010</xref>). Although the rewiring of gene regulatory networks over evolutionary time is recognized as a key source of variation responsible for the modification of complex phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Carroll, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Davidson and Erwin, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Li and Johnson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wray, 2007</xref>), we still lack an understanding of how new, large gene regulatory networks controlling novel phenotypes arise over evolutionary time. Typically, gene regulatory networks are composed of ‘master’ transcription regulators and many downstream ‘target’ genes, whose expression is controlled by these regulators in response to environmental or developmental signals. It has been proposed that new gene regulatory networks arise from a combination of de novo genes as well as conserved genes that have undergone changes in regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wagner and Lynch, 2010</xref>). Yet, it remains unclear how a large number of genes (whether old or new) can be brought together to form a new network.</p><p>To address these questions, we examined the evolutionary history of Ndt80, a sequence-specific DNA-binding protein that is deeply conserved across a large group of fungal species encompassing approximately 300 million years of diversity. In most of these species, Ndt80 controls meiosis and sporulation, the coupled processes that form a portion of the fungal sexual cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chu and Herskowitz, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Xu et al., 1995</xref>). However, in the narrow lineage leading to the human fungal pathogen species <italic>Candida albicans</italic>, Ndt80 acquired a new role as a master regulator of the gene regulatory network that controls the formation of biofilms, multicellular communities of surface-associated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nobile et al., 2012</xref>). This newly evolved trait enables <italic>C. albicans</italic> to persist on mucosal surfaces and on implanted medical devices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bonhomme and d'Enfert, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kojic and Darouiche, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nobile et al., 2012</xref>) and is responsible for many of the disease-causing properties of <italic>C. albicans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nobile and Johnson, 2015</xref>). The entire biofilm gene regulatory network in <italic>C. albicans</italic> is complex—Ndt80 alone controls the expression of hundreds of genes involved in biofilm formation—but it appears to have evolved relatively recently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nobile et al., 2012</xref>). In this paper, we infer that approximately 20 to 100 million years ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Taylor and Berbee, 2006</xref>), Ndt80’s role changed from regulating sporulation and meiosis (its ancestral role) to regulating biofilm formation. We rigorously exclude a model in which the Ndt80 network remained relatively static until a sudden change occurred in the <italic>Candida</italic> clade when Ndt80’s overall function changed from sporulation to biofilm formation. Instead, we found that the Ndt80 regulon was continuously undergoing significant rewiring in all lineages examined, even in those where the overall function of Ndt80 remained unchanged. Indeed, at the resolution of our experiments, the extent of Ndt80 rewiring was approximately the same whether its function had changed or not.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23250.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Ndt80 target genes differ between <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>C. albi</italic>cans.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Diagram of sporulation in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and biofilm formation in <italic>C. albicans</italic>.

This idea is analogous to examples of protein evolution in which mutational space can be sampled by drift without compromising the ancestral function of the protein. Such neutral excursions can then be exploited if they provide, as a by-product, a new function, for example weak catalysis of an alternative reaction by an enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aharoni et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bridgham et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Coyle et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Khersonsky and Tawfik, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wagner, 2005a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">2005b</xref>). Our work provides an empirical, case study of an analogous exploitation of regulatory network plasticity in the evolution of novel transcription regulator function.</p><p>It has been well established that transcription regulator-target gene interactions change over evolutionary timescales. For example, the regulators controlling the ribosomal genes and the <bold>a</bold>-specific genes in fungi have changed over several hundred million years of evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baker et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ihmels et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lavoie et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tanay et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tsong et al., 2006</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sorrells et al., 2015</xref>). Likewise, transcription regulators (such as Mcm1 and Ste12) have been shown to undergo extensive rewiring of their regulatory targets over similar timescales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Borneman et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tuch et al., 2008</xref>). Such rewiring is not restricted to fungi; for example, enhancers in <italic>Drosophila</italic> have been shown to undergo rapid changes in the nature and arrangement of their <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Frankel et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gompel et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ludwig et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Swanson et al., 2011</xref>). This high degree of network plasticity seems to be a general feature of many regulatory networks. Based on the case study of Ndt80, we propose that this plasticity can be captured to produce new, complex regulatory networks.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Ndt80 target genes differ markedly between <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>C. albicans</italic></title><p>As described above, the transcription factor Ndt80 is required for sporulation and meiosis in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and biofilm formation in <italic>C. albicans</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In principle, the difference in phenotype could be due to a difference in the identity of the genes regulated by Ndt80 between these species; alternatively, Ndt80 could regulate the same gene set in both species and the difference in phenotype could be due to something else, for example, Ndt80 target genes acquiring new enzymatic functions or Ndt80 itself being regulated differently in the two species.</p><p>To distinguish between these models, we identified the genes directly regulated by Ndt80 in both <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>C. albicans</italic> using chromatin immunoprecipitation of epitope-tagged Ndt80 followed by high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-Seq). To minimize the effect of species-specific differences in the levels of Ndt80 expression (and to capture as much of the network as possible), the promoters of Ndt80 in both species were replaced with high-expression constitutive promoters (Materials and methods). It has been well established that, even using proper controls, chromatin immunoprecipitation produces false positives in addition to valid instances of binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fan and Struhl, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Teytelman et al., 2013</xref>). To eliminate spurious signals and identify bona fide instances of Ndt80 binding, we employed four different criteria of increasing stringency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). First, we simply identified genes with significant peaks of ChIP enrichment in their intergenic regions; this is our least stringent criteria. Second, we filtered this set to include only those ChIP enrichment peaks that contained an Ndt80 <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory motif in the intergenic region (this motif is discussed in more detail below). Third, of those ChIP peaks that contained an Ndt80 motif, we further refined the set of Ndt80 targets by requiring that the motif also be present in the orthologous intergenic region of two very closely related species, as this greatly increases the likelihood that the Ndt80-binding site was maintained by selection. (For <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, we used <italic>S. mikatae</italic> and <italic>S. kudriavzevii</italic>, for <italic>C. albicans</italic> we used <italic>C. tropicalis</italic> and <italic>C. dubliniensis</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Byrne and Wolfe, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lohse et al., 2013</xref>]). Lastly, we used gene expression data to restrict Ndt80 targets to ChIP peaks with an Ndt80 motif where the gene also exhibited a significant change in mRNA expression when Ndt80 was deleted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chu et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nobile et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Each of the four criteria were used to identify and compare the genes regulated by Ndt80 between <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>C. albicans</italic>. While the number of genes identified as Ndt80 targets differs depending on the criteria used, all four methods produce the same overall conclusion: Ndt80 regulates many genes in each species, with very little overlap between them (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). By all methods, fewer than 13% of the targets of Ndt80 in these two species are shared; with the most stringent criteria this drops to 3.4% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). To ensure that constitutive overexpression of Ndt80 was not responsible for this large difference in Ndt80 targets, we also performed ChIP-Seq on Ndt80 in both species under the control of the endogenous promoter. While many fewer regions are bound than with constitutive Ndt80 expression, we similarly find very little overlap in the Ndt80 targets in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>C. albicans</italic> (less than 12%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

These results highlight the specialized type of biofilm produced by <italic>C. albicans</italic> and the pivotal role played by Ndt80 in its evolution.</p><p>Taken together, these results indicate that Ndt80 regulated sporulation in the shared ancestor of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>C. albicans</italic>, and that it gained a role in biofilm formation along the <italic>C. albicans</italic> lineage, after it branched off from <italic>C. lusitaniae</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). We believe this scenario is more likely than that of the next most parsimonious model, which holds that Ndt80 regulated both sporulation and biofilm formation in the shared ancestor, as this would require at least three independent losses of biofilm regulation. Given that Ndt80 regulates hundreds of genes in each species, a single gain of Ndt80 function seem more plausible than three independent losses.</p><p>Combining this phenotypic data with the Ndt80 target identification previously discussed, we can begin to pinpoint the importance of individual genes in the overall switch in Ndt80 function. Only 10 genes are targets of Ndt80 in all five species tested (<italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, <italic>K. lactis, P. pastoris</italic>, <italic>S. stipitis</italic>, and <italic>C. albicans</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). This suggests that a very limited set of genes may have been repurposed from sporulation to biofilm formation. Notably, five of these genes (<italic>CLN2</italic>, <italic>CLG1</italic>, <italic>GLN1</italic>, <italic>GDH2</italic>, <italic>RPS7a</italic>) are strongly upregulated in biofilm formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fox et al., 2015</xref>). If we examine the 10 shared genes based on their known functions in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, three are involved in cell cycle regulation (<italic>CLG1</italic>, <italic>CLN2</italic>, and <italic>YOX1</italic>), four are metabolic enzymes (<italic>GDH2</italic>, <italic>GLN1</italic>, <italic>RKI1</italic>, and <italic>SGA1</italic>), two are proteins associated with the ribosome (<italic>RPS7a</italic> and <italic>TMA10</italic>), and one is involved in regulation of cell wall biosynthesis (<italic>USV1</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). The protein Usv1 is particularly intriguing, as its ortholog in <italic>C. albicans</italic>, Bcr1, is one of the other master regulators of biofilm formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nobile et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nobile and Mitchell, 2005</xref>). This observation suggests that two of the master regulators of biofilm formation, Ndt80 and Bcr1, may have had an ancestral regulatory relationship that was co-opted in the evolution of the biofilm regulatory network. In summary, while there are small vestiges of the sporulation network present in the <italic>C. albicans</italic> biofilm network, the great majority of connections are new.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>The transcription network that controls meiosis and sporulation changes extensively</title><p>Because the targets of Ndt80 appear to have rewired significantly during the switch from sporulation regulation to biofilm regulation, we tested whether Ndt80 targets are more similar among species with a conserved Ndt80 phenotype than among species with a diverged Ndt80 phenotype. If so, this would suggest that the dramatic rewiring of targets was associated with the switch in Ndt80 regulatory function. We focused on the four species for which we know both the Ndt80 phenotype and the binding targets: <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, <italic>K. lactis</italic>, <italic>P. pastoris</italic>, and <italic>C. albicans</italic>. For every two-species pair, we compared the Ndt80 targets, considering only genes with 1:1 orthologs for both species. We find relatively little overlap in Ndt80 targets for any of these comparisons (9–14%), but more importantly, we do not find a correlation between target overlap and conservation of overall Ndt80 function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). For example, a larger fraction of targets (14%) are shared between <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>C. albicans</italic> than between <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>P. pastoris</italic> (9.2%). If we take into account the different divergence times for each of these two-species comparisons (normalizing to the divergence time between <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>K. lactis)</italic>, we still find that conservation of overall Ndt80 function does not correlate with increased conservation of Ndt80 targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). This pattern also holds if we use more stringent criteria to identify Ndt80 targets in each species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Overall, these results show that the targets of Ndt80 change extensively, even while Ndt80’s conserved role in regulating sporulation is maintained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). While we cannot entirely rule out the possibility that Ndt80 has another, unknown regulatory function in one or more of these species that accounts for the significant difference in Ndt80 targets, we know that <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Ndt80 is produced specifically during sporulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chu and Herskowitz, 1998</xref>).

Although there are several possible explanations for how Ndt80 could have maintained a role in sporulation despite the near complete turnover of its target genes, we tested perhaps the most intriguing hypothesis: the genes required for sporulation and meiosis are themselves changing across species. To test this hypothesis, we measured global gene expression during sporulation and mitotic growth in <italic>K. lactis</italic> and <italic>P. pastoris</italic> (Materials and methods). We compared the genes upregulated during sporulation in these species to those upregulated during sporulation in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chu et al., 1998</xref>) and found extensive differences in the genes activated during sporulation across these species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Only 25 genes show sporulation-activation across <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, <italic>K. lactis</italic>, and <italic>P. pastoris</italic>, while 577 genes are activated uniquely in only one of the three species. Of the 65 genes known to be required for sporulation in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> that also exhibit sporulation-specific activation, only nine are activated during sporulation in both <italic>K. lactis</italic> and <italic>P. pastoris</italic>, with 21 of these genes missing altogether from the genomes of one or both of these species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>).

This incorporation, which occurred on the lineage leading to <italic>C. albicans</italic>, resulted in an overall switch in Ndt80’s function from an ancestral role in regulating sporulation and meiosis to a derived role in regulating biofilm formation. We have shown that this switch in function was not accompanied by a change in the DNA-binding specificity of Ndt80 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>); rather, a change in the distribution of the conserved Ndt80 <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory sequence across hundreds of genes in the genome largely accounts for the different functions of Ndt80 in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>C. albicans</italic>.</p><p>A priori, we considered two likely explanations for the change in Ndt80 function. First, we hypothesized that a duplication of Ndt80 in the <italic>C. albicans</italic> clade could have allowed the ancestral function (sporulation) to be conserved in one paralog, while the other acquired a new function (biofilm regulation). However, the similarity in function of Ndt80 paralogs in <italic>C. lusitaniae</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C and F</xref>) as well as the similarity in targets of Ndt80 paralogs in <italic>C. albicans</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>) rule out this model. A second plausible model held that a sudden change in Ndt80-target gene connections occurred along the <italic>C. albicans</italic> lineage, perhaps triggered by the loss of meiosis in this clade, relaxing constraints on Ndt80 target gene connections and allowing old connections to rapidly break and new connections to rapidly form. However, we also ruled out this model by showing that similarly high rates of Ndt80 rewiring occurred in all phylogenetic branches examined, even those where the function of Ndt80 remains conserved in sporulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and B</xref>). Rather than a sudden shift in regulation, our results indicate continuous flexibility in the regulon of Ndt80, allowing it to sample many configurations even while retaining its ancestral function. In support of this idea, we showed that genes upregulated during sporulation (by Ndt80 and other regulators of sporulation) vary considerably across different species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), indicating that many different network configurations can support sporulation. Consistent with this idea, it has previously been noted that several key genes required for meiosis and sporulation in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (<italic>IME1</italic>, <italic>ZIP2</italic>, <italic>SPO13</italic>) are missing from the genomes of species such as <italic>C. lusitaniae</italic> that are known to undergo meiosis and sporulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bennett and Johnson, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sherwood and Bennett, 2009</xref>). These observations, taken together, indicate that there is no ‘universal’ solution to meiosis and sporulation in terms of both the genes required for this process and the regulatory network itself. Instead, many different networks can apparently orchestrate this ancient process.</p><p>This work illustrates how a transcription regulator with hundreds of ancestral connections can, nonetheless, completely shift its cellular function. We propose that the continuous exploration of regulatory connections available to Ndt80—while still maintaining its role in sporulation—facilitated it reaching a network configuration that supported a new role in biofilm regulation. Computational models had previously led to this view, namely that gene regulatory networks are inherently flexible, allowing for the exploration of many configurations that maintain an overall function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barve and Wagner, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wagner, 2005a</xref>). This exploration allows networks to sample many points in ‘network space’, some of which may be only a few changes away from generating a novel output. We believe that Ndt80 represents a tangible example of this idea: we propose that it is only through the inherent flexibility of the Ndt80 connections that the network—while still maintaining sporulation and meiosis—could reach a position where the initial transition to regulating biofilm formation would be a simple one.</p><p>Although other transcription regulators may be subject to stronger evolutionary constraints than Ndt80, there is ample evidence that many transcription networks, like that of Ndt80, can drift through new configurations while preserving their transcriptional output (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baker et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hare et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lavoie et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Swanson et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tanay et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tsong et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Villar et al., 2015</xref>). Although the overall rate of network rewiring has not been extensively documented, it seems likely that the rewiring of the Ndt80 regulon is not unusually rapid when compared to at least some other fungal regulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Borneman et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tuch et al., 2008</xref>). While much regulatory rewiring likely occurs through drift with no obvious shift in phenotype, we propose that continuous rewiring also predisposes regulators to a shift in function. Such extreme, inherent flexibility in gene regulatory networks, such as that exhibited by Ndt80, seems likely to be a general model to explain how complex regulatory networks can evolve to produce novel phenotypes.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Media</title><p>All strains were grown in YPD at 30°C unless otherwise noted.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Patricia Wittkopp as both Senior and Reviewing Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Scott Barolo (Reviewer #1) and Zhenglong Gu (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>All three reviewers found this work of potential interest for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>, but also identified a number of issues that must be addressed prior to publication. These issues, which all reviewers and the reviewing editor agreed to in our post-review discussion, are summarized below, with some of the reviewers originally submitted comments worked in for context.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The conclusion that evolutionary plasticity of the Ndt80 network &quot;facilitated&quot; the change in Ndt80 function is not well supported and must be toned down. In the words of one reviewer: &quot;At most, it seems to me the authors could say that the acquisition of the new function is consistent with their model of plasticity facilitating the evolution. All they've shown is that the two things are true - I don't see anything that connects the first to the second. To actually provide evidence for this claim, the authors would have to show, e.g., that at least that the plasticity in Ndt80 is unusual, as is the divergence of function. Alternatively, maybe they could show some kind of theory or simulation showing that this type of evolution would be less likely if the evolution of the regulatory network were less plastic. However, without getting deeply into the molecular/cellular mechanisms of the biofilm formation in <italic>C. albicans</italic>, I don't see how the authors could really provide direct support for this claim. I don't think this additional work is within the scope of this paper. The authors could also reduce the claim that the rapid divergence &quot;facilitated&quot; the evolution of the phenotype. Another way to see the observations of this paper is that the divergence in the transcriptional network appears relatively constant, even though the phenotypic change is lineage specific. Perhaps this is the surprising finding: transcriptional rewiring doesn't seem to correlate with phenotypic change.&quot;</p><p>2) The paper should do more to put this work in the context of other work on evolution of regulatory networks. Particularly, the work on the evolution of the regulation of the yeast ribosome needs to be discussed. This work showed how conserved regulators could be co-opted into new regulatory functions. Also, related to this &quot;Yet it remains unclear how large numbers of genes (whether old or new) become incorporated into an emerging regulatory network. It is also not known how an ancient, conserved transcription regulator can form the basis of an entirely new regulatory network.&quot; I see the point the authors are trying to make here, but there have been some studies that give at least some hints as to how these things happen. For example, previous work from the Johnson lab in yeast and David Stern and Sean Carroll's labs in flies showed how new targets get incorporated into existing networks. We also know from work on the yeast ribosome that highly conserved processes (like translation) can change their regulatory mechanisms over evolution. The authors should put their work in this context:</p><p>Tanay A, et al. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2005 May 17;102(20):7203-8</p><p>Ihmels et al. Science. 2005 Aug 5;309(5736):938-40</p><p>Hogues Het al. Mol Cell. 2008 Mar 14;29(5):552-62.</p><p>3) Additional support is needed to claim that Ndt80s rewiring is &quot;rapid&quot; or &quot;extensive&quot;. Specifically, how does this rewiring compare to that of other genes? &quot;Because several recent multi-species ChIP studies have showed evidence for divergence of binding, and because the amount of divergence inferred depends on the analysis methods used, I'm not sure how the authors observations about Ndt80 compares to what would be expected for a &quot;normal&quot; transcription factor (that didn't undergo rapid or extensive divergence).&quot; Also, how much &quot;divergence&quot; is expected from biological replicates (in the same species) and how this compares to what is observed between species? This will reveal whether 13% or 2% (from different analysis methods) is &quot;little&quot; overlap. This puts a lower bound on how much &quot;evolution&quot; is expected due to experimental noise alone. (e.g., PMID:26429922, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). We suggest addressing this by comparing your estimates for Ndt80 to data from other transcription factors using the same data analysis pipeline. This could be done using previously published data.</p><p>4) Correct (or clarify) interpretation of paralogs: &quot;While the NDT80 genes in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>C. albicans</italic> discussed above are orthologous, <italic>C. albicans</italic> has an additional paralog of Ndt80, resulting from a recent gene duplication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, (Sellam et al. 2010)). The Ndt80 ortholog whose targets we identified above will be referred to as Ndt80B, while the additional paralog will be referred to as Ndt80A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).&quot; The tree in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref> does not support this. Ndt80B appears to be the derived form, while Ndt80 appears ancestral. The authors should clarify the evidence that they have the correct homolog (or if there is a &quot;correct&quot; one). Further, the duplication does not appear recent, as claimed in the text. Most of the species in the clade containing <italic>C. albicans</italic> contain the duplicate. In the main text, for support of the &quot;recent&quot; duplication, it points to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>. In the figure legend is says: &quot;Phylogenetic tree of the species investigated, inferred from protein sequences of 73 highly conserved genes (Lohse et al. 2013) with the scale representing the number of nucleotide substitutions per site.&quot; This must be wrong because the nucleotide divergence between <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>K. lactis</italic> is already very large (&gt;2 subs. per site). It's not really possible to measure nucleotide divergence between such distantly related species as shown in this tree.</p><p>&quot;In <italic>C. albicans</italic> and <italic>S. stipitis</italic>, there are two paralogs of Ndt80 and so targets were identified for each paralog separately and the union was taken to represent all Ndt80 targets in that species.&quot; I don't understand how this is consistent with &quot;While the NDT80 genes in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>C. albicans</italic> discussed above are orthologous&quot;. At the very least the authors need rethink and clarify their treatment of the paralogs.</p><p>5) &quot;This observation strongly supports the conclusion that the majority of the differences in the Ndt80 regulons across species are due to gains and losses of the conserved Ndt80 cis-regulatory sequence.&quot; I think this is a great experiment, but I think this claim is overstated. The experiment shows that the differences in regulation are not due to changes in the protein sequence of Ndt80. It doesn't rule out the possibility of additional trans-factors (e.g., different co-factors) in the different species that are responsible for the differences in Ndt80 target specificity. (In passing, I get what the authors are trying to say here, but I think it's very confusing to say gains and losses of a conserved sequence. How about gains and losses of consensus motif matches or cis-regulatory DNA binding sites?)</p><p>6) To explain &quot;how Ndt80 could have maintained a role in sporulation despite the near complete turnover of its target genes&quot;, a hypothesis is proposed: &quot;the genes required for sporulation and meiosis are themselves changing across species&quot; (subsection “The transcription network that controls meiosis and sporulation changes rapidly”). This is a very interesting yet plausible hypothesis. To test it, the authors measured gene expression changes during sporulation in <italic>K. lactis, P. pastoris</italic>, and <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and found very little overlap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). This is interesting and to the point, but it doesn't fully answer the question or test the hypothesis. Perhaps the 25 shared targets are the key ones for sporulation in all three species. If so, the authors' conclusion that there is no shared sporulation network is wrong. In the absence of functional data establishing which genes are necessary for sporulation in each species, the authors should back off from their firm conclusion that the key sporulation genes are different in each species.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23250.025</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) The conclusion that evolutionary plasticity of the Ndt80 network &quot;facilitated&quot; the change in Ndt80 function is not well supported and must be toned down.

We have made several modifications to clarify that this idea is a proposal, rather than a conclusion. Most notably, we have changed the title of the paper from “Extreme gene regulatory network plasticity facilitates a switch in function of a conserved transcription regulator” to “Gene regulatory network plasticity predates a switch in function of a conserved transcription regulator. In addition, we have made changes to the Abstract (last sentence), Introduction (last two sentences), and Discussion (first sentence) to clarify that this idea is a proposal rather than a conclusion. In passing, it is worth noting that the counter hypothesis – that the plasticity did not play a role – seems unlikely to us. Nevertheless, we now properly distinguish between our conclusions and our model.</p><p><italic>2) The paper should do more to put this work in the context of other work on evolution of regulatory networks. Particularly, the work on the evolution of the regulation of the yeast ribosome needs to be discussed. This work showed how conserved regulators could be co-opted into new regulatory functions.

Mol Cell. 2008 Mar 14;29(5):552-62.</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewers that network rewiring is not a new idea, and we certainly did not mean to imply this. We have added a paragraph to the end of the Introduction (with numerous references) to better put our work in a broader context of other work on regulatory rewiring. We have also changed the two sentences specifically referenced by the reviewers in the Introduction (end of the first paragraph) to clarify the question that we believe this study addresses.</p><p>We do wish to point out that this paper differs from previous work in studying how a conserved regulator was co-opted to form the basis of a large, new circuit (comprising hundreds of genes), which produces a novel phenotype. This is in contrast to previous work that has focused primarily on changes in the regulation of conserved set of genes, such as the ribosomal or <bold>a</bold>-specific genes, in yeast.</p><p><italic>3) Additional support is needed to claim that Ndt80s rewiring is &quot;rapid&quot; or &quot;extensive&quot;. Specifically, how does this rewiring compare to that of other genes? &quot;Because several recent multi-species ChIP studies have showed evidence for divergence of binding, and because the amount of divergence inferred depends on the analysis methods used, I'm not sure how the authors observations about Ndt80 compares to what would be expected for a &quot;normal&quot; transcription factor (that didn't undergo rapid or extensive divergence).&quot; Also, how much &quot;divergence&quot; is expected from biological replicates (in the same species) and how this compares to what is observed between species? This will reveal whether 13% or 2% (from different analysis methods) is &quot;little&quot; overlap. This puts a lower bound on how much &quot;evolution&quot; is expected due to experimental noise alone. (e.g., PMID:26429922, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). We suggest addressing this by comparing your estimates for Ndt80 to data from other transcription factors using the same data analysis pipeline. This could be done using previously published data.</italic> </p><p>For many reasons, it is difficult to compare the rates of Ndt80 rewiring with previous work. For example, we have used numerous “stringency” criteria (ChIP, transcript profiling, and conservation of binding sites) to try to eliminate false positives, whereas other work (including our own) typically lacks these additional analyses. Our best guess is that the high rate of Ndt80 rewiring is not unusual; it is clearly much higher than that exhibited by Matα1 or the Mat<bold>a</bold>1-α2 heterodimer, but is in the ballpark range of that of Mcm1 (Tuch et al. 2008) and Gal4 (Askew et al. 2009). We now explicitly state this in the Discussion (last paragraph).</p><p>We believe that the rewiring of the Ndt80 regulon is notable not in its comparison to that of other regulators, but in comparison to its conservation in phenotype. In our experience, many scientists are still surprised that a conserved regulator that controls a conserved process exhibits any rewiring whatsoever. For this reason, we believe the use of the term “extensive” is appropriate, given the small overlap in genes controlled by Ndt80 across species. However, we can see how use of the term “rapid” may have implied a comparison with other regulators, and have chosen to substitute the term “rapid” with “extensive” when referring to the rewiring of the Ndt80 regulon (Abstract; subsection “The transcription network that controls meiosis and sporulation changes extensively” heading and first paragraph).</p><p>We appreciate the observation that we have neglected to address the issue of experimental noise directly in the manuscript, and agree that it is important to clarify that the differences that we observe between species are not attributable to simple noise in our ChIP-seq experiments. We have added a figure supplement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), inspired by the suggested paper that shows the fraction of targets shared between biological ChIP-seq replicates of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>C. albicans</italic>, and how these compare to the differences we observe between the two species, for all four methods of Ndt80 target identification. These results show that experimental noise alone results in less than a 20% difference in Ndt80 targets, and less than a 5% difference for our most stringent method of target identification. In contrast, the comparisons between <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>C. albicans</italic> show greater than 85% difference in the least stringent method of identification and greater than 95% for the most stringent, suggesting that experimental noise is not sufficient to explain the differences we observe. We have added a sentence explaining this and referring to the new figure supplement in the first Results section (subsection “Ndt80 target genes differ markedly between <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>C. albicans</italic>”, end of third paragraph).</p><p><italic>4) Correct (or clarify) interpretation of paralogs: &quot;While the NDT80 genes in S. cerevisiae and C. albicans discussed above are orthologous, C. albicans has an additional paralog of Ndt80, resulting from a recent gene duplication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, (Sellam et al. 2010)). The Ndt80 ortholog whose targets we identified above will be referred to as Ndt80B, while the additional paralog will be referred to as Ndt80A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).&quot; The tree in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref> does not support this. Ndt80B appears to be the derived form, while Ndt80 appears ancestral. The authors should clarify the evidence that they have the correct homolog (or if there is a &quot;correct&quot; one). Further, the duplication does not appear recent, as claimed in the text. Most of the species in the clade containing C. albicans contain the duplicate. In the main text, for support of the &quot;recent&quot; duplication, it points to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>. In the figure legend is says: &quot;Phylogenetic tree of the species investigated, inferred from protein sequences of 73 highly conserved genes (Lohse et al. 2013) with the scale representing the number of nucleotide substitutions per site.&quot; This must be wrong because the nucleotide divergence between S. cerevisiae and K. lactis is already very large (&gt;2 subs. per site). It's not really possible to measure nucleotide divergence between such distantly related species as shown in this tree.</italic> </p><p><italic>&quot;In C. albicans and S. stipitis, there are two paralogs of Ndt80 and so targets were identified for each paralog separately and the union was taken to represent all Ndt80 targets in that species.&quot; I don't understand how this is consistent with &quot;While the NDT80 genes in S. cerevisiae and C. albicans discussed above are orthologous&quot;. At the very least the authors need rethink and clarify their treatment of the paralogs.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewers for this comment, and have rewritten the section discussing the Ndt80 paralogs extensively to attempt to clarify our results related to the two Ndt80 paralogs. To clarify, it is not possible to definitively conclude which of the Ndt80 paralogs is more related to the ancestral pre-duplication Ndt80. While the reviewers are correct that the phylogenetic tree in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> indicates that Ndt80B is the original form, synteny-based analysis suggests that Ndt80A may in fact be the ancestral paralog. In addition, protein trees built using different alignment methods show different topologies, with some indicating Ndt80B is the ancestral form and others indicating that Ndt80A is the ancestral form. Because of this uncertainty, we have made no attempt to conclude which paralog descends from the original Ndt80 and which arose as a result of the gene duplication.</p><p>Instead, we have focused our analysis primarily on Ndt80B for two reasons: (1) Ndt80B is the gene required for biofilm formation in <italic>C. albicans</italic>, while Ndt80A has no known phenotype, and (2) the targets of Ndt80A are also targets of Ndt80B. We identified the genes bound by the two Ndt80 paralogs in both <italic>C. albicans</italic> and <italic>P. stipitis</italic> and found that, in both species, Ndt80A binds primarily to a small subset of the Ndt80B targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). This suggests that the change in Ndt80 targets that occurred since the divergence of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>C. albicans</italic> was not a direct result of the gene duplication, and more likely (as we show later) occurred prior to the duplication. Because the respective roles of the two paralogs are unknown in <italic>C. albicans</italic> and <italic>P. stipitis</italic>, we have treated them, in a sense, as a single protein. Because Ndt80A binds primarily to a small subset of the Ndt80B targets, in both species we took the union of the paralog targets (encompassing all the Ndt80B targets and the few unique Ndt80A targets) as representative of the overall Ndt80 targets in that species. In this way, we feel we are remaining agnostic to the question of which is the “correct” paralog and are instead focusing on the species-specific divergence in overall Ndt80 targets. We note that this uncertainty does not affect any of our major conclusions.</p><p>However, we can see how this was not clear from the manuscript, and have made a number of changes to attempt to clarify this issue. We have added a new section in Results entitled “Divergence in Ndt80 targets not a result of Ndt80 gene duplication”, which includes text from the original manuscript with several changes. Notably, the reviewers were correct to point out that the use of the term “ortholog” and “orthologous” is incorrect in the discussion of a paralog, and this has been corrected to “homolog” and “homologous”. In addition, we have changed “recent gene duplication” to simply “gene duplication” as the term “recent” may serve to confuse more than clarify. We have also added several sentences to this section to clarify our conclusions about the paralogs. In addition, we have added a sentence later in the Results section to clarify that the paralogs in <italic>P. stipitis</italic> also bind highly overlapping targets, which is why we have considered the union of their targets in our cross-species comparisons (see subsection “Ndt80 target genes also differ between <italic>S. cerevisiae, K. lactis, P. pastoris, S. stipitis</italic>, and <italic>C. albicans</italic>”, first paragraph).</p><p>We also thank the reviewers for noticing an error in the caption of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> (also present in the captions for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>): “nucleotide substitutions per site” has been corrected to “substitutions per site”, as this rate refers to the rate of amino acid substitutions in the proteins used to construct the tree, not nucleotide substitutions.</p><p><italic>5) &quot;This observation strongly supports the conclusion that the majority of the differences in the Ndt80 regulons across species are due to gains and losses of the conserved Ndt80 cis-regulatory sequence.&quot; I think this is a great experiment, but I think this claim is overstated. The experiment shows that the differences in regulation are not due to changes in the protein sequence of Ndt80. It doesn't rule out the possibility of additional trans-factors (e.g., different co-factors) in the different species that are responsible for the differences in Ndt80 target specificity. (In passing, I get what the authors are trying to say here, but I think it's very confusing to say gains and losses of a conserved sequence. How about gains and losses of consensus motif matches or cis-regulatory DNA binding sites?)</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. The result we obtained shows that the difference in Ndt80 targets is largely due to changes in cis-regulatory sequences, but we agree that we did not show that these changes occurred in the Ndt80 cis-regulatory sequence as opposed to the cis-regulatory sequence of a hypothetical co-factor. We have added a sentence to the Results section explaining this (subsection “Ndt80 binding differences are largely determined by the gain and loss of <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory sites”, last paragraph). We have also reworded the awkward construction noted.</p><p><italic>6) To explain &quot;how Ndt80 could have maintained a role in sporulation despite the near complete turnover of its target genes&quot;, a hypothesis is proposed: &quot;the genes required for sporulation and meiosis are themselves changing across species&quot; (subsection “The transcription network that controls meiosis and sporulation changes rapidly”). This is a very interesting yet plausible hypothesis. To test it, the authors measured gene expression changes during sporulation in K. lactis, P. pastoris, and S. cerevisiae and found very little overlap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). This is interesting and to the point, but it doesn't fully answer the question or test the hypothesis. Perhaps the 25 shared targets are the key ones for sporulation in all three species. If so, the authors' conclusion that there is no shared sporulation network is wrong. In the absence of functional data establishing which genes are necessary for sporulation in each species, the authors should back off from their firm conclusion that the key sporulation genes are different in each species.</italic> </p><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s note that we have omitted any discussion of the genes required for sporulation in our discussion of our expression results. We have added a figure supplement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>), along with a sentence referring to this data in the Results section (subsection “The transcription network that controls meiosis and sporulation changes extensively”, last paragraph) that we believe supports our conclusion that the genes required for sporulation are changing across species. While we have not directly tested for the genes required for sporulation in <italic>K. lactis</italic> and <italic>P. pastoris</italic> (as this would be extremely labor intensive), we do find that 21 of the genes required for sporulation in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> that exhibit upregulation in sporulation are missing entirely from the genomes of <italic>K. lactis</italic> and <italic>P. pastoris</italic>. In addition, of those that are present in these two species (46), only 9 show sporulation up-regulation in both species tested. Based on these results, as well as the expression results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, we believe there is strong evidence that there are significant changes in the genes involved in sporulation between these species. We do not believe, however, that there is “no shared sporulation network”, and have removed the last sentence from the Results section, in order to ensure that the reader does not draw this incorrect conclusion from our results.</p></body></sub-article></article>
