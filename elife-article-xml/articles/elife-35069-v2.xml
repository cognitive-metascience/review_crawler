function. However, Cas9-assisted epitope tagging in primary mammalian cell cultures is often inefficient and reliant on plasmid-based selection strategies. Here, we demonstrate improved knock-in efficiencies of diverse tags (V5, 3XFLAG, Myc, HA) using co-delivery of Cas9 protein pre-complexed with two-part synthetic modified RNAs (annealed crRNA:tracrRNA) and single-stranded oligodeoxynucleotide (ssODN) repair templates. Knock-in efficiencies of ~5â30%, were achieved without selection in embryonic stem (ES) cells, neural stem (NS) cells, and brain-tumor-derived stem cells. Biallelic-tagged clonal lines were readily derived and used to define Olig2 chromatin-bound interacting partners. Using our novel web-based design tool, we established a 96-well format pipeline that enabled V5-tagging of 60 different transcription factors. This efficient, selection-free and scalable epitope tagging pipeline enables systematic surveys of protein expression levels, subcellular localization, and interactors across diverse mammalian stem cells.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.35069.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Genes are often referred to as the blueprints of life. Understanding the role of the genes in human cells is one of the major goals of biology. Recent advances in gene editing technologies, such as CRISPR/Cas9, mean scientists can now edit or delete precise sections within human genes, similar to how we edit words in a document on a computer. This has made it possible to insert small sequences that encode specific âtagsâ into genes. This in turn means that when a protein is built following the instructions in the gene, the protein includes the tag too, making it easy to monitor.</p><p>Tags on proteins can help scientists understand what those proteins do by answering various questions, such as: where is the protein found in the cell? How much of the protein is there in each cell? Does this change as the cell matures? What does the protein interact with? Yet, more research could be done if the tagging process was made easier, quicker and more efficient.</p><p>Dewari et al. have now come up with an improved gene editing approach that enabled them to rapidly tag hundreds of proteins all at the same time, with efficiencies that were much higher than expected based on previous approaches. The strategy uses common âoff the shelfâ reagents that can be designed with a new user-friendly, web-based tool called âTag-INâ. Dewari et al. focused on optimizing their method in freshly grown stem cells, originally collected from mice and humans. They then went on to show the scalability and efficiency of this approach by tagging 60 different proteins in brain stem cells from mice.</p><p>Now, rather than being limited to a handful of genes of interest, scientists can explore large families of genes in a variety of mouse and human cells in a much quicker and more comprehensive manner. Also, working with stem cells that can be freshly collected from individuals rather than cells that have been grown in the laboratory for a long time will be more useful for biological and disease studies. In the long-term, more knowledge of how protein-coding genes work in different human cells will benefit patients as new drugs or therapeutic targets are discovered.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>neural stem cell</kwd><kwd>CRISPR</kwd><kwd>epitope tagging</kwd><kwd>stem cells</kwd><kwd>genome editing</kwd><kwd>transcription factors</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000289</institution-id><institution>Cancer Research UK</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>A17368</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dewari</surname><given-names>Pooran Singh</given-names></name><name><surname>Southgate</surname><given-names>Benjamin</given-names></name><name><surname>O'Duibhir</surname><given-names>Eoghan</given-names></name><name><surname>Pollard</surname><given-names>Steven M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/M018040/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dewari</surname><given-names>Pooran Singh</given-names></name><name><surname>Pollard</surname><given-names>Steven M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/M018040/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dewari</surname><given-names>Pooran Singh</given-names></name><name><surname>Pollard</surname><given-names>Steven M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000266</institution-id><institution>Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/M018040/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dewari</surname><given-names>Pooran Singh</given-names></name><name><surname>Pollard</surname><given-names>Steven M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002203</institution-id><institution>Brain Tumour Charity</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GN-000358</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dewari</surname><given-names>Pooran Singh</given-names></name><name><surname>Pollard</surname><given-names>Steven M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Biochemical tags can be easily knocked into endogenous genes in mammalian stem cells using optimised and scalable protocols that will enable annotation of protein levels, localisation and interaction partners.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Defining the protein levels, subcellular localisation and biochemical interactions for theÂ &gt;20,000 protein-coding genes in the mammalian genome remains a formidable challenge. Ideally, these would be explored across diverse primary cells â rather than genetically transformed and corrupted cell lines. Large-scale projects, such as the human protein atlas, have performed systematic characterisation of antibodies against native proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Thul et al., 2017</xref>). However, there are inherent difficulties in discovering, validating and distributing high-quality antibodies that cover all species and key applications (e.g. immunoblotting, immunoprecipitation, ChIP-Seq and immunocytochemistry).</p><p>A complementary strategy is to use epitope tagging: the fusion of small peptide-coding sequences to a protein of interest (e.g. 3XFLAG, HA, V5, and Myc) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jarvik and Telmer, 1998</xref>). In contrast to plasmid-driven cDNA overexpression, which creates artificially high-protein levels, the knock-in of small epitope tags to endogenous genes provides physiologically relevant levels. A small set of pre-validated tag-specific antibodies is then used across diverse downstream experimental applications. This has been a key tool in yeast studies, resulting in global characterization of core protein complexes and their extensive interaction networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gavin et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Krogan et al., 2006</xref>). However, to date this approach has not been widely adopted in mammalian cells, primarily due to the poor efficiency of homologous recombination (HR). Repurposed programmable nucleases now provide a potential solution.</p><p>Formation of a site-specific DNA double-strand break (DSBs), will massively enhance HR-mediated repair. This has become straightforward with the discovery and application of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) and CRISPR-associated (Cas) proteins as designer site-specific nucleases. CRISPR/Cas9 was uncovered as a form of microbial adaptive immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bhaya et al., 2011</xref>) that has been repurposed for genome editing in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cong et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Doudna and Charpentier, 2014</xref>).</p><p>Cas9 is an RNA-guided endonuclease that binds complementary DNA via formation of a 20 bp RNA:DNA heteroduplex. Stable binding of Cas9/gRNA complex at the target site leads to activation of nuclease domains and formation of a double-stranded DNA break (DSB) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jinek et al., 2014</xref>). DSBs are predominantly repaired through the error-prone non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway, resulting in insertion or deletion mutations (indels) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sander and Joung, 2014</xref>). Alternatively, at lower frequencies HR-mediated repair will occur.</p><p>Successful knock-in of tags, therefore, requires co-delivery of three ingredients to the mammalian cells: the Cas9 protein, a guide RNA, and a donor repair template (i.e. single or double-stranded DNA encoding the tag or reporter with homology arms). These CRISPR components are typically delivered via transient plasmid transfection or viral vectors. Bespoke targeting vector plasmids are usually constructed for delivery of large cargoes or conditional alleles. Selection strategies, such as flow cytometry or use of antibiotic resistance cassettes, are then used to enrich for edited cells.</p><p>Despite the successes of current approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dalvai et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Savic et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mikuni et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Xiong et al., 2017</xref>), it is clear that many bottlenecks restrict widespread applications; (i) Production of tailored plasmids for each component can be tedious and time-consuming; (ii) Plasmid-based selection strategies introduce additional regulatory elements that can disrupt normal regulatory processes; (iii) Plasmid DNA, either Cas9/gRNA expression vectors or targeting vectors, can randomly integrate in the genome causing insertional mutagenesis or increasing risks of off-target cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kim et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Liang et al., 2015</xref>); (iv) current strategies are often not readily scalable to enable routine exploration of large numbers of genes; (v) recovery of biallelic clonal lines is inefficient. Thus, there remains an unmet need for improved knock-in strategies that can work efficiently in primary mammalian cells, such as pluripotent (ES/iPS), multipotent (tissue stem cells) and cancer stem cells.</p><p>Improved efficiencies of CRISPR editing in mammalian cells have been demonstrated using recombinant Cas9 protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kim et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ramakrishna et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bressan et al., 2017</xref>). Cas9 protein is complexed with in vitro-transcribed (IVT) RNA, to produce a ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex that can be then delivered into cells. The RNPs are short-lived and cleared by cells within 24â48 hr, reducing the risk of both formation of mosaic clones or off-target cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kim et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zuris et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cameron et al., 2017</xref>). However, RNP-assisted methods have mainly been used for gene knock-out (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kim et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Liang et al., 2015</xref>), incorporation of point mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ma et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rivera-Torres et al., 2017</xref>), or knock-in of restriction enzyme sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Schumann et al., 2015</xref>). We and others have recently made use of RNP with in vitro-transcribed (IVT) sgRNAs for CRIPSR epitope tagging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bressan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Liang et al., 2017</xref>), yet the efficiencies in the absence of selection are highly variable, and this approach cannot be scaled.</p><p>To avoid IVT, chemicallyÂ modifiedÂ ~100 nt-long sgRNAs can be synthesised (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hendel et al., 2015</xref>); however, these are prohibitively expensive, limiting applications. Alternatively, a two-part, chemically synthesised, short target-specific crRNA plus a longer generic tracrRNA can be used. This is cheaper (only the crRNA needs to be resynthesised for new targets) and has better performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aida et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anderson et al., 2015</xref>). This âdual-RNAâ approach has been advanced further by âbase, backbone and endâ modifications of cr/tracrRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rahdar et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kelley et al., 2016</xref>) and also by the use of shorter and more effective modified cr/tracrRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jacobi et al., 2017</xref>). Modified synthetic cr/tracrRNAs are resistant to nuclease digestion, limit cellular immune responses, have greater stability, and therefore provide enhanced targeting efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jacobi et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Here, we explored whether RNPs with synthetic modified two-part guide RNA can enhance efficiency of epitope tagging in mammalian stem cells. We find that co-delivery of a Cas9 RNP (dual-synthetic RNA) withÂ ~200 bp single-stranded oligodeoxynucleotides (ssODNs) supports highly efficient epitope tagging. This is achieved across a variety of stem cell types without any requirement for plasmids, selection steps, flow-cytometry-based enrichment, or IVT reactions. To provide a proof-of-principle, we developed a novel web-based design tool and demonstrate effective tagging in 96-well plate format. We demonstrate one application, by identifying Olig2 protein partners using immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry (IP-MS).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Cas9 protein complexed with synthetic cr/tracr RNAs enables highly efficient epitope tagging in neural and glioma stem cells</title><p>sgRNAs produced by IVT reactions can vary in quality and quantity and are prone to degradation, either during production and/or following delivery into cells.

However, this assay is qualitative. To quantitatively score the knock-in efficiency, we performed V5 ICC assay for the seven expressed TFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B,C</xref>). Sanger sequencing confirmed targeted insertion of the V5 tag-coding sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Importantly, by comparing the efficiency of tagging for these seven genes, we noted a consistent trend towards increased tagging efficiency for the most proximal cut site. For example, Sox3 showed 18% and 5% knock-in efficiency, for proximal and distal gRNAs, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). For four genes (<italic>Sox9, Foxj3, Fok1</italic> and <italic>Foxk2</italic>), the distal gRNA did not work, whereas the proximal gRNA facilitated high knock-in efficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). There were no genes for which the more distal gRNA worked better than the proximal gRNA. These results suggest proximity of DSB to the stop codon influences the efficiency of knock-in.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>A scalable pipeline for high-throughput knock-in of epitope tags using 96-well microplates</title><p>It is often desirable to explore large numbers of proteins within a shared family, complex or pathway. Methods enabling knock-in of many genes in parallel would be valuable. The gene-specific synthetic short crRNAs and matched ssODN repair templates can be obtained from commercial suppliers in 96-well microplates. Indeed, all steps can be performed easily in 96-well format: preparation of the transfection-ready components via automated liquid handling, benchtop incubation/annealing, 96-well transfection, and automated microscopy to acquire images across 96-well plates. We reasoned that scale-up could therefore be relatively straightforward. A major remaining bottleneck, however, is the need for bioinformatics design tools specifically tailored towards epitope tagging applications.</p><p>Manually extracting gene sequence data, identifying appropriate gRNAs, and design of modified repair ssODNs, would be laborious and error-prone for hundreds of genes. To automate the batch design of crRNAs and ssODNs, we developed âTag-INâ, a novel web-based tool (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://tagin.stembio.org">http://tagin.stembio.org</ext-link>).

Our tool also considers optimal distance from the insertion site (stop codon), and outputs the matched ssODNs modified with PAM-blocking mutations and appropriate epitope tag sequence. âTag-INâ also enables batch design; critical for the effective scale up to 96-well format (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.35069.020</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>A simple pipeline for high-throughput epitope knock-in using 96-well format.</title><p>In the first step, crRNAs and matched ssODNs are designed (either single input or batch processing) using the âTag-INâ bioinformatics tool.

Furthermore, we detected two other members of the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) family: Npas3 and Tcf4. The bHLH transcription factors are known to form heterodimers with other bHLH proteins on chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Massari and Murre, 2000</xref>) and the presence of Npas3 and Tcf4 may be explained by their direct physical interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig7sdata1">Figure 7âsource data 1</xref>).

Interestingly, a recent study reporting interactions of Olig2, Tcf4 and Npas3 in mouse neural stem cells by FLAG-affinity purification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Moen et al., 2017</xref>) allowed us to correlate interactomes of all the three bHLH proteins with our data.

As expected, Olig2, Olig1, and Olig3 were found among the most highly abundant proteins, indicating high specificity of the immunoprecipitation. Furthermore, composition of identified proteins correlates with previous findings: we detected three known interactors of Olig2 (Cul3, Smarca4 and Sox8 (BioGRID, Intact)) and 55 other proteins reported to co-precipitate with Olig2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Moen et al., 2017</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). These included many SWI/SNF family members, and chromatin regulators Cbx3 and Chd4, consistent with RIME.

Additionally, fusion proteins can be used for pull-down assays (immunoprecipitation and ChIP). Encouraged by the facile deployment and efficiencies of the Cas9 RNP method for small epitope tagging, we next asked if the same approach could be used for knock-in of relatively large mCherry-encoding DNA sequence (~700 bp) in NS cells. First, we tested the effect of variable length of homology arms on knock-in efficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). For these experiments, double-stranded linear DNA fragments harbouring variable homology arms were used as donor DNA templates (PCR-amplified from a previously reported promoterless Sox2-mCherry plasmid) (Bressan et al.). We found that dsDNA with larger homology arms were more effective in mCherry knock-in (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>), although homology arms as small as 100 bp showedÂ ~0.29% cells positive for mCherry in the bulk populations.

Epitope tagging of endogenous genes using CRISPR-assisted knock-in provides new opportunities to interrogate protein function, expression, subcellular localisation and interacting partners. In this study, we demonstrated simple and efficient epitope tag knock-in across a large number of genes in mouse and human stem cells.</p><p>Use of Cas9 recombinant protein is critical. We found that when combined with synthetic modified RNAs significant enhancement in the efficiency is possible. This was achieved using faster and more reliable method â compared to plasmid-based strategies. Importantly, we showed primary mammalian stem cell lines are readily amenable to RNP engineering, without the need for plasmid production, or prior genetic manipulation of the host cell lines. Our method is therefore versatile enough to be implemented by any laboratory in their existing cell lines. All reagents can now be obtained âoff the shelfâ.</p><p>Assembly of RNPs with csRNAs is simple and requires onlyÂ ~30 min hands-on-time; this compared favourably to IVT reactions, which require multiple steps, are time-consuming, and result in variable quality of gRNAs. In our hands, these reagents are stable at â20<sup>o</sup> C for many months, and is particularly convenient when re-used across a range of cell types. Perhaps more importantly, use of the custom synthetic cr/tracrRNAs with their modified backbone and protected ends, shields the RNA from cellular RNases. We found greatly reduced toxicity â one of the key advantages of the csRNP over IVT sgRNA and plasmids-based delivery methods.</p><p>We routinely generated clonal knock-in lines in a time-frame of 4â6 weeks. Consistent with a previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Liang et al., 2015</xref>), we found that RNP complexes target both copies of the genes at high frequency, enabling facile isolation of bi-allelic knock-in clones. Although monoallelic knock-in clones are sufficient for pull-down assays, bi-allelic clones are preferred to have more confidence in the interpretation of downstream assays.</p><p>While our focus has been on neural stem cells and their malignant counterparts (glioma stem cells), these same methods and reagents can work well in other stem cells, such as ES cells. Indeed, our knock-in data using ES cells revealed that non-expressed genes can be efficiently tagged using the same protocol. Under appropriate differentiation cues, induction of these proteins can be monitored using ICC analysis in the ES cell differentiating progeny. We believe this could be a key application â rapidly enabling assessment of proteins across a range of lineage contexts.</p><p>Despite the excitement, there are also some caveats. Foremost, inevitably there is a risk that C-terminus tagging can potentially compromise protein function, localisation or levels in the edited cells. Not all proteins will be amenable to tagging. If the protein of interest harbours critical C terminal domains, an N-terminus approach could be pursued â or knock-in to other regions such as structurally neutral linkers, if this is known. In this study, we used PAM-strand (non-complementary strand) for donor DNA synthesis, which is less likely to be cut by Cas9 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gasiunas et al., 2012</xref>). We have not compared PAM versus non-PAM donor DNA strands for knock-in efficiency although a recent report suggests that for symmetrical PAM ssODNs, both strands are equally effective for knock-in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Liang et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Previous findings have reported a higher HDR rate with the guide RNAs that cut near the insertion site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bialk et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Paquet et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Liang et al., 2017</xref>). Our results corroborate these findings and reveal that cut-to-insertion-site distance is a critical factor for successful knock-in. Lower knock-in efficiency achieved with the distal-cutting gRNAs could be attributed to âpartial HDRâ events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Guo et al., 2018</xref>), which are not detectable in our ICC end-point assays. Although beyond the scope of our present study, whole-genome sequencing of the CRISPR-edited bulk cells can shed light on the extent of âpartial HDRâ events in epitope knock-in experiments. The average size of CRISPR/Cas9-induced indels in mammalian cells has been reported to be around 1â5 bp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Paquet et al., 2016</xref>). We therefore recommend designing guide RNAs in the 3âUTR, preferably cutting 8â15 bp downstream of stop codon, to avoid interfering with the stop codon.</p><p>The ability to scale-up tagging to 96-well format required us to tackle the bottleneck in design. Our newly developed âTag-INâ tool simplifies gene sequence retrieval and designing crRNA and ssODN for medium-throughput experiments and is available from any web browser (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://tagin.stembio.org">http://tagin.stembio.org</ext-link>). This can be modified for use with alternative design parameters and distinct tags. We demonstrated one of the key applications by single-cell imaging of the levels and localisation for 60 different transcription factors in glioma stem cells. These were successfully tagged without any screening of gRNAs or ssODN; those that failed could be due to the gRNA not working effectively or the ssODN donor being sub-optimal. These could be re-tested with replacements â particularly for the ssODN, other tag can be used that works effectively in some instances (data not shown). Alternatively, the protein maybe expressed at levels too low to detect by ICC, but the tag insertion might still be detected by PCR genotyping. This is likely the case for 10â20% of the genes we explored.</p><p>The pipeline that emerges is fully scalable and does not require sophisticated tools, expertise, or know-how. There are no significant bottlenecks in either the design, acquisition/production of reagents or delivery into cells. It was possible to generate such data with relatively little labour investment, and the whole pipeline from obtaining the reagents to imaging data was accomplished within three weeks.</p><p>Increasing the throughput further, we can envision systematic surveys of many hundreds or thousands of genes. Because tag-specific antibodies work universally across different cell types and species, this approach should allow cross-species comparisons and will also complement existing efforts to develop and characterise native antibodies. Furthermore, tagging of DNA-binding proteins will allow us to generate comprehensive genome-wide binding sites via ChIP-Seq for key transcription factors, chromatin-modifying enzymes, and other gene regulatory proteins. Although not a focus of the current study, we also find that csRNP is highly effective for gene knockout studies (Pollard laboratory, unpublished and (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jacobi et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>We demonstrated proof-of-principle in identification of Olig2 protein partners. This is likely a key application for future studies; simplifying and scaling up the ability to probe protein complexes in a range of cell types and cell states. Using the Olig2-V5 knockin lines we demonstrated on-chromatin partners in mouse glioma cells using optimised RIME and ChIP-SICAP methods, validating previously reported protein interaction partners. These optimised V5 RIME and ChIP-SICAP methods can now be deployed using the same optimised protocol for other mammalian proteins, particular for those with no good quality antibodies â a key advantage of epitope tagging.</p><p>With the remarkable developments in single-cell mRNA profiling, and plans for systematic RNA and protein atlases of mammalian cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rozenblatt-Rosen et al., 2017</xref>), there is a greater need than ever to relieve the bottleneck of exploring protein products. Descriptive maps of cell types, while valuable, must be complemented by careful and detail molecular and cellular functional studies. Our findings suggest that epitope using CRISPR/Cas-assisted knock-in is now simple and efficient enough that systematic annotation of many hundreds or thousands of endogenous will be possible in mouse and human stem and progenitor cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type (species) <break/>or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Gene (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>SOX2</italic></td><td valign="top">NA</td><td valign="top">Transcript ID_ENSEMBL: <break/>ENST00000325404</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Gene (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>SOX9</italic></td><td valign="top">NA</td><td valign="top">Transcript ID_ENSEMBL: <break/>ENST00000245479</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Gene (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>OLIG2</italic></td><td valign="top">NA</td><td valign="top">Transcript ID_ENSEMBL: <break/>ENST00000333337</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cell line (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">ANS4</td><td valign="top">PMID: 28096221</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">mouse neural stem cells</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cell line (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">BL6</td><td valign="top">PMID: 28096221</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">mouse neural stem cells</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cell line (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">IENS</td><td valign="top">PMID: 17936558</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">mouse glioma-initiating stem cells</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cell line (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">ES (Tg2a)</td><td valign="top">This paper</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">mouse embryonic stem cells</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td valign="top">MasterShef7 (MS7)</td><td valign="top">This paper</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">human embryonic stem cells</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td valign="top">G7 human <break/>tumour-derived</td><td valign="top">This paper</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Cell derived from GBM tumours</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">V5 tag</td><td valign="top">eBioscience</td><td valign="top">TCM5 #14-6796-82;

Mouse ES (Tg2a) cells were cultured in GMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 1x non-essential amino acids,1x glutamine/sodium pyruvate, 1xLIF, 1x Pen/strep and 100 Î¼M of Ã-mercaptoethanol. Media was changed every day and cells passaged approximately every other day onto plates pre-coated with 0.1% gelatin. Differentiation of ES cell was performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pollard et al., 2006</xref>) with 1 Ã 10<sup>4</sup> cells per cm<sup>2</sup> being seeded in N2B27 complete media for 7 days, with media being changed every 1â2 days.</p><p>MasterShef7 (MS7) human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) were re-cultured in Essential 8 (E8) medium (Gibco, A1517001) on tissue culture plastic coated with Human Recombinant Laminin-521 (BioLamina, LN521) at 5 Î¼g/ml. Routine passaging was performed by incubating cells for 5 min at 37Â°C in 0.5 mM EDTA in PBS. Single-cell dissociation prior to nucleofection was performed by incubating cells for 10 min at 37Â°C in accutase. Y-27632 (Cell Guidance Systems, SM02) was included in the culture medium at 10 Î¼M following initial thawing and after plating following nucleofection. New engineered cell reporters described here are available upon request. No standard cell lines were used. We used primary stem cell lines. Human ES cells were provided by the UK stem cell bank and had appropriate contamination testing and authentication.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Colony picking and clonal lines generation</title><p>Clonal cell lines were derived from the bulk populations using either single-cell deposition to 96-well plates or by manual colony picking. Single cells were deposited into 96-well plates using BD FACSAria II cell sorter. Depending on the cell lines, we obtained 30â40 colonies per 96-well plate in 2 weeks. For manual colony picking, mouse cells were seeded at clonal density (400 cells per 10 cm dish for NS cells, 100 cells per dish for GNS cells) to a 10 cm dish and incubated in the complete media for 10â12 days for colony formation. From each dish, we picked 25â30 manually with a P20 pipette. Colonies from both methods were later replica plated into 96-well plates and analysed for successful knock-in using immunocytochemistry against the V5 tag. The V5-positive clones were further expanded for DNA extraction (PCR genotyping) and cryostorage.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Design of guide RNAs and ssODN repair templates</title><p>For manual design: the 3âUTR sequence and 500 bp sequence upstream of the 3âUTR were retrieved using Biomart tool. The final coding exon and 3âUTR features were manually annotated using SnapGene and theÂ ~200 bp around the stop codon were used as an input for guide RNA designing. We designed guide RNAs using either the web-based tool form Desktop Genetics (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.deskgen.com/landing/">https://www.deskgen.com/landing/</ext-link>) or our own bioinformatics âTag-INâ tool (below). High scoring guide RNAs were picked for synthesis (i.e those with cut sites in the 3âUTR, preferably within 8â15 bp distance from the stop codon and minimal predicted off-target cleavage). For ssODN design, first the PAM-blocking mutations (NGGÂ &gt;NGC or NGT) were introduced into the SnapGene sequence and then the epitope-tag coding sequence was inserted before the stop codon. TheÂ &lt;200 mer ssODN ultramer was chosen to be the same strand as the guide RNA (also referred to as the PAM-strand, non-complementary strand or non-targeting strand) and is comprised of: a 5â homology arm (~70 mer), the epitope tag coding sequence, stop codon, and a 3â homology arm with the PAM-blocking mutations (~70 mer). For some of the ultramers the PAM-strand synthesis had failed and, therefore, the complementary strand (non-PAM strand) was synthesised as a donor DNA.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Custom synthetic crRNA, tracrRNA, and ssODN</title><p>Custom synthetic crRNAs, tracrRNA, and ssODNs were manufactured by Integrated DNA Technologies, USA. The RNA backbone and ends were chemically modified for protection against cellular RNases. The 36-mer crRNA contains a variable gene-specific 20-nt target sequence followed by 16-nt sequence that base-pairs with the tracrRNA. The 67-mer tracrRNA contains the gRNA-scaffold sequence as well as 16-nt sequence complementary to crRNA. The lyophilised crRNA and tracrRNA pellets were resuspended in Duplex buffer (IDT) at 100 Î¼M concentration and stored in small aliquots at â80Â°C. ssODN donor DNAs lyophilised pellets were supplied without modifications and resuspended in Duplex buffer (IDT) at 30 Î¼M concentration.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Production of in vitro-transcribed sgRNA</title><p>DNA template for T7-driven synthesis was prepared by annealing 119-mer, single-stranded, complementary ultramers (from IDT) encoding T7 promoter, guide RNA, and gRNA scaffold sequences. 200 ng of the template were used to synthesise sgRNA with the MEGAscript T7 Transcription Kit.

Cas9 protein expression was induced with 0.5 mM IPTG (Isopropyl Î²-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside) (Fisher, 10715114) and the cells were incubated overnight at 20Â°C. 24 hr later, bacterial pellets were resuspended in 20 ml of lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 500 mM NaCl, 1 mM TCEP, 5 mM imidazole pH 8.0), sonicated and loaded on a HisTrap HP 5 ml column (GE, 17-5248-01). The Cas9 protein was collected in elution buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 250 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mM TCEP, 250 mM imidazole pH 8.0). The fractions containing Cas9 protein were pooled and loaded into a HiPrep 26/10 Desalting Column (GE, 28-4026-52) to equilibrate in Cas9 buffer (20 mM HEPES-KOH pH 7.5, 150 mM KCl, 1 mM TCEP). The purified Cas9 protein was further concentrated using Vivaspin columns (Vivaspin20, 30 000 MWCO PES, Sartorius stedim, VS2021) as per the users-guide instructions.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Assembly of the active ribonucleoprotein (Cas9 plus csRNAs)</title><p>Synthetic Alt-R CRISPR/Cas9 crRNAs and tracrRNA were supplied by IDT. We prepared Cas9 RNP complexes immediately before electroporation experiments (a detailed protocol in a separate Appendix 1 is available). Cas9 RNPs with IVT sgRNA were assembled (1â3 Î¼g of IVT sgRNA with 5â10 Î¼g of Cas9 protein) as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bressan et al., 2017</xref>). For csRNP preparation, 100 picomoles of each crRNA and tracrRNA were annealed using gradual step-down cooling in the PCR block (5 min at 95Â°C, step cool-down from 95Â°C to 25Â°C at ramp rate 0.1Â°C/s, 4Â°C (store) at ramp rate 0.5Â°C/s). Ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes were assembled by adding 10 Î¼g of recombinant Cas9 protein to the annealed cr/tracrRNAs, incubated at room temperature for 10 min and stored on ice until electroporation into cells. 30 picomoles of single-stranded donor DNA were added to RNP complexes just before electroporation to prepare the complete RNP mix. For mCherry knock-in, csRNPs were prepared similarly and 200 ng of PCR products were used as donor DNA templates per reaction. For multiplex epitope tagging, 100 picomoles of cr/tracrRNA of each Sox2 and Olig2 were mixed together with 20 Î¼g of rCas9 protein.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Cell transfection</title><p>We used 4D Amaxa nucleofection system for the delivery of CRISPR ingredients. For NS cells and GNS cells, approximately 1.5 Ã 10<sup>5</sup> cells were resuspended in 20 Î¼L of Lonza SG cell line buffer and were mixed with the complete RNP mix and electroporated using the DN-100 program (two consecutive pulses for mouse NS cells) or using EN-138 program (one pulse for human GBM-derived cells). For embryonic stem cells, approximately 6 Ã 10<sup>4</sup> cells in 20 Î¼L of Lonza P3 primary cell buffer were used for each transfection with different programs: one pulse of program CA-120 for mouse ESCs; program CB-150 for human ESCs. After the electroporation, cells were transferred into a 6-well plate and allowed to recover for 3â5 days and later seeded into 96-well plates (1â2 Ã 10<sup>4</sup> cells per well) for ICC.</p><p>For scale up, RNP assembly and delivery were performed as above, except that RNP complexes were prepared a day before and stored at â20Â°C. Electroporation was performed using the 96-well Shuttle device (Amaxa, Lonza). Immediately after transfection cells were transferred into a 96-deep-well plate and replica plates for immunocytochemistry assay were prepared by dispensing 1 Ã 10<sup>4</sup> cells into 96-well plate using CyBi-FeliX Liquid Handling Platform.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Immunocytochemistry and imaging</title><p>We performed ICC on 96-well plates 5 days after transfection. Cells were washed once with PBS and fixed using 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature and then permeabilised in PBST (PBSÂ +Â 0.1% Triton X-100) for 20 min. Samples were incubated with blocking solution (1% goat serum in PBST) for 30 min at room temperature to block non-specific binding of the antibodies. Samples were treated overnight with primary antibodies in blocking solution followed by incubation with appropriate secondary antibodies and 4â²,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). Images were acquired using either a Nikon wide-field fluorescence microscope or a PerkinElmer Operetta high-content imaging system. V5-positive cells were scored using Fiji software.</p><p>The following primary antibodies were used: V5 tag (eBioscience, TCM5 #14-6796-82,1:1000); HA Tag (Cell Signalling, 6E2 #2367, 1:100); FLAG tag (Sigma-Aldrich, #F3165, 1:2000); Myc tag (Cell Signalling, 9B11 #2276, 1:4000), Alexa Fluor secondary antibodies mostly Alexa Fluor Plus 647 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 1:1000). HCS CellMask Green Stain (Thermo Fisher Scientific, #H32714) for nucleocytoplasmic staining was used at 1: 10,000 for 20 min at room temperature.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Genomic DNA extraction and PCR genotyping</title><p>Genomic DNA was extracted either using in-house lysis buffer as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bressan et al., 2017</xref>) (bulk populations from 96-well plate or using DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit (Qiagen, # 69506, for DNA extraction from clonal lines in a 24-well plate). PCR primers flanking the V5 tag were designed online using Primer3Plus to generate 400â600 bp PCR amplicons. PCR genotyping and Sanger sequencing were done as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bressan et al., 2017</xref>). DNA samples were analysed using 2.5% agarose gels.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>ChIP-SICAP and RIME</title><p>Approximately 40 million mouse NS cells from three T150 flasks (150 cm<sup>2</sup>) were cultured until 70â80% confluence and then dissociated into single-cells using accutase. To fix DNA-protein and protein-protein interactions, the cell pellet was resuspended in 1.5% methanol-free formaldehyde (Pierce) in 10 mL PBS for 10 min at room temperature. Excess formaldehyde was quenched by adding 125 mM glycine and incubated for 5 min at room temperature. Cells were washed twice with cold PBS and stored at â80Â°C until further use. ChIP-SICAP experiments were performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rafiee et al., 2016</xref>). Briefly, chromatin from 40 million formaldehyde-fixed cells was sheared by sonication (Bioruptor Pico, Diagenode) down to 150â500 bp fragments, which were used as input for immunoprecipitation with anti V5 antibody (Abcam, 15828) overnight at 4Â°C. Antibody was captured with Protein-G beads (LIFE technologies, 10004D), the associated DNA was biotinylated by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (Thermo Fisher, EP0162) in the presence of biotin-11-dCTP (Jena Bioscience, NU-809-BIOX). The antibody was eluted from the beads in 7.5% SDS with 200 mM DTT and the released DNA-protein complexes were caputred by streptavidin magnetic beads (NEB, S1420). After subsequent washes with SDS washing buffer (Tris-CL 1 mM, 1% SDS, 200 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA), 20% isopropanol and 40% acetonitrile, the beads were boiled in 0.1% SDS in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate and 10 mM DTT at 95Â°C for 20 min. Proteins were digested overnight with trypsin at 37Â°C and the resulting peptides were purified with the SP3 protocol as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hughes et al., 2014</xref>) and analysed using an Orbitrap Fusion LC-MS system.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>crRNA/ssODN design tool</title><p>The implementation of our crRNA/ssODN design tool was completed in four stages: extraction of a target genomic sequence from GRCh38.p5 or GRCm38.p4 genome builds, retrieval of crRNA sequences matching the pattern N<sub>20</sub>NGG, scoring and ranking of each crRNA using the âRule Set 2â (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Doench et al., 2016</xref>) and âMITâ scoring models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hsu et al., 2013</xref>), and design of each corresponding ssODN sequence.</p><p>To accommodate genomic sequence extraction, an SQL database of genomic coordinates was built using the Genomic Features package in R. This SQL database was used to retrieve coding DNA sequence (CDS) ranges upon user query with a desired Ensembl transcript Id. Given a CDS range, a genomic sequence was then extracted from a corresponding GRCh38.p5 or GRCm38.p4 Fasta file.</p><p>For each target genomic sequence, crRNAs were extracted limited to the pattern N<sub>20</sub>NGG. crRNAs were then ranked using two scoring models, âRule Set 2â for assessing crRNA efficiency, and the MIT scoring system for crRNA specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hsu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Doench et al., 2016</xref>). The former was utilised as a standalone script retrieved from the âsgRNA Designerâ website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://portals.broadinstitute.org/gpp/public/analysis-tools/sgrna-design">https://portals.broadinstitute.org/gpp/public/analysis-tools/sgrna-design</ext-link>) and the latter was implemented as documented on the âCRISPR Designâ website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://crispr.mit.edu/about">http://crispr.mit.edu/about</ext-link>). Off targets for each crRNA were found using the short read aligner tool Bowtie, searching up to three mismatches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Langmead et al., 2009</xref>). Off targets that then match the PAM pattern NAG and NGG were extracted from the Bowtie output. In addition, crRNAs that cut close to the stop codon (8â15 bp in the 3âUTR), and within the UTR region, were prioritised. Given a batch request, the top two ranking crRNAs were selected for output. A maximum distance of 30 bp from the stop codon was chosen as an additional threshold for batch processing.</p><p>To implement ssODN design, user-defined tags were inserted immediately 5<sup>I</sup> proximal to the stop codon. PAM sequences were changed to minimise potential for Cas9 cleavage of donor sequences. Where the PAM sequence resided in the 3<sup>I</sup> UTR, our tool modified the NGG PAM to NGC. Intronic or exonic PAM changes instead aimed to produce silent mutations, and where this was not possible, aimed to reduce alterations in function by minimising differences in hydrophobicity and charge. Final ssODN sequences were limited to 200-mer including the tag sequence. We therefore present the â<italic>Tag-IN</italic>â design tool, a novel crRNA and ssODN design tool aimed at streamlining CRISPR knock-in experimentation (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://tagin.stembio.org">http://tagin.stembio.org</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry</title><p>The Olig2 protein interactors were identified using the Rapid immunoprecipitation mass spectrometry of endogenous protein (RIME) protocol.

Lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 2000 <italic>g</italic> for 5 min at 4Â°C, and the pellet was resuspended with 1 ml of LB2 (10 mM Tris-HCL [pH 8.0], 200 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, and 0.5 mM EGTA), and mixed at 4Â°C for 5 min. Lysate was cleared by centrifugation and the pellet was resuspended in 0.5 ml of LB3 (10 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8], 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM EGTA, 0.1% Na-deoxycholate, and 0.5% N-lauroylsarcosine). Samples were sonicated in a waterbath sonicator (Diagenode Bioruptor) and cleared by centrifugation. 10 ÂµL V5 trap magnetic beads (MBL) were used per sample. IPs, washes and on-bead digests were performed using a Thermo Kingfisher Duo, all steps are at 5Â°C unless otherwise stated. Beads were transferred into 500 Î¼L of cleared lysate and incubated for 2 hr with mixing. Beads were then transferred for two washes in RIPA buffer and three washes in non-detergent lysis buffer. On-bead digest was performed by transferring the washed beads into 100 Î¼L 2M urea, 100 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 1 mM DTT containing 0.3 Î¼g trypsin (Promega) per sample, beads were incubated at 27Â°C for 30 min with mixing to achieve limited proteolysis. The beads were then removed and tryptic digest of the released peptides was allowed to continue for 9 hr at 37Â°C. Reduced cysteine residues were alkylated by adding iodoacetamide solution to a final concentration of 50 mM and incubated 30 min at room temperature, in the dark. Trypsin activity was inhibited by acidification of samples to a concentration of 1% TFA. Samples were desalted on a C18 Stage tip and eluates were analysed by HPLC coupled to a Q-Exactive mass spectrometer as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Turriziani et al., 2014</xref>). Peptides and proteins were identified and quantified with the MaxQuant software package (1.5.3.8), and label-free quantification was performed by MaxLFQ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cox et al., 2014</xref>). The search included variable modifications for oxidation of methionine, protein N-terminal acetylation, and carbamidomethylation as fixed modification. The FDR, determined by searching a reverse database, was set at 0.01 for both peptides and proteins.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Vectors were provided by Addgene for Cas9 recombinant protein production (Addgene Plasmid 53261).

The same protocol can be used for other cell lines including ES cells. We used an Amaxa 4D Nucleofection system for the delivery of Cas9 RNP. The typical nucleofection reaction volume is 20 Î¼L (Lonza transfection buffer) plus 5 Î¼L (CRISPR/Cas9 reagents) in a 16-well microcuvette.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Fiona Watt as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Hein te Riele (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Dewari et al., present a pipeline for high content epitope tagging of proteins in mammalian cells. Salient features of their approach are: (i) the use of purified CRISPR/Cas9 protein loaded with a 67-mer tracrRNA and a gene-specific 36-mer crRNA to introduce a double-strand break in the 3' UTR of the target gene in close vicinity of the stop codon. The RNP is introduced into cells by electroporation. In Figure 1 they show that the synthetic cr:tracr dual RNA system outperforms in vitro transcribed single guide RNAs. (ii) for homology-directed break repair, they use {plus minus}200 nucleotide single-stranded oligo deoxyribonucleotide templates that instruct the integration of the epitope tag. To prevent recutting, they simultaneously introduce a PAM-disrupting mutation. The frequency of successful tagging is around 15-20%, occasionally even 30%.</p><p>Overall, this report is very well written. The figures support the conclusions of the paper and present a convenient guideline for tagging of proteins with small epitopes. As such, the manuscript may be of interest for a broad audience. However, some points need further clarifications.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The frequency of successful epitope tagging was calculated based on the percentage of cells expressing the epitope (Figure 1). Subcloning and subsequent PCR analysis of V5-positive clones revealed many clones with bi-allelic tagging (Figure 2B, Table 1). However, this analysis also showed not all clones were correctly targeted. E.g., lane 1 of the <italic>Sox2</italic>-V5 clones and lanes 3 and 6 of the Sox3-V5 clones (Figure 2B). It would be helpful if the authors would add to Table 1 the number of non-correctly targeted clones in order to more precisely determine the targeting efficiency.</p><p>2) In subsection âThe high frequency of knock-in using csRNP facilitates simple recovery of biallelictagged clonal linesâ, reference is made to Table 2. This apparently should be Table 1. Or Supplementary table 2, which is the same as Table 1?</p><p>3) Figure 3C shows that epitope tagging can also be achieved at genes that are not expressed in ES cells. Only after differentiation into neural cells, the V5 tag became visible. However, it seems as if in the differentiated ES cells all neuronal cells expressed V5. How is this possible? Were neural rosettes obtained from single ES cells? Were also V5-negative neuronal rosettes obtained. If so, could an estimation be given on the frequency of epitope tagging at non-expressed genes versus expressed genes in ES cells by comparing the number of V8-negative and -positive rosettes?</p><p>4) Figure 4D shows the fusion between two target genes and the V5 tag. However, it is unclear why this information is useful as the fusion is present in the ssODN template. It would be more interesting to see how the sequence around the DSB was repaired.</p><p>Similar data is shown in Figure 1âfigure supplement 1, Figure 2âfigure supplement 1, Figure 3âfigure supplement 1 and Figure 4âfigure supplement 3. From a skeptical point of view, these sequences only show that the ssODNs were properly synthesized. To confirm &quot;in-frame and error-free insertion of V5 tag sequence at the C-terminus&quot;, mRNA sequencing appears more appropriate to show the tag is really present at the destined site. Reassuringly, Figure 1âfigure supplement 2BFigure just shows the modified <italic>Sox2</italic> PAM site. Anyway, it is important to indicate that false positives were excluded by properly choosing the position of PCR primers.</p><p>5) The higher performance of gRNAs cutting proximal to the insertion site of the epitope tag compared to distal cutting sites shown in Figure 4 is very interesting and may relate to suggested mechanisms of ssODN-templated DSB repair. It would be interesting if the authors could share their opinion on the reasons for the inferior performance of distal gRNAs.</p><p>6) The higher performance of tag-proximal gRNAs was only seen by staining for the V5 epitope (Figure 4), not by PCR (Figure 4âfigure supplement 1, Figure 4âfigure supplement 2), according to the authors because the latter is not quantitative. It is not clear why in Figure 4âfigure supplement 1, Figure 4âfigure supplement 2 some lanes are indicated +, others not. Was this only based on the expected size of the PCR product? Please indicate this in the legend. How discordant were the PCR and ICC results?</p><p>7) Related to the above: In subsection âDesign of guide RNAs and ssODN repair templatesâ it is mentioned that &quot;the 200-mer ssODN ultramer was chosen to be the same strand as the guide RNA&quot;. Was there a particular reason to choose this strand and not the opposite strand? However, &quot;for some of the ultramers the PAM-strand synthesis had failed and therefore, the complementary strand (non-PAM strand) was synthesized as a donor DNA.&quot; It would be very interesting to know how these non-PAM ssODNs performed. Do the authors consider PAM and non-PAM ssODNs equally effective? Has a comparison been made between the two?</p><p>8) The above is important with respect to the Tag-IN tool the authors have created. Does the tool always propose a PAM ssODN or can also the reversed strand be chosen? If so, it should be made clear form comparative experiments that the two strands perform equally well.</p><p>9) In subsection âA scalable pipeline for high-throughput knock-in of epitope tags using 96-well Microplatesâ, the results of simultaneous tagging of 185 genes is presented. Plate 1 (Figure 6A) and 2 (Figure 6C) show 30/90 and 31/95 TF2 positive for V5. What was the cutoff here? According to the scale bar, more positive wells are visible with low ({plus minus}2-5%) but detectable V5 signal. On the other hand, what happened to the negative wells ({plus minus}77 in total)? Are these all non-expressed genes? This should be made clear in order to estimate how effective the Tag-IN tool works.</p><p>10) What would the authors recommend for tagging proteins with larger tags, such as GFP or luciferase?

For PCR genotyping, of bulk populations, we used a forward primer designed flanking the left homology arm (i.e. it was not present within the ssODN, but the upstream exon sequence) (Figure 1âfigure supplement 1, Figure 3âfigure supplement 1 and Figure 4âfigure supplement 3). This product therefore confirms correct in-frame insertion. We have updated the Figure legend to make this clear. Indels in the 3âUTR in the bulk population could not be assessed by Sanger sequencing using this PCR product; however, for the clonal lines we used PCR primers flanking the V5 tag (Figure 2âfigure supplement 1).</p><p>The figure has now been updated to clearly show the sequences around the guide RNA cut-site and confirms the error-free knock-in of V5 tag sequence.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The higher performance of gRNAs cutting proximal to the insertion site of the epitope tag compared to distal cutting sites shown in Figure 4 is very interesting and may relate to suggested mechanisms of ssODN-templated DSB repair.

The legends for both the Figure 4âfigure supplement 1 and Figure 4âfigure supplement 2 have been updated to make this clear.</p><p>Genes positive for V5 knock-in as assessed by ICC were positive by PCR genotyping. However, many expressed-genes (e.g. <italic>Sox5, Foxj3, Foxk1</italic>) were positive by PCR for the second set of gRNAs (distal-cutting), but we only detected a few V5-positive cells in the entire microscopic field. The increased sensitivity of PCR therefore likely explains this difference. V5 immunocytochemistry remains in our view the simplest way to confirm successful knock-in.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Related to the above: In subsection âDesign of guide RNAs and ssODN repair templatesâ it is mentioned that &quot;the 200-mer ssODN ultramer was chosen to be the same strand as the guide RNA&quot;.

We initially had chosen the non-complementary strand of the DNA (PAM ssODN) for donor DNA synthesis as a precautionary step to avoid risks of ssODN being cut during in vitro assembly of CRISPR ingredients. However, a recent report suggests that for symmetrical PAM ssODNs there is no strand bias in terms of HDR knock-in efficiency (Liang et al., 2017). We have updated the Discussion section to make clear that our study focussed on the PAM ssODN, but in light of these recent publications the alternative strand will likely also be effective.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) The above is important with respect to the Tag-IN tool the authors have created.

In subsection âA scalable pipeline for high-throughput knock-in of epitope tags using 96-well Microplatesâ, the results of simultaneous tagging of 185 genes is presented.

This should be made clear in order to estimate how effective the Tag-IN tool works.</p></disp-quote><p>For the V5 tagging of 185 genes in the 96-well format, we used high-content imaging with Operetta to calculate the knock-in efficiency. The success of V5 tag insertion was assessed by manually inspecting images from each of the 96 wells and those with clear nuclear staining were scored as positive (30/90 and 31/95 both plates). The gRNAs for the 185 genes that were designed using Tag-IN tool were also verified manually to confirm that they were cutting near the insertion site (proximal-cutting) and had high score.</p><p>RNA-seq data we have recently obtained from other NS cell lines suggests the majority of the 185 genes are expressed â but we found that 10-20% are either not detectable or expressed at low levels. So, our ~30% of tagging success is likely a significant underestimate. For some, however, the failure is likely due to either a poor gRNA, poor repair ssODN or both. We now make this clear in the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) What would the authors recommend for tagging proteins with larger tags, such as GFP or luciferase? Would RNPs work similar well with larger double- or single-stranded templates?</p></disp-quote><p>This is a good suggestion and of great interest to our lab.

We see 1% efficiency (as anticipated, less than V5 tags; but still sufficient to recover cell lines by FACs). We include these data as a new supplementary Figure 7, which shows the knock-in of mCherry reporter at the C-terminus of mouse <italic>Sox2</italic>, Olig2, and Foxg1 loci alongside some testing of different sized arms (we find that ~500bp is optimal for efficiency and costs of synthesis).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) A large number of stem and progenitor lines have been generated that would be of great value as a resource for the scientific community.
