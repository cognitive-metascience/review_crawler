We determined structures of full-length <italic>Manduca sexta</italic> sGC in both inactive and active states using cryo-electron microscopy. NO and the sGC-specific stimulator YC-1 induce a 71° rotation of the heme-binding β H-NOX and PAS domains. Repositioning of the β H-NOX domain leads to a straightening of the coiled-coil domains, which, in turn, use the motion to move the catalytic domains into an active conformation. YC-1 binds directly between the β H-NOX domain and the two CC domains. The structural elongation of the particle observed in cryo-EM was corroborated in solution using small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). These structures delineate the endpoints of the allosteric transition responsible for the major cyclic GMP-dependent physiological effects of NO.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.50634.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>In humans and other animals, as the heart pumps blood around the body, the blood exerts pressure on the walls of the blood vessels, much like water flowing through a hose. Our blood pressure naturally varies over the day, generally increasing when we are active and decreasing when we rest. However, if blood pressure remains high for extended periods of time it can lead to heart attacks, strokes and other serious health conditions.</p><p>In 2013, a new drug known as Adempas was approved to treat high blood pressure in the lungs. This drug helps a signaling molecule in the body called nitric oxide to activate an enzyme that widens blood vessels and in turn lower blood pressure. Previous studies have found that the enzyme – called soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) – contains several distinct domains and that nitric oxide binds to a domain known as β H-NOX. However, it was not clear how β H-NOX and the other three domains fit together to make the three-dimensional structure of the enzyme, or how nitric oxide and Adempas activate it.</p><p>To address this question, Horst, Yokom et al. used a technique called cryo-electron microscopy to determine the three-dimensional structures of the inactive and active forms of a soluble guanylate cyclase from a moth known as <italic>Manduca sexta</italic>. To produce the active form of the enzyme, soluble guanylate cyclase was incubated with both nitric oxide and a molecule called YC-1 that works in similar way to Adempas. The structures revealed that nitric oxide and YC-1 caused β H-NOX and another domain to rotate by 71. This in turn caused the remaining two domains – known as the coiled-coil domains – to change shape, and all of these movements together led to the activated enzyme. The structures also revealed that YC-1 bound to a site on the enzyme between β H-NOX and the coiled-coil domains.</p><p>Understanding how a drug for a particular condition works makes it much easier to develop new drugs that are more effective at treating the same condition or are tailored to treat other diseases. Therefore, these findings will allow pharmaceutical companies and other organizations to develop new drugs for high blood pressure and other cardiovascular diseases in a much more precise way.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>CryoEM</kwd><kwd>nitric oxide</kwd><kwd>cyclic GMP</kwd><kwd>manduca sexta</kwd><kwd>allostery</kwd><kwd>SAXS</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM127854</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Marletta</surname><given-names>Michael A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM066698</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Horst</surname><given-names>Benjamin G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM124169</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hammel</surname><given-names>Michal</given-names></name><name><surname>Rosenberg</surname><given-names>Daniel J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001033</institution-id><institution>Jane Coffin Childs Memorial Fund for Medical Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yokom</surname><given-names>Adam L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id><bold><italic>S10OD018483</italic></bold></award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hammel</surname><given-names>Michal</given-names></name><name><surname>Rosenberg</surname><given-names>Daniel J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The full-length structures of the mammalian nitric oxide receptor reveal the molecular activation steps and a binding site for the prototype of FDA-approved stimulators.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Nitric oxide (NO) is a critical primary signaling molecule in eukaryotic organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Palmer et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Moncada et al., 1991</xref>). Cells detect this diatomic gas through the NO receptor soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC), which is activated by NO to catalyze the cyclization of 5′-guanosine triphosphate (GTP) to 3′,5′-cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arnold et al., 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Stone and Marletta, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Russwurm and Koesling, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Derbyshire and Marletta, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Montfort et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Horst and Marletta, 2018</xref>). The NO signaling pathway, with sGC as a central component, plays crucial roles in the cardiovascular and neurological systems in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lucas et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Prast and Philippu, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Benarroch, 2011</xref>). Furthermore, aberrations in these signaling pathways can lead to pathologies that include various forms of hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and neurodegeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bredt, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Friebe and Koesling, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lundberg et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hervé et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wallace et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>sGC is a heterodimer composed of two subunits, denoted α and β, that are each composed of four domains: an N-terminal heme nitric oxide/oxygen (H-NOX) domain, a Per/Arnt/Sim (PAS)-like domain, a coiled-coil (CC) domain, and a catalytic (CAT) domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Derbyshire and Marletta, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Montfort et al., 2017</xref>). Although each subunit contains an H-NOX domain, only the β H-NOX domain binds a heme cofactor, with direct ligation occurring through a conserved histidine residue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zhao et al., 1998</xref>). The CC domains, together with the PAS domains, are thought to form a structured assembly upon dimerization of sGC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Campbell et al., 2014</xref>). The CAT domains form a wreath-like structure with the active site at the dimer interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Derbyshire and Marletta, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hurley, 1998</xref>).</p><p>Biochemical aspects of sGC activation by NO have been studied in great detail. Without a ligand bound to the β H-NOX domain, sGC has a low basal activity. A stoichiometric equivalent of NO relative to the sGC heterodimer results in the cleavage of the proximal histidine-iron bond and the formation of a distal five-coordinate ferrous nitrosyl enzyme with 15% of maximal activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Russwurm and Koesling, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cary et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fernhoff et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Herzik et al., 2014</xref>). This low-activity state of sGC will be referred to here as the 1-NO state; importantly, the <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> of the ferrous nitrosyl heme is 1.2 × 10<sup>–12</sup> M thus in this state NO remains bound to the heme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zhao et al., 1999</xref>). The activity of the 1-NO state can be increased to a maximally active state either by the addition of excess NO (xsNO), or by addition of small-molecule stimulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Stasch et al., 2011</xref>). The benzylindazole compound YC-1 was the first reported small-molecule sGC stimulator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ko et al., 1994</xref>). It was identified in a screen of compounds that inhibit platelet aggregation, one of the physiological responses of sGC activation. The molecular mechanisms by which NO and small molecule stimulator binding leads to enzyme activation remain unclear, despite the fact that the sGC-targeted drug Adempas discovered through a small molecule screen based on the YC-1 scaffold was approved by the FDA in 2013.</p><p>Visualization of the molecular steps in sGC activation has been a longstanding challenge. Crystal structures of individual truncated domains from various homologues of sGC have been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pellicena et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Purohit et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ma et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Winger et al., 2008</xref>). Additionally, structures of related heterodimeric and multidomain proteins have provided insight into the higher order connectivity of sGC. The heterodimeric catalytic domain from <italic>Homo sapiens</italic> was solved in an inactive conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allerston et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Seeger et al., 2014</xref>). Structures of membrane-bound adenylate cyclases have been solved that contain catalytic domains as well as portions of or the entire CC domains, helping to orient the C-terminal domains of sGC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Vercellino et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Qi et al., 2019</xref>). However, the precise quaternary structural arrangement of domains in the N-terminal portion of sGC is not known. Consequently, the mechanism by which NO and small-molecule stimulators couple binding through the protein for activation are poorly understood.</p><p>In the absence of a high-resolution full-length structure, previous work has used alternative methods in attempts to understand interdomain interactions and how small molecules activate sGC. Crosslinking experiments and negative stain electron microscopy support the hypothesis that sGC is a flexible dumbbell-shaped particle, in which the CC domains serve to connect the H-NOX and PAS domains on one end of the dumbbell to the CAT domain on the other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Campbell et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fritz et al., 2013</xref>). Hydrogen deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) has implicated the linker region between the PAS domains and the CC domains as critical in the activation mechanism, as both regions change in H/D exchange upon NO binding to sGC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Underbakke et al., 2014</xref>). Truncations of sGC have suggested that the β H-NOX domain directly inhibits the CAT domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Winger and Marletta, 2005</xref>). Point mutagenesis was used to identify several residues thought to transmit the ligand occupancy of the gas-binding H-NOX domain to the catalytic domains, including β D102 and β D106 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baskaran et al., 2011a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Underbakke et al., 2013</xref>). None of these methods, however, afford sufficient resolution to discern domain organization and interdomain communication for the full-length protein.</p><p>Here, we report the first full-length structures of sGC with and without activating ligands using cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) to 5.1 and 5.8 Å resolution, respectively. We find that sGC adopts two dramatically different conformations, revealing a large-scale global conformational change in response to NO and YC-1. Density consistent with YC-1 is observed in the active state map directly between the β H-NOX and both CC domains. We also show the functional relationship of NO binding to sGC on overall organization of sGC in solution by small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). By visualizing the quaternary structural changes that activate this NO receptor, we can now answer the long-standing question as to how the ligand binding in the regulatory domains of sGC is communicated to the catalytic domains.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Characterization and activity of full-length <italic>Manduca sexta</italic> sGC</title><p>We selected <italic>Manduca sexta</italic> (<italic>Ms</italic>) sGC as a biochemically tractable protein which has 36% and 59% sequence identity when compared to the human homolog for the α and β monomers, respectively.

In the inactive state, the αE, αF, and β2 secondary structural elements of the β H-NOX (82–126, green) form an extensive interface with the β PAS (270–275, red) and the α PAS-CC linker (400–419, blue) regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>). Overall, these interfaces are maintained in the active state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>), in spite of the straightening by the CC domains. Activation of sGC induces the formation of an interface between β CC (355-367) and β H-NOX (33-41) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>, purple). These residues on the β H-NOX comprise a loop located between helix αB and αC in the β H-NOX domain which was extended away from the CC in the inactive state. The large conformational change of the H-NOX/PAS bundle is necessary for the formation of the new interface in the active site, and thus this interaction could be critical for stabilizing the active sGC conformation.</p><p>In the active structure, the CCs undergo a significant conformational change and rotation relative to the CAT dimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>). The active state CC domains are completely extended (56 Å and 63 Å for αCC and βCC respectively in the inactive state, to 74 Å for both CC in the active state), as the bend present in the inactive state moves away from the CAT domains to be in line with the C-terminal portion of both CC domains. The CC conformational change upon activation twists the CC interface such that the β CC helix rotates relative to the α CC by 72 degrees (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>). The dramatic rearrangements of the H-NOX/PAS bundle leads to unbending of the CC domains, a change in their orientations as they project from the regulatory lobe, and finally to opening of the nucleotide-binding pocket (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e</xref>). Alignment to the α CAT domain shows a clear rotation of the β CAT domain away from α CAT domain by 40° (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e</xref>, left). This rotation entails the pinching together of the base of the CC domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e</xref>, middle). In combination, these motions open the GTP-binding pocket by moving the β CAT active site helix (535-545) away from the α CAT domain and into an active conformation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>SAXS shows a distribution of inactive and active states in solution</title><p>Small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) was used to interrogate conformational changes with and without NO in solution.

A minimal ensemble search was performed over thousands of sGC conformations and corresponding scattering curves were calculated and compared to the experimental data. The result of this minimal ensemble search confirmed the presence of a single sGC conformation while in an inactive state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>), which overlays with the inactive structure with an RMSD of 2.0 Å.

However, the remainder of the sample (28%) is consistent with a more elongated conformation, one that is in between the inactive and active state obtained by cryo-EM. The Cα RMSD of the partially active SAXS model and the active state cryo-EM model is 13.5 Å. This analysis shows that sGC adopts a mixture of inactive and active conformations in the 1-NO state, suggesting that NO binding at the heme establishes an equilibrium between these two conformational extremes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The structures of the inactive and active states of full-length sGC provide detailed insight into the molecular mechanism of activation of <italic>Ms</italic> sGC. The most unexpected feature of the inactive state of the enzyme are the bends in the CC domains. Straightening of the bent CCs is the clearest structural link between the regulatory and catalytic lobes during activation. Previous HDX-MS data showed a differential exchange pattern for the CC domains, where the N-terminal portion of the α CC and the C-terminal portion of the β CC increase in H/D exchange upon NO binding, while the C-terminal portion of the α CC and the N-terminal portion of the β CC decrease in H/D exchange (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s7">Figure 3—figure supplement 7</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Underbakke et al., 2014</xref>). The changes seen in HDX in the CCs near the bend are thus consistent with the large-scale rearrangements of the CCs that we have now observed in the cryo-EM. Furthermore, the bent portion of the CC domain is highly conserved among sGC homologues, consistent with its centrality to allosteric communication.</p><p>The C-terminal portions of the CC domains undergo a 72° twist and contain a motif known as the signaling helix (or S-helix) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anantharaman et al., 2006</xref>). Similar to sGC, proteins with this motif contain both receptor and output domains that are connected by dimeric coiled-coils. The inactive and active sGC structures are the first full-length enzyme with a S-helix motif to be characterized. This motif aligns with C-terminal part of the CC domain, part of the 72° twist described above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s10">Figure 2—figure supplement 10</xref>). It is possible that the twisting motion of these domains is a more general mechanism of activation for proteins with S-helices.</p><p>In transitioning between the inactive and active states, the H-NOX/PAS bundle rotates 71° in order for β H-NOX residues 33–41 to form an interface with residues β 355–367 of the β CC domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>, purple). The αH helix of the β H-NOX domain contains the proximal histidine that binds to the heme cofactor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zhao et al., 1998</xref>). Crystal structures of bacterial H-NOX domains with and without NO show a rotation in the αF helix of the β H-NOX. However, in our full-length structures, the αF of the β H-NOX retains its interface with the β PAS and the α CC domain in both states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b and c</xref>). More strikingly, binding of YC-1 at a site bridging the β H-NOX and CC domain highlights how stabilization of this contact drives CC unbending (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>). This interface corroborates specific point mutations known to decrease activity of the full-length protein; specifically, single point mutants of β I41E in the β H-NOX domain retain basal activity but are only minimally activate with excess NO, implying that these sGC variants are catalytically competent but not as sensitive to stimulation as the wildtype enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Underbakke et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baskaran et al., 2011b</xref>). The structural finding that residue Ile41 of the β H-NOX form contacts with the unbent β CC that are specific for the active conformation explains these phenotypes. Destabilizing these contacts by mutating Ile41 thus blocks this interface and prevents sGC from reaching the active conformation. While this paper was under review, a cryo-EM map of activated <italic>H. sapiens</italic> sGC was reported, where the activation was achieved by using xsNO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kang et al., 2019</xref>). This xsNO map and the xsNO + YC-1 map reported here overlay well, except for the proposed density for YC-1. This lends support to our assignment of the YC-1 binding site at the β H-NOX- β CC interface. These insights suggest that the β H-NOX- β CC contact may be the most critical allosteric switch in the regulatory lobe of sGC.</p><p>While conformational changes are readily observed by comparing the two cryo-EM structures, the SAXS implies that the 1-NO state can sample similar conformations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>). Although only a fraction of the population exhibits an extension, inspection of the Soret to protein UV-visible absorption indicates that the protein is in the 1-NO state. These data support the hypothesis that when the first NO binds to the heme of the β H-NOX, sGC adopts an equilibrium between the inactive and a partially extended conformation, with a <italic>K</italic><sub>eq</sub> = [active]/[inactive] = [0.72]/[0.28]=0.39. This is corroborated by the activity data from the 1-NO state, which exhibits 15% of the maximal activity. The conformational heterogeneity observed in SAXS analysis could represent the physiological state of sGC at basal cellular conditions.</p><p>In the absence of increased NO concentrations, sGC stimulators can maximally activate cGMP production and are now used to treat forms of pulmonary hypertension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Koglin et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Follmann et al., 2013</xref>). YC-1 was present in the sample used to generate the active state reconstruction of <italic>Ms</italic> sGC, and extra density is seen near the new β H-NOX: β CC interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>). Distinct changes in both resonance Raman and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy signatures for heme ligands have been detected with both YC-1 and BAY 41–2272 supporting this proposed binding site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Derbyshire, 2008</xref>). Previously, a stimulator binding site was proposed between helices αA and αD in the β H-NOX domain based on cross linking and NMR data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wales et al., 2018</xref>). However, there is no density for YC-1 present in the active state reconstruction between αA and αD helices. We note that our study used YC-1 compared to IWP-854, IWP-051 and BAY 41–2272 previously used, which could explain the difference in binding sites. Visualization of YC-1 bound to sGC is an important development as a proof of concept that small molecule sGC stimulators can now be characterized structurally.</p><p>Adenylyl cyclases (AC) catalyze a similar reaction mechanism as sGC. Mammalian membrane-associated ACs contain two catalytic domains which form the intrapolypeptide equivalent of a heterodimer. The catalytic domains in active mammalian AC heterodimer rotate by 7° with respect to an inactive homodimeric counterpart bound to two molecules of forskolin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zhang et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tesmer et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hurley, 1999</xref>). We observe a rotation of the sGC CAT domains about the same axis, although the magnitude is larger for sGC, at 40°. A full-length membrane bound AC (AC-9) was recently solved in the active nucleotide-bound state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Qi et al., 2019</xref>). The CC domains between the full-length active sGC and AC9 structures overlay well, consistent with a common active geometry for GCs and ACs. The AC9 has a very different angle between the CC and CAT domains. The rotation of the sGC regulatory lobe is sterically incompatible with the presence of a membrane, thus by their different natures as soluble and membrane-associated enzymes, sGC and ACs must differ in the detailed modes of allosteric communication.</p><p>To date, a detailed understanding of sGC activation has been hampered by the lack of full-length structures. The inactive and active structures in tandem with established studies lead to formation of new hypotheses for the activation of sGC. First, activity assays with sGC truncations suggested that direct interaction of the β H-NOX domain and the CAT dimer was responsible for sGC inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Winger and Marletta, 2005</xref>). However, the structural data shows no direct interaction between the β H-NOX and the CAT domain in either conformation. Instead, the formation of the new β H-NOX/β CC interface in the active state stimulates the active CAT conformation. Activation leads to a global conformational rearrangement of the heterodimer, elongating the structure; however, only a single equivalent of NO is required to cleave the bond between the heme Fe center and the ligating histidine residue. Maximal activation of sGC involves either the binding of a second NO molecule to a non-heme site on sGC or a small molecule stimulator stabilizing the active state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Guo et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Horst and Marletta, 2018</xref>).</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> depicts the proposed physiological activation sequence of sGC, where unliganded sGC adopts a more compact conformation with bent CC domains. Upon NO binding to the heme, an equilibrium of conformational states is established, with the partially elongated state affording about 15% of the maximal activity. Given the very tight association between NO and the heme, this represents the basal cellular activity. Finally, in the presence of either an increase in NO concentration or sGC stimulating molecules, the completely extended, fully active state is reached and sGC reaches maximal catalytic activity. Using these structures as a starting point, new avenues of exploration can now be undertaken, to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of excess NO activation. Critical residues for interdomain interactions along with the proposed stimulator binding site can be characterized in more detail. Having resolved the two structural states of an important therapeutic target, the structures of sGC will influence rational design of improved drugs for diseases associated with NO signaling impairment.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.50634.040</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Model for conformational rearrangement upon sGC activation.</title><p>Schematic of the sGC activation pathway. sGC adopts a bent CC conformation after formation of the holoenzyme.

Clear density for heme in the β H-NOX domain enabled clear distinction of the two H-NOX domains. Linkers between the H-NOX and PAS domains are missing in the density, likely due to flexibility, and were left out of the model (α 238–278 and β184–206). Initial placement of the CAT dimer was based on a significant extension in the sequence of the α CAT C-terminus, which is visible as unmodeled density. Continuous density from the CAT dimer enabled assignment of the CC and PAS domains. The linker region between the PAS domains and the CC were manually modeled in COOT based on secondary structure predictions from PSIPRED (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Emsley et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Vynne, 1997</xref>).

The activated sample was prepared with 500 µM NO (from DEA NONOate). The samples were sealed and run within 3 hr of being prepared; samples did not undergo freeze–thaw after the sample was prepared (the protein was freeze–thawed once after purification for initial storage).</p><p>In situ sample purification was accomplished through SEC to isolate well-folded proteins from aggregates and other impurities immediately before exposure to synchrotron X-ray radiation using a custom designed flow cell. SEC-SAXS was collected at the SIBYLS beamline (bl12.3.1) at the Advanced Light Source at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, California (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Classen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Classen et al., 2013</xref>). X-ray wavelength was set at λ = 1.127 Å and the sample-to-detector distance was 2105 mm, as determined by silver behenate calibration, resulting in scattering vectors, q, ranging from 0.01 Å<sup>–1</sup> to 0.4 Å<sup>–1</sup>. The scattering vector is defined as q = 4πsinθ/λ, where 2θ is the scattering angle. Data was collected using a Dectris PILATUS3 × 2M detector at 20°C and processed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dyer et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hura et al., 2009</xref>). Briefly, a custom-made SAXS flow cell was directly coupled with an Agilent 1260 Infinity HPLC system using a Shodex KW-803 column. The column was equilibrated with running Buffer E with a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min for inactive sGC and 0.55 mL/min for activated sGC. To achieve activation conditions, the buffer was continuously sparged with nitrogen gas and the column was equilibrated for at least 2 hr to maintain an anaerobic environment. Several NONOates with various half-lives were added to the running buffer to achieve activation of sGC. These NONOates include DEA NONOate and DETA NONOate, which spontaneously release NO with half-lives of 16 min and 56 hr, respectively. Each sample was run through the SEC-SAXS system and 3 s X-ray exposures were collected continuously over the 30 min elution. The SAXS frames recorded prior to the protein elution peak were used to correct all other frames. The corrected frames were investigated by radius of gyration R<sub>g</sub> derived by the Guinier approximation I(q)=I(0) exp(–q<sup>2</sup>R<sub>g</sub><sup>2</sup>/3) with the limits q*R<sub>g</sub> &lt;1.3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). The elution peak was mapped by comparing the integral of ratios to background and R<sub>g</sub> relative to the recorded frame using the program SCÅTTER (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>The frames in the regions of least R<sub>g</sub> variation were averaged and merged in SCÅTTER to produce the highest signal-to-noise SAXS curves. These merged SAXS curves were used to generate the Guinier plots, volumes-of-correlation (V<sub>c</sub>), pair distribution functions, P(r), and normalized Kratky plots. The Guinier plot indicated an aggregation-free state of the protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). The P(r) function was used to determine the maximal dimension of the macromolecule (D<sub>max</sub>) and estimate inter-domain distances (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Putnam et al., 2007</xref>). P(r) functions were normalized based on the molecular weight (MW) of the assemblies, as determined by the calculated V<sub>c</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rambo and Tainer, 2013</xref>).</p><p>Eluent was subsequently split (4 to 1) between the SAXS line and a multiple wavelength detector (UV-vis), set to 432 and 280 nm, multi-angle light scattering (MALS), and refractometer. The ratios of the protein (280 nm) and Soret band (432 nm) of the heme from SEC were used to evaluate the ligation state of <italic>Ms</italic> sGC upon NO binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). MALS experiments were performed using an 18-angle DAWN HELEOS II light scattering detector connected in tandem to an Optilab refractive index concentration detector (Wyatt Technology). System normalization and calibration was performed with bovine serum albumin using a 60 μL sample at 10 mg/mL in the same SEC running buffer and a dn/dc value of 0.185 and 0.15 mL/g for inactive and active sGC respectively. The MALS data was used to compliment the MWs calculated by the SAXS analysis and, being furthest downstream, the MALS peaks were used to align the SAXS and UV-vis peaks along the x-axis (elution volume in mL/min) to compensate for fluctuations in timing and band broadening (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). UV–vis data was integrated using Agilent Chemstation software and baseline corrected using Origin 9.1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). MALS and differential refractive index data was analyzed using Wyatt Astra seven software to monitor the homogeneity of the sample molecular weights across the elution peak, complementing the SEC-SAXS signal validation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Solution structure modeling</title><p>The cryo-EM refined crystal structure for inactive sGC was used to build an initial atomistic model; all missing loops and terminal residues were added using MODELLER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fiser et al., 2000</xref>).

To obtain an inactive state model, the α H-NOX domain and both α terminal tails were moved, then all α and β domains were moved by allowing flexibility at the hinge region where the CCs meet the CAT domains, while holding the CAT domains fixed and still permitting flexibility of the terminal tails. This was then used to generate the 1-NO state model by moving the same regions as the inactive state in reverse order.

accompanying author responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Allosteric activation of the nitric oxide receptor soluble guanylate cyclase mapped by cryo-electron microscopy&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Wilfred van der Donk as Reviewing Editor and Philip Cole as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Andrea Mattevi (Reviewer #1); Annie Beuve (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This study presents two cryo-EM structures of the soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC), the primary receptor of nitric oxide in mammals. The authors report the inactive structure in the absence of nitric oxide, and an active structure in the presence of nitric oxide and a stimulating molecule YC-1. The data address a long-standing question in the field of NO-sGC signaling related to how the NO signal propagates from the heme receptor domain to the effector catalytic domain. The findings in this work are of high (patho)physiological importance as sGC is a key target for cardiovascular diseases.</p><p>Determination of the molecular mechanism of activation has been impaired by the lack of a full-length structure of this heterodimeric enzyme formed by two subunits, each containing 4 domains (HNOX, PAS, coiled-coil, catalytic). The current work provides the basal enzyme structure at 5.8 Å and the activated enzyme at 5.1 Å resolution. The analysis relies on a single 3D class arising from less than 6% of the total particles that were identified on the grid, corresponding to 25000-40000 particles effectively used for the density reconstruction. As a consequence, the maps are only at medium resolution, but the conformational changes are large and hence readily and convincingly identified. The authors are careful not to overinterpret their data as the authors limit their interpretation to the existence of multiple conformations in the partly activated enzyme.</p><p>Upon activation, a helical connecting domain straightens to trigger large rotations of the heme-binding domain and PAS domains that lead to the opening of the active site in the catalytic domain. The enzyme thereby acquires the ability to bind GTP. This suggests a new paradigm of activation not only for sGC but also for S-helix containing proteins. A potential site for the stimulator YC-1 is also identified, and the findings rebut some long-established beliefs in the molecular mechanism of activation of sGC. Thus, this work will provide invaluable resources for many groups and indicate routes to pursue in future research.</p><p>Although the reviewers are generally enthusiastic about the findings and their publication in <italic>eLife</italic>, some concerns and questions were raised that the authors should address prior to publication:</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors should provide more details about the cryo-EM data processing procedures. Were other classes identified? Were the rejected particles (&gt;90% of the total) really inconclusive and uninformative? What was the issue? Disorder? Multiple conformations? Are they due to too inclusive particle picking, damaged particles at the air water interface or conformational variability? Considering that this manuscript describes an allosteric mechanism, it is critical that the cryo-EM data processing workflow is better described, and if necessary re-processed, to quantitatively assess the heterogeneity in each dataset to support the proposed model where inactive state protein is predominantly in one conformation, YC-1- and NO-bound protein is in predominantly in a second active state conformation, and stochiometric NO-bound protein is fluctuating between those two states.</p><p>2) The activated state has been obtained with a combination of nitric oxide and a stimulating agent YC-1. It is therefore not possible to delineate the role of each in the conformational change observed. The small angle X-ray scattering data presented addresses this issue by comparing scatterings of the enzyme in an inactive state and a state activated by nitric oxide only and seem to support a model where the enzyme fluctuates between inactive and active conformations in the presence of nitric oxide and where YC-1 stabilizes the active conformation further, but the experiment is missing an important control, which is scattering data from the same conditions as the active cryo-EM structure. While obtaining cryo-EM data from a sample activated by NO only and SAXS data for a sample activated by NO and YC-1 would greatly strengthen the manuscript and appear very feasible given the data presented, it is understood that, if sample or instrument availability are limiting, collecting such additional data may be outside the scope of a revision. If the collection of such data was attempted but unsuccessful, it should be noted in the manuscript.</p><p>3) Along similar lines, conformational variability should be assessed and described in detail. Can enzyme fluctuating between inactive and active states still be observed by SAXS in the presence of YC-1?</p><p>4) The figures are generally rather small and sometimes not very clear. For instance, in the last paragraph ofsubsection “Inactive conformation of sGC exhibits bent coiled-coils”, Figure 2E is very unclear and needs to show density to support the statement. In the third paragraph of the subsection “Activated sGC extends the regulatory lobe from catalytic core”, comparison is made between two different figures. It would help to show this in a single figure.</p><p>5) The purification of <italic>Ms</italic> sGC-Histag is done by infection of Sf9 insect cells and one of the steps involves elution through a talon column. Although all the data presented in the manuscript (NO-stimulated activity, UV absorbance, heme density in the cryo-EM) suggest heme is present, there is concern that a significant percentage of the purified sGC could be in an apo-form, which would affect some experimental outcomes. Sf9 cells are usually very poor at synthesizing heme and elution of a talon column with 150 mM imidazole could affect the heme (His-bound) of sGC. Maybe the culture or the purified samples were complemented by excess hemin or 5-ALA but this is not mentioned in the Materials and methods. The authors should clarify heme content and the methods used (if any) to ensure maximal heme content. In addition, the heme density is not properly shown in the figure, which should be corrected.</p><p>6) The authors need to add text to describe more extensively the YC-1 activator. How was it identified? Affinity? Biological activity? Since an YC-1 analog (riociguat) is a new treatment for pulmonary arterial hypertension, this will be valuable for readers. In addition, a very recent structure of inactivated and NO-bound activated sGC was just published online. The authors of the current work should emphasize the YC-1 angle, with a particular emphasis on its role in the observed allosteric activation, since the online report does not contain such a stimulating agent. The authors of the current work are highly qualified to draw conclusions and interpretations from comparing their structures with YC-1 (even at a lesser resolution) to the newly published structures because of their expertise in sGC mechanisms of activation.</p><p>7) The authors have been careful to not over-interpret their data given the limited resolution of their study and the absence of critical controls. Still, these caveats should be discussed thoroughly in the manuscript.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.50634.055</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors should provide more details about the cryo-EM data processing procedures.

Many of the initial particles picked in both data sets were ‘false’ particles of background or broken sGC complexes. The first paragraph of the subsection “Inactive conformation of sGC exhibits bent coiled-coils” and the first paragraph of the subsection “Activated sGC extends the regulatory lobe from catalytic core” are clarified stating the 2D averages were cleaned of poor particles. Additionally, a detailed description is included in the Materials and methods (subsection “Cryo-EM Data Processing”). To further clarify our workflow, the supplementary figures for the processing schemes have been expanded to show an initial round of 2D class averages for both Inactive (Figure 2—figure supplement 3) and Active (Figure 3—figure supplement 3) which show partial complexes.</p><p>We tested many processing schemes to determine that only a single conformation was present in each dataset (data not shown). To highlight this, in the Materials and methods we have added “Of note, both Inactive and Active datasets underwent exhaustive processing schemes, including Bayesian polishing, multibody refinement and focused classification, none of which improved the resolution or showed evidence of multiple conformations in a single dataset.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The activated state has been obtained with a combination of nitric oxide and a stimulating agent YC-1. It is therefore not possible to delineate the role of each in the conformational change observed. The small angle X-ray scattering data presented addresses this issue by comparing scatterings of the enzyme in an inactive state and a state activated by nitric oxide only and seem to support a model where the enzyme fluctuates between inactive and active conformations in the presence of nitric oxide and where YC-1 stabilizes the active conformation further, but the experiment is missing an important control, which is scattering data from the same conditions as the active cryo-EM structure. While obtaining cryo-EM data from a sample activated by NO only and SAXS data for a sample activated by NO and YC-1 would greatly strengthen the manuscript and appear very feasible given the data presented, it is understood that, if sample or instrument availability are limiting, collecting such additional data may be outside the scope of a revision. If the collection of such data was attempted but unsuccessful, it should be noted in the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that SAXS data with NO and YC-1 would be an excellent addition to the manuscript. Unfortunately, preliminary SAXS data collected with <italic>Ms</italic> sGC + YC-1 and <italic>Ms</italic> sGC + NO + YC-1 indicated that YC-1 is not soluble enough to collect scattering data, and thus a full experiment was not attempted as SAXS is costly in terms of protein required. Even compounds that are further along in their development to riociguat (e.g. BAY 41-2272) are not soluble enough for these experiments. The introductory sentence to the subsection “SAXS shows a distribution of inactive and active states in solution” has been modified to explain why this control is not present.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Along similar lines, conformational variability should be assessed and described in detail. Can enzyme fluctuating between inactive and active states still be observed by SAXS in the presence of YC-1?</p></disp-quote><p>Please see the response to the previous comment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The figures are generally rather small and sometimes not very clear. For instance, in the last paragraph of subsection “Inactive conformation of sGC exhibits bent coiled-coils”, Figure 2E is very unclear and needs to show density to support the statement. In the third paragraph of the subsection “Activated sGC extends the regulatory lobe from catalytic core”, comparison is made between two different figures. It would help to show this in a single figure.</p></disp-quote><p>The comparison between Figure 2D and Figure 3D has been removed for clarity. We feature the comparison between the two structures in Figure 4. Specifically, Figure 4D shows the coiled-coil domains in the inactive and active state.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The purification of Ms sGC-Histag is done by infection of Sf9 insect cells and one of the steps involves elution through a talon column. Although all the data presented in the manuscript (NO-stimulated activity, UV absorbance, heme density in the cryo-EM) suggest heme is present, there is concern that a significant percentage of the purified sGC could be in an apo-form, which would affect some experimental outcomes. Sf9 cells are usually very poor at synthesizing heme and elution of a talon column with 150 mM imidazole could affect the heme (His-bound) of sGC. Maybe the culture or the purified samples were complemented by excess hemin or 5-ALA but this is not mentioned in the Materials and methods. The authors should clarify heme content and the methods used (if any) to ensure maximal heme content. In addition, the heme density is not properly shown in the figure, which should be corrected.</p></disp-quote><p>While the presence of apo sGC in our preparations is a constant concern for us, the final purified fraction of <italic>Ms</italic> sGC is primarily if not exclusively in the holo from. We know this for several reasons: firstly, in the anion exchange step of our purification (after the IMAC TALON column), apo sGC elutes after the holo enzyme and those fractions are not carried forward in the prep. Also, based on extinction coefficients for full-length sGC purified from bovine lung (Stone and Marletta, 1994) and studies with stand-alone HNOX proteins from bacteria, the ratio of the absorption of the heme Soret band to the absorption of the protein is as expected (for <italic>Ms</italic> sGC, a ratio of 0.8 is expected for 434 nm / 280 nm). For these reasons, as well as the data the reviewer mentions, we are confident in the quality of the preparations of <italic>Ms</italic> sGC.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The authors need to add text to describe more extensively the YC-1 activator. How was it identified? Affinity? Biological activity? Since an YC-1 analog (riociguat) is a new treatment for pulmonary arterial hypertension, this will be valuable for readers. In addition, a very recent structure of inactivated and NO-bound activated sGC was just published online. The authors of the current work should emphasize the YC-1 angle, with a particular emphasis on its role in the observed allosteric activation, since the online report does not contain such a stimulating agent. The authors of the current work are highly qualified to draw conclusions and interpretations from comparing their structures with YC-1 (even at a lesser resolution) to the newly published structures because of their expertise in sGC mechanisms of activation.</p></disp-quote><p>Two sentences more clearly introducing YC-1 have been included in the third paragraph of the Introduction. We have added three sentences to the third paragraph of the Discussion comparing the xsNO + YC-1 map to the newly published xsNO only map, emphasizing the similarity in map in all regards except for the density we assign to YC-1. While we agree that the potential location of the binding pocket of sGC stimulators is an exciting finding, we feel it would be misleading to highlight the YC-1 in our paper more than this addition and our analysis, given the resolution of our map.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The authors have been careful to not over-interpret their data given the limited resolution of their study and the absence of critical controls. Still, these caveats should be discussed thoroughly in the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their acknowledgement that we have been careful not to over-interpret our data. We hope that our additions discussing our attempts to improve the resolution, the limited solubility of sGC stimulators, and the comparison with the new higher resolution structure will satisfy the reviewers concerns for the discussion of these caveats.</p></body></sub-article></article>
