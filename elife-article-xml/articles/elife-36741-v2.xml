An open question is whether the living communities housed in pitchers also converge in structure or function. Using samples from more than 330 field-collected pitchers of eight species of Southeast Asian <italic>Nepenthes</italic> and six species of North American <italic>Sarracenia</italic>, we demonstrate that the pitcher microcosms, or miniature ecosystems with complex communities, are strikingly similar. Compared to communities from surrounding habitats, pitcher communities house fewer species. While communities associated with the two genera contain different microbial organisms and arthropods, the species are predominantly from the same phylogenetic clades. Microbiomes from both genera are enriched in degradation pathways and have high abundances of key degradation enzymes. Moreover, in a manipulative field experiment, <italic>Nepenthes</italic> pitchers placed in a North American bog assembled <italic>Sarracenia</italic>-like communities. An understanding of the convergent interactions in pitcher microcosms facilitates identification of selective pressures shaping the communities.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36741.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The ecosystems found across the Earth, including in forests, lakes and prairies, consist of communities of plants, animals and microbes. How these organisms interact with each other determines which ones grow and thrive. We still do not understand how communities form: why different species exist where they do, and what enables them to survive in different locations. This knowledge is particularly limited with regard to communities of microbes because they are hard to see and count.</p><p>Pitcher plants are an ideal system for studying how communities and ecosystems assemble. The pitcher-shaped leaves of these plants each contain small aquatic communities of microbes and arthropods (including insects and mites) that can be relatively easily studied. Because unrelated groups of plants have evolved pitchers at different times and on different continents, these communities can also be used to explore how evolutionary history and the current environment determine which species thrive in a particular location.</p><p>Bittleston et al. sampled the DNA of the communities living within 330 pitchers from various North American and Southeast Asian pitcher plant species. This revealed that very distantly related plants on opposite sides of the planet have pitchers that host similar communities, with the organisms found in one pitcher plant often closely related to the organisms found in others. The genes within the community’s DNA also shared many functions, with the majority of shared genes devoted to digesting captured insect prey. Bittleston et al. also relocated pitcher plants from Southeast Asia to grow alongside North American species and found the same microbes and arthropods colonizing both groups, indicating that the different types of pitchers present a similar habitat.</p><p>Overall, the results of the experiments performed by Bittleston et al. suggest that certain kinds of interactions between species (such as between the pitcher plants and their microbes) can evolve independently in different parts of the world. Researchers can use these interactions to learn more about how communities and ecosystems form. With a greater understanding of the Earth’s ecosystems, it will be easier to protect them and predict how they will fare as global conditions change.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>microbial ecology</kwd><kwd>Nepenthes</kwd><kwd>Sarracenia</kwd><kwd>communities</kwd><kwd>species interactions</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NSF Graduate Fellowship and Doctoral Dissertation Improvement Grant DEB-1400982</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bittleston</surname><given-names>Leonora S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000925</institution-id><institution>John Templeton Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Foundational Questions In Evolutionary Biology</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pierce</surname><given-names>Naomi E</given-names></name><name><surname>Pringle</surname><given-names>Anne</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Harvard University Museum of Comparative Zoology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Putnam Expedition Grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bittleston</surname><given-names>Leonora S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006363</institution-id><institution>National Geographic Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pierce</surname><given-names>Naomi E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004386</institution-id><institution>Universiti Malaya</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>High Impact Research Grant, UM-MOHE HIR Grant UM.C/625/1/HIR/MOHE/CHAN/14/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chan</surname><given-names>Kok Gan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SES-0750480</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pierce</surname><given-names>Naomi E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004386</institution-id><institution>Universiti Malaya</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>High Impact Research Grant, H-50001-A000027</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chan</surname><given-names>Kok Gan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004386</institution-id><institution>Universiti Malaya</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>High Impact Research Grant, A-000001-50001</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chan</surname><given-names>Kok Gan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Host characteristics drive the assembly of similar communities within the convergently evolved and geographically distant pitcher ecosystems of carnivorous pitcher plants.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Similar selective pressures in geographically distant habitats can cause unrelated organisms to converge in both morphological and functional traits. Pitchers of carnivorous plants have evolved repeatedly and independently to have the same shapes and insect-trapping functions in Southeast Asia, North America, and Australia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Albert et al., 1992</xref>). Similar selective pressures can also cause the independent emergence of multispecies interactions with parallel physiological or ecological functions, defined as ‘convergent interactions’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bittleston et al., 2016b</xref>). The concept of convergent interactions was developed in detail in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bittleston et al. (2016b)</xref>, and can be used as a tool to better understand forces influencing interspecific relationships. Here, we investigate whether convergent interactions can be identified between different, independently evolved pitcher plant genera and the arthropods and microbes housed within their pitchers. We hypothesize that the microbial communities formed within the fluids of distantly-related pitcher plant species possess similar community structures and functions, and we test this hypothesis by comparing the bacterial and eukaryotic communities living within the plant-held waters (phytotelmata) of pitcher plants from two genera in different plant orders, <italic>Nepenthes</italic> (family Nepenthaceae, order Caryophyllales) native to Southeast Asia and <italic>Sarracenia</italic> (family Sarraceniaceae, order Ericales) native to North America.</p><p>Microbial communities are complex, and even apparently simple habitats house orders of magnitude more microbial species than plant or animal species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Horner-Devine et al., 2004</xref>). Parsing the principles shaping microbial community structure and function remains a challenge. But virtually all plants and animals interact with microbes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">van der Heijden et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">McFall-Ngai et al., 2013</xref>), and host morphology and ecology are likely to shape associated microbial communities. Convergent plant or animal forms, chemistry, or habitats may control the communities within them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bittleston et al., 2016b</xref>), analogous to a kind of ‘extended phenotype.’ Convergently evolved organisms are ideal systems for understanding how different aspects of form or ecology influence microbial communities because they enable distinctions among the effects of evolutionary history, geography, and host morphology or physiology.</p><p>A nascent understanding of how microbial communities assemble in association with highly specialized, convergently evolved hosts is emerging. Interactions between animals and their gut microbiomes are frequently mediated by diet. For example, animals with fermenting foreguts as distantly related as the hoatzin bird and cow are colonized by microbial communities with similar structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Godoy-Vitorino et al., 2012</xref>), and the gut bacteria of disparate animals whose diets consist of ants also possess a convergent community composition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Delsuc et al., 2014</xref>). In turn, the herbivorous, arboreal ants of different taxonomic groups are associated with specific bacteria likely to supplement their low-nitrogen diets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sanders et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hu et al., 2018</xref>). And convergent shifts in bacterial communities are observed in different cichlid fishes as diets change from herbivory to carnivory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Baldo et al., 2017</xref>). Similar convergent dynamics are observed in sea urchin larvae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Carrier and Reitzel, 2018</xref>). Animals' microbial associates are likely to impact fitness. The pitchers of carnivorous pitcher plants are the plant analog of an animal gut, and may function in digestion of animal prey. Convergently evolved genera of pitcher plants provide a tractable model and opportunity to explore the assembly and functional potentials of host-associated microbial communities.</p><p>In fact, pitcher microcosms have long served as elegant models for investigating metacommunities and community assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kneitel and Miller, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Buckley et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Srivastava et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Armitage, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Bittleston, 2018</xref>); each pitcher pool is a discrete but similar habitat with a unique history. In our study, we take advantage of the pitcher system to focus primarily on comparisons of the communities of convergently evolved plants, testing how unrelated hosts with similar morphologies and functions shape their associated communities. Implicit within our comparisons are myriad community assembly mechanisms and processes, including dispersal and environmental filtering caused by characteristics of the host.</p><p>Two genera of carnivorous pitcher plants, <italic>Sarracenia</italic> and <italic>Nepenthes</italic>, evolved independently in North America and Southeast Asia, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Albert et al., 1992</xref>). Pitchers are highly modified leaves, and both genera grow pitchers to attract, trap, and digest insects—primarily ants. Pitcher microcosms also house communities of bacteria, fungi, protozoa, and arthropods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Beaver, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Bradshaw and Creelman, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kitching, 2000</xref>). Pitchers of both genera have characteristic shapes, although forms can vary greatly in color and size among different species. Pitchers of both genera also offer extra-floral nectar to attract prey, possess slippery interiors to trap prey, and secrete digestive enzymes to break down prey tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Juniper et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adlassnig et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kurup et al., 2013</xref>). <italic>Nepenthes</italic> species produce more different kinds, and a greater abundance, of enzymes compared to <italic>Sarracenia</italic> species, and <italic>Sarracenia</italic> species may rely more on their bacterial communities for prey degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Butler et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Moran and Clarke, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Baiser et al., 2011</xref>). Pitchers actively absorb nitrogen, phosphorus, and other elements from prey; these nutrients are otherwise scarce in the soils where the plants grow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Chapin and Pastor, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Schulze et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ellison, 2006</xref>). While the plants are perennial, individual pitchers can last from a few weeks to two years, depending on the species, and are generally most active for the first few weeks to months after opening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Heard, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Osunkoya et al., 2008</xref>). Pitcher interiors appear to be sterile before opening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Peterson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Buch et al., 2013</xref>) (but see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Chou et al., 2014</xref>]), and once open, a complex community forms within (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Beaver, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kitching, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Koopman et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Krieger and Kourtev, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Chan et al., 2016</xref>). Many pitcher-associated organisms are specialists, and are restricted to the pitcher habitat for at least part of their lives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Fish and Hall, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Beaver, 1983</xref>). Various arthropods have co-diversified with their pitcher plant host, suggesting ecological dependence and a shared evolutionary history (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Satler and Carstens, 2016</xref>). In fact, even though the species <italic>S. purpurea</italic> was introduced to Europe over 100 years ago, it houses very few insect inquilines as compared with pitchers in native habitats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zander et al., 2016</xref>); the close associations of pitchers and arthropods may be slow to evolve.</p><p>To test for convergence between the microcosms of North American <italic>Sarracenia</italic> and Southeast Asian <italic>Nepenthes</italic>, we collected fluids from over 330 pitchers of six species of <italic>Sarracenia</italic> and eight species of <italic>Nepenthes</italic> from native habitats in the United States, Singapore, and Borneo (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> Table S1), and used next generation sequencing to characterize the biodiversity housed in each pitcher. To the best of our knowledge, ours are the first comparisons of the entire communities, encompassing bacteria, microbial eukaryotes, and arthropods, associated with convergently evolved organisms; our sampling is also more intensive than any sampling previously published for pitcher plants. We tested for convergence between communities by comparing species richness, community composition, phylogenetic structure, and functional potential. We hypothesized the living communities housed in unrelated pitchers would converge, both structurally and functionally: tests of the hypothesis would result in similar species richness, phylogenetic structure, and functional potential between the <italic>Sarracenia</italic> and <italic>Nepenthes</italic>, as compared to the same parameters measured from surrounding bog water and soil communities. In addition to describing the bacterial and eukaryotic communities of each of the 14 different species of pitcher plants, we explored which features of host species appear to drive patterns of biodiversity. Finally, in a field manipulation, we experimentally tested whether North American insects and microbes would colonize Southeast Asian <italic>Nepenthes</italic> pitchers when <italic>Nepenthes</italic> plants were placed in a North American <italic>Sarracenia</italic> habitat; the experiment tests whether the pitchers of different genera function as similar selective environments when exposed to the same microbial pool. In the aggregate, data provide evidence for the convergence of pitcher microcosms between independently evolved host genera, and identify aspects of pitcher form and physiology underpinning the similarities.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The species richness and evenness of North American and Southeast Asian pitcher plant microcosms converge</title><p>To compare the microbial communities within <italic>Sarracenia</italic> and <italic>Nepenthes</italic> pitchers, we analyzed DNA samples from pitchers and their surrounding environments using an amplicon sequencing approach, separately characterizing bacteria and eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> Table S2, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref> Dataset S1). Communities from Southeast Asian and North American pitchers were defined as converging if the communities were more similar to each other than to the communities of the environments immediately surrounding the plants, even despite the vast geographic distance between them. In fact, the <italic>Nepenthes</italic> and <italic>Sarracenia</italic> pitcher communities were distinct from and had fewer Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs, clustered at 97% sequence similarity; a proxy for species) than communities in surrounding bog water or soil (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> Table S3). The pattern held for both bacteria and eukaryotes, and was unaffected by sample volume (no correlation of observed OTUs with sample volume; for bacteria: R = −0.003, p=0.984, and for eukaryotes: R = −0.003, p=0.812). Pitcher samples also had significantly lower Shannon diversities (Mann-Whitney U Test, p&lt;0.001 in all comparisons) than surrounding environments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), and this pattern also held when we controlled for extraction volume (by analyzing a subset of 155 samples, each extracted from the same volume; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> Table S3).

Because pitchers evolved to trap insect prey, we hypothesized pitcher plant microbiomes would have the genes to digest chitin. We also chose to focus on key enzymes involved in proteins and amino acid degradation (aminopeptidase N, lysine decarboxylase, ornithine decarboxylase, and glutamate dehydrogenase), because nitrogen mineralization via the microbiome may assist pitcher plants in nitrogen acquisition from prey. Finally, we chose to compare cellulases across the metagenomes, as we hypothesized microbiomes of pitcher plants would be less involved in breaking down plant material, compared to microbiomes of other habitats. Although individual pitcher samples showed considerable variability, <italic>Nepenthes</italic> and <italic>Sarracenia</italic> microbiome metagenomes did in fact have high relative abundances of chitinase, lysine decaboxylase, and ornithine decarboxylase genes compared to metagenomes of bacterial communities collected from other habitats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). But aminopeptidase N levels were not significantly higher in pitcher plants than in other habitats, and surprisingly, glutamate dehydrogenases were, in fact, significantly lower in pitcher plants.

First, in nature, the bacterial and eukaryotic communities inside both <italic>Nepenthes</italic> and <italic>Sarracenia</italic> pitchers are less species rich and less even than communities in surrounding soil or bog water; pitcher habitats favor a subset of available species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>). Second, although the communities within the two genera of pitchers are made up of different species, organisms tend to be closely related and from the same phylogenetic clades (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). This pattern was especially pronounced among bacteria. Third, both <italic>Nepenthes</italic> and <italic>Sarracenia</italic> pitcher microbiomes are depleted in pathways for metabolic precursors and enriched in pathways involved in fatty acid degradation and cell wall biosynthesis; pitcher microbiomes also possess a high relative abundance of both chitinases and genes involved in amino acid degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).

Finally, <italic>Nepenthes</italic> pitchers experimentally placed into a <italic>Sarracenia</italic> habitat assembled <italic>Sarracenia</italic>-like communities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).

Furthermore, while the communities formed in sterile glass tubes with or without sterilized insect ‘prey’ appeared somewhat similar to plant pitcher communities, communities were still statistically different—suggesting that a general tube-like form that drowns insects in rainwater is almost, but not completely, sufficient for generating a pitcher-like microcosm. Other unmeasured characteristics of real <italic>Nepenthes</italic> and <italic>Sarracenia</italic> pitchers, including for example the production or abundance of plant-produced digestive enzymes or nectar, oxygen levels, and temperature, are also likely to cause these plant-formed pitcher microcosms to be more similar to each other than they are to glass tube microcosms.</p><p>The pitcher environment appears to be the dominant selective force shaping community composition in pitchers. Fewer eukaryotes consistently colonize <italic>Nepenthes</italic> or <italic>Sarracenia</italic> pitchers, as compared to bacteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>); the pattern is consistent with stronger habitat filtering with increasing body size, as observed in bromeliad phytotelmata (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Farjalla et al., 2012</xref>). Within each pitcher plant genus, collection site explained less of the observed variation than characteristics of the pitcher itself, suggesting that environmental filtering has a larger influence than dispersal. At a broad scale, comparisons between Southeast Asia and North America reveal that the regional pools of microbial organisms are distinct, and dispersal likely plays a stronger role in differentiating the microbial communities of these two continents. However, despite the differences in regional pools, organisms from the same phylogenetic groups colonize the pitcher microcosms found on opposite sides of the globe.</p><p>Convergent interactions, albeit on a much smaller scale, mirror the biome concept (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Odum, 1971</xref>): the same functional groups of plants and animals are found in different regions of the world when those regions possess similar climate and soil conditions. For example, clumped grasses, crustose lichens, and jumping rodents are found in xeric shrublands globally, including in Australia and Arizona, just as Chitinophagaceae bacteria, Sphingomonadaceae bacteria, and Histiostomatidae mites are found in the unrelated pitcher microcosms of Southeast Asia and North America. However, beyond scale, there is a second fundamental difference between the two concepts: convergent interactions are, by definition, <italic>interactions</italic> among different living organisms, and thus there is a potential for reciprocal feedback, and potentially coevolution.</p><p>The concept of convergent interactions can be used to better understand the selective pressures structuring microbial biodiversity elsewhere, outside of the pitcher plant system. In addition to diet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Godoy-Vitorino et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Delsuc et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Baldo et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sanders et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hu et al., 2018</xref>), many other features of convergently evolved organisms appear to cause associations with similar microbial communities. For example, bacterial communities associated with fungus-growing ants, beetles, and termites in different regions of the world have dominant community members from the same genera, with convergent functional potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Aylward et al., 2014</xref>), and microbial symbionts of sponges are functionally equivalent across phylogenetically divergent hosts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Fan et al., 2012</xref>). Convergent interactions can provide predictions about community structure and function, which can be tested across systems. The framework provides a tool to explore compositional and functional similarities of whole ecosystems, potentially enabling an understanding of the fundamental evolutionary and environmental drivers structuring microbial communities.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="bottom">Commercial assay or kit</td><td valign="bottom">MoBio PowerClean kit</td><td valign="bottom">Qiagen/MoBio</td><td valign="bottom"/><td valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">Commercial assay or kit</td><td valign="bottom">Quant-iT High-Sensitivity dsDNA Assay Kit</td><td valign="bottom">Invitrogen/ThermoFisher</td><td valign="bottom"/><td valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">Commercial assay or kit</td><td valign="bottom">TruSeq DNA PCR Free HT Kit</td><td valign="bottom">Illumina</td><td valign="bottom"/><td valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">Commercial assay or kit</td><td valign="bottom">KAPA LTP Library Prep Kit</td><td valign="bottom">Roche</td><td valign="bottom"/><td valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">Commercial assay or kit</td><td valign="bottom">KAPA Library Quantification Kit</td><td valign="bottom">Roche</td><td valign="bottom"/><td valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">Commercial assay or kit</td><td valign="bottom">PerfeCta NGS Library Quantification Kit</td><td valign="bottom">Quanta Biosciences/VWR</td><td valign="bottom"/><td valign="bottom"/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>Collections and experiments took place from 2012 to 2014 at field sites along the U.S. Gulf Coast, at Harvard Forest in Massachusetts, in Singapore, and in the Maliau Basin of Borneo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

We measured DNA quantity, and then re-extracted DNA from a few samples with very low DNA amounts, using a larger initial volume. DNA extracts with dark coloration (suggesting high levels of polyphenols) were cleaned using a MoBio Powerclean kit. DNA concentrations of successful extractions were fluorometrically quantified a final time using a Quant-iT High-Sensitivity dsDNA Assay Kit (Invitrogen). Samples were sent to Argonne National Laboratories for Illumina MiSeq next-generation amplicon sequencing.

DNA library concentrations were measured using a KAPA Library Quantification Kit, and the qualities were tested with a Bioanalyzer.

Here, we used the same DNA extractions as previously used for metabarcoding. DNA samples were sheared with a Covaris at 500 bp, and prepared with a KAPA LTP Library Prep Kit. Due to lower initial DNA quantities, the samples were subject to 2–9 cycles of PCR before final quantification using a PerfeCta NGS Library Quantification Kit, quality testing with a Bioanalyzer, and pooling of samples in equal concentrations. These libraries were sequenced in one-third of an Illumina HiSeq 150 bp paired-end Rapid Run lane.

Resulting numbers of sequences and OTUs are summarized in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> Table S2. Phylogenetic trees were generated using QIIME default settings for 16S; when generating the18S alignment and tree we set the allowed gap fraction to 0.8 and the entropy threshold to 0.0005. We assigned taxonomy with the greengenes version 13_8 (Greengenes Database Consortium) and SILVA version 111 databases for 16S and 18S, respectively.

We also encourage you to revise the Introduction/Discussion to more pointedly articulate how this study compares to previous ones that examine microbial community composition (including in animals), and how it raises new questions that move the field forward conceptually.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>See summary comments</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>This paper presents a compelling combination of observational data and experiments to test the hypothesis that distantly-related families of pitcher plants share a common core microbiota independent of their geographic locations and evolutionary histories. The authors first present data supporting the hypothesis that the inquiline microbial communities of <italic>Nepenthes</italic> and <italic>Sarracenia</italic> species are more similar to one another than they are to their external environments. Such similarity across these huge geographic distances suggests that the plants' leaf environments selectively enrich a similar suite of inquiline taxa and metabolic pathways. The authors then conduct a clever field experiment wherein <italic>Nepenthes</italic> host plants, which evolved in Asia, are brought into a <italic>Sarracenia</italic> habitat in New England and are allowed to naturally develop their microbiota. The authors found that <italic>Nepenthes</italic> pitcher community composition matched that of local <italic>Sarracenia</italic> pitchers, suggesting 1) that some shared features of these two families deterministically influenced the success of particular clades of micro-organisms, and 2) that differences between pitcher families' microbiota are not evolutionarily conserved, and are instead products of their local source pools. In terms of novelty, a number of other studies have previously documented convergent interactions among hosts and their microbial symbionts (e.g., N-fixing and mycorrhizal associations in plants, diet-driven gut microbiota in animals), but this is among the first to identify shared communities that encompass such a wide taxonomic breadth (arthropods, micro-eukaryotes, bacteria). It is also one of the first to experimentally test how these communities form when placed well outside of their natural ranges (though analogous 'natural experiments' have been conducted on <italic>Sarracenia</italic> introduced to Switzerland by Fragnière 2012 and Zander et al., 2016, which might be discussed). The inclusion of metagenomic data is another valuable contribution. Few studies have done so, and none as thoroughly as this one.</p><p>I outline a few concerns with the current draft below.</p><p>One major issue with the study design is that it appears pitcher leaves within each species were sampled at a single point in time from their respective locations. Given that pitcher environments and microbial communities have been observed to change markedly in response to season and prey deposition (e.g., Koopman et al., 2010; Sirota et al., 2013 PNAS) it would be very helpful to also have data on prey biomass (mg prey/ml), oxygen concentration, and (most importantly) living microbial and arthropod biomass in each pitcher. Were these data collected? How might differences in prey biomass influence the results?</p><p>Introduction, second paragraph: This paragraph draws some parallels between microbial diversity, global change, convergent interactions that are a bit of a stretch and are not covered in the design/Results/Discussion. If the goal is to justify the study, I think it's better to scrap the narratives of microbial diversity and global change, and instead introduce the question at hand – how microbial communities assemble in highly-specialized, convergently-evolved structures. This could be done by introducing the concept of convergence in dietary structures among various clades (e.g. ruminants and the hoatzin, blood-feeding arthropods, wood-eating insects) and then introducing the potential importance of microbial digestive associates in these cases. The case can then be made that pitcher plants are uniquely situated for testing this concept.</p><p>Introduction, third paragraph: Citations here are misleading. Why not cite the studies that have actually used pitcher plants to investigate metacommunities and community assembly? (e.g.., Kneitel and Miller 2003; Buckley et al., 2003; Armitage 2017).</p><p>Introduction, third paragraph: It's not clear what these 'clear parallels' are between these different communities. Here again, citations are somewhat misleading in that they do not address the aforementioned parallels between pitcher plant and phyllosphere/nectar/rhizosphere microbionts.</p><p>Introduction, last paragraph: Please explain how 'convergence' is defined. As it stands, it is a nebulous enough term that it can be used to assign meaning to a huge variety of different patterns, such as:</p><p>– many shared OTUs</p><p>– some shared numerically-abundant OTUs</p><p>– no shared OTUs but some shared genes conferring an implied function</p><p>– no shared OTUs but many shared genes conferring no implied function</p><p>– shared relative abundance of OTU families but no shared OTUs</p><p>– shared network of OTU co-occurrences among hosts</p><p>Are there any commonly-used definitions? Is there a criterion for rejecting convergence?</p><p>Also, if the authors are truly searching for evidence of convergent interactions, then why aren't interactions being measured? The authors are making the tacit assumption that shared communities equates to shared interactions within those communities, which is not necessarily the case.</p><p>Subsection “Relocated <italic>Nepenthes</italic> converge on <italic>Sarracenia</italic>-like communities”, last paragraph: Were pitcher leaves more similar to tubes with prey than they were to tubes without prey? These comparisons could identify how much variation prey capture accounts for, independent of the pitcher leaf.</p><p>Subsection “Relocated <italic>Nepenthes</italic> converge on <italic>Sarracenia</italic>-like communities”, last paragraph: Given the differences in sample sizes, it's entirely conceivable that more tube samples would recapitulate the observed variation among pitchers and the 'reduced variation' would vanish. Therefore, I suggest removing the statement that the glass communities were different from the experimental pitchers owing to their variation. Also, I couldn't find the PERMANOVA results for experimental pitchers vs. glass tubes. The negative results should also be included for the sake of transparency.</p><p>Discussion, second and fifth paragraphs: Without data on the actual contribution of microbes to host functioning (e.g., via prey decomposition/isotope uptake paired with fluid dilution/antibiotic treatment), calling these 'convergent interactions' remains speculative, as the term 'interaction' implies some type of reciprocal responses between the host organism and its microbiota. However, we already know that removing of many components of the pitcher food web (such as micro-arthropods) carries no perceptible consequences for their hosts (Butler, Gotelli and Ellison et al., 2008; Baiser, Ardeshiri and Ellison, et al. 2011). Again, a more formal introduction to 'convergent interactions' would be welcome.</p><p>Subsection “Experimental relocation of <italic>Nepenthes spp.</italic> to a New England bog”, second paragraph: I'm not convinced that the control groups (bog water, soil) are appropriate references to use for detecting convergence among pitchers. For instance, bog and soil water are treated as &quot;null&quot; environments to which pitcher leaves are compared. However, since pitcher leaves are really being colonised by microbes derived primarily from the guts and bodies of trapped or resident arthropods, then wouldn't those organisms' combined microbiota serve as a more meaningful source pool? That way, the resulting pitcher communities could be directly related to environmental filtering from the pool of colonists. What if the insect prey microbiota ended up being identical to the pitcher microbiota?</p><p>Subsection “Analyses of 16S and 18S diversity”, third paragraph: Unweighted UniFrac is notoriously sensitive to rare members of the community. Please also include similar weighted UniFrac or Bray-Curtis based dissimilarity analysis in the supplement so that readers can assess the influence of rare vs. dominant taxa on beta-diversity.</p><p>Subsection “Analyses of 16S and 18S diversity”, last paragraph: How were these trees generated? I can't assess their quality without more information such as the identification of major clades on the trees, some branch length scale, bootstrap values, rooting methodology, etc.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>This study compared the eukaryotic and prokaryotic inhabitants of two phylogenetically and geographically distinct clades of pitcher plants. The authors ask if these inhabiting organisms show convergence in taxonomic and functional composition, defined here as being more similar to each other in composition than to other neighbouring habitats.</p><p>Overall, this is a very pleasing study. The breadth of organismal diversity studied – from bacteria to insects – is impressive and made possible by barcoding and metagenomics methods. The authors combine observational evidence (pitcher communities in native country) with experimental evidence (transplant of one pitcher genera to the other country) to build a case for convergence mediated by habitat filtering.

The authors first present data supporting the hypothesis that the inquiline microbial communities of Nepenthes and Sarracenia species are more similar to one another than they are to their external environments. Such similarity across these huge geographic distances suggests that the plants' leaf environments selectively enrich a similar suite of inquiline taxa and metabolic pathways. The authors then conduct a clever field experiment wherein Nepenthes host plants, which evolved in Asia, are brought into a Sarracenia habitat in New England and are allowed to naturally develop their microbiota. The authors found that Nepenthes pitcher community composition matched that of local Sarracenia pitchers, suggesting 1) that some shared features of these two families deterministically influenced the success of particular clades of micro-organisms, and 2) that differences between pitcher families' microbiota are not evolutionarily conserved, and are instead products of their local source pools. In terms of novelty, a number of other studies have previously documented convergent interactions among hosts and their microbial symbionts (e.g., N-fixing and mycorrhizal associations in plants, diet-driven gut microbiota in animals), but this is among the first to identify shared communities that encompass such a wide taxonomic breadth (arthropods, micro-eukaryotes, bacteria). It is also one of the first to experimentally test how these communities form when placed well outside of their natural ranges (though analogous 'natural experiments' have been conducted on Sarracenia introduced to Switzerland by Fragnière 2012 and Zander et al., 2016, which might be discussed). The inclusion of metagenomic data is another valuable contribution. Few studies have done so, and none as thoroughly as this one.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate your clear and concise summary; it highlights what we hoped readers would take from the manuscript.</p><p>We have added a sentence to the Introduction describing the Swiss <italic>Sarracenia purpurea</italic>: “Various arthropods have co-diversified with their pitcher plant hosts, suggesting ecological dependence and a shared evolutionary history (Satler et al. 2016). In fact, even though the species <italic>S. purpurea</italic> was introduced to Europe over 100 years ago, it houses very few insect inquilines, as compared to plants in native habitats (Zander et al. 2016); the close associations of pitchers and arthropods may be slow to evolve.” We have not included the reference in our Discussion as the Swiss plants are growing in a place that does not have any native pitcher inquilines – an aspect of natural history which translates to a very large difference between the Swiss circumstance and our manipulative experiment, in which the <italic>Nepenthes</italic> were placed into a <italic>Sarracenia</italic> habitat and exposed to the same pool of organisms already colonizing the convergently evolved Sarracenia.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I outline a few concerns with the current draft below.</p><p>One major issue with the study design is that it appears pitcher leaves within each species were sampled at a single point in time from their respective locations. Given that pitcher environments and microbial communities have been observed to change markedly in response to season and prey deposition (e.g., Koopman et al., 2010; Sirota et al., 2013 PNAS) it would be very helpful to also have data on prey biomass (mg prey/ml), oxygen concentration, and (most importantly) living microbial and arthropod biomass in each pitcher. Were these data collected? How might differences in prey biomass influence the results?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that successional and seasonal dynamics can affect the communities within pitchers. But in Singapore, we sampled opportunistically at the same sites in different years (often traveling in different months of the different years), and saw almost no differences in our diversity measures among years (see our paper: Baker et al., 2016, Phil. Trans. B.). Much of our fieldwork took place in Southeast Asia. In remote locations, when it was impossible to specifically age pitchers or visit twice, sampling across pitchers was the best option: when we could only sample at one time point, we purposely sampled from pitchers at different successional stages in order to recover the greatest possible diversity. We recognize there can also be seasonal differences in diversity, but our data suggest successional stage and the randomness of prey capture have larger influences on microbiome diversity than season, and we are confident our sampling design reflects real differences between the biodiversity of different pitcher plant species across time and space.</p><p>We have included a discussion of oxygen concentrations in our Discussion (second paragraph). Oxygen is likely to be an unmeasured variable in our study; we did try to measure oxygen concentrations in the field, but our initial tests with a portable instrument proved the instrument was unreliable and we stopped collecting these data.</p><p>With regard to prey biomass and living microbial/other biomass, DNA concentration is the best and most appropriate measure for this study. Living biomass and DNA concentrations are strongly correlated (e.g. Marstorp, Guan and Gong, 2000), and in our samples it is a better measure than cell counts because some cells are lysed in the high-salt preservative we use to collect pitcher fluids in Borneo and other distant field sites. In fact our related study (Bittleston et al., 2016a) confirms that the great majority of the DNA sequences extracted from pitcher fluid samples came from living inquilines, and not from dead prey (in other words, DNA concentrations are not measuring dead biomass). DNA concentrations are also the most appropriate because some prey break down very quickly in pitcher plants, and measurements of prey biomass can result in an underestimation of resource availability (Heard, The American Midland Naturalist 1998; and personal observations).</p><p>We have added the DNA concentration of each sample to our metadata (Supplementary Dataset 1), and included DNA concentration as a variable in our analyses of <italic>Nepenthes</italic> and <italic>Sarracenia</italic> communities (see Supplementary file 1—table S4 in our revised manuscript).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Introduction, second paragraph: This paragraph draws some parallels between microbial diversity, global change, convergent interactions that are a bit of a stretch and are not covered in the design/Results/Discussion. If the goal is to justify the study, I think it's better to scrap the narratives of microbial diversity and global change, and instead introduce the question at hand – how microbial communities assemble in highly-specialized, convergently-evolved structures. This could be done by introducing the concept of convergence in dietary structures among various clades (e.g. ruminants and the hoatzin, blood-feeding arthropods, wood-eating insects) and then introducing the potential importance of microbial digestive associates in these cases. The case can then be made that pitcher plants are uniquely situated for testing this concept.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate your suggestions for improving our framing. We decided to delete the paragraph you reference, and rewrote the Introduction to 1) address microbial community assembly in convergent hosts across distinct animal/plant systems, and 2) explicitly articulate how pitcher plants are a model of microbial community dynamics.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Introduction, third paragraph: Citations here are misleading. Why not cite the studies that have actually used pitcher plants to investigate metacommunities and community assembly? (e.g.., Kneitel and Miller 2003; Buckley et al., 2003; Armitage 2017).</p></disp-quote><p>We had chosen to cite general references to community assembly and metacommunity theory, but realize these citations were confusing. We have edited the citations to include your suggestions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Introduction, third paragraph: It's not clear what these 'clear parallels' are between these different communities. Here again, citations are somewhat misleading in that they do not address the aforementioned parallels between pitcher plant and phyllosphere/nectar/rhizosphere microbionts.</p></disp-quote><p>Given our extensive editing, we don't feel this sentence is necessary any longer, and we have deleted it.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Introduction, last paragraph: Please explain how 'convergence' is defined. As it stands, it is a nebulous enough term that it can be used to assign meaning to a huge variety of different patterns, such as:</p><p>– many shared OTUs</p><p>– some shared numerically-abundant OTUs</p><p>– no shared OTUs but some shared genes conferring an implied function</p><p>– no shared OTUs but many shared genes conferring no implied function</p><p>– shared relative abundance of OTU families but no shared OTUs</p><p>– shared network of OTU co-occurrences among hosts</p><p>Are there any commonly-used definitions? Is there a criterion for rejecting convergence?</p></disp-quote><p>Convergence is defined based on similarity, and similarity is a relative concept, making convergence inherently difficult to define precisely; nonetheless we seek precision and have written a sentence at the beginning of the results to clarify the definition we use to probe for the presence or absence of convergence: “Communities from Southeast Asian and North American pitchers were defined as converging if the communities were more similar to each other than to the communities of the environments immediately surrounding the plants, even despite the vast geographic distance between them.” Much of the conceptual work behind this definition is described in our publication Bittleston et al. (2016b); in this publication we describe in detail our use of the word convergence. We have more explicitly referenced this publication in our revised manuscript. Using this definition, our study finds convergence as measured by alpha diversity (based on both observed OTUs and Shannon diversity), and as measured by the phylogenetic groups that are most common and relatively abundant within pitchers. Using this definition, tests of convergence can definitely fail. In terms of beta-diversity, our test of convergence is inconclusive, because in Figure 1Ci and Cii, the <italic>Nepenthes</italic> and <italic>Sarracenia</italic> communities do not cluster more closely with each other than they do with the communities from their surrounding environments. But the results of our manipulative field experiment suggest <italic>Nepenthes</italic> and <italic>Sarracenia</italic> pitchers function as similar selective environments, when exposed to the same microbial pool; the same kinds of communities assembled in each genus in the common habitat.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, if the authors are truly searching for evidence of convergent interactions, then why aren't interactions being measured? The authors are making the tacit assumption that shared communities equates to shared interactions within those communities, which is not necessarily the case.</p></disp-quote><p>We would argue that we <italic>are</italic> measuring interactions: the interactions between the pitcher plants and the microcosms assembling within them. While exploring a subset of specific two-way interactions using more traditional ecological approaches emerges as a logical next step, it was not the focus of our paper, and could not be; we need the knowledge represented by the current manuscript to move forward. Focusing on a subset of interactions might also result in a different bias (how would we know the subset is representative?), and given that our aim was to work across the East Coast of North America, in Singapore, and in Borneo, high throughput molecular methods were definitely the first priority.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Subsection “Relocated Nepenthes converge on Sarracenia-like communities”, last paragraph: Were pitcher leaves more similar to tubes with prey than they were to tubes without prey? These comparisons could identify how much variation prey capture accounts for, independent of the pitcher leaf.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion; you make a good point. We have now included the two types of tubes as different symbols in Figure 4Di and Dii. We also added text to the Results: “NMDS plots indicate glass tubes with added prey did not assemble communities more similar to the experimental pitcher communities than glass tubes without added prey.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Subsection “Relocated Nepenthes converge on Sarracenia-like communities”, last paragraph: Given the differences in sample sizes, it's entirely conceivable that more tube samples would recapitulate the observed variation among pitchers and the 'reduced variation' would vanish. Therefore, I suggest removing the statement that the glass communities were different from the experimental pitchers owing to their variation. Also, I couldn't find the PERMANOVA results for experimental pitchers vs. glass tubes. The negative results should also be included for the sake of transparency.</p></disp-quote><p>We have removed the statement, and have included the analysis of pitchers vs. glass tubes in Supplementary file 1—table S4. We also added text to the Results: “Only a very small portion of the variation in community composition was explained in analyses of pitchers vs. glass tubes; however, the differences were highly significant (bacteria: <italic>envfit</italic> R<sup>2</sup> = 0.05, P &lt; 0.001, <italic>adonis</italic> R<sup>2</sup> = 0.02, P &lt; 0.001; eukaryotes: <italic>envfit</italic> R<sup>2</sup> = 0.09, P &lt; 0.001, <italic>adonis</italic> R<sup>2</sup> = 0.03, P &lt; 0.001). The analysis suggests a sterile, pitcher-shaped form is almost, but not quite entirely, sufficient for acquiring a pitcher plant-like microcosm (Figure 4D).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Discussion, second and fifth paragraphs: Without data on the actual contribution of microbes to host functioning (e.g., via prey decomposition/isotope uptake paired with fluid dilution/antibiotic treatment), calling these 'convergent interactions' remains speculative, as the term 'interaction' implies some type of reciprocal responses between the host organism and its microbiota. However, we already know that removing of many components of the pitcher food web (such as micro-arthropods) carries no perceptible consequences for their hosts (Butler, Gotelli and Ellison, 2008; Baiser, Ardeshiri and Ellison, 2011). Again, a more formal introduction to 'convergent interactions' would be welcome.</p></disp-quote><p>Please also see our comments, above. We agree that direct evidence of reciprocal responses between the host organism and its microbiota would be strong evidence of convergent interactions. However, without our current data, the design of these manipulative experiments would be difficult to justify, and difficult to make happen in remote habitats: hopefully these kinds of experiments will take place in the near future. Meanwhile, our large dataset, collected from two continents, also builds a compelling case for convergent interactions: we have clearly demonstrated that two distantly related, convergently evolved genera of pitcher plants select for similar communities, with microbiomes with increased degradation capabilities compared to other habitats. However, to more appropriately reflect what we have learned, we have added “appear” to modify our updated statement: “Convergently evolved pitchers appear to cause convergent interactions (Bittleston et al., 2016b) between the two genera and their associated pitcher microcosms.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Subsection “Experimental relocation of Nepenthes spp. to a New England bog”, second paragraph: I'm not convinced that the control groups (bog water, soil) are appropriate references to use for detecting convergence among pitchers. For instance, bog and soil water are treated as &quot;null&quot; environments to which pitcher leaves are compared. However, since pitcher leaves are really being colonised by microbes derived primarily from the guts and bodies of trapped or resident arthropods, then wouldn't those organisms' combined microbiota serve as a more meaningful source pool? That way, the resulting pitcher communities could be directly related to environmental filtering from the pool of colonists. What if the insect prey microbiota ended up being identical to the pitcher microbiota?</p></disp-quote><p>Although insect gut microbes may be one source of pitcher microbiota, we do not agree they are the primary colonizers: the main bacterial groups we find in pitchers are ones that are generally soil-, water-, and plant surface-associated. Sirigusa et al. (2007) suggest that bacteria cultured from <italic>Sarracenia</italic> pitchers are of insect origins, however, the taxa referenced (e.g. <italic>Serratia, Pantoea</italic>, etc.) are also common soil and freshwater habitats. Takeuchi et al. (2015) found pitcher plant bacteria were more similar to phyllosphere bacteria than gut bacteria. In one of our own unpublished studies, we excluded insects (both prey and inquilines) from <italic>Sarracenia purpurea</italic> pitchers and still found common pitcher microbes colonizing the pitchers, even when insects were absent. Of course, ideally, we would have the entire spectrum of potential microbiota from all potential source environments as our “null” environments, but this kind of sampling simply wasn't feasible; based on what we knew, bog water and soil emerged as more relevant than insect guts. Because almost all of the microbes we found in our pitcher samples were also present (albeit at very low relative abundances, sometimes) in our environmental samples (see Figure 2), we feel that the sampled environments do represent good “null” comparisons for this study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Subsection “Analyses of 16S and 18S diversity”, third paragraph: Unweighted UniFrac is notoriously sensitive to rare members of the community. Please also include similar weighted UniFrac or Bray-Curtis based dissimilarity analysis in the supplement so that readers can assess the influence of rare vs. dominant taxa on beta-diversity.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your suggestion.

But to facilitate a more straightforward evaluation of the trees, we have added bootstrap value indicators in Figure 2, and have also included new trees as a figure supplement to Figure 2 with both branch lengths and branch length scales. We have also added text detailing rooting methodology to the Materials and methods section: “The bacterial tree was rooted with Archaea, and the eukaryotic tree was rooted in Streptophyta (land plants and most green algae).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>[…] 1) My most substantive comment is that I cannot find evidence in the Materials and methods or supplementary material that the authors standardized sample volume between the pitchers and the other environmental samples (soil and bog water).

We also tested for a relationship between sample volume and alpha diversity, using two different methods: we checked for a correlation between observed OTUs and volume (and found no correlation), and we re-ran our analysis of Shannon diversity using a subset of 155 samples that were all extracted around the same time, in exactly the same way, and with the same extraction volume. We see the same patterns of Shannon diversity in this subset as we see in our larger dataset. We are confident that sample volume is not driving the patterns of Figure 1Bi and Bii.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In the analysis of within-genera correlates of community structure (subsection “Within each genus, pitcher species, acidity, form, and volume correlate with community composition”, third paragraph), it is not clear if you have controlled for species. If not, any community correlations with the physical and chemical properties of pitchers would be psuedoreplicated as these physical/chemical differences could simply stand in for species differences.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for raising this issue. For the within-genus correlates that we examine, it would be difficult to control for host species within the multivariate analyses. For pH, the best way to control for host species is to examine the effect of pH within each of the three <italic>Nepenthes</italic> species that have broad pH ranges (<italic>N. gracilis, N. rafflesiana</italic> and <italic>N. stenophylla</italic>). We have added these analyses for these three host species, and for each we find that pH still has a very strong correlation with community diversity (Supplementary file 1—table S4). These new analyses clearly show that the strong correlation with pH is not simply a result of the different pH of different host species. Unfortunately, for the plant form analysis in <italic>Sarracenia</italic>, the different forms do not occur within a single species, and we cannot separate these factors. We have added a sentence to the manuscript explaining that plant form is confounded with host species and have removed plant form from our analyses.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) In the gene pathways analysis, I couldn't determine if you were using samples from the same region (transplant experiment) or different regions (observation dataset).
