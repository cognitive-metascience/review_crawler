pleiotropic intracellular signals in mammalian cells. Here, we report neuronal excitability of β-blockers carvedilol and alprenolol at clinically relevant nanomolar concentrations. Carvedilol and alprenolol activate β<sub>2</sub>AR, which promote G protein signaling and cAMP/PKA activities without action of G protein receptor kinases (GRKs). The cAMP/PKA activities are restricted within the immediate vicinity of activated β<sub>2</sub>AR, leading to selectively enhance PKA-dependent phosphorylation and stimulation of endogenous L-type calcium channel (LTCC) but not AMPA receptor in rat hippocampal neurons. Moreover, we have engineered a mutant β<sub>2</sub>AR that lacks the catecholamine binding pocket. This mutant is preferentially activated by carvedilol but not the orthosteric agonist isoproterenol. Carvedilol activates the mutant β<sub>2</sub>AR in mouse hippocampal neurons augmenting LTCC activity through cAMP/PKA signaling. Together, our study identifies a mechanism by which β-blocker-dependent activation of GPCRs promotes spatially restricted cAMP/PKA signaling to selectively target membrane downstream effectors such as LTCC in neurons.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>signaling transduction</kwd><kwd>ion channel</kwd><kwd>hippocampus</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM129376</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xiang</surname><given-names>Yang K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000738</institution-id><institution>U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BX002900</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xiang</surname><given-names>Yang K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HL098200</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Navedo</surname><given-names>Manuel F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HL121059</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Navedo</surname><given-names>Manuel F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HL149127</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Navedo</surname><given-names>Manuel F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000968</institution-id><institution>American Heart Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Postdoctoral fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shen</surname><given-names>Ao</given-names></name><name><surname>Shi</surname><given-names>Qian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000968</institution-id><institution>American Heart Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xiang</surname><given-names>Yang K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>FRET biosensor-based measurement of cAMP signaling and single-channel recording reveal that β-blockers trigger local activation of adrenergic receptors and calcium channels in primary neurons.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>GPCRs often signal not only through canonical G proteins but also through noncanonical G protein-independent signaling, frequently via G protein receptor kinases (GRKs) and β-arrestins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lefkowitz, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Xiang and Kobilka, 2003</xref>). One of the universal features of GPCRs is that they undergo ligand-induced phosphorylation at different sites by either GRKs or second messenger dependent protein kinases such as protein kinase A (PKA). The phosphorylated GPCRs thus may present distinct structural features that favor receptor binding to different signaling partners, engaging distinct downstream signaling cascades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Reiter and Lefkowitz, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lefkowitz, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nobles et al., 2011</xref>). Some ligands can differentially activate a GPCR via a phenomenon known as functional selectivity or biased signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wisler et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zweemer et al., 2014</xref>). For example, stimulation of β<sub>2</sub> adrenergic receptor (β<sub>2</sub>AR), a prototypical GPCR involved in memory and learning in the central nervous system (CNS) and regulation of metabolism and cardiovascular function, promotes phosphorylation by both GRKs and PKA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Najafi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mammarella et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Matera et al., 2018</xref>). We have recently identified spatially segregated subpopulations of β<sub>2</sub>AR undergoing exclusive phosphorylation by GRKs or PKA in a single cell. These findings indicate specific GPCR subpopulation-based signaling branches can co-exist in a single cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Shen et al., 2018</xref>). GRK-mediated phosphorylation promotes pro-survival and cell growth signaling via β-arrestin-dependent mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK/ERK) pathways, prompting the search for biased ligands that preferentially activate β-arrestin pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Luttrell et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pierce et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kim et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ren et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zidar et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Choi et al., 2018</xref>). On the other hand, our recent studies show that the cAMP/PKA-dependent phosphorylation of β<sub>2</sub>AR controls ion channel activity at the plasma membrane in primary hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Shen et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>β-blockers are thought to reduce cAMP signaling because they either reduce basal activity of βARs or block agonist-induced receptor activation. While β-blockers are successful in clinical therapies of a broad range of diseases, their utility is limited by side effects in both the CNS and peripheral tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bakris, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gorre and Vandekerckhove, 2010</xref>). Indeed, studies have revealed that some β-blockers display partial agonism and can promote receptor-Gs coupling at high concentrations in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yao et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">DeVree et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gregorio et al., 2017</xref>). Accordingly, some β-blockers display intrinsic properties mimicking sympathetic activation (sympathomimetic β-blockers) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Maack et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brixius et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Larochelle et al., 2014</xref>). The mechanism remains poorly understood because classic cAMP assay do not show even minimal cAMP signal induced by these β-blockers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Maack et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brixius et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we show that the β-blockers carvedilol and alprenolol can promote Gs protein coupling to β<sub>2</sub>AR and cAMP/PKA but not GRK activity at nanomolar concentrations. Thus, these β-blockers are emerging as partial agonists even at low concentrations rather than strict antagonists in mammalian cells. This cAMP/PKA signaling is spatially restricted, selectively promoting phosphorylation of β<sub>2</sub>AR and Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 by PKA which augments LTCC activity in primary hippocampal neurons. Furthermore, we have engineered a mutant β<sub>2</sub>AR that can be selectively activated by carvedilol but not by the orthosteric agonist isoproterenol (ISO) to stimulate PKA but not GRK. Together, these studies identify a unique mechanism by which β-blockers activate β<sub>2</sub>AR at low concentrations, which promotes Gs/cAMP/PKA signaling branch and selectively targets downstream LTCC channels in neurons. This observation may also explain sympathomimetic effects of β-blockers in the CNS.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Carvedilol and alprenolol selectively promote β<sub>2</sub>AR-mediated PKA-phosphorylation of β<sub>2</sub>AR</title><p>In this study, we applied two sets of well-characterized phospho-specific antibodies, anti-pS261/262 and anti-pS355/356 to examine a series of β-blockers for their effects on the phosphorylation of β<sub>2</sub>AR at its PKA and GRKs sites, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Shen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tran et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tran et al., 2007</xref>). We found that various β-blockers including alprenolol (ALP), carvedilol (CAR), propranolol (PRO) and CGP12177 (177) were able to stimulate phosphorylation of β<sub>2</sub>AR at PKA sites expressed in HEK293 cells, similar to the βAR agonist isoproterenol (ISO) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). In contrast, other β-blockers, that is ICI118551 (ICI), timolol (TIM) and metoprolol (MET), were not able to do so (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The ligand-induced phosphorylation of β<sub>2</sub>AR was blocked by β<sub>2</sub>AR-specific antagonist ICI but not β<sub>1</sub>AR-specific antagonist CGP20712A (CGP) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B and C</xref>). We chose CAR and ALP for further study. We found that CAR and ALP promoted phosphorylation of β<sub>2</sub>AR by PKA even at nanomolar concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>), which was paralleled by concentration-dependent increases in phosphorylation of ERK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). The roles of β<sub>2</sub>AR and PKA in this phenomenon were confirmed by inhibition of β<sub>2</sub>AR with ICI and inhibition of PKA with H89, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C and D</xref>). In contrast, those β-blockers induced at best minimal increases in phosphorylation of β<sub>2</sub>AR at GRK sites and only at high concentrations, consistent with a previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wisler et al., 2007</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). As positive control, the βAR agonist ISO promoted robust increases in both PKA and GRK phosphorylation of the receptors at different concentrations ranging from nanomolar to micromolar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplements 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">3</xref>). In the CNS, β<sub>2</sub>AR emerges as a prevalent postsynaptic norepinephrine effector at glutamatergic synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Davare et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Joiner et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Qian et al., 2012</xref>). Consistent with the data from HEK293 cells, we found β-blockers CAR and ALP activated β<sub>2</sub>AR and promoted phosphorylation of the receptor by PKA in hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Together, these data suggest that certain β-blockers selectively promote PKA phosphorylation of β<sub>2</sub>AR in HEK293 and primary hippocampal neurons.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Carvedilol and alprenolol selectively promote phosphorylation of β<sub>2</sub>AR at PKA sites.</title><p>HEK293 cells stably expressing FLAG-tagged β<sub>2</sub>AR were either directly stimulated for 5 min with the βAR agonist ISO or different β-blockers at indicated concentrations (<bold>A</bold>) n = 4), or pretreated for 15 min with 1 μM β<sub>1</sub>AR antagonist CGP20712A (<bold>B</bold>) n = 5) or 10 μM β<sub>2</sub>AR antagonist ICI118551 (<bold>C</bold>) n = 4) before the treatment.

We hypothesized that the cAMP signal induced by β-blockers is restricted to local plasma membrane domains containing activated receptor, which is not detectable with traditional cAMP assays likely due to limited sensitivity. We applied the highly sensitive FRET-based biosensor ICUE3 to detect the dynamics of cAMP signal in living cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">DiPilato and Zhang, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">De Arcangelis et al., 2009</xref>). The full agonist ISO promoted cAMP signal in HEK293 cells while all β-blockers failed to do so (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), in agreement with the classic definition of β-blockers. However, when cells were treated with non-selective phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitor IBMX, CAR, ALP and CGP12177 were able to induce small but significant cAMP signal in HEK293 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), indicating a role of PDE in suppressing and restricting the distribution of cAMP in the cells. When β<sub>2</sub>AR was exogenously expressed in HEK293 cells, CAR and ALP were able to induce cAMP signal in HEK293 cells even without PDE inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>), probably due to insufficient cAMP-hydrolytic activity of endogenous PDEs to counter cAMP production induced from overexpressed β<sub>2</sub>AR. We then engineered a targeted cAMP biosensor by fusing the biosensor ICUE3 to the C-terminus of β<sub>2</sub>AR (β<sub>2</sub>AR-ICUE3), aiming to detect increases of cAMP within the local domain of the receptor. CAR and ALP promoted cAMP signals within the immediate vicinity of activated β<sub>2</sub>AR even at nanomolar concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D and E</xref>). The local increases of cAMP were abolished by inhibition of β<sub>2</sub>AR with ICI or inhibition of ACs with ddA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). We also used two generic plasma membrane (PM) targeted ICUE3 sensors to further characterize how the CAR and ALP generated cAMP signals are localized when compared to the full agonist ISO. Interestingly, neither CAAX-ICUE3 targeting to the non-rafts regions of PM nor LYN-ICUE3 targeting to the rafts regions of PM could sense cAMP induced by CAR and ALP, while ISO induced cAMP were readily detectable on PM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>), this further demonstrates that CAR and ALP only promote cAMP within the immediate vicinity of β<sub>2</sub>AR. These data confirm that CAR and ALP promote cAMP/PKA activity within the immediate vicinity of activated β<sub>2</sub>AR, in contrast to the broad distribution of cAMP/PKA activities induced by ISO in the cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Carvedilol augments the endogenous β<sub>2</sub>AR-dependent PKA phosphorylation of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 and its channel activity in hippocampal neurons</title><p>Local cAMP signals possess the potential to selectively regulate downstream effectors in receptor complexes or within the vicinity of activated receptors. In the CNS, β<sub>2</sub>AR emerges as a prevalent postsynaptic norepinephrine effector at glutamatergic synapses, where β<sub>2</sub>AR functionally interacts with AMPA receptor (AMPAR) and L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel (LTCC) Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2, and regulates neuronal excitability and synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Davare et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Joiner et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Qian et al., 2012</xref>). CAR and ALP, but not TIM significantly increased PKA phosphorylation of S1928 and S1700 of central α<sub>1</sub>1.2 subunit of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 in hippocampal neurons when both β<sub>2</sub>AR and LTCC were endogenously expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). However, CAR and ALP failed to promote phosphorylation of the AMPAR subunit GluA1 on its PKA site serine 845 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Like Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2, AMPARs are associated with β<sub>2</sub>AR, Gs, AC and PKA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Davare et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Joiner et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Qian et al., 2012</xref>). These results indicate high selectivity in targeting downstream substrates by this β-blocker-induced signaling in hippocampal neurons. Meanwhile, the CAR and ALP-induced PKA phosphorylation of LTCC were blocked by β<sub>2</sub>AR inhibitor ICI, AC inhibitor ddA, and PKA inhibitor H89, but not CaMKII inhibitor KN93, validating the activation of β<sub>2</sub>AR-cAMP-PKA pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>). We then examined the effects of CAR on PKA-dependent activation of LTCC Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channels using cell-attached single channel recordings in hippocampal neurons. As shown before, ISO stimulates LTCC activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Shen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Davare et al., 2001</xref>). Consistent with the phosphorylation data, CAR but not TIM significantly increased the open probability, channel availability and mean ensemble average of endogenous LTCC in rat hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). CAR stimulated channel activity when present in the patch pipette solution but not when applied outside the patch via bath perfusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Moreover, backfilling experiments with CAR found that L-type channels activity was relatively low at the beginning of the recording but then it significantly increased as the drug diffused to the pipette tip (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F–G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Consistent with our hypothesis and prior studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Davare et al., 2001</xref>), ISO applied outside the patch via bath perfusion was still able to stimulate LTCC activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>). These data indicate that CAR promotes spatially restricted cAMP/PKA activities for selective augmentation of LTCC activities in neurons. We further found that the activation of LTCC by CAR promoted cell death in cortical neuron cultures, and inhibition of β<sub>2</sub>AR or LTCC counteracted carvedilol-induced neuronal toxicities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Carvedilol promotes endogenous β<sub>2</sub>AR-dependent phosphorylation of LTCC α<sub>1</sub>1.2 by PKA in neurons.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Rat neurons on 10–14 days in vitro (DIV) were treated for 5 min with 1 μM indicated drugs.

We co-expressed the cAMP biosensor ICUE3 together with either wild-type (WT) β<sub>2</sub>AR or mutant S204A/S207A β<sub>2</sub>AR in MEF cells lacking endogenous β<sub>1</sub>AR and β<sub>2</sub>AR (DKO) to detect receptor signaling induced by different ligands.

Meanwhile, ISO failed to induce GRK phosphorylation of β<sub>2</sub>AR S204A/S207A mutant at different concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). In comparison, CAR induced equivalent PKA phosphorylation of β<sub>2</sub>AR WT and S204A/S207A mutant at different concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>). These data suggest that CAR, but not ISO selectively activates the S204A/S207A mutant β<sub>2</sub>AR at nanomolar concentrations. We then tested the effects of β<sub>2</sub>AR S204A/S207A mutant on LTCC channel activity after treatment with CAR in hippocampal neurons. In DKO neurons expressing the mutant S204A/S207A β<sub>2</sub>AR, CAR, but not ISO (30 nM) promoted PKA phosphorylation of LTCC α<sub>1</sub>1.2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A and B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). In agreement, CAR, but not ISO significantly increased the open probability, channel availability and mean ensemble average of LTCC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C–7G</xref>).

Although previous studies have reported that some β-blockers promote βAR-Gs coupling and thus might display partial agonism, this phenomenon is only observed at high concentrations and in vitro with reconstituted systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yao et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">DeVree et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gregorio et al., 2017</xref>). In this study, using a combination of highly sensitive tools such as engineered FRET-based cAMP sensors and single channel recording together with detection by phospho-specific antibodies, we show for the first time that β-blockers such as CAR and ALP can promote receptor-Gs coupling at nanomolar concentrations in living cells, which is clinically relevant in contrast to superphysiological concentrations in previous studies. In detail, as low as 1 nM alprenolol as well as 1 nM carvedilol induce 20–40% of maximal effects (as obtained with 1 μM isoproterenol) with respect to phosphorylation of β<sub>2</sub>AR by PKA and to cAMP production detected by the ICUE3 sensor coupled to β<sub>2</sub>AR. Unlike agonists, activation of β<sub>2</sub>AR by β-blockers selectively transduce G protein/cAMP/PKA signaling but not GRK signaling. More importantly, the β<sub>2</sub>AR-induced cAMP signal is highly spatially restricted to the local domain of activated β<sub>2</sub>AR, which selectively promotes activation of receptor-associated LTCC but not receptor-associated AMPAR, two downstream ion channels essential for adrenergic regulation of neuronal excitability in hippocampal neurons. The differential signaling by carvedilol with respect to LTCC and AMPAR is especially remarkable because both channels form complexes with β<sub>2</sub>AR that are localized within dendritic spines. Moreover, we have engineered a mutant β<sub>2</sub>AR that is selectively activated by β-blockers but not by catecholamines at low concentration. Our study defines CAR and ALP as Gs-biased partial agonists of βAR for highly spatially restricted cAMP/PKA signaling to Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 in neurons. The study exemplifies a unique mechanism by which β-blockers shape the compartmentalization of βAR signaling and a highly restrictive distribution of ligand-induced activation of GPCR targeting a specific downstream effector.</p><p>PKA-mediated phosphorylation is thought to play critical roles in heterologous desensitization of GPCRs and in receptor switching from Gs to Gi coupling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Daaka et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zamah et al., 2002</xref>), whereas GRK-mediated phosphorylation is implicated in β-arrestin recruitment and β-arrestin-dependent ERK activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Luttrell et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pierce et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kim et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ren et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zidar et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Choi et al., 2018</xref>). We have recently characterized that PKA and GRKs phosphorylate distinct subpopulations of β<sub>2</sub>AR in a single fibroblast or neuron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Shen et al., 2018</xref>). While GRK phosphorylation of β<sub>2</sub>AR is only observed at high concentrations of agonists, PKA phosphorylation can be induced with minimal doses of agonist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Shen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tran et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tran et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Liu et al., 2009</xref>). Here, our data show CAR does not promote GRK phosphorylation at low concentrations and induces a slow and minimal GRK effect at high concentrations when compared to those induced by ISO. The CAR-induced GRK effects are minimally related to the PKA effects. Previously, CAR has been recognized as a biased β-blocker that preferentially activates β-arrestin/ERK pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wisler et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kim et al., 2008</xref>). Despite the prominent role of GRK phosphorylation in full agonist ISO-induced β<sub>2</sub>AR-β-arrestin/ERK signaling, our data clearly indicate that GRK phosphorylation of β<sub>2</sub>AR is not necessary for CAR-induced activation of ERK, consistent with a recent study showing a distinct general mechanism of β-arrestin activation that does not require the GRK-phosphorylated tail of different GPCRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Eichel et al., 2018</xref>). Meanwhile, other studies show that in the absence of all G proteins, GPCRs fail to transduce β-arrestin/ERK signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Grundmann et al., 2018</xref>). These data indicate the necessity of G proteins in GPCR-induced arrestin activation. In our study, we observed a concentration-dependent correlation between PKA phosphorylation of β<sub>2</sub>AR with ERK activity induced by β-blockers, suggesting the potential role of Gs and PKA in CAR-induced β<sub>2</sub>AR-β-arrestin/ERK signaling are overlooked. In comparison, Gi is not required for CAR-induced β<sub>2</sub>AR/β-arrestin signaling even though CAR induces Gi recruitment to β<sub>1</sub>AR for transducing β<sub>1</sub>AR/β-arrestin signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wang et al., 2017</xref>). Moreover, our results are also in line with a recent report that activation of β<sub>2</sub>AR with as low as femtomolar concentrations of ligands causes sustained ERK signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Civciristov et al., 2018</xref>), further support a PKA but GRK-dependent mechanism in GPCR-induced ERK activation. Future studies will help us understand how ligand-induced GPCRs utilize distinct mechanisms in activating β-arrestin/ERK pathway.</p><p>Engineered GPCRs have been widely applied in investigating structural and biological processes and behaviors by precisely controlling specific GPCR signaling branches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lee et al., 2014</xref>). Previous mutagenesis studies have shown that β<sub>2</sub>AR with S204/207A mutation loses binding to adrenaline but still binds with several β-blockers including ALP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liapakis et al., 2000</xref>). Based on this and recent advances in βAR structures with agonists and β-blockers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Warne et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ring et al., 2013</xref>), we have generated a S204/207A mutant that bestow β<sub>2</sub>AR with the ability to be selectively activated by β-blockers such as CAR and to transduce cAMP/PKA signaling. At nanomolar concentrations, while ISO fails to stimulate PKA phosphorylation of the S204/207A mutant β<sub>2</sub>AR, the mutant receptor still retains CAR-induced stimulation of PKA-phosphorylation of the receptor. The CAR-induced activation of mutant β<sub>2</sub>AR triggers the β<sub>2</sub>AR/Gs/cAMP/PKA signaling pathway and selectively targets downstream effectors in primary hippocampal neurons. Interestingly, the S204/207A β2AR mutant is not only refractory to its agonists but also completely lost both ISO- and CAR-induced GRK-phosphorylation of β<sub>2</sub>AR. Further studies comparing this mutant with previous reported β<sub>2</sub>AR-TYY and Y219A mutants that lack Gs and GRKs coupling, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Choi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Shenoy et al., 2006</xref>), will facilitate the analysis of the physiological relevance of Gs/cAMP/PKA-dependent and GRK-dependent signaling pathways and enable researchers to explore β-arrestin/ERK pathway devoid of individual signaling branches.</p><p>β-blockers are a standard clinical treatment in a broad range of diseases. Many β-blockers possess intrinsic sympathomimetic activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bakris, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gorre and Vandekerckhove, 2010</xref>), which are problematic due to the side effects through stimulation of βARs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bakris, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gorre and Vandekerckhove, 2010</xref>), a feature that limits the clinical utility of the drugs. Here, we show that β-blockers promote activation of β<sub>2</sub>AR by recruiting Gs that selectively transduces cAMP/PKA signal but not GRK signal. Meanwhile, binding of β-blockers to β<sub>1</sub>AR has been shown to enhance cAMP levels locally by dissociating a β<sub>1</sub>AR-PDE4 complex, thereby reducing the local cAMP-hydrolytic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Richter et al., 2013</xref>), β<sub>1</sub>AR and β<sub>2</sub>AR thus could utilize different mechanisms for β-blocker-induced signaling. Another interesting observation is that the β-blocker-induced β<sub>2</sub>AR-cAMP signal is sufficient to promote PKA phosphorylation of both β<sub>2</sub>AR and the receptor-associated Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 of LTCC, but not another substrate, the AMPAR GluA1 subunit. Both LTCC and AMPAR are shown to associate with the β<sub>2</sub>AR in hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Davare et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Joiner et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Qian et al., 2012</xref>). Therefore, the preference of one local membrane target over another local target indicates a highly restricted nature of the cAMP-PKA activities, potentially dependent on the recently identified distinct subpopulations of β<sub>2</sub>AR and associated signaling molecules in the neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Shen et al., 2018</xref>). Nevertheless, the PKA phosphorylation leads to augmentation of LTCC activity, potentially contributing to the neuronal toxicities. Therefore, activation of GPCR at low ligand concentrations should be taken into consideration when designing and screening new therapeutic drugs.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Strain (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td>β<sub>1</sub>AR/β<sub>2</sub>AR double knockout</td><td>Jackson Laboratories</td><td>Stock # 003810</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain (<italic>Rattus norvegicus</italic>)</td><td>Sprague Dawley</td><td>Charles River Laboratories</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td>HEK293/β<sub>2</sub>AR-WT</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">De Arcangelis et al., 2009</xref></td><td/><td>HEK293 cells stably expressing FLAG-β<sub>2</sub>AR</td></tr><tr><td>Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td>HEK293/β<sub>2</sub>AR-S204/207A</td><td>This paper</td><td/><td>HEK293 cells stably expressing FLAG-β<sub>2</sub>AR-S204/207A</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Phospho-β<sub>2</sub>AR (Ser261/262) (mouse monoclonal)</td><td>Dr. Richard Clark (UT Huston)</td><td>Clone 2G3</td><td>IF (1 μg/ml), WB (1:1000)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Phospho-β<sub>2</sub>AR (Ser355/356) (mouse monoclonal)</td><td>Dr. Richard Clark (UT Huston)</td><td>Clone 10A5</td><td>WB (1:1000)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>β<sub>2</sub>AR (rabbit polyclonal)</td><td>Santa Cruz Biotechnology</td><td>sc-570 RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2225412">AB_2225412</ext-link></td><td>PLA (1:100), WB (1:1000)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Phospho-β<sub>2</sub>AR (Ser355/356) (rabbit polyclonal)</td><td>Santa Cruz Biotechnology</td><td>sc-16719R RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_781609">AB_781609</ext-link></td><td>WB (1:1000)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>α<sub>1</sub>1.2 (rabbit polyclonal)</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Patriarchi et al., 2016</xref></td><td>FP1</td><td>WB (1:1000)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Phospho-α<sub>1</sub>1.2 (Ser1928) (rabbit polyclonal)</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Patriarchi et al., 2016</xref></td><td>CH3P</td><td>IF (1 μg/ml), WB (1:1000)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Phospho-α<sub>1</sub>1.2 (Ser1700) (rabbit polyclonal)</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Patriarchi et al., 2016</xref>, Originally from Dr. William Catterall (U of Washington)</td><td/><td>WB (1:1000)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>GluA1 (rabbit polyclonal)</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Patriarchi et al., 2016</xref></td><td/><td>WB (1:1000)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Phospho-GluA1 (Ser831) (rabbit polyclonal)</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Patriarchi et al., 2016</xref></td><td/><td>WB (1:1000)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Phospho-GluA1 (Ser845) (rabbit polyclonal)</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Patriarchi et al., 2016</xref></td><td/><td>WB (1:1000)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>FLAG-M1</td><td>Sigma-Aldrich</td><td>F3040 RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_439712">AB_439712</ext-link></td><td>IF (1 μg/ml), WB (1:1000)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>HA</td><td>Covance</td><td>MMS-101R RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_291262">AB_291262</ext-link></td><td>PLA (1:1000)</td></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td>β<sub>2</sub>AR-mutant</td><td>This paper</td><td/><td>FLAG-tagged human β<sub>2</sub>AR with S204/207A double mutations</td></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td>β<sub>2</sub>AR-ICUE3</td><td>This paper</td><td/><td>ICUE3 fused to the C-terminal of human β<sub>2</sub>AR</td></tr><tr><td>Commercial assay or kit</td><td>Duolink in situ detection reagents</td><td>Sigma-Aldrich</td><td>DUO92007</td><td>PLA</td></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>pCLAMP10</td><td>Molecular Devices</td><td/><td>electrophysiology</td></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>MetaFluor</td><td>Molecular Devices</td><td/><td>FRET</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>β<sub>1</sub>AR/β<sub>2</sub>AR double knockout (DKO) mouse were obtained from Jackson Laboratories to produce P0-P1 postnatal DKO pups, SD pregnant rats were obtained from Charles River Laboratories to provide E17-E19 embryonic rats.

Primary mouse hippocampal neurons were isolated and cultured from P0-P1 early postnatal DKO mouse pups, and primary rat hippocampal neurons were prepared from E17-E19 embryonic rats using methods described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Beaudoin et al., 2012</xref>). Briefly, dissected hippocampi were dissociated by 0.25% trypsin (Corning) and trituration. Neurons were plated on poly-D-lysine-coated (Sigma) glass coverslips in 24-well plate for imaging and in 6-well plate for biochemistry at a cell density of 50,000/well and 1 million/well, respectively.

Following stimulation, cells were fixed, permeabilized, and co-stained with anti-β<sub>2</sub>AR antibody (1:100 dilution) from rabbit in conjunction with anti-HA antibody (1:1000 dilution) from mouse. The proximity ligation reaction was performed according to the manufacturer’s protocol using the Duolink in situ detection orange reagents (Sigma). Images were recorded with Zeiss LSM 700 confocal microscope with a 63×/1.4 numerical aperture oil-immersion lens. To quantify the PLA signals, the number of red fluorescent objects in each image was quantified using the Squassh plug-in for ImageJ software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rizk et al., 2014</xref>), and divided by the number of transfected cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) measurement</title><p>FRET measurement was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">De Arcangelis et al., 2009</xref>). Briefly, HEK 293 cells were transfected with ICUE3 or β<sub>2</sub>AR-ICUE3, DKO MEFs were co-transfected with ICUE3 and FLAG-β<sub>2</sub>AR or FLAG-mutant. Cells were imaged on a Zeiss Axiovert 200M microscope with a 40×/1.3 numerical aperture oil-immersion lens and a cooled CCD camera. Dual emission ratio imaging was acquired with a 420DF20 excitation filter, a 450DRLP diachronic mirror, and two emission filters (475DF40 for cyan and 535DF25 for yellow). The acquisition was set with 0.2 s exposure in both channels and 20 s elapses. Images in both channels were subjected to background subtraction, and ratios of yellow-to-cyan were calculated at different time points.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Western blot</title><p>HEK293 cells stably expressing FLAG-β<sub>2</sub>AR or FLAG-mutant were serum-starved for 2 hr and treated with indicated drugs and times, then harvested by lysis buffer (10 mM Tris pH 7.4, 1% NP40, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA) with protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail.

Protein samples were analyzed by western blot using antibodies as indicated at a 1:1000 dilution and signals were detected by Odyssey scanner (Li-cor).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Cell-attached patch clamp electrophysiology</title><p>Primary rat and mouse hippocampal neurons were used on 7–10 DIV. Cell-attached patch clamp recordings were performed on an Olympus IX70 inverted microscope in a 15 mm culture coverslip at room temperature (22–25°C). Signals were recorded at 10 kHz and low-pass filtered at 2 kHz with an Axopatch 200B amplifier and digitized with a Digidata 1440 (Molecular Devices). Recording pipettes were pulled from borosilicate capillary glass (0.86 OD) with a Flaming micropipette puller (Model P-97, Sutter Instruments) and polished (polisher from World Precision Instruments). Pipette resistances were strictly maintained between 6–7 MΩ to ameliorate variations in number of channels in the patch pipette. The patch transmembrane potential was zeroed by perfusing cells with a high K<sup>+</sup> extracellular solution containing (in mM) 145 KCl, 10 NaCl, and 10 HEPES, pH 7.4 (NaOH). The pipette solution contained (in mM) 20 tetraethylammonium chloride (TEA-Cl), 110 BaCl<sub>2</sub> (as charge carrier), and 10 HEPES, pH 7.3 (TEA-OH). This pipette solution was supplemented with 1 µM ω-conotoxin GVIA and 1 µM ω-conotoxin MCVIIC to block N and P/Q-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, respectively, and (S)-(-)-BayK-8644 (500 nM) was included in the pipette solution to promote longer open times and resolve channel openings as previously performed by our group and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Shen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Davare et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wang et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Qian et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hess et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Schuhmann et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Costantin et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yue and Marban, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dzhura and Neely, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Navedo et al., 2005</xref>). In a subset of experiments, BayK was left out of the pipette solution. Note that ISO and CAR had similar effects on channel activity whether BayK was included or not in the pipette solution. To examine the effects of β-adrenergic stimulation on the L-type Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 single-channel activity, 1 μM isoproterenol was added to the pipette solution in independent experiments. Note that we have previously used the L-type Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channel blocker nifedipine (1 μM) to confirm the recording of L-type Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 currents under control conditions and in the presence of isoproterenol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Patriarchi et al., 2016</xref>). Single-channel activity was recorded during a single pulse protocol (2 s) from a holding potential of −80 mV to 0 mV every 5 s. An average of &gt;50 sweeps were collected with each recording file under all experimental conditions. The half-amplitude event-detection algorithm of pClamp10 was used to measure overall single-channel L-type Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 activity as nPo, where n is the number of channels in the patch and Po is the open probability. Because the variability of nPo can be a critical element to interpret single channel data due to overstating open probability based on a high n number, we corrected this parameter by the number of channels (n) describing channel open probability and availability as well as calculating the mean ensemble average current. Data were pooled for each condition and analyzed with GraphPad Prism software.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism software and expressed as mean ± s.e.m.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Olga Boudker as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Ruiping Xiao (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors expand on their recent studies exploring the local regulation of L-type Ca channels (LTCC) in neurons by β-adrenergic signaling. Previously, they found that cAMP-PKA dependent phosphorylation of beta2 adrenergic receptors controls ion channel regulation in hippocampal neurons. In this study, the authors show that carvedilol and alprenolol can promote Gs activity and PKA phosphorylation of β-adrenergic receptor and LTCC at Ser1928, and increased LTCC activity. The authors contend that some β blockers can activate beta2 adrenergic receptors and target specific downstream LTCCs, and could explain the effect of β blockers on the central nervous system.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) In part, the manuscript incrementally builds upon several other studies, including these authors, probing the concept that some β adrenergic antagonists have agonist properties, and that in hippocampus, the LTCC 's may be positioned close to beta2 adrenergic receptors and are a &quot;privileged&quot; downstream signaling target. Please clearly indicate why this study should not be considered incremental.</p><p>2) The conclusion at the end of the manuscript attempting to create relevance to the findings, in regards to neuronal toxicities, is overstated without data showing that this local signaling could have these effects. Having data showing neuronal toxicities that are both carvedilol and Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependent would have made the manuscript more than more substantial. Are there data showing neuronal toxicities (not just known reversible side effects associated with β blockers) associated with carvedilol in humans? Otherwise, this angle should be greatly downplayed.</p><p>3) All reviewers felt that the other major conclusion that this β-blocker signaling is highly spatially restricted to only the local domain of the B2AR receptor is not quite as well supported and could benefit from some additional experiments, which I would prioritize as: 1) evaluating whether CAR is only effective in regulation L-channel currents when applied through the patch pipet as shown in Figure 4 but <italic>not</italic> when applied in the bath and 2) using a generic plasma membrane targeted ICUE3 cAMPs sensor to better characterize how local the CAR and ALP generated cAMP signals are compared to the full-agonist ISO. The authors already show that CAR regulation of Ca<sub>v</sub>1.2 S1928-P and S1700-P is block by the B2AR-specific antagonist ICI.</p><p>4) The authors use BayK to enhance channel activities and increase open time. This is a suboptimal method to establish that phosphorylation has a significant effect on signaling in native conditions. To convincingly show that LTCC are indeed a bona fide target of carvedilol, the experiments should be performed without BayK so that we can determine the actual effect of beta2-adrenergic receptor activation by carvedilol. The effects of PKA phosphorylation of LTCC may or may not be the same in the absence of BayK. The effects of carvedilol should be tested, at least on as subset of experiments, without BayK. The impact of BayK on channel modulation should be addressed. It is not necessary to use BayK to measure calcium channel activity.</p><p>5) Concerns about the variability of NPo. For instance, In Figure 6C, the data are driven by 7 points. In fact, the majority of data-points are similar to mutant and mutant + Iso. This variability suggest that the authors should develop a system so that they can measure the basal current and then infuse the drug via the patch pipette. Without understanding the number of channels in each patch and the basal open probability, the experiments have limited value. The single channel recordings clearly indicate bimodal gating, i.e. periods of low and high open probability. How do others authors take this into account? One would need very many long recordings to do this.

We now have revised the Abstract and Discussion section of our manuscript to include an expanded description of the significance of our study. (1) The concept that some β-blockers have agonist properties was only observed at high drug concentrations and in vitro with reconstituted systems before, our study for the first time show that β-blockers can activate receptor at nanomolar concentrations in living cells, which is clinically relevant in contrast to superphysiological concentrations in previous studies. In detail, as low as 1 nM alprenolol as well as 1 nM carvedilol induced 20-40% of maximal effects (as obtained with 1 μM isoproterenol) with respect to phosphorylation of β<sub>2</sub>AR by PKA and to cAMP production detected by the ICUE3 sensor coupled to β<sub>2</sub>AR. (2) Unlike agonists triggering both PKA and GRK pathways, activation of β<sub>2</sub>AR by β-blockers selectively transduce cAMP/PKA signaling, but not GRK signaling, function as PKA-biased drugs. This is a phenomenon never reported before, especially for carvedilol which was recognized as a GRK-biased drug in the past. (3) Importantly, we show that β-blocker-induced cAMP/PKA signaling can differentiate two primary downstream targets (LTCC vs. AMPAR) in primary neurons, which further exemplifies biased actions as well as unique tools to dissect these two functionally relevant ion channels in neuronal physiology in future. The differential signaling by carvedilol with respect to LTCC and AMPAR is especially remarkable because both channels form complexes with β<sub>2</sub>AR that are localized within dendritic spines (the postsynaptic sites of glutamatergic synapses), which are only ~500 nm in diameter.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The conclusion at the end of the manuscript attempting to create relevance to the findings, in regards to neuronal toxicities, is overstated without data showing that this local signaling could have these effects.

The impact of BayK on channel modulation should be addressed. It is not necessary to use BayK to measure calcium channel activity.</p></disp-quote><p>Although we agree that it is not always necessary to use BayK, this L-type channel agonist has been traditionally used in this type of single-channel recordings because it promotes channel activity and longer open-times. This facilitates the detection and measurement of unitary channel openings and increases the proportion of sweeps with activity, a maneuver that has been extensively employed in prior studies to facilitate the examination of single L-type channel activity [1-8]. Note that BayK is present in all experimental conditions, including NT. Therefore, any change in channel activity is expected to result from the effects of the stimuli provided, be that ISO or carvedilol. Consistent with this, our data here showing that ISO increases the open probability of L-type channels are consistent with a wealth of studies in the literature [6,9-14], thus suggesting that the presence of BayK did not mask the ISO effects.</p><p>Nonetheless, as requested, we repeated a subset of the single-channel experiments without BayK in the patch pipette (Figure 5—figure supplement 1). Under these conditions and in our hands, the probability of observing patches with single-channel activity in neurons was greatly reduced. Indeed, patches with &gt;5% channel availability within the first 50 sweeps that could be used for analysis accounted for ≤30% of all patches recorded (Figure 5—figure supplement 1A). Note that these are challenging experiments and that the reduced frequency of detecting events without BayK in the pipette solution delays an already very time consuming experimental process. Figure 5—figure supplement 1 shows all the data that we were able to collect within the two-month period given for resubmission. From patches with single-channel activity, we found that data acquired without BayK in the patch pipette resembled those with BayK (see Figure 5—figure supplement 1 and Figure 5). Importantly, in carvedilol backfilling pipette experiments, L-type channel activity was increased regardless of whether or not BayK was present in the patch pipette (see Figure 5F-G and Figure 5—figure supplement 1C). These new data support our hypothesis that L-type channels are a downstream target of β<sub>2</sub>AR activation by carvedilol.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Concerns about the variability of NPo.

This issue is further confounded by using BayK to artificially elevate channel open probability.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the variability of nPo can be a critical element to interpret single channel data due to overstating open probability based on a high n number. Therefore, we corrected our parameter by the number of channels (<italic>n</italic>) and determined in addition to open probability slow and fast kinetic and the mean ensemble average current. We further performed backfilling experiments in which the pipette tip was filled by capillary force with control solution and carvedilol was loaded with a hypodermic needle from the back end of the pipette. This configuration allows measuring basal L-type channel activity immediately after seal formation before the carvedilol effects could take placed. These carvedilol backfilling experiments show that LTCC activity was relatively low at the beginning of the recording but significantly increased as the drug diffused to the pipette tip. Similar results were observed regardless of whether BayK was included or not in the pipette solution (Figure 5F-G and Figure 5—figure supplement 1C). These new data provide further support to our original observation that carvedilol increases LTCC activity in neurons.</p><p>We agree with the reviewers that carvedilol seems to have a bimodal effect with some patches showing increased L-type channel activity and others displaying no or minimal effect compared to NT recordings. Whether this is a reflection of or related to bimodal L-type channel gating is unclear [15]. Our new FRET analysis show that carvedilol-induced cAMP signals are highly restricted within the receptor local domain and cannot be detected by the cAMP biosensors targeted to lipid rafts or non-lipid rafts in the plasma membrane; this finding is in contrast to the broad distribution of cAMP signals induced by ISO. These data indicate that only the channels in the complex with activated β<sub>2</sub>AR will display increased activity after carvedilol stimulation. In some patches, LTCCs without β<sub>2</sub>AR in the complexes won’t display increases in channel activities after stimulation with carvedilol. Nonetheless, these results are reminiscent and in agreement with earlier studies describing β adrenergic effects on L-type channels [10-11,16-19]. We plan to examine this possibility in subsequent research because, as the reviewers well pointed out, addressing this issue will require a substantial number of additional experiments that fall beyond the scope of this study, are unlikely to change the conclusions, and these experiments will require a much longer time frame.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Statistics:</p><p>In some Figures such as 3A, 4E, 6C, the n's for carvedilol are much more than other groups.

For example, how many separate experiments have been performed? And in the separate experiments, were all the different groups represented? What is the rationale for the disproportional representation among different groups?</p></disp-quote><p>Now the repeats of separate experiments and n’s for each condition are clearly noted in figure legends for all figures.</p><p>For Figure 3A (which is Figure 3A now), we apologize for not stating clearly in figure legend – we repeated separate experiments three times. Now we have combined data of three repeats together, and the n's for carvedilol are similar to other groups.</p><p>For the single-channel data in Figures 4E and 6C (which are Figures 5C and 7E now), we repeated the experiments for all conditions using at least three different neuronal cultures. For all the conditions, except carvedilol, we found that the single-channel data had a tight spread, even if they did not follow a normal distribution, which was consistent with prior results from our group [13-14,20]. When attempting the carvedilol experiments for the first time, however, we immediately noticed a broad distribution in the data with some patches displaying low channel activity and others high channel activity. This prompted us to collect as much data as possible for this particular experimental condition. Because we did not find a rational scientific justification to exclude a particular result, we found it necessary to include all the data collected in our analysis. As we discussed above, this broad (or bimodal) distribution in LTCC activity in response to carvedilol could be due to whether β<sub>2</sub>AR-LTCC complexes are present in the patches. We will only observe carvedilol-induced increases in channel activities when β<sub>2</sub>AR is present in the patch; and some patches may lack the complex despite the presence of LTCCs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>References:</p></disp-quote><p>1) Hess P, Lansman JB, Tsien RW.
