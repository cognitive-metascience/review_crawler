noroviruses. We have combined proteomic analysis of the viral translation and replication complexes with a CRISPR screen, to identify host factors required for norovirus infection. The core stress granule component G3BP1 was identified as a host factor essential for efficient human and murine norovirus infection, demonstrating a conserved function across the <italic>Norovirus</italic> genus. Furthermore, we show that G3BP1 functions in the novel paradigm of viral VPg-dependent translation initiation, contributing to the assembly of translation complexes on the VPg-linked viral positive sense RNA genome by facilitating ribosome recruitment. Our data uncovers a novel function for G3BP1 in the life cycle of positive sense RNA viruses and identifies the first host factor with pan-norovirus pro-viral activity.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46681.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The human norovirus (also known as the winter vomiting bug) is a major cause of gastroenteritis worldwide and is responsible for the deaths of many children in developing countries. Norovirus infections are estimated to have an economic cost of over 60 billion US dollars per year, yet there are no vaccines or drugs to prevent or limit the spread of outbreaks. In most cases norovirus infections last only a few days but, in people with weakened immune systems, infections can last from months to years.</p><p>A norovirus particle consists of a molecule of ribonucleic acid (or RNA for short), which contains the genome of the virus, surrounded by a coat of proteins. The virus is unable to multiply on its own and so it infects the cells of its host and hijacks them to make new viral proteins and RNA. Host cells have their own RNA molecules, which provide the instructions that cellular machines called ribosomes need to make proteins. Recent work reported that a norovirus protein called VPg interacts with the host cells’ ribosomes to recruit them to produce proteins from the viral genome. However, it remained unclear which host proteins were important for this key stage of the norovirus life cycle.</p><p>Hosmillo, Lu, McAllaster et al. combined three different molecular biology and genetic approaches to search for host proteins that help noroviruses to multiply in cells. Any proteins identified in these experiments would be fundamental for the norovirus life cycle, making them potential drug targets for future treatments. The experiments revealed that a protein called G3BP1 was required for noroviruses to multiply efficiently. Previous studies have shown that G3BP1 is a member of a family of proteins that can bind to RNA and play many roles in healthy cells, including helping the cells to adjust the proteins they produce in response to stress. Hosmillo, Lu, McAllister et al. found that G3BP1 helped VPg to recruit ribosomes and the other host components needed to make new proteins from the viral RNA genome.</p><p>These findings reveal a new role for G3BP1 in allowing noroviruses to multiply within cells and identifies a potential weakness in the norovirus life cycle. In the future, this work may help researchers to identify new drugs that could control norovirus outbreaks or treat long-term norovirus infections in humans.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>Norovirus</italic></kwd><kwd>translation</kwd><kwd>G3BP1</kwd><kwd>CRISPR</kwd><kwd>stress granule</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Virus</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>207498/Z/17/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hosmillo</surname><given-names>Myra</given-names></name><name><surname>Lu</surname><given-names>Jia</given-names></name><name><surname>Eaglesham</surname><given-names>James B</given-names></name><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Xinjie</given-names></name><name><surname>Emmott</surname><given-names>Edward</given-names></name><name><surname>Domingues</surname><given-names>Patricia</given-names></name><name><surname>Chaudhry</surname><given-names>Yasmin</given-names></name><name><surname>Fitzmaurice</surname><given-names>Tim J</given-names></name><name><surname>Tung</surname><given-names>Matthew KH</given-names></name><name><surname>Goodfellow</surname><given-names>Ian G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AI128043</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wilen</surname><given-names>Craig B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/N001176/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lu</surname><given-names>Jia</given-names></name><name><surname>Goodfellow</surname><given-names>Ian G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>104914/Z/14/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Goodfellow</surname><given-names>Ian G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000861</institution-id><institution>Burroughs Wellcome Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wilen</surname><given-names>Craig B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000742</institution-id><institution>Churchill College, University of Cambridge</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Eaglesham</surname><given-names>James B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/000943N/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Locker</surname><given-names>Nicolas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A key cellular stress granule protein, G3BP1, is critical for efficient norovirus infection, representing the first pan-norovirus, pro-viral factor identified to date.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Positive sense RNA viruses rely heavily on host cell factors for all aspects of their life cycle. They replicate on host derived membranous vesicles that are induced following viral infection, the formation of which requires the activity of key membrane bound viral enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Altan-Bonnet, 2017</xref>). Within the membrane bound viral replication complex, translation of the viral genome and the synthesis of new viral RNA occurs in a highly coordinated process. Positive sense RNA viruses have evolved novel gene expression mechanisms that enable them to overcome the genome size limitations that accompany error-prone replication and which might restrict their overall coding capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Firth and Brierley, 2012</xref>). In addition, viral modification of the host cell translation machinery often provides a competitive advantage allowing for the efficient translation of viral RNA in an environment where competing cellular RNAs are in abundance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">McCormick and Khaperskyy, 2017</xref>). This ability to compete with cellular RNAs is particularly important for the initiation of infection where the incoming viral genome may be present at only a single copy per cell.</p><p>We have previously described a novel paradigm of viral translation that relies on the interaction of host translation initiation factors with a virus-encoded protein (VPg), covalently linked to the 5’ end of the genome of members of the <italic>Caliciviridae</italic> family of positive sense RNA viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chaudhry et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chung et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Goodfellow et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hosmillo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Leen et al., 2016</xref>). Unlike the 22-amino acid VPg peptides from picornaviruses, the VPg protein linked to the genomes of caliciviruses is significantly larger and is essential for the translation of viral RNA and viral RNA infectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Goodfellow, 2011</xref>).</p><p>Human noroviruses (HuNoV) and sapoviruses (HuSaV) are enteropathogenic members of the <italic>Caliciviridae</italic> family of positive sense RNA viruses, and together cause &gt;20% of all cases of gastroenteritis (GE). They are also a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in the immunocompromised; individuals with genetic immune-deficiencies, cancer patients undergoing treatment and transplant recipients often experience chronic norovirus infections lasting months to years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">van Beek et al., 2017</xref>). The economic impact of HuNoV is estimated to be at least ~$4.2 billion in direct health care costs, with wider societal costs of ~$60 billion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bartsch et al., 2016</xref>). Despite their socioeconomic impact, we have, until very recently lacked a detailed understanding of much of the norovirus life cycle and many significant questions remain unanswered. HuNoV replicons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chang et al., 2006</xref>), a murine norovirus that replicates in cell culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Karst et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wobus et al., 2004</xref>) and the recent B cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jones et al., 2014</xref>), stem-cell derived organoid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ettayebi et al., 2016</xref>) and zebrafish larvae infection models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Van et al., 2019</xref>), have all provided invaluable tools to dissect the norovirus life cycle. However, due to the technical limitations associated with many of these experimental systems, in comparison to other positive sense RNA viruses, our knowledge of the intracellular life of noroviruses is significantly lacking (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Thorne and Goodfellow, 2014</xref>).</p><p>In the current study, we have combined three independent unbiased approaches to identify host factors involved in the norovirus life cycle. Combining experimental systems that incorporated both murine and human noroviruses, allowed the identification of cellular factors for which the function is likely conserved across the <italic>Norovirus</italic> genus. By combining three complimentary approaches, we identify the host protein G3BP1 as a critical host factor required for norovirus VPg-dependent translation, identifying a new role for G3BP1 in virus-specific translation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Comparative analysis of the norovirus translation initiation complex</title><p>The MNV and the prototype HuNoV Norwalk virus (NV) VPg proteins are covalently linked to the viral genome via the highly conserved tyrosine residue within an N-terminal DEEYD/E motif found in all calicivirus VPg proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In addition, the norovirus VPg proteins contain a highly conserved C-terminal domain which we have shown to be necessary and sufficient for binding to the translation initiation factor eIF4G via an interaction that requires a highly conserved phenylalanine residue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chung et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Leen et al., 2016</xref>). Using affinity purification on m7-GTP sepharose, we confirmed that the NV VPg protein, as produced during authentic virus replication in a NV replicon bearing cell line, interacts with the cap-binding complex eIF4F (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Components of the eIF4F complex, namely the eIF4E cap-binding protein, the eIF4A helicase and the eIF4GI scaffold protein, along with poly-A binding protein (PABP) and eIF3 subunits, were readily purified on m7-GTP sepharose, whereas GAPDH was not. In NV-replicon containing cells, mature VPg was also enriched on m7-GTP sepharose but the NS3 protein, known to have RNA binding and helicase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Li et al., 2018</xref>), was not. Furthermore, we demonstrated that transfection of GFP-tagged versions of either the MNV or NV VPg proteins into 293 T cells allowed for the affinity purification of eIF4F components and that mutations in the eIF4G binding domain of VPg reduced this association (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46681.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The norovirus VPg proteins interacts with ribosome associated translation initiation factors.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Amino acid sequence alignment of the GV murine norovirus VPg sequences with VPg from representative human noroviruses from GI Norwalk virus (NV), GII, and GIV.

Except for YBX1, the association of all proteins tested were reduced by the introduction of eIF4G-binding site mutations into the MNV VPg protein.

Unlabelled or stable isotope labelled highly permissive BV2 microglial cells were infected with either wild type MNV or the equivalent virus carrying the FLAG epitope purification tag in either NS1/2 or NS4, and the viral replication complex was purified. The experiment was performed three times by swapping the labelled derivatives of arginine and lysine as described in the Materials and methods. Silver stain of the purified complexes confirmed the presence of the bait proteins, with both the uncleaved and cleaved forms of NS1/2 and NS2 being highly enriched (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).

In contrast, NS1/2 effectively pulled down mature VPg (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> and S2.2). Consistent with this, NS1/2 enriched the VPg binding partner eIF4G more than 2-fold, while pulldown of NS4 resulted in no eIF4G enrichment, likely indicating that the NS4/5 (VPg) precursor cannot effectively function in translation initiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). This is consistent with a previous observation that binding of C-terminal VPg fusion proteins to eIF4G is inhibited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Leen et al., 2016</xref>), but may further suggest that the function of VPg is also altered when present as an N-terminal fusion with NS4.

The Brie library (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Doench et al., 2016</xref>) was selected due to the reduced off-target effects relative to previously described CRISPR libraries used for norovirus studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Haga et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Orchard et al., 2016</xref>). In addition, to minimise the impact of gRNAs that may have deleterious effects on long term cell viability and to increase our ability to detect genes that may be important, but not essential, for norovirus-induced cell death, the infection was reduced to 24 hr as compared to 2–10 days post infection in previous studies. BV2-Cas9 expressing cells were infected with lentiviruses carrying the Brie gRNA library carrying 78,637 independent guide RNAs to 19,674 genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Doench et al., 2016</xref>).

Genes that were enriched by STARS analysis following MNV infection represent putative pro-viral factors which when disrupted, resulting in slower cell death, whereas those with a negative STARS value represent putative anti-viral factors where virus-induced cell death has occurred quicker, resulting in their underrepresentation in the final pool of cells. MNV-CR6 infection resulted in 212 genes being enriched and 42 being negatively selected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), whereas for MNV-CW3 279 and 18 genes were positively and negatively selected respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).

The four genes identified were the MNV receptor CD300lf, the stress granule component G3BP1, the histone methytransferase Kmt2d and Smarce1, which encodes an actin dependent regulator of chromatin. The discrepancy between the screens performed here and those in previous studies likely reflects the experimental conditions under which the screens were undertaken that is 24 hr of infection vs 2–3 days in the previous screens. The previous screen was performed under much more stringent conditions that were unlikely to identify proteins that play a role in the norovirus life cycle but are not essential. Pathway over-representation analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Liao et al., 2019</xref>) of the genes pro-viral genes identified in the CRISPR screens performed in this study highlighted mRNA processing, RNA splicing and methylation as the three most highly represented gene ontology (GO) terms (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). The gene encoding PTBP1, polypyrimidine tract binding protein, was one of the genes identified in these enriched GO terms. PTBP1 is a protein we have previously shown to bind to a 3’ pyrimidine-rich stretch in the MNV genome which is important for viral pathogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bailey et al., 2010</xref>). The interaction of PTBP1 with the viral 3’ end also facilitates the recruitment of PTBP1 to the viral replication complex where it contributes to an as yet undefined aspect of the norovirus life cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Vashist et al., 2012b</xref>).</p><p>A cross-comparison of the data obtained from all three approaches allowed us to identify several host proteins that were common to all screens (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>).

A clear defect was observed in the ability to replicate to produce infectious virus in three independently selected ΔG3BP1 cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).

Transfection of replicon RNA, purified from replicon containing cells, into BHK cells readily resulted in the formation of antibiotic resistant cell colonies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>).

The interaction between VPg and eIF4G occurs via a direct interaction between the highly conserved C-terminal region in VPg and the central HEAT domain of eIF4G (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Leen et al., 2016</xref>) and does not require any additional cellular cofactors, as a stable complex can be formed between VPg and the eIF4G HEAT domain at least in vitro. The interaction between the eIF4G HEAT domain and the eIF3 complex plays a central role in the recruitment of the 40S ribosomal subunit for translation initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Marcotrigiano et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kumar et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Villa et al., 2013</xref>). Our proteomics analysis also confirms that the norovirus VPg proteins form a complex that contains multiple components of the large and small ribosomal subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). It has been established previously that G3BP1 associates with 40S subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kedersha et al., 2016</xref>). To assess a potential role for G3BP1 in the formation of VPg-driven translation complexes in cells, we examined the ability of GFP tagged versions of MNV VPg to pull down ribosomal proteins in the presence and absence of G3BP1. GFP-tagged WT MNV VPg was readily able to pull down eIF4G, G3BP1 and RpS6, a component of the 40S subunit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>). However, in the absence of G3BP1, the ability to pull down RpS6 and RpS3 was lost (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref>). Furthermore, we found that disruption of the VPg-eIF4G interaction by the introduction of the F123A mutation into the eIF4G binding domain, also significantly reduced the ability to pull down RpS6, RpS3, as well as RpL4, a component of the large ribosomal subunit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref>). We also observed that upon reconstitution of G3BP1 expression, the levels of RpS6, RpS3 and RpL4 associated with VPg were enhanced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref>). We note however that the levels of ribosomal proteins associated with the GFP-tagged VPg in this assay is relatively low, we think this reflect the fact that in the context of viral infection where VPg is covalently linked to viral RNA, secondary interactions between translation initiation factors and the viral RNA likely stabilise this complex. We have previously seen that the eIF4A protein binds directly to the 5’ end of the sapovirus genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hosmillo et al., 2016</xref>). Furthermore, eIF4G is known to make secondary stabilising interactions with the template RNA that are critical for translation initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Yanagiya et al., 2009</xref>). Therefore we hypothesise that in the absence of covalently linked viral RNA, the association of VPg with ribosomal subunits is less robust and therefore less able to be maintained during the purification process used in the GFP-Trap approach. Therefore, to assess how the loss of G3BP1 may influence the association of VPg-linked viral RNA with ribosomal subunits in a more physiologically relevant system, we quantified the amount of viral VPg-linked RNA bound to ribosomal subunits by RNA-IP. By inclusion of the viral RNA polymerase inhibitor 2CMC we were able to assess viral RNA association with ribosomal proteins in the absence of viral RNA synthesis. We found that in the absence of G3BP1, the amount of viral RNA associated with the ribosomal subunit protein RpS3 was decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>).

This approach enabled us to assess only the capacity of the incoming parental viral RNA to assemble into translationally active complexes, a stage often referred to as the ‘maiden round’ of RNA virus genome translation. To this aim, cells were infected with MNV in the presence of 2CMC and polysomes profiling on extracts prepared from cells at 4 and 9 hr post infection performed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A</xref>). Quantification of the viral RNA levels in cells in the presence of 2CMC confirmed that the absence of G3BP1 has no impact on the overall levels present at the time points examined (data not shown). We noted that even in the presence of 2CMC, which inhibits viral RNA synthesis, there was a small but measurable increase in free 80S ribosomes over time in WT cells but not in cells lacking G3BP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A</xref>). We have previously found that MNV infection results in translation shut off and that this effect is at least partially due to the activity of the NS6 protease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Emmott et al., 2017</xref>). The fact we observed 80S accumulation in WT cells, even in the absence of viral RNA synthesis, but not in cells lacking G3BP1, indirectly lead us to suspect that translation of viral RNA had occurred in WT cells, but was much less efficient in cells lacking G3BP1. Further analyses indicated that while most ribosome-associated norovirus RNA in WT cells was found in polysomes containing fractions, less viral RNA was found in ribosome-containing fractions (1–12 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A and B</xref>) in the absence of G3BP1 and, in comparison to WT cells, very little viral RNA was found in fractions containing polysomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B</xref>).

Originally identified as a protein that interacted with Ras-GTPase activating protein (RasGAP), more than two decades of research have significantly expanded our knowledge of the multifunctional role in cellular processes. It is now well accepted that G3BPs play a role in cancer cell survival, cancer metastasis and invasion, processing of specific miRNAs and stress granule formation (Reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alam and Kennedy, 2019</xref>). Stress granules are dynamic cytoplasmic ribonucleoprotein complexes that form rapidly under stress conditions and within which cellular RNAs are stored in stalled translation complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Protter and Parker, 2016</xref>). In the context of viral infection, numerous studies have suggested that many, if not all, viruses must interact in some manner with stress granules as there is growing evidence that the formation of cytoplasmic stress granules is part of the anti-viral defense mechanism (Reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">McCormick and Khaperskyy, 2017</xref>). Some viruses interact with stress granules to promote viral replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cristea et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kim et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Panas et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Panas et al., 2012</xref>) whereas some do so to counteract the inhibitory effect of stress granules on the translation of viral RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Panas et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">White et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Our data suggests that G3BP1 plays a key role in promoting the translation of norovirus VPg-linked viral RNA. Positive sense RNA viruses have evolved mechanisms to ensure the efficient translation of their viral genomic RNAs in the presence of high concentrations of competing cellular RNAs. These mechanisms include the use of internal ribosome entry site elements (IRES), modified cap-dependent mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Firth and Brierley, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jaafar and Kieft, 2019</xref>) and the ability to target the host cell translation machinery to generate an environment where viral RNA translation is favoured over cellular capped RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Walsh et al., 2013</xref>). G3BP1 is thought to associate primarily with free 40S subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kedersha et al., 2016</xref>). Our data supports a hypothesis whereby the association of G3BP1 with 40S ribosomal subunits somehow stabilises the recruitment of a translation initiation complex to the 5’ end of the VPg-linked viral RNA genome, promoting VPg-dependent translation and thereby uncovering a new function in virus specific translation. The mechanism by which G3BP1 contributes to this process has yet to be fully explored but our data supports the hypothesis that G3BP1 directly or indirectly promotes the recruitment of ribosomal subunits to VPg-driven translation complexes. The RGG motif of G3BP1 is known to be essential for the association between G3BP1 and 40S subunits as well as the ability to from stress granules, whereas data would suggest that the RRM may play a regulatory role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kedersha et al., 2016</xref>). These domains were also required for the function of G3BP1 in the norovirus life cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) confirming that the G3BP1 association with 40S is important for its role in promoting norovirus VPg-dependent translation. Importantly, RGG domains are known to have many functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Thandapani et al., 2013</xref>) and therefore in the context of G3BP1 function in the norovirus life cycle, may also contribute to unknown interactions that promote norovirus translation. Previous work on alphaviruses have shown that G3BP1 is sequestered by binding to the nsP3 protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Panas et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Panas et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Panas et al., 2015</xref>). Furthermore, this interaction occurs via an FGDF motif also found in other viral proteins including the ICP8 protein of herpes simplex virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Panas et al., 2015</xref>). While the MNV VPg protein has a similar motif FGDGF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), this motif is not conserved in the GI Norwalk virus VPg protein. Therefore, our data suggest that the interaction of VPg with G3BP1 is not direct, fitting with our observation that this interaction is reduced by mutations in the eIF4G binding domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>.) While our data fit with a primary role for G3BP1 in norovirus translation, we are unable to exclude the possibility that G3BP1 plays other roles in the viral life cycle. Recent studies have confirmed that G3BP1 is enriched at sites of viral RNA synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brocard et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fritzlar et al., 2019</xref>) so it is possible that G3BP1 makes multiple contacts between the 40S subunit and viral RNA genome directly. These additional contacts, may further promote viral VPg-dependent translation and/or another aspect of the viral life cycle.</p><p>The technical challenges associated with studying human norovirus replication in cell culture have limited the experimental approaches we could use to validate the role of G3BP1 in human norovirus translation. However, our results have clearly demonstrated that in the absence of G3BP1, human Norwalk virus is unable to replicate or form replicon-containing colonies. Furthermore we were able to show that BV2 murine microglial cells support the replication of the HuNoV GI replicon, albeit it to a lesser degree than BHK or U20S cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). These data confirm that all the machinery necessary for HuNoV replication is conserved between human, hamster and mouse cells. Furthermore, reconstitution of the ΔG3BP1 BV2 microglial cells with WT G3BP1, at least partially restored the ability of the HuNoV GI replicon to form colonies, confirming the specificity of the effect. The presence of G3BP1 in the NV VPg-containing complexes again fits with our hypothesis that G3BP1 plays a role in promoting viral VPg-dependent protein synthesis.</p><p>We have previously found that norovirus infection leads to preferential viral-translation whereby cellular mRNAs induced in response to norovirus infection are inefficiently translated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Emmott et al., 2017</xref>). This modification of host cell translation is at least partially driven by the ability of the viral NS6 protease to cleave PABP and the induction of apoptosis which results in cleavage of cellular translation initiation factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Emmott et al., 2017</xref>). Importantly, whilst caspase cleaved translation initiation factors do not support host cell cap-dependent translation, we have previously found that the cleaved forms of eIF4G do support norovirus VPg-dependent translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Emmott et al., 2017</xref>). The ability of the norovirus protease to cleave PABP and other substrates is also controlled by polyprotein processing and interactions with other viral proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Emmott et al., 2019</xref>). Recent work confirms that the preferential viral translation is not driven by the GCN2-mediated phosphorylation of eIF2α in MNV infected cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brocard et al., 2018</xref>). We note however that others have suggested that NS3 may contribute to the translational shut off seen in MNV infected cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fritzlar et al., 2019</xref>), with the caveat that this observation was made outside of the context of infected cells and used overexpressed tagged viral proteins. We suspect that noroviruses use multiple mechanisms that work cooperatively to enable the control of host gene expression and the subsequent translation of the cellular mRNAs. The relative contribution of these processes in any given cell type may also vary dependent on the degree to which the cells can sense and respond to viral infection through the induction of innate and apoptotic responses.</p><p>The observation that many of the factors enriched using the VPg protein were only enriched on complexes purified with NS1/2 tagged infectious MNV, could suggest that the viral proteins present in the viral translation complex are distinct from those present in complexes active for viral RNA synthesis. However, we cannot formally rule out other possible explanations including the possibility that the specific enrichment of translation factors on NS1/2 occurs because NS1/2 is the first protein to be translated from ORF1, therefore unprocessed NS1/2 at the N-terminus of the ORF1 polyprotein being actively translated could function as an anchor, facilitating the enrichment of ribosomes and the associated factors. In addition, we have previously seen that VPg-containing precursors may bind the translation initiation factor eIF4G less well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Leen et al., 2016</xref>), which could prevent some VPg (NS5) containing precursors associating with translation initiation complexes. Furthermore, the norovirus replication complex contains a number of highly conserved viral protein-viral protein interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Emmott et al., 2019</xref>). Within this network of interactions, the NS1/2 protein interacts with the viral RNA polymerase NS7, which in turn binds VPg. It is therefore possible that the interactions observed between the NS1/2 proteins and the host proteins involved in translation, occurs via the formation of a NS1/2-NS7-VPg complex. How the viral protein-protein interactions within the replication complex integrate with the network of cellular proteins identified in the current study and how this facilitates viral replication and/or regulates the host response to infection, remains to be determined.</p><p>This study provides an unprecedented insight into the identity of host factors likely involved in the norovirus life cycle. As detailed above, we focused our detailed analysis on the role of G3BP1 given that it was identified in all three screens, however it is likely that many of the host factors identified in each screen play key roles in the norovirus life cycle. The high enrichment of proteins involved in vesicle-mediated transport, organelle organisation and exocytosis, fits well with our current understanding on the nature of the norovirus replication complex and the impact on host cell processes. Detailed analysis of the impact of norovirus non-structural protein expression and MNV infection on host cell membrane architecture suggests that norovirus replication complexes are generated from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and results in the formation of single membrane vesicles (SMVs), double membrane vesicles (DMVs) and multi membrane vesicles (MMVs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Doerflinger et al., 2017</xref>) . The process by which the non-structural proteins induce the formation of these structures is unknown, but the NS1/2 and NS4 proteins are thought to be key to the process. We have previously reported that the NS1/2 protein from MNV and HuNoV interacts with the VapA and VapB proteins and that this interaction is required for efficient viral replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">McCune et al., 2017</xref>). The norovirus NS4 protein associates with lipid droplets and is able to drive the formation of SMVs and DMVs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Doerflinger et al., 2017</xref>), suggesting that it may regulate the biosynthetic pathways involved in lipid synthesis or intracellular vesicular transport pathways. Our characterisation of the replication complex indicates an intimate link with numerous proteins involved in vesicle transport and lipid metabolism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Given that NS1/2 and NS4 interact to form a complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Emmott et al., 2019</xref>), it is likely they work in concert to drive the formation of membrane-bound replication complex by regulating the functions of multiple components, the characterisation of which will require further analysis.</p><p>In conclusion, our data adds significantly to the growing body of literature on the role of G3BP proteins in the life cycle of viruses and further extends the functional roles of G3BP1 to include the promotion of viral translation processes. We identify G3BP1 as a host protein that has a critical role in the life cycle of murine and human noroviruses, identifying the first cellular pro-viral protein with pan-norovirus activity. Furthermore, given the apparent importance of G3BP1 to an early stage of the norovirus life cycle, this work suggests that targeting G3BP1 may hold future therapeutic potential.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Grants</title><p>CBW was supported by NIH K08 AI128043 and Burroughs Wellcome Fund.

Clone 1B2 also had three independent deletions at the sgRNA binding site resulting in deletions of 1, 2, and five base pairs respectively.

G3BP1 knockout BV2 cell clones A, C and F were generated using an independent approach that relied on first generating a pool of three lentiviruses carrying guide RNAs <named-content content-type="sequence">TGTGCAACATGTCCGGGGCC</named-content>, <named-content content-type="sequence">CAAACTCCCGCCCGACCAGC</named-content> and <named-content content-type="sequence">TAGTCCCCTGCTGGTCGGGC</named-content> targeting the first 100 bp of the coding sequence, cloned into pLentiCRISPRv2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sanjana et al., 2014</xref>).

Mouse G3BP1 was subcloned from pCM6-G3BP1 (MR207441; Origene). Mouse G3BP1 lentiviral constructs deficient in the C-terminal RGG domain (mG3BP1ΔRGG) and the RGG and RRM domains (mG3BP1ΔRGGRRM) were generated by Gibson cloning from the pCMV6-G3BP1 vector. Lentivirus was generated by co-transfecting pCDH-G3BP1-T2A-puro-MSCV with pCMV-VSV-G and pSPAX2 into 293 T cells with Trans-IT LT1 (Mirus Biosciences) per manufacture instructions. Two days post-transfection, supernatants were harvested, filtered through a 0.22 micron filter, and stored at −80C.

Infected cells were flash frozen at −80°C at the times post infection indicated in the text. Viral replication was then assessed by plaque assay or TCID50 in BV2 cells as described in the text.

BV2 cells stably expressing Cas9 nuclease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Orchard et al., 2016</xref>) were transduced with the Brie library using previously described protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Doench et al., 2016</xref>).

The screen relies on the premise that guide RNAs targeting genes that are overrepresented following infection represent genes that when disrupted are protected against infection and therefore likely represent factors with pro-viral activity. Likewise, genes for which guide RNA are underrepresented suggest that infection had proceeded faster and the gene is anti-viral. Following sequencing, the data was analyzed by STARS method as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Doench et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Orchard et al., 2016</xref>).

After 1 hr, the inoculum was then removed; the cells were washed and maintained in growth media containing 2-CMC accordingly until the cells were harvested at 4 hr and 9 h p.i. Prior to harvesting, cells were treated with cycloheximide (CHX) for 10 mins at 37°C (Sigma-Aldrich; 100 µg/ml) and were rinsed with 5 ml of ice-cold PBS supplemented with CHX 100 µg/ml. Polysome lysis buffer [20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl, 1 mM DTT, 1% Triton X-100, 100 µg/ml cycloheximide, 25 U/ml TURBO DNase (Life Technologies)] was used to lyse the cells. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation for 20 min at 13,000 <italic>g</italic> at 4°C. Aliquots of the lysates were collected for BSA assay and qPCR analysis against MNV1 RNA before proceeding with fractionation. Input lysates were normalised to total protein concentration and RT-qPCR was used to confirm the levels of viral RNA in samples were comparable. Lysates were subjected next to 10–50% sucrose gradient centrifugation for 90 mins SW41Ti rotor at 190,000 <italic>x g</italic> at 4°C. The gradients were fractionated at 0.5 ml/min and the levels of RNA in each sample measured using an in line-254 nm spectrophotometer connected to a chart recorder. RNAs were extracted from each fraction, converted to cDNA and immediately used for qPCR. The distribution of viral RNA across the gradient was then calculated as percentage (%) of the viral RNA seen in WT BV2 cells using the reference gene (GAPDH) to obtain normalised values across the gradient. Samples were performed in duplicates on the same qPCR plate, and the observations were robust across three independent experiments. Data were collected using a ViiA 7 Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems).</p></sec><sec id="s4-18"><title>Transfection of VPg-linked MNV RNA into BV2 cells</title><p>VPg-linked RNA purified from MNV-1 virus particles was transfected in BV2 cells using NEON as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Yunus et al., 2010</xref>). Total cell lysates were harvested at 3 and 9 hr post transfection with RIPA buffer. 10 μg total lysates were analysed by 4–12% SDS-PAGE (Invitrogen) and antibodies against MNV, VPg, G3BP1 and GAPDH were used for detection using LI-COR Odyssey CLx. Virus yield was determined by TCID<sub>50</sub>. For strand-specific qPCR detection of MNV RNA, total cellular RNA was extracted using GeneElute Mammalian Total RNA Miniprep kit (Sigma).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Karla Kirkegaard as the Reviewing and Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of the submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Volker Thiel (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This manuscript does an excellent job of documenting three different methods to identify potential host factors in the growth of murine and human noroviruses. One of them focuses on proteins present in complexes that contain VPg, a protein that is covalently linked to the genome. Known to be a primer of viral RNA synthesis, an hypothesis that focuses this host factor search is that it is likely that VPg is also involved in translation of the viral genome. Of the many interesting candidates, they choose to study further a member of the stress granule complex, GCBP1. This is a good choice because of the abundant literature on both proviral and antiviral effects of this complex, so mechanistic detail for the observed proviral role is of great interest.</p><p>Overall, this is a data-rich study leading to a novel and very interesting function of G3BP1 during norovirus replication. Given the technical limitations associated with experimental systems for norovirus infection, this study will be a valuable resource for future research. Each screen contains a wealth of interesting hits that will stimulate the field of RNA virus research, and the authors are requested to include additional information on the individual screens.</p><p>While the authors present strong evidence for the critical role that G3BP1 plays in norovirus infection generally, the mechanistic studies showing that it functions to recruit 40S ribosomes to the initiation complex and that it provides a competitive advantage to viral genomes compared to cellular RNAs need strengthening. Specific comments below include the inclusion of additional data, more straightforward interpretation of the existing data, and increased clarity of presentation.</p><p>Major comments: Experimental</p><p>1) In Figure 9, the amount of RpS6 that is co-immunoprecipitated with the VpG fusion is so low that it is difficult to be completely convinced that it is higher in the presence than in the absence of G3BP1. Considering this is the key finding of the figure, the authors are encouraged to strengthen this finding, perhaps by examining other 40S subunit proteins. Additionally, a critical test that G3BP1 is required for VPg association with translational initiation complexes would be to repeat much of the data in Figure 1 in the absence of G3BP1.</p><p>2) Figure 11 as it currently stands cannot be evaluated because insufficient experimental details are provided. The authors should explain how experiments to analyze cap- and IRES-dependent translation were performed.</p><p>3) The interpretation that addition of cellular RNAs enhances the reduction of viral translation in the absence of G3BP1 is based on results in Figure 11D-E. These data are highly normalized and it is not convincing that the 80% reduction in viral translation is significantly different from 40-50% reduction in the absence of cellular RNAs. This would seem to require a large number of replicates and statistical stringency to conclude. Besides, this argument only indirectly supports an hypothesis that cellular and viral RNAs compete for translational machinery, which is only one explanation for the proposed preferential translation of viral RNAs. Thus, it could be deleted and replaced with an experiment that speaks more to translational efficiency, such as ribosomal occupancy or quantitation of protein synthesis in a pulsed labeling experiment.</p><p>Major comments: Interpretation and explication</p><p>1) The term &quot;translational bias&quot; might confuse some readers because &quot;bias&quot; in the context of translation is usually used to discuss codon preference. Perhaps &quot;preferential translation&quot; of viral over cellular RNA would be more clear.</p><p>2) The evidence that bias or preferential translation of viral RNA over cellular RNA observed in wild-type-infected cells is caused by GCBP1 is not yet convincing. It is clearly shown that translation of viral RNA is inhibited in the absence of GCBP1 and translation of host RNA is not. However, preferential translation or bias in productively infected cells means that GCBP1 makes viral translation 'better' than host translation. How would this be measured? Perhaps ribosomal occupancy of host mRNA in the presence and absence of viral infection, in the presence and absence of GCBP1? As it stands, GCBP1 has been shown to specifically promote viral translation, but not bias.</p><p>3) The sixth paragraph of the Discussion is a list of observations from the literature that is not easy to follow. It doesn't really matter who did what experiment. The point is that the basis for any observed preferential translation of viral vs. host capped messages could have several origins. There are several pieces of data that bear on this point that could be presented logically as consistent with different hypotheses. This is interesting and should be more clearly explained.</p><p>4) Determination of the norovirus replication complex proteome: This section is of high interest and the authors are encouraged to extend the data analysis. For example, in the last paragraph of the subsection “Determination of the norovirus replication complex proteome”, there is a very brief comment concerning the degree of overlap between the data using VPg as a bait protein and the NS1/2 tagged or NS4 tagged viruses. Please elucidate a bit more on what that implies.</p><p>5) Similarly, the CRISPR data set is of high interest and the authors are encouraged to extend the data analysis. Specifically, a comparison to previously published CRISPR screens could be provided. Are there some common themes, pathways or cellular processes amongst the putative pro- and anti-viral factors?</p><p>6) In the subsection “G3BP1 is required for the association of VPg with 40S ribosomal subunits”, the authors state that the interaction between VPg and eIF4G occurs via a direct interaction between the highly conserved C-terminal region in VPg and the central HEAT domain of eIF4G (Leen et al., 2016) and does not require any additional cellular cofactors, at least in vitro. These experiments were performed in translation-competent extracts, and thus contain many cellular proteins that may very well be conserved. Therefore, it is not shown that the 'interaction is direct', if this means that GCBP1 and VPg binding would occur in isolation, as opposed to both being part of a stable complex that contains multiple proteins. This does not matter for the very interesting findings of the paper, but does for the biochemical mechanism of ribosome recruitment.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46681.031</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[…] While the authors present strong evidence for the critical role that G3BP1 plays in norovirus infection generally, the mechanistic studies showing that it functions to recruit 40S ribosomes to the initiation complex and that it provides a competitive advantage to viral genomes compared to cellular RNAs need strengthening.

We note that the study is “data rich” and that reading it will have taken a considerable amount of their time – we are grateful for this. We have taken on board the comments and as a result we have substantially revised the text and included additional experimental data where appropriate. In hindsight we feel that the message that G3BP1 provides a competitive advantage to viral translation is confusing and one that is not particularly well supported by the data we can obtain using the experimental approaches currently available to us – we have therefore toned down this narrative. Instead we emphasise the conclusion that G3BP1 plays a role in the novel paradigm of viral VPg-dependent translation initiation. The further dissection of the precise role for G3BP1 requires a fully in vitro reconstituted norovirus translation initiation system using purified translation initiation factors and ribosomal subunits. This is an approach we are working on, but which we feel is beyond the scope of the current study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major comments: Experimental</p><p>1) In Figure 9, the amount of RpS6 that is co-immunoprecipitated with the VpG fusion is so low that it is difficult to be completely convinced that it is higher in the presence than in the absence of G3BP1. Considering this is the key finding of the figure, the authors are encouraged to strengthen this finding, perhaps by examining other 40S subunit proteins. Additionally, a critical test that G3BP1 is required for VPg association with translational initiation complexes would be to repeat much of the data in Figure 1 in the absence of G3BP1.</p></disp-quote><p>We accept the reviewers comments re the blots and we have invested the bulk of our time and effort in trying to address this particular issue. As part of the revision process we have purchased many additional antibodies to ribosomal proteins, many of which have failed to work in one or more of the assays we have attempted.As the reviewers are probably aware, we are somewhat restricted by the nature of the experimental systems we have available for noroviruses – in this case we are using overexpressed VPg in transfected cells, which importantly is not linked to the viral RNA genome. We find that the complex formed between overexpressed VPg and the ribosomal proteins to be somewhat unstable, most likely due to the fact that the interaction within the complex occurs by VPg binding first to eIF4G, which in turn binds eIF3 and then the ribosomal subunits. In the context of the viral infection, this complex is likely stabilised via secondary interactions between the initiation factors and the viral RNA which is covalently linked to VPg. We have previously published that eIF4A bindings to the sapovirus RNA genome directly and it is already well-established in the literature that eIF4G makes secondary RNA-protein contacts. Therefore maintaining the stability of this ternary complex throughout the multiple steps of the IP using VPg alone is challenging. We have amended the text according to make this clear.</p><p>To address the reviewers comment further, we have repeated the experiments multiple times and have now replaced the previous panel with another panel and supplementary figures that now include RpS6, RpS6 and RpL4. In addition we include data that demonstrates that the interaction is largely restored in the ΔG3BP1 cell line reconstituted with wild type G3BP1. We accept that the levels of the ribosomal proteins detected by western blot are still low, and further confounded by their abundance and rather ‘sticky’ nature, but we feel this has to be taken in the light of the fact that the VPg expressed in this context is <underline>not</underline> linked to viral RNA and therefore the secondary interactions with RNA that would stabilise this complex are not present. Therefore in addition, we have assessed the amount of viral RNA associated with ribosomal proteins (i.e. RpS3) using RNA-IP. Again, we consistently see that in the absence of G3BP1, the amount of viral RNA associated with ribosomal proteins is significantly reduced. The new data is included in the revised Figure 9 and an additional Figure 9—figure supplement 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Figure 11 as it currently stands cannot be evaluated because insufficient experimental details are provided. The authors should explain how experiments to analyze cap- and IRES-dependent translation were performed.</p></disp-quote><p>See comments above and below re the modifications to Figure 11– we have significantly modified the composition of this figure in light of the reviewers comments and have now included a clearer explanation of the method used to analyse the cap and IRES-dependent translation in the cytoplasmic extracts.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The interpretation that addition of cellular RNAs enhances the reduction of viral translation in the absence of G3BP1 is based on results in Figure 11D-E. These data are highly normalized and it is not convincing that the 80% reduction in viral translation is significantly different from 40-50% reduction in the absence of cellular RNAs. This would seem to require a large number of replicates and statistical stringency to conclude. Besides, this argument only indirectly supports an hypothesis that cellular and viral RNAs compete for translational machinery, which is only one explanation for the proposed preferential translation of viral RNAs. Thus, it could be deleted and replaced with an experiments that speaks more to translational efficiency, such as ribosomal occupancy or quantitation of protein synthesis in a pulsed labeling experiment.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers comments and thank them for highlighting the conceptual challenges this data presents. In light of their comments we have removed the component of the figure where we assess the impact of adding back cellular RNAs to nuclease treated extracts as we feel that this is a too artefactual. We believe that in order to be confident on the role of G3BP1 in the preferential translation of viral RNA we will need to establish a fully in vitro reconstituted translation system using purified ribosomal subunits and translation initiation factors, a significant undertaking in its own right. We aim to do this as part of a future study and have therefore revised Figure 11 to include in vitro analyses performed using nuclease treated extracts (panels D and E) and non-nuclease treated extracts (panels F and G). We find in both cases the translation efficiency is reduced in the absence of G3BP1. Whilst the reduction is modest (~50%), this likely reflect the in vitronature of the assay and the potent effect of this reduction on viral replication is likely amplified over the multiple rounds of replication. The revised figure still support our hypothesis that G3BP1 promotes norovirus VPg-dependent translation. The text has been updated to reflect these changes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major comments: Interpretation and explication</p><p>1) The term &quot;translational bias&quot; might confuse some readers because &quot;bias&quot; in the context of translation is usually used to discuss codon preference. Perhaps &quot;preferential translation&quot; of viral over cellular RNA would be more clear.</p></disp-quote><p>As detailed above, upon reflection we feel that this narrative is somewhat confusing and we have therefore de-emphasised this particular hypothesis. Instead we focus purely on the observation that in the absence of G3BP1, norovirus a RNA is translated less efficiently and is recruited to ribosomal subunits (and polysomes) less efficiently. This observation represents a new function for G3BP1. We have changed the text accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The evidence that bias or preferential translation of viral RNA over cellular RNA observed in wild-type-infected cells is caused by GCBP1 is not yet convincing. It is clearly shown that translation of viral RNA is inhibited in the absence of GCBP1 and translation of host RNA is not. However, preferential translation or bias in productively infected cells means that GCBP1 makes viral translation 'better' than host translation. How would this be measured? Perhaps ribosomal occupancy of host mRNA in the presence and absence of viral infection, in the presence and absence of GCBP1? As it stands, GCBP1 has been shown to specifically promote viral translation, but not bias.</p></disp-quote><p>See response to comments above. In response to the reviewers comments we have revised Figure 11 and de-emphasised the hypothesis that G3BP1 provides a translational advantage to viral RNA, simplifying the message that G3BP1 plays a key role in the novel paradigm of viral VPg-dependent translation used by noroviruses.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The sixth paragraph of the Discussion is a list of observations from the literature that is not easy to follow. It doesn't really matter who did what experiment. The point is that the basis for any observed preferential translation of viral vs. host capped messages could have several origins. There are several pieces of data that bear on this point that could be presented logically as consistent with different hypotheses. This is interesting and should be more clearly explained.</p></disp-quote><p>We have amended the text to remove the emphasis on who did what experiments and when they were performed, to improve the overall clarity of this paragraph.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Determination of the norovirus replication complex proteome: This section is of high interest and the authors are encouraged to extend the data analysis. For example, in the last paragraph of the subsection “Determination of the norovirus replication complex proteome”, there is a very brief comment concerning the degree of overlap between the data using VPg as a bait protein and the NS1/2 tagged or NS4 tagged viruses. Please elucidate a bit more on what that implies.</p></disp-quote><p>We acknowledge the value of this data to those in the field and the rather limited nature of our initial analyses. We have amended the supplementary figure to include additional analysis, added an additional supplementary figure and added additional text to the Results and Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Similarly, the CRISPR data set is of high interest and the authors are encouraged to extend the data analysis. Specifically, a comparison to previously published CRISPR screens could be provided. Are there some common themes, pathways or cellular processes amongst the putative pro- and anti-viral factors?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the data obtained from the CRISPR screen will contain a wealth of information that will be invaluable to the field and accept that our initial submission failed to provide a suitable analysis of this. We have taken on board the reviewers comments and tried to address this without being too verbose. We have compared our CRISPR data with that previously published and provide a list of genes enriched in both in a revised Supplementary file 4 – we find surprisingly little overlap, likely reflecting the experimental conditions under which the screens were performed i.e. the previous screens were performed under much more stringent conditions that were unlikely to identify proteins that play a role in the norovirus life cycle but are not essential. We have also added additional data analysis to the Results section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) In the subsection “G3BP1 is required for the association of VPg with 40S ribosomal subunits”, the authors state that the interaction between VPg and eIF4G occurs via a direct interaction between the highly conserved C-terminal region in VPg and the central HEAT domain of eIF4G (Leen et al., 2016) and does not require any additional cellular cofactors, at least in vitro. These experiments were performed in translation-competent extracts, and thus contain many cellular proteins that may very well be conserved. Therefore, it is not shown that the 'interaction is direct', if this means that GCBP1 and VPg binding would occur in isolation, as opposed to both being part of a stable complex that contains multiple proteins. This does not matter for the very interesting findings of the paper, but does for the biochemical mechanism of ribosome recruitment.</p></disp-quote><p>We are unsure as to the meaning of the reviewers comment but wish to clarify that the previous study was performed using recombinant proteins where we were able to demonstrate that the small C-terminal domain of VPg binds directly to the central domain of eIF4G without the aid of any additional factors. We have amended the text to ensure this point is clearer.</p></body></sub-article></article>
