Neural stem cells <italic>in vivo</italic> are located in a relative hypoxic environment, and hypoxia enhances their survival, proliferation and stemness <italic>in vitro</italic>. Thus, we hypothesized that migration of IPCs away from hypoxic zones within the SGZ might result in oxidative damage, thus triggering cell death. Hypoxic niches were observed along the SGZ, composed of adult NSCs and early IPCs, and oxidative byproducts were present in adjacent late IPCs and neuroblasts. Stabilizing hypoxia inducible factor-1Î± with dimethyloxallyl glycine increased early survival, but not proliferation or differentiation, in neurospheres <italic>in vitro</italic> and in newly born SGZ cells <italic>in vivo</italic>. Rescue experiments in <italic>Bax<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mutants supported these results. We propose that localized hypoxia within the SGZ contributes to the neurogenic microenvironment and determines the early, activity-independent survival of adult hippocampal newborn cells.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><back><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interest</title><fn fn-type="conflict" id="conf1"><p>The authors declare that no competing interests exist.</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Animal experimentation: All procedures were performed according to the National Institutes of Health Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and have been conducted with the approval of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (#IP00000148) and the Insitutional Biosafety Committee (#04-06) at Oregon Health and Science University.</p></fn></fn-group></back></article>
