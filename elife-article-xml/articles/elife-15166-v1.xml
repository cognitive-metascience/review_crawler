behavior. ‘Shared experience’ theories propose common brain representations for somatic and vicarious pain, but other evidence suggests that specialized circuits are required to experience others’ suffering. Combining functional neuroimaging with multivariate pattern analyses, we identified dissociable patterns that predicted somatic (high versus low: 100%) and vicarious (high versus low: 100%) pain intensity in out-of-sample individuals. Critically, each pattern was at chance in predicting the other experience, demonstrating separate modifiability of both patterns. Somatotopy (upper versus lower limb: 93% accuracy for both conditions) was also distinct, located in somatosensory versus mentalizing-related circuits for somatic and vicarious pain, respectively. Two additional studies demonstrated the generalizability of the somatic pain pattern (which was originally developed on thermal pain) to mechanical and electrical pain, and also demonstrated the replicability of the somatic/vicarious dissociation. These findings suggest possible mechanisms underlying limitations in feeling others’ pain, and present new, more specific, brain targets for studying pain empathy.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.15166.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.15166.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15166.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The ability to experience others’ pain is a cornerstone of empathy, and binds us together in times of hardship. However, we have not yet fully understood the complex interactions in the brain that make people empathetic to others’ suffering. One possibility is that we experience others’ pain through the activation of the same brain regions as those that enable us to experience physical pain ourselves.</p><p>To test this idea, Krishnan et al. compared patterns of brain activity in human volunteers as they experienced pain (from heat being applied to their forearm or foot) or watched images of others’ hands or feet being injured. While watching these images, the volunteers were asked to try to imagine that the injuries were happening to their own bodies.</p><p>The patterns of brain activity that arose when the volunteers observed someone else in pain did not overlap with the patterns produced when the volunteers experienced pain themselves. Instead, seeing someone else in pain activated regions involved in taking another person’s perspective. This process, which is known as mentalizing, involves thinking about the other person’s thoughts, intentions and preferences. Thus within the brain, the experience of observing someone else in pain is distinct from that of experiencing physical pain in oneself.</p><p>The results presented by Krishnan et al. raise new questions about how the brain regions involved in empathy help us to relate to other people when they experience different types of pain. Future studies should explore the factors that influence our ability to adopt another’s perspective, and whether it might be possible to improve this ability.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.15166.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.15166.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>pain</kwd><kwd>empathy</kwd><kwd>fMRI</kwd><kwd>multivariate patterns</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01MH076136</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wager</surname><given-names>Tor D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01DA035484</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wager</surname><given-names>Tor D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R21MH083164</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fan</surname><given-names>Jin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Understanding others' pain is grounded in cognitive rather than sensory faculties.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><disp-quote><p>“Though our brother is upon the rack, as long as we ourselves are at our ease, our senses will never inform us of what he suffers. … it is by the imagination only that we can form any conception of what are his sensations.”</p><attrib>Adam Smith (1759)</attrib></disp-quote><p>A fundamental feature of social interactions is our capacity for vicarious experience—the ability to perceive another person’s affective state, reference it to ourselves, and generate an emotional response. This ability provides the foundation for empathy and cooperative behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Smith, 1759</xref>) by allowing us to recognize and respond to suffering in others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Batson et al., 1981</xref>), and learn from their experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Olsson and Phelps, 2007</xref>). Vicarious experiences of others’ pain, in particular, aid in representing others’ distress with sufficient vividness and importance that we are moved to action.</p><p>But how do we represent others’ pain, and how vivid and automatic are such representations? Theories differ markedly on this point. One theory suggests that vicarious pain involves <italic>shared experience</italic>, activating neural circuits that represent somatic pain in the perceiver. Such theories are based largely on overlapping activity in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and anterior insular (aINS) cortices when both experiencing pain and observing pain in others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Corradi-Dell'Acqua et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Jackson et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">2006a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lamm et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Ogino et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Singer et al., 2004</xref>). Such overlaps have also been found in primary and secondary somatosensory areas [i.e., SI and SII] (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Jackson et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Keysers et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Lamm et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Singer et al., 2004</xref>). Witnessing others in pain can increase one’s own pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Langford et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Loggia et al., 2008</xref>), and placebos given for somatic pain can also reduce vicarious ‘pain’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Rütgen et al., 2015</xref>). Together, these findings have been taken as brain evidence for shared representation of pain. In particular, dACC and aINS activation are thought to reflect a kind of shared experience that has been described in terms of 'neural resonance' (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Zaki et al., 2012</xref>), and as 'automatic' (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Singer et al., 2004</xref>). By this account, empathy is 'built <italic>bottom up</italic> from relatively simple mechanisms of action production and perception' (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Iacoboni, 2009</xref>).</p><p>Another theory suggests that vicarious pain may be primarily a reflective, cognitive experience whose experiential qualities are hard to mimic or simulate directly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hooker et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Loewenstein, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Morley and Morley, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Zaki, 2014</xref>). Others’ pain need not activate somatic pain representations to be aversive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chang et al., 2015</xref>), and empathy may work by engaging other emotional systems apart from ‘pain in oneself’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hooker et al., 2008</xref>). Unlike somatic pain, vicarious pain is all too easy to ignore. For example, many participants will inflict substantial pain on an innocent person when instructed to do so by authority figures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cheetham et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Milgram, 1963</xref>). We also ignore our own past and future pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gilbert et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Loewenstein, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Van Boven and Loewenstein, 2003</xref>), making decisions in line with our goals when pain is distant but often reversing those choices when pain is imminent.</p><p>Brain evidence also suggests that vicarious pain may rely on circuits specialized for representing the thoughts and intentions of others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cheetham et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Zaki et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">2009</xref>). A network encompassing the dorso-medial prefrontal cortex [dmPFC], posterior cingulate cortex [PCC], temporal-parietal junction [TPJ], and superior temporal sulcus [STS; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Frith and Frith, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Van Overwalle, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Zaki et al., 2012</xref>)] is reliably involved in ‘mentalizing’—thinking about others’ thoughts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Saxe and Kanwisher, 2003</xref>), preferences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Mitchell et al., 2006</xref>), and intentions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hampton et al., 2008</xref>)—and in imagining one’s own and others’ responses to painful stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Jackson et al., 2006a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Lamm et al., 2011</xref>). This ‘mentalizing’ network is distinct from both pain-related circuitry and circuitry thought to underlie shared affective experiences and actions, including the dACC and aINS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Frith and Frith, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Iacoboni, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Shamay-Tsoory et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Singer et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Van Overwalle and Baetens, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Zaki et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">2012</xref>).</p><p>A critical question in assessing shared representation is whether the overlapping brain activity observed really reflects shared <italic>pain-related</italic> processes. Several recent lines of evidence suggest this may not be the case. In a meta-analysis of over 3500 neuroimaging studies available from Neurosynth.org, activation in the aINS and dACC were among the most frequently observed findings across all kinds of tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Yarkoni et al., 2011</xref>), suggesting that activation in these regions frequently has nothing to do with pain. It is possible that activity in portions of the dACC is <italic>preferentially</italic> related to pain on average; for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Lieberman and Eisenberger, 2015</xref> used Neurosynth.org to identify a statistical association between studies using the term 'pain' and activation of the dACC. However, this does not mean that dACC activity is sufficient to infer pain, as the dACC responds to a variety of cognitive and emotional events that are not painful (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Wager et al., 2016</xref>). For instance, electrophysiological and optogenetic studies have identified neurons engaged during foraging behavior, attention, emotion, reward expectancy, skeletomotor and visceromotor activity, and other functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Davis et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Picard and Strick, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Shidara and Richmond, 2002</xref>). ‘Pain-encoding’ portions of the dACC can be activated in individuals with a congenital insensitivity to pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Salomons et al., 2016</xref>). Only a small minority of dACC neurons are pain-related (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Davis et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hutchison et al., 1999</xref>), and the dACC encodes emotional events, including rejection and general negative emotion, in a way that is distinct from how it encodes pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Woo et al., 2014</xref>). More fine-grained analyses of population-level representations are required to make inferences about pain based on activity in the dACC and other regions.</p><p>In this study, we attempted to identify representations (or markers) for somatic and vicarious pain—both within the dACC and aINS and across the brain—and test their similarity. For a marker (e.g., a multivariate brain pattern) to serve as a representation of pain, it should satisfy three criteria. It should: a) closely track pain experience (be <italic>sensitive</italic> to the presence of pain); b) not respond to experiences that are defined as non-painful (be pain-<italic>specific</italic>); and c) generalize across multiple forms of pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Woo and Wager, 2015</xref>). Only to the degree that brain patterns <italic>represent</italic> somatic and vicarious pain does testing their similarity bear on shared representation theories. Previous studies [e.g.,(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Corradi-Dell'Acqua et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Corradi-Dell'Acqua et al., 2016</xref>)] have compared the similarity of self-pain and other-pain patterns, but these patterns have not shown strong sensitivity to pain experience [criterion (<italic>a</italic>) above]. Indeed, prior work has suggested that sensitivity to pain and emotional experiences requires combining signals across brain regions and networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kassam et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kragel and Labar, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Nummenmaa et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Wager et al., 2015</xref>), whereas previous studies of vicarious pain have focused only on local patterns within a single region at a time. In addition, the patterns identified as shared across self- and other-pain have responded to other types of negative emotion (e.g., emotional pictures, disgust, and unfairness), and so do not satisfy criterion (<italic>b</italic>) for pain representations. Finally, no vicarious pain studies have tested generalizability of a specific brain pattern across types of pain [criterion (<italic>c</italic>)].</p><p>Here, in Study 1, we used a 3 (stimulation level) × 2 (body site) × 2 (pain modality; i.e., somatic vs. vicarious) experimental design, with pain reports after each trial, to identify patterns that predicted the level of reported somatic and vicarious pain in response to painful heat and observation of pain in others, respectively. Between-participant machine learning analyses were used to identify patterns that test <italic>sensitivity</italic> [i.e., satisfy criterion (<italic>a</italic>) above] for both pain modalities (i.e., somatic vs. vicarious), and to provide an unbiased test of similarity and cross-prediction across somatic and vicarious pain predictive patterns. In addition, we tested somatotopy (upper versus lower limb) within sensory cortices and other systems for both pain modalities, and compared the somatotopic representations. The identification of patterns that can be generalized across participants allowed us to test the specificity [criterion (<italic>b</italic>)], and generalizability [criterion (<italic>c</italic>)] of these patterns in additional studies.</p><p>Previous work has identified a pattern that is, thus far, sensitive and specific [criteria (<italic>a</italic>) and (<italic>b</italic>) above] for somatic pain across multiple studies. We used this pattern, called the Neurologic Pain Signature [NPS; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Wager et al., 2013</xref>)], in our primary analyses, and attempted to identify a parallel pattern for vicarious pain. The NPS has over 90% sensitivity and specificity in predicting somatic pain relative to several other salient states, including non-painful warmth, anticipated pain, pain recall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Wager et al., 2013</xref>), social rejection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Woo et al., 2014</xref>), and general negative emotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chang et al., 2015</xref>). In the current paper, Study 2 and Study 3 tested the generalizability of the NPS to mechanical and electrical pain, respectively [addressing criterion (<italic>c</italic>) above]. Study 3 also provided a replication of the sensitivity, specificity, and similarity of somatic and vicarious pain predictive patterns. Our primary goal was to identify—and test the similarity of—whole-brain patterns for somatic and vicarious pain that generalize across individuals and can be tested prospectively in multiple studies. However, we also conducted analyses focused on the dACC and aINS specifically, and on pain-predictive patterns identified for each individual participant. In addition, we conducted ‘searchlight’ analyses designed to test the maximal similarity of local brain patterns related to somatic and vicarious pain across the brain, and provide inferences on whether distributed, whole-brain patterns are necessary to capture representations of both somatic and vicarious pain.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Reported intensity</title><p>In Study 1, for the <italic>somatic pain</italic> condition, participants were scanned using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (<italic>f</italic>MRI) while they experienced three levels of thermal pain (46, 47 or 48°C; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) on their left volar forearm (the ‘upper limb or UL’ site) and left dorsal foot (the ‘lower limb or LL’ site), and rated the intensity of pain with their right hand following every trial.

This mirrors the side of painful stimulation from the observer’s point of view in an allocentric reference frame, but not an egocentric one; thus, laterality could conceivably play a role. To test this, we repeated the signature response analysis with a left-right flipped version of the VPS pattern (excluding the occipital cortex), which preserves the pattern but with opposite laterality.

The leave-one-participant-out SVM classifier successfully discriminated somatic pain on upper limb (UL) versus lower limb (LL) sites (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>; <italic>t<sub>Som.Pain</sub></italic>(27) = 6.90, p&lt;0.0001; accuracy<italic><sub>UL-LL</sub></italic>= 93%, p&lt;0.0001). The regions that made reliable contributions to classification (as tested with a bootstrap procedure; see 'Materials and methods' for details) paralleled the somatotopy identified in previous literature, including specific regions of contralateral SI, mid INS, and dpINS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baumgärtner et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brooks et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hua et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Picard and Strick, 1996</xref>).

Crucially, the somatotopic patterns for vicarious pain did not include the expected topography in contralateral SI, SII, mid-INS or dpINS, in either hemisphere (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B and C</xref>). Instead, vicarious pain somatotopy was represented in other brain areas, including the supplementary motor area, anterior cingulate (ACC), and medial prefrontal (mPFC) cortices (see Appendix and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14">Appendix 1—figure 6</xref> for additional analyses).<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15166.009</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Upper limb versus lower limb multivariate patterns for somatic and vicarious pain.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Accuracy statistics for upper limb versus lower limb weight maps for somatic and vicarious pain; Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves for two-choice forced alternative tests for upper versus lower limb sites; (<bold>B</bold>) Support Vector Machine (SVM) derived pattern for upper limb versus lower limb sites for somatic and vicarious pain, bootstrap thresholded at FDR q&lt;0.05 for display purposes, showing somatotopy for these sites in the primary somatosensory cortex (schematic of homunculus shown for reference); (<bold>C</bold>) SVM derived pattern for upper limb versus lower limb sites for somatic and vicarious pain, bootstrap thresholded at FDR q&lt;0.05 for display purposes, showing somatotopy for these sites in the mid- and dorsal-posterior insular cortex (warm colors indicate upper limb regions and cool colors indicate lower limb sites).</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.15166.009">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.15166.009</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-15166-fig7-v1"/></fig></p><p>Thus, somatotopy was apparent for both somatic and vicarious pain and strongly predictive of upper versus lower limb stimulation, but the <italic>f</italic>MRI patterns were qualitatively distinct in each condition.

Neuroimaging can help understand <italic>how</italic> we represent others’ suffering by testing whether vicarious pain activates the same neural mechanisms as somatic pain, implying shared affective experience. Overlapping neural responses in the dACC and aINS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hutchison et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Jackson et al., 2006b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Lamm et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Singer et al., 2004</xref>) have been interpreted in terms of shared pain representations, but these responses may reflect emotions that are distinct from pain, and need not entail shared experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hooker et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Zaki, 2014</xref>). The question of shared representation can only be addressed if brain markers that are sensitive, specific, and generalizable can be identified for both somatic and vicarious pain. Then, the similarity of those markers can be assessed. But can a representation of vicarious pain be identified, and if so, is it conserved across individuals so that it can be prospectively compared with somatic pain and related to empathetic behavior? Our findings suggest that the answer to this question is yes. Is this representation similar to that for somatic pain? Our findings suggest that the answer to this question is no.</p><p>In a series of analyses across 3 studies, we identified distinct <italic>f</italic>MRI patterns that encoded the intensity of somatic and vicarious experiences, suggesting that somatic and vicarious pain are distinct processes. Local brain patterns did not accurately predict somatic or vicarious pain experience. Instead, distributed patterns within and across multiple association regions strongly and separately predicted both somatic and vicarious pain. Somatic pain was encoded largely in the aINS, dACC, dpINS, and SII—regions targeted by ascending nociceptive afferents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bushnell et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Willis, 1985</xref>) and thought to encode sensory and affective aspects of pain. By contrast, vicarious pain was encoded in portions of the dmPFC, amygdala, PCC, and TPJ—multisensory, heteromodal regions associated with mentalizing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hampton et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Mitchell et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Saxe et al., 2003</xref>), consistent with other work emphasizing the importance of mentalizing systems in empathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hooker et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Rütgen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Zaki, 2014</xref>). These findings demonstrate separate modifiability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Sternberg, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Woo et al., 2014</xref>), which entails sensitivity and specificity of each brain pattern to only one type of ‘pain’, and rules out common influences of shared demands on attention, ‘salience,’ ‘arousal,’ and other more general processes (see Appendix for an extended discussion).</p><p>In addition, strong somatotopy was found for both somatic and vicarious pain, though the somatotopic organization was very different for each. Somatic pain and touch have a well-established somatotopy in SI, SII, and dpINS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baumgärtner et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brooks et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hua et al., 2005</xref>), which we observed here. Vicarious pain showed different somatotopic patterns that, interestingly, were localized within ‘mentalizing’ systems rather than somatosensory ones.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>A departure from shared representation</title><p>Most previous studies of vicarious pain point out its similarity with somatic pain, and it is thus widely believed that the two experiences rely on the same systems. Why are our findings and conclusions different? There are three main reasons.</p><p>First, many previous studies focused only on the points of similarity—mainly identified in two isolated brain regions, dACC and aINS—ignoring dissimilarities [but cf. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Lamm et al., 2011</xref>), who write, 'our results reveal more differences than similarities…' p. 2500]. Here, we aimed for an unbiased assessment of the two processes.</p><p>Second, most previous work has identified ‘pain-related’ activation by contrasting pain with loosely matched control conditions (e.g., neutral or innocuous stimuli). Overlapping activity in such contrasts may be caused by many processes that are not pain, including general negative affect, attention, and arousal [see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Wager et al., 2016</xref>) for discussion]. Engagement of these processes may be responsible for the similar activation in previous work. By contrast, in our study, we attempted to isolate pain-relevant patterns that predicted the magnitude of experienced intensity, and examined the similarity of those patterns.</p><p>Third, most previous studies focused on voxel-wise activation ‘blobs,’ rather than on multivariate patterns, which can be sensitive to information at finer spatial scales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Shmuel et al., 2010</xref>), possibly even below the intrinsic resolution determined by the voxel size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kamitani and Tong, 2005</xref>). This property, combined with our experimental approach targeting within-person variations in pain intensity, suggests that the multivariate patterns we identified are more likely to reflect specific representations contained in meso-scale neural circuits.</p><p>Based on our findings, we infer that the overlapping activation in the dACC, aINS, and other areas is not related to shared pain experience. Interestingly, on close reading, the few previous multivariate pattern-based studies agree broadly with this interpretation. The brain patterns they identified as shared across somatic and vicarious pain were not specific to ‘pain,’ as these patterns were also activated by other, non-painful types of negative affect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Corradi-Dell'Acqua et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Zaki et al., 2016</xref>). As in our study, in these studies what is shared does not seem to be particular to pain per se.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Identifying representations: criteria and evidence</title><p>Somatic and vicarious pain experiences, <italic>by definition</italic>, are similar in some ways and different in others. They are similar in that they are both aversive, salient, and attention-capturing. They differ in their sensory input modalities (somatosensory versus visual) and likely many of the cognitive processes involved. Brain activity, including both regional activation and multivariate patterns, may reflect any or all of these processes. For this reason, it is necessary to test the similarity of the brain patterns that <italic>most closely encode pain experiences of each type</italic>. We have proposed three criteria for identifying patterns that may be used to make inferences about pain representation. Such patterns should be (a) sensitive to pain, and thus respond in proportion to its experience; (b) specific to pain, and not activated by non-painful events; and (c) generalizable across varied instances of the type of pain. For example, a brain pattern that encodes ‘pain affect’—whether common to self- and other-pain or not—should increase as pain affect increases, and not respond to non-painful forms of negative emotion such as disgust (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Zaki et al., 2016</xref>). Previous studies have identified both shared and dissimilar patterns of activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Corradi-Dell'Acqua et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">2016</xref>) in local dACC and aINS regions. Though an important step, these patterns have not been shown to track pain experience with meaningfully large effect sizes, and our findings here suggest that local regions are insufficient to do so. In addition, they have not identified a pattern that tracks ‘pain affect’ specifically and does not respond to other negative emotions.</p><p>Our findings provide an advance because they identify patterns that are strongly predictive of pain experience. Though they do not test many other kinds of emotions, the patterns are demonstrably specific to either pain for oneself or another. In addition, a lack of correlations between the NPS, VPS, and patterns predictive of rejection and negative emotion further suggest that these patterns are not sensitive to general emotional arousal. Fortunately, the between-participant patterns we identified here can be prospectively tested for generalizability to other emotions and paradigms in future studies. Indeed, in an initial step towards broader generalizability, we showed that the sensitivity and specificity of both patterns generalize to new studies, and that our putative somatic pain representation, the NPS, generalizes across three types of somatic pain.</p><p>The fact that capturing vicarious pain experience requires identifying distributed patterns across large-scale networks is consistent with prior work suggesting that accurate predictions of pain and emotional experiences requires combining signals across brain regions and networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brodersen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cecchi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kassam et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kragel and Labar, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Nummenmaa et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Wager et al., 2015</xref>).

It also converges with views of somatic pain as represented by patterns across populations of neurons distributed across macroscopic brain regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Coghill et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Leknes and Tracey, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Melzack and Wall, 1967</xref>).

However, our approach is not guaranteed to be maximally sensitive to shared representations. Optimizing for shared representation would require using machine-learning approaches to predict pain in a modality-nonspecific fashion. Another important issue is individual differences in the experience of vicarious pain. Having established pain-predictive brain patterns as we do here, subsequent studies could include stimuli that are externally matched, and brain responses in the 'vicarious pain signature' are correlated meaningfully with empathy ratings across participants. In addition, the VPS could potentially be used to test clinical populations: for example, whether patients in chronic pain show greater (or lesser) responses to others’ suffering. These questions are beyond the scope of the present study, but could be undertaken in future work.</p><p>Our study used conditions designed to maximize the neural overlap between vicarious and somatic pain, by using ‘painful’ pictures previously demonstrated to induce stronger somatosensory activity—and are thus potentially <italic>more</italic> somatic pain-like—than other, ‘cued empathy’ paradigms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Lamm et al., 2011</xref>).

Somatic stimulation was administered as thermal pain, which was applied on the volar surface of the left forearm (i.e., upper limb) and dorsal surface of the left foot (i.e., lower limb) using a TSA-II Neurosensory Analyzer (Medoc Ltd., Chapel Hill, NC) with a 16 mm Peltier thermode end plate. Three levels of somatic stimulation (pseudo-randomly assigned to each participant)—low (44 or 45°C), medium (46 or 47°C) and high (48 or 49°C)—were applied to four different locations on both the upper limb and lower limb . Each stimulation lasted a total of 11s with a 2s ramp-up and a 2s ramp down, and 7s at the peak target temperature. The participants made responses on a Visual Analog Scale (VAS), which had anchors based on a labeled magnitude rating scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bartoshuk, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Green et al., 1996</xref>) for No Sensation (0% of scale length), Barely Detectable (1.4% of scale length), Weak (6.1% of scale length), Moderate (17.2% of scale length), Strong (35.4% of scale length), Very Strong (53.3% of scale length), and Strongest Imaginable Sensation (100% of scale length). Participants first made a moment-by-moment rating where for the duration of the trial, as they experienced any sensation, they used a pointer on the screen to move continuously along the rating scale and indicate the level of sensation they felt at each moment. They then made an overall rating at the end of each trial to indicate the maximum overall sensation they experienced in that trial. As part of the calibration procedure, participants also viewed pictures for 11s (to match the thermal pain trials) depicting varying levels of injury occurring on the right hand or foot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Jackson et al., 2005</xref>). Participants were given the instruction, 'Imagine the experience if the situation in each picture happened to you, and rate how much sensation you would feel in that situation'. They used the same visual analog scale as the somatic pain calibration to make their ratings—a moment-by-moment rating while they viewed the picture and an overall rating about their experience after each trial.

Each scanning session contained 11 runs and lasted about an hour. The experimental design was the same for both sessions, with the only difference being the duration of intra- and inter- stimulation jitter. Each stimulation was preceded by one of three levels of predictive cues that corresponded to three levels of stimulation, with the cues and stimulation completely crossed with each other (i.e., a 3 × 3 experimental design). These predictive cues were designed to be orthogonal to the intensity of stimulation, and were used to study cue-based expectation effects for aversive experiences (to be addressed in a separate manuscript). Prior to being scanned, participants completed a short training with an explicit learning task in which they learned the levels of the three cues that were to be later presented in the scanner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Atlas et al., 2010</xref>). The first two <italic>f</italic>MRI runs consisted of a conditioning task where the participants learned the association between the cues they encountered in the pre-scan training and the level of stimulation for that session. The remaining nine <italic>f</italic>MRI runs consisted of the experimental task with the completely crossed cue-stimulation paradigm.

The somatic and vicarious pain sessions were conducted on different days to reduce learning effects. During both the conditioning (2 runs) and experimental runs (9 runs), participants received a cue-stimulus pair for each trial and were asked to make a rating on a visual analog scale (same as the calibration session) about the sensation they felt after each trial. For the somatic pain session, the participants rated the intensity of pain they felt during each trial. For the vicarious pain session, the participants were instructed to imagine that the injury occurring in the picture displayed was happening to them and rated how much pain they might feel in that situation.</p><p>Each experimental run contained 9 trials (81 total for each session), which were counterbalanced between runs for each participant using a Latin Square design. Experimental trials (i.e., post conditioning) began with a 2s cue followed by a systematic jitter separating the cue from stimulation (i.e., 5, 7, 11s). Participants then received stimulation (somatic or vicarious pain) for 11s followed by a jittered fixation (2, 6 or 14s for somatic pain and 3, 6 or 12s for vicarious pain). The 11s trial duration for somatic pain included a 2s ramp-up, 2s ramp-down and 7s at target temperature; the vicarious pain stimuli remained on the screen for 11s. Finally, participants had 4s to make a rating of the sensation they experienced for the stimulation on a visual analog scale using a trackball (responses were confirmed with a button-click). There was an inter-trial jittered fixation (1, 4, or 10s for somatic pain and 1, 2 or 4s for vicarious pain). The jittered fixations were counterbalanced across trials within a run, so that all runs were of equal duration for each session.</p></sec><sec id="s4-1-4"><title>Behavioral analyses</title><p>Participants rated the sensation they felt at every trial during the <italic>f</italic>MRI sessions. All ratings were averaged across trials and runs for each participant, separately for each level of stimulation—low, medium and high, and for each body site (i.e., upper limb or UL and lower limb or LL). Averaged ratings for all participants from the somatic pain and vicarious pain sessions were tested for differences in stimulation level, and body site separately. All behavioral data were analyzed using the R Project for Statistical Computing (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.r-project.org/">http://www.r-project.org/</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-1-5"><title>Image acquisition</title><p>Structural images were acquired using high-resolution T1 spoiled gradient recall images (SPGR) for anatomical localization and warped to Montréal Neurological Institute (MNI) space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Evans et al., 1993</xref>).

The somatic pain sessions had 11 runs, which each lasted 5 min and 50s (265 TRs), and the vicarious pain sessions had 11 runs, which each lasted 5 min and 22s (244 TRs). Stimulus presentation and behavioral data acquisition were controlled using Matlab software (MATLAB, The MathWorks, Inc., Natick, Massachusetts, United States).</p></sec><sec id="s4-1-6"><title>Image preprocessing</title><p>All images were preprocessed using SPM8 (Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, London, UK). Mean structural T1-weighted images were computed for each participant from all imaging sessions. The mean structural images were then co-registered to the first functional image for each participant with an iterative procedure of automated registration using mutual information from the co-registration in SPM8 and manual adjustment of the automated algorithm’s starting point until the automated procedure provided satisfactory alignment, and were normalized to MNI space using SPM8, interpolated to 2×2×2 mm<sup>3</sup> voxels.</p><p>Functional images were corrected for slice-acquisition-timing and motion using SPM8.

Spatial smoothing was performed for between-participant analyses as it does not diminish the sensitivity of multivariate analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Op de Beeck, 2010</xref>), and also captures mesoscopic patterns that are consistent across participants. No spatial smoothing was performed for any of the within-participant analyses.</p><p>Prior to preprocessing of functional images, global outlier time points (i.e., 'spikes' in signal) were identified by computing both the mean and the standard deviation (across voxels) of values for each image for all slices. Mahalanobis distances for the matrix of slice-wise mean and standard deviation values (concatenated) were computed for all functional volumes (time), and any values with a significant <bold>χ</bold><sup>2</sup> value (corrected for multiple comparisons) were considered outliers (less than 1% of images were outliers). The output of this procedure was later used as a covariate of noninterest in the first level models.</p></sec><sec id="s4-1-7"><title>Imaging analyses</title><p>First-level general linear model (GLM) analyses were conducted in SPM8. The first 6 volumes of each run were discarded, and the nine experimental runs were concatenated for each participant (the first two conditioning runs were excluded). Boxcar regressors, convolved with the canonical hemodynamic response function, were constructed to model periods for the 2s cue presentation, the 5, 7, or 11s variable pre-stimulus fixation period, the 11s somatic stimulation (9 levels), and 4s rating periods. The fixation cross epoch was used as an implicit baseline. A high-pass filter of 224s was used for the somatic pain session and 309s was used for the vicarious pain sessions. These values for the high pass filter were determined based on a first-level analysis on the two conditioning runs, where the variance inflation factor was determined to be less than 5%. Contrasts of interest included the low, medium and high stimulation period collapsed across cues and body site (i.e., upper limb and lower limb), upper limb and lower limb contrasts for three levels of stimulation, and overall averaged stimulation collapsed across levels, cues and body site. These contrasts were computed for both the somatic pain and vicarious pain sessions, and were used for the signature response analyses described below.</p></sec><sec id="s4-1-8"><title>Univariate general linear model (GLM) analyses</title><p>A second level one-sample <italic>t</italic>-test was calculated for each contrast using robust regression.

This process is continued until all participants have been left out of the classification algorithm once to obtain their respective cross-validated signature response values.

These regions were identified by masking the overlapping significant voxels, and were used as regions of interest for separate region-specific local pattern classification.

A local region classifier (i.e., LASSO-PCR) was trained to predict behavioral ratings from each modality separately for each of the 181,129 local regions, and the pattern obtained was used to cross-validate (within-modality) and cross-predict (between-modality) for each pain modality (i.e., somatic vs. vicarious). For each of the cross-validation folds, one run with upper limb stimulation and one run with lower limb stimulation was excluded from the analysis. The resulting pattern was tested on these left-out runs (cross-validation), and the corresponding trial numbers from the other modality (cross-prediction). The within-modality patterns loosely corroborate the global patterns, but are noisier and have considerably less statistical power.</p></sec><sec id="s4-1-14"><title>Stimulus and anticipation-related activity of NPS and VPS responses</title><p>In order to potentially identify activation at time points that do not match the rise of pain experience (including anticipation), a smoothed finite-impulse response model (sFIR) was estimated across all trials for both somatic and vicarious pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Lindquist et al., 2009</xref>). These models provide an empirical picture of the time-courses for the different events in a trial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Lindquist et al., 2009</xref>). The first-level betas for each TR were estimated separately at the 11s stimulation onset, and at the 2s cue onset, for a total period of 32.5s after onset (which was equivalent to 25 TRs).

This paradigm used uncomfortable electrodermal stimulation (low current) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">LaBar et al., 1998</xref>) applied to the left extremity (lower medial side above the ankle). This is an S1-S2 paradigm with 1s of S1 for safe/stimulation cue and 1s of S2 with/without stimulation, with an inter stimulus interval (ISI) of 3s. The inter trial interval (ITI) was jittered (4–12s, exponentially distributed, mean = 5s). Mean duration for each trial was 10s. Different colored squares, identical in shape, size, and luminance, served as the cue and target stimuli. Participants were instructed to view visual stimulus squares (red, blue, yellow, or green) presented pseudo-randomly. Participants were informed that a red square with the word 'STIMULATION', when presented, indicates that stimulation may follow when a yellow square appears. They were also informed that a blue square with the word 'SAFE' indicates that there was no stimulation when a yellow square appears. Each run had 48 counterbalanced trials with 24 safe trials and 24 stimulation trials. Electrodermal stimulation was given during 50% of the S2 period of the stimulation trials (12 of 24 trials) when the 'STIMULATION' stimulus preceded the yellow square. In addition, there were 4 catch trials with the word 'PRESS' to instruct the participant to press a button to ensure that participants were watching the screen. There was a 30s resting period at the beginning and end of each run. Each run took 580s or about 10 min. Two runs of the shock pain paradigm were conducted. Due to the fact that the threshold for pain perception varies markedly among individuals, the intensity was decided and recorded individually before scanning at a medium level of pain tolerable by the participant (using a 5-point scale). No active task was required for shock or safe trials. However, participants were instructed to press a button when they saw the target following the 'PRESS' cue in order to maintain their attention during scanning.

Each 5.5s trial consisted of a presentation of a stimulus picture, along with the two response categories (i.e., no pain and pain) for 2.5s, during which participants made their responses. This was followed by 3s of fixation. Sixty-four images were selected for presentation in each run, for a total of four runs.

Using a mask obtained from Neurosynth.org (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Yarkoni et al., 2011</xref>), we performed feature selection for the NPS pattern with 'pain' as the search term. We obtained a reverse inference map based on a meta-analysis for 'pain' from the journal articles coded in the Neurosynth database (<italic>N</italic> = 224). The reverse inference map indicates regions that are most likely associated with journal articles that focus on 'pain' than any other topic. The reason that visual regions are included in the NPS mask is because based on the Neurosynth definition of reverse inference, these regions are least likely to be associated with journal articles that focus on pain, and therefore have negative weights in the NPS mask. In the case where the NPS mask is applied to data that include visual stimuli (e.g., vicarious pain), activation of the visual regions of the brain are correlated with the visual regions of the NPS mask. Therefore, we extracted the NPS weights associated with either only the positive or only the negative regions of the Neurosynth 'pain' mask and computed the signature response for somatic and vicarious pain for data from Study 1.</p><p>The removal of the negative regions of the Neurosynth 'pain' mask had no effect on the signature response for somatic pain (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Appendix 1—figure 1A</xref>; <italic>t<sub>UL</sub></italic>(27) = 9.26, p&lt;0.0001, <italic>t<sub>LL</sub></italic>(27) = 7.18, p&lt;0.0001 for somatic pain; <italic>t<sub>UL</sub></italic>(27) = −0.56, <italic>n.s., t<sub>LL</sub></italic>(27) = 0.046, <italic>n.s.</italic>, for vicarious pain), but greatly reduced the signature response for vicarious pain. In contrast, the weights corresponding to the negative regions of the Neurosynth “pain” mask showed increased activity for vicarious pain (although still did not detect the difference in intensity), but greatly reduced the signature response for somatic pain (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Appendix 1—figure 1B</xref>; <italic>t<sub>UL</sub></italic>(27) = −5.22, p&lt;0.005, <italic>t<sub>LL</sub></italic>(27) = −2.81, p&lt;0.01 for somatic pain; <italic>t<sub>UL</sub></italic>(27) = −1.14, <italic>n.s., t<sub>LL</sub></italic>(27) = −3.05, p&lt;0.01 for vicarious pain). Limiting the NPS to only regions that are positively related to pain in previous studies [based on (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Yarkoni et al., 2011</xref>)], resulted in strong NPS responses to somatic pain but no responses to any vicarious pain conditions. Critically, however, the NPS did <italic>not</italic> predict vicarious pain intensity, suggesting that the two types of pain may engage fundamentally different circuits. This suggests that the negative NPS response for vicarious pain was mostly driven by weights in the negative regions of the Neurosynth 'pain' mask.<fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15166.011</object-id><label>Appendix 1—figure 1.</label><caption><title>NPS responses in</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) (Left): NPS weights from positive regions of the Neurosynth mask for 'pain'; <bold>A</bold> (Right): Signature response computed as the dot product of the NPS pattern weights and estimated activation maps for each participant (including within-participant standard error of the mean; <italic>t<sub>UL</sub></italic>(27) = 9.26, p&lt;0.0001, <italic>t<sub>LL</sub></italic>(27) = 7.18, p&lt;0.0001 for somatic pain; <italic>t<sub>UL</sub></italic>(27) = −0.56, <italic>n.s., t<sub>LL</sub></italic>(27) = 0.046, <italic>n.s.</italic>, for vicarious pain); <bold>B</bold> (Left): NPS weights from negative regions of the Neurosynth mask for 'pain'; <bold>B</bold> (Right): Signature response computed as the dot product of the NPS pattern weights and estimated activation maps for each participant (including within-participant standard error of the mean; <italic>t<sub>UL</sub></italic>(27) = −5.22, p&lt;0.005, <italic>t<sub>LL</sub></italic>(27) = −2.81, p&lt;0.01 for somatic pain; <italic>t<sub>UL</sub></italic>(27) = −1.14, <italic>n.s., t<sub>LL</sub></italic>(27) = −3.05, p&lt;0.01 for vicarious pain).</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.15166.011">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.15166.011</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-15166-app1-fig1-v1"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="s53" sec-type="appendix"><title>Re-training of a new somatic pain predictive pattern</title><p>In addition to testing the NPS—which was defined <italic>a priori</italic> based on previous studies—we used LASSO-PCR (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator-regularized Principal Components Regression) to identify a somatic pain-predictive pattern using cross-validated analyses on data from Study 1.

This concern applies to whole-brain analyses but not to local analyses of dACC and aINS, which are heteromodal, multisensory regions thought to encode ‘pain affect’ and other modality-independent motivational processes. The predictive voxels in the VPS map are clustered in sensory modality-independent ‘mentalizing’ systems, rather than visual processing systems. However, to further test the (in)dependence of vicarious pain prediction on visual processing, we re-trained the VPS excluding the entire occipital cortex. We used a LASSO-PCR classification to predict behavioral responses to different intensities of vicarious pain stimulation, with a leave-one-participant-out cross-validation scheme, identical to the original analysis performed with whole brain data. The pattern map with occipital cortex removed was thresholded using a bootstrap procedure with 5000 samples and FDR correction of q&lt;0.05 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Appendix 1—figure 3A</xref>).<fig id="fig11" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15166.013</object-id><label>Appendix 1—figure 3.</label><caption><title>Vicarious pain pattern (excluding occipital cortex) and analyses.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Thresholded LASSO-PCR (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator-regularized Principal Components Regression) derived pattern for vicarious pain excluding the occipital cortex; (<bold>B</bold>) Signature response computed as the dot product of the VPS pattern weights and estimated activation maps for each participant (including within-participant standard error of the mean; <italic>t<sub>UL</sub></italic>(27) = 5.75, p&lt;0.0001, <italic>t<sub>LL</sub></italic>(27) = 5.45, p&lt;0.0001; <italic>t<sub>UL-LL</sub></italic>(27) = 2.21, p&lt;0.05, for vicarious pain; <italic>t<sub>UL</sub></italic>(27) = 1.56, <italic>n.s., t<sub>LL</sub></italic>(27) = 1.23, <italic>n.s.; t<sub>UL-LL</sub></italic>(27) = 0.03, <italic>n.s.</italic>, for somatic pain); (<bold>C</bold>) Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) plot for two-choice forced-alternative accuracies for vicarious and somatic pain, high and low vicarious pain, and high and low somatic pain (accuracy<italic><sub>Vic-Som</sub></italic> = 71%, p&lt;0.05; accuracy<italic><sub>Hvic-Lvic</sub></italic> = 93%, p&lt;0.0001; accuracy<italic><sub>Hsom-Lsom</sub></italic> = 64%, <italic>n.s.</italic>).</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.15166.013">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.15166.013</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-15166-app1-fig3-v1"/></fig></p><p>The signature response (excluding the occipital cortex) monotonically increased for each level of vicarious pain for both the upper limb and lower limb sites (<italic>t<sub>UL</sub></italic>(27) = 5.75, p&lt;0.0001, <italic>t<sub>LL</sub></italic>(27) = 5.45, p&lt;0.0001; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Appendix 1—figure 3B</xref>).

The predictive accuracy for vicarious pain was qualitatively identical, further indicating that the brain patterns that predict vicarious pain are not tied to sensory-specific cortical areas.</p><p>Based on previous literature, somatic pain was administered on the left limbs, and the visual stimuli used to evoke vicarious pain showed injuries to the right limbs. This mirrors the side of painful stimulation from the observer’s point of view in an allocentric reference frame, but not an egocentric one; thus, lateralization of stimulus presentation could potentially determine some of the functional properties of the VPS. To test this, we repeated the signature response analysis with a left-right flipped version of the VPS pattern (excluding the occipital cortex), which preserves the pattern but with opposite laterality. The results remained the same: The flipped VPS pattern did not track somatic pain intensity (<italic>t<sub>UL</sub></italic>(27) = 1.47, <italic>n.s., t<sub>LL</sub></italic>(27) = 0.04, <italic>n.s.</italic>, accuracy<italic><sub>Hsom-Lsom</sub></italic> = 50%, <italic>n.s.</italic>), but did track vicarious pain intensity (<italic>t<sub>UL</sub></italic>(27) = 2.68, p&lt;0.05, <italic>t<sub>LL</sub></italic>(27) = 2.53, p&lt;0.05, accuracy<italic><sub>Hvic-Lvic</sub></italic> = 79%, p&lt;0.005). These results indicate that the laterality of the VPS, and by extension the laterality of the stimuli it was trained on, are not an important determinant of its functional properties.</p></sec><sec id="s55" sec-type="appendix"><title>Habituation or sensitization across trials</title><p>Another issue that may make the NPS and VPS responses appear more dissimilar is differential habituation or sensitization across trials. To test this, we estimated NPS and VPS amplitudes for each trial using a ‘beta series’ approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Mumford et al., 2012</xref>) and examined their stability across trials. For this analysis, we used single-trial beta estimates for the stimulation period (one per trial), and applied the NPS and VPS patterns. For each participant, we then regressed the NPS responses against the reported somatic pain rating, and obtained the residual activity for somatic pain. We followed the same procedure for each participant for vicarious pain, and regressed the VPS responses against the reported vicarious pain rating to obtain the corresponding residual activity for vicarious pain. We then averaged the responses trial-by-trial across participants, and plotted the dynamic changes for the behavior, predicted signature response, and residual activity for somatic and vicarious pain. We did not see any evidence for systematic variation [e.g., sensitization or habituation; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Jepma et al., 2013</xref>)] across trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Appendix 1—figure 4</xref>).<fig id="fig12" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15166.014</object-id><label>Appendix 1—figure 4.</label><caption><title>Trial-level stability of the NPS and VPS responses across all trials.</title><p>The first row depicts subjective ratings for somatic pain (top panel) and vicarious pain (bottom panel) respectively, the second row depicts the ratings predicted by NPS (top panel) and VPS (bottom panel) respectively, and the third row shows the residual rating variance not predicted by the NPS (top panel) and VPS (bottom panel) respectively.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.15166.014">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.15166.014</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-15166-app1-fig4-v1"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="s56" sec-type="appendix"><title>Within participant whole-brain and local classification</title><p>Patterns tailored to predict somatic and vicarious pain for each individual might be more accurate, and thus provide better markers for representation that could yield different results. Therefore, we performed within-participant classification of vicarious pain patterns across the whole brain and also within the bilateral aINS and dACC. We used unsmoothed (but corrected for slice-acquisition-time and motion, and warped to SPM’s normative atlas) images for these analyses. Single-trial level analyses were conducted where first-level betas for each trial were estimated by modeling the 2s cue presentation, the 5, 7, or 11s variable pre-stimulus fixation period, the 11s stimulation (9 levels) and 4s rating periods, and the fixation cross epoch was used as an implicit baseline. Each of the 9 levels of the 11s stimulation period were modeled trial-by-trial with a total of 81 trial-level betas for each participant per experimental session. Trials with high variance inflation factors (VIFs &gt; 2.5), and unreliable ratings were excluded from further analysis. The estimated betas were used for training classifiers (i.e., LASSO-PCR and SVM) for each participant. For each of the cross-validated iterations, one run with upper limb stimulation and one run with lower limb stimulation were excluded from the analysis. The classifier was trained on the trials from the remaining runs and the resultant pattern was tested both on the left out runs from the training modality (i.e., within modality cross-validation) and all trials from the other modality (i.e., between modality cross-prediction).</p><p>We performed a whole-brain LASSO-PCR prediction of each modality’s behavioral ratings,cross-validated signature responses within modality, and cross-predicted signature responses between modalities <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Appendix 1—figure 5</xref>).

For example, if the NPS responds to vicarious pain, but with weaker intensity [e.g., as in Hutchinson et al., (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hutchison et al., 1999</xref>)], is our study powered to detect differences? We address this issue in three ways.</p><p>First, we used a study design that does not require that the levels of activity for somatic and vicarious pain to be the same in order to detect similarity.

However, our findings do not indicate such sharing.</p><p>Second, we use between-participant multi-system predictive , which do not rely on multiple comparisons correction—which dramatically reduces power and replicability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Button et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Yarkoni, 2009</xref>)—for valid tests of the population codes. These analyses also allow for unbiased assessments of power to detect cross-modality predictive effects based on the observed strength of the within-modality predictive effects. We performed a formal power analysis for out-of-sample individuals, which indicated that in the NPS, we have 100% power (N needed for 80% power = 4) to detect vicarious pain responses that are as strong as somatic pain responses, and 79.2% power (N needed for 80% power = 29) to detect vicarious pain responses that are only 25% as strong as somatic pain responses. In the VPS, we have 100% power (N needed for 80% power = 4) to detect somatic pain responses that are as strong as vicarious pain responses, and 87.3% power (N needed for 80% power = 24) to detect somatic pain responses that are only 25% as strong as vicarious pain responses.</p><p>Third, we demonstrate direct replication in new samples with Study 3, which includes data from a separate sample, scanner, and institution, and show the dissociation of the NPS and VPS responses to somatic and vicarious pain, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="s59" sec-type="appendix"><title>Upper versus lower limb pattern classification within the somatosensory cortex</title><p>We ran additional cross-classification analyses to predict stimulation site (upper versus lower limb), restricting training to only the primary somatosensory cortex.

What is at stake is whether the representations that <italic>encode pain</italic>, particularly in the dACC and aINS, are shared by vicarious pain. This question has not previously been fully examined, in part because previous studies have identified patterns that discriminate painful versus neutral stimuli but not those that predict pain experience with meaningfully large effect sizes [e.g., (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Corradi-Dell'Acqua et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">2016</xref>)]. Four unique features of our study help to address whether the dissociations are trivial versus meaningful in terms of pain representations. First, strong predictive accuracy for both types of experience suggests that the patterns were related to pain, rather than other extraneous processes. Second, strong accuracy in out-of-sample (for new individuals) prediction also indicates that our study was highly powered to detect patterns that track experience, providing a meaningful test of shared representations. Third, lack of correlations between the NPS, VPS, and patterns predictive of rejection and negative emotion further suggest that these patterns are not sensitive to general emotional arousal. And fourth, somatotopy concerns brain organization <italic>within</italic> sensory modalities, which is expected to be similar if vicarious pain activates somatic pain representations. However, a full characterization of pain representations requires a long, multi-study program of research that is beyond the scope of this manuscript.</p><sec id="s62"><title>Implications for pain representation</title><p>The critical issue addressed in this work is how somatic and vicarious pain representations are related, which raises important (and controversial) questions about what constitutes a neural representation of mental constructs such as pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Davis and Poldrack, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Haxby et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Panzeri et al., 2015</xref>). One question concerns the level of analysis, as <italic>f</italic>MRI activity necessarily integrates across populations of many neurons, and whether single-neuron activity might provide a different and perhaps privileged picture. A second, related question concerns whether various forms of pain are represented by localized activity (in voxels or single neurons) or distributed patterns across populations. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hutchison et al., 1999</xref> found that a subset of human dACC neurons (11/68, 16%) responds to noxious events, and a fraction of those neurons (1/11, 9%) also responded to observation of pain, albeit more weakly. The overlapping neurons could indicate shared ‘pain representation.’ Alternatively, however, they may reflect engagement of common processes that are distinct from pain—for example, engagement of attention, which is known to activate dACC neurons. In addition, pain may be encoded not in single neurons, but in population vectors that relate to the pattern across many neurons, and even across macroscopic brain regions.</p><p>One way to establish a provisional representation is to characterize the sufficient basis for predicting related outcomes. Our study is grounded on the supposition that for a neural measure to serve as a representation of any particular type of pain, it should a) respond strongly to that type of pain (be <italic>sensitive</italic>); b) not respond to things that are similar but acknowledged to be distinct from pain (be <italic>specific</italic>); and c) generalize across multiple instances with different superficial properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Woo and Wager, 2015</xref>). Only to the degree that the criteria are met does it become meaningful to test the relationship among the constructs. Previous studies have compared patterns for high versus low pain, but their results do not fulfill any of these three criteria. By these criteria, no single method (e.g., single-neuron approaches) are privileged as a measure, though some techniques may turn out to have much better measurement properties than others.</p><p>Our study takes several steps towards fulfilling these criteria, but also leaves much more work to be done. First, we identify patterns that are highly sensitive (and powered) to predict the magnitude of somatic and vicarious pain experience in out-of-sample individuals, and replicate those effects. Second, the NPS’s specificity has been tested more broadly across datasets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Woo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">2015</xref>), whereas we demonstrate specificity of the VPS here only with respect to somatic pain and anticipation (for somatic and vicarious pain), with no responses to any of these conditions. However, testing specificity is a multi-study process that ultimately requires examining many psychological conditions. The NPS and VPS have not yet been tested on all of the possible cognitive processes that may engage one of them or the other for reasons unrelated to pain (e.g., engagement of attention), though establishing patterns that predict pain experience helps to minimize influences of extraneous processes. Third, in Study 2 we demonstrate generalizability of the NPS across several types of somatic pain (pressure and mechanical), and we are actively examining the generalizability of the VPS to other empathy-related paradigms (e.g., ‘cued empathy’). Assessing the full scope of what processes these patterns are sensitive to is an open-ended process, and a work in progress. However, the results thus far demonstrate promise that both patterns are useful as provisional representations of somatic and vicarious pain.</p></sec><sec id="s63"><title>Identifying shared representations for somatic and vicarious pain</title><p>Our findings do not suggest that there are <italic>no</italic> shared processes common to somatic and vicarious pain. Previous studies have investigated the shared representation question, and variously concluded that there is support for both shared (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bruneau et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Corradi-Dell'Acqua et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Corradi-Dell'Acqua et al., 2016</xref>) and distinct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bruneau et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Woo et al., 2014</xref>) brain bases for pain-related and other affective events that were interpreted as activating somatic pain representations precisely because they activated the dACC and aINS.</p><p>However, it is now widely recognized that these regions are activated by a wide variety of tasks that do not involve pain at all (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Iannetti et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Lindquist et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Mouraux et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Yarkoni et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, neither dissociable activity patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bruneau et al., 2013</xref>) nor shared ones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Corradi-Dell'Acqua et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">2016</xref>) can tell us whether pain representations are involved unless at least one of the patterns tested is strongly predictive of pain experience. The finding of shared representation in the aINS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Corradi-Dell'Acqua et al., 2011</xref>)—which we replicated here—does not imply that those shared representations are actually representations of pain. What is shared could reflect common demands on attention, salience, and other more general processes. Consistent with this view, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Corradi-Dell'Acqua et al., 2011</xref> provided evidence that the common patterns they identified in the aINS were not specific to pain, but rather reflected some more general aspect of negative emotional experience.</p></sec><sec id="s64"><title>Separate modifiability for somatic and vicarious pain predictive patterns</title><p>Our study tested the separate modifiability of somatic and vicarious pain patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Sternberg, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Woo et al., 2014</xref>), which can rule out common influences of shared demands on attention, ‘salience,’ ‘arousal,’ and other more general processes. In brief, the logic is that if any hypothetical common process underlies both patterns, then both patterns should be affected by manipulations of the common process in consistent ways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Sternberg, 2001</xref>). In our results, two independent manipulations—of somatic pain intensity and vicarious pain intensity—differentially affect two unrelated patterns. Manipulating somatic pain influenced somatic pain representations (the NPS) but not vicarious pain representations (the VPS), and manipulating vicarious pain intensity influenced the VPS but not the NPS, demonstrating separate modifiability, in spite of comparable intensity ratings for somatic and vicarious pain. Furthermore, separate modifiability was found in both between-participant and within-participant whole brain analyses, and in the aINS.</p><p>This pattern of findings is logically incompatible with common-process accounts: If somatic and vicarious pain manipulations increased arousal (which might be reflected in the dACC or aINS), for example, and the NPS and VPS responses reflected arousal, then the vicarious pain manipulation should have increased activity in the NPS and vice versa. Because there was virtually no cross-prediction of either pattern, this implies that the signature diagnostic of each pain experience is independent and thus does not share overlapping processes. The lack of common patterns (cross-prediction) or shared representations for pain as compared with the findings of Corradi-Dell’Acqua and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Corradi-Dell'Acqua et al., 2011</xref>), or findings from other non-pain related domains such as listening to or executing actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Etzel et al., 2008</xref>) can be interpreted alongside the strong positive findings. We demonstrate that the shared representation is likely to be much smaller, perhaps an order of magnitude smaller, than the strength of the within-modality effects. We also account for non-specific factors (e.g., arousal and salience) by training on pain experience and demonstrating separate modifiability. Thus, our results strongly suggest that the patterns identified in this study reflect distinct affective processes rather than general processes common to somatic and vicarious pain, such as emotional arousal.</p></sec><sec id="s65"><title>Towards signatures for multiple affective experiences</title><p>This paper presents a whole-brain multivariate signature that tracks pain empathy and can be applied prospectively to new individuals. We also applied the pattern to an independent replication dataset, which showed that the VPS dissociates somatic versus vicarious pain, and included two additional, independent datasets that confirm the generalizability of the NPS across pain modalities (heat, shock, and pressure), and confirms that the NPS is distinct from the VPS. Thus, these findings can be used, tested, and extended by many groups, allowing us to build a cumulative neuroscience of affect across laboratories.</p><p>Importantly, our results not only show that the neural bases of somatic and vicarious pain experiences are distinct, they also provide preliminary evidence that they are distinct from social rejection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Woo et al., 2014</xref>), another type of affective experience thought to be encoded in ‘affective pain’ systems. Though vicarious pain and social rejection share common involvement of some brain regions, such as the dorso-medial prefrontal cortex, they largely involve distinct regions even at the macroscopic scale. The social rejection pattern identified in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Woo et al. (2014)</xref> involves a distinct set of regions associated with emotion generation [e.g., (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Lindquist et al., 2012</xref>)], including the ventro-lateral prefrontal cortex, medial thalamus, and supplementary motor cortex. Thus, vicarious pain, somatic pain, and social rejection are distinct classes of affective experience, with distinct neural signatures that we can now identify and distinguish empirically.</p></sec></sec></boxed-text></app></app-group></back><sub-article article-type="article-commentary" id="SA1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15166.017</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Mason</surname><given-names>Peggy</given-names></name><role>Reviewing editor</role><aff id="aff13"><institution>University of Chicago</institution>, <country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text><p>In the interests of transparency, eLife includes the editorial decision letter and accompanying author responses.

Ultimately, we are pleased that this approach allowed us to expedite the review process for your work by taking into consideration the considerable efforts you had already invested in addressing past reviewers' and editors' concerns satisfactorily.</p><p>This is a very important paper. It tackles a finding that in no short order became dogma and even slipped into popular 'fact.' The authors clearly demonstrate that the conflation of the brain representations of self and other pain is not warranted and that has been 'verified' without the simple but telling tests that the authors use in this paper. In particular, the authors compare 3 different intensities and 2 different locations and then toss in two additional modalities at single intensity and location. The work is compelling and shows that the somatic pain signature is different from the vicarious pain one. The important take-home message is (in the authors words) that &quot;vicarious pain does not involve re-activation of somatosensory representations. Rather, body site-specific representations of vicarious pain may be accomplished using the mPFC 'mentalizing' system and perhaps other ideomotor systems.&quot;</p><p>The reviewing editor raised the following point that should be addressed in a revision:</p><p>Could the authors discuss in a concise way why they think that previous studies have come up with a different answer?

While I am convinced by the data, I am puzzled by the long record of studies concluding the opposite.

We have added an additional section to the Discussion to address this, which is reproduced here:</p><p>“Most previous studies of pain empathy point out its similarity with somatic pain, and it is thus widely believed that the two experiences rely on the same systems. Why are our findings and conclusions different? There are three main reasons.</p><p>[…]</p><p>Based on our findings, we infer that the overlapping activation in dACC, aINS, and other areas is not related to shared pain experience. Interestingly, on close reading, the few previous multivariate pattern-based studies agree broadly with this interpretation. The brain patterns they identified as shared across somatic and observed pain were not specific to ‘pain,’ as these patterns were also activated by other, non-painful types of negative affect (Corradi-Dell’Acqua, Tusche, Vuilleumier, &amp; Singer, 2016; Zaki et al.et al., 2016). As in our study, in these studies what is shared does not seem to be particular to pain per se.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
