vesicles in dedicated structures called docking/release sites. It has been assumed that when voltage-dependent calcium entry is sufficiently large, synaptic output attains a maximum value of one synaptic vesicle per action potential and per site. Here we use deconvolution to count synaptic vesicle output at single sites (mean site number per synapse: 3.6). When increasing calcium entry with tetraethylammonium in 1.5 mM external calcium concentration, we find that synaptic output saturates at 0.22 vesicle per site, not at 1 vesicle per site. Fitting the results with current models of calcium-dependent exocytosis indicates that the 0.22 vesicle limit reflects the probability of docking sites to be occupied by synaptic vesicles at rest, as only docked vesicles can be released. With 3 mM external calcium, the maximum output per site increases to 0.47, indicating an increase in docking site occupancy as a function of external calcium concentration.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>synapse</kwd><kwd>release site</kwd><kwd>calcium concentration</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004794</institution-id><institution>Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>UMR 8003</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Marty</surname><given-names>Alain</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Advanced Grant Single Site 294509</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Marty</surname><given-names>Alain</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>JSPS</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>KAKENHI Grant JP18K06472</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Miki</surname><given-names>Takafumi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002915</institution-id><institution>Fondation pour la Recherche Médicale</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SPF201809007190</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tran</surname><given-names>Van</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The probability of occupancy of individual synaptic release sites at rest sets an upper limit to synaptic output when increasing action potential related calcium entry.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The release of synaptic vesicles (SVs) at mammalian central synapses is a complex process that comprises two series of events. Firstly, SVs move to a small part of the presynaptic terminal, the active zone (AZ), where they bind to specific proteins such as RIM and Munc13, and undergo a number of maturation steps including docking and priming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Südhof, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Jahn and Fasshauer, 2012</xref>). At the end of these preparatory processes, SVs are connected to the plasma membrane through SNARE complexes, and they are ready for exocytosis. Secondly, mature SVs fuse with the plasma membrane following a rapid increase in local Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration (Ca<sub>i</sub>), leading to the release of neurotransmitter. The sensitivity of the exocytosis step to Ca<sub>i</sub> results from the change of conformation of the SNARE complex following rapid Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding to a series of Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding sites residing on synaptotagmins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Jahn and Fasshauer, 2012</xref>). Experiments combining Ca<sup>2+</sup> uncaging and Ca<sub>i</sub> measurement in presynaptic terminals with postsynaptic EPSC recording have demonstrated that these sites have a low affinity for Ca<sup>2+</sup> and fast kinetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bollmann et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Schneggenburger and Neher, 2000</xref>). The corresponding Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent reactions generate a characteristic curve describing the rate of SV exocytosis as a function of Ca<sub>i</sub>. At low Ca<sub>i</sub> values, the response follows a sigmoid rise with a Hill coefficient close to 4. At high Ca<sub>i</sub> values, the response saturates, presumably because all available SVs undergo exocytosis. Based on these findings, various multistep kinetic models of SV release have been proposed, where the probability of exocytosis reaches a maximum of 1 for high Ca<sub>i</sub> values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bollmann et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Schneggenburger and Neher, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lou et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>The docking/priming steps preceding exocytosis have been extensively studied in recent years. TIRF results using single SV tracking in calyx of Held terminals indicate a sequence of a long-lived (about 3 s long) tethered state (at a distance of &lt;100 nm from the plasma membrane), followed by shorter-lived (about 0.3 s long) docked, and docked/primed states, before exocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Midorikawa and Sakaba, 2015</xref>). These results indicate that certain docking/priming steps are much slower than exocytosis. However other results using electrophysiological recordings indicate that in some preparations, the last preparatory step before exocytosis can occur within a few ms only (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Saviane and Silver, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Hallermann et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Miki et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kawaguchi and Sakaba, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Miki et al., 2018</xref>). In agreement with these studies, a recent electron microscopy study of synaptotagmin-1 modified mouse mutants demonstrates that in these mouse lines, docking of synaptic vesicles occurs within 10 ms following action potential stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chang et al., 2018</xref>). Another electron microscopy study carried out on wild type animals showed that following a presynaptic action potential, complex undocking/docking sequences occur on a time scale ranging from 5 to 100 ms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kusick et al., 2018</xref>). These results indicate that the last step before exocytosis involves a fast, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent SV movement towards the plasma membrane, and they suggest some degree of integration between preparatory steps and exocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Neher and Brose, 2018</xref>).</p><p>Recently our group has developed methods to investigate SV release in 'simple synapses', small central synapses that contain a single presynaptic active zone (review: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Pulido and Marty, 2017</xref>). Simple synapse recording in cerebellar slices has provided precise information on SV release and has led to several observations indicating that docking sites are not fully occupied at rest, both in GABAergic connections between molecular layer interneurons (MLIs), and in glutamatergic connections between parallel fibers (PFs) and MLIs: (i) in MLI-MLI simple synapses, responses to repeated saturating Ca<sup>2+</sup> uncaging stimulations display trial to trial fluctuations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Trigo et al., 2012</xref>); (ii) when testing the responses of simple MLI-MLI synapses to presynaptic action potentials, individual docking sites fluctuate between periods of low release probability and periods of high release probability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Pulido et al., 2015</xref>); (iii) synaptic facilitation at simple PF-MLI synapses is most simply explained by assuming partial resting docking site occupancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Miki et al., 2016</xref>). In spite of these various lines of evidence, however, present estimates for the probability of docking site occupation remain tentative, because of the difficulty in separating this probability from the release probablilty of occupied sites.</p><p>Model simulations indicate that the docking site occupancy at rest strongly influences short-term synaptic plasticity and statistics of SV release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Pulido and Marty, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Miki, 2019</xref>). In addition, the proposal of partial docking site occupancy at rest has important implications concerning the maximum response of a synapse. Because a release site needs a docked SV to release, partially occupied docking sites should display a release probability following AP stimulation that remains below 1, even if experimental conditions are chosen to maximize release of docked SVs. To test this prediction, we explore in the present work how high release conditions alter the behavior of simple synapses. We estimate release site numbers in each recording, and obtain absolute numbers for the release probability per release site. We then produce dose-response curves by combining these results with measurements of calcium entry in single varicosities. Comparing the dose-response curve with the predictions of current models of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent exocytosis confirms the notion that docking site occupancy is incomplete at rest, and that partial site occupancy limits the synapse output at high release probability. Furthermore, our results suggest that docking site occupancy grows as a function of the external Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration, [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub>. They further suggest that a given [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub>, the docking site occupancy can be obtained as the maximal attainable release probability per release site. Finally, our results suggest that previous apparently discrepant results indicating a very high (close to 1) maximal release probability per release site can be explained partially by uncorrected errors in variance-mean analysis, and partially by changes of docking site occupancy with [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub>.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Release probability per docking site during AP trains</title><p>In this work we examine counts of SV release events measured in simple PF-MLI synapses when increasing the release probability with several methods. Our aim is to identify the source(s) of the increase of release probability in each case, taking advantage of the detailed information provided by SV counting in individual AZs. As further discussed below, we assume for the interpretation of our results that release occurs at a finite set of docking/release sites, and that SVs undergo exocytosis only once they are docked. Within this simple docking/release model, we attempt to distinguish increased probability of docking site occupancy by SVs from increased probability of exocytosis of an occupied docking site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Quastel, 1997</xref>).</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> illustrates the experimental protocol. Having established a recording in an MLI, a pipette was placed either in the granule cell layer or in the molecular layer to stimulate extracellularly a presynaptic granule cell or its associated PF axon. The pipette position and stimulation strength were carefully adjusted to restrict the stimulation to a single presynaptic PF (see Materials and methods; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Malagon et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Miki et al., 2017</xref>). Trains of 8 action potentials (APs) were applied at a frequency of 100 Hz inside a train, leaving 10 s intervals between trains. Typical traces in response to an 8-AP stimulation train (stimulation times: vertical red bars) are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>. As illustrated in this example, responses to individual APs varied between single quantal responses (with unitary amplitudes on the order of 100 pA or more in this preparation: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Llano and Gerschenfeld, 1993</xref>; examples in responses to 1 st and 2nd AP in 1 st trace), failures (as following 3rd and 4th AP of 1 st trace), and multivesicular responses (eg, following the 5th stimulation in the 1 st trace). Only results passing previously defined criteria for simple synapse recordings were accepted in this work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Malagon et al., 2016</xref>). Briefly, the criteria were: (i) stability of the recording as a function of time; (ii) amplitude occlusion for consecutive events at short intervals; (iii) low scatter of quantal current amplitudes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Malagon et al., 2016</xref>). In recordings that met these criteria, we identified single release events during AP trains by deconvolution, using a synapse-specific averaged quantal EPSC profile as template (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Malagon et al., 2016</xref>). We then summed the numbers of SVs released in a 5 ms long time window following each AP stimulation. These numbers represent the output of individual AZs following AP stimulations. They are depicted in matrices as a function of AP number and train number in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, where grey levels represent various SV numbers.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Effects of different release conditions on synaptic parameters and short-term plasticity.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Upper panel: Schematics of recording configuration.

We then observed a gradual increase in SV counts during a train, reflecting facilitation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, upper panel; group data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, pink). After obtaining a series of train responses, SV counts were calculated separately for each of the 8 successive AP stimulations, and we calculated means and variances of SV counts according to the AP stimulation number, i. This gave a variance vs. mean plot with 8 data points that could be fitted using a parabola (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). To interpret these data we assumed that each simple synapse obeys a binomial release process, with N functional units (docking/release sites) acting in parallel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Malagon et al., 2016</xref>). The intersect of the parabola with the abscissa axis yielded the value of N. For stimulus number i, we calculated the probability P<sub>i</sub> that a docking site releases a SV by dividing the mean SV count by N, with a mean N value of 3.6 across synapses. The mean of P<sub>1</sub> obtained in this manner under control conditions was 0.089 ± 0.015 while the mean of the maximum of P<sub>i</sub> for i = 1–8 was P<sub>max</sub> = 0.270 ± 0.027. These data show that facilitation markedly increases P under control conditions, with a ratio between P<sub>1</sub> and P<sub>max</sub> of 3-fold. They also indicate that P is far from reaching the maximum value of 1 under these conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Effect of adding 1 mM TEA on P</title><p>Standard docking/release site models assume that a docking site can release only if it is occupied by a SV. Accordingly, these models predict that P<sub>i</sub> is the product of δ<sub>i</sub> and p<sub>i</sub>, where δ<sub>i</sub> is the mean docking site occupancy (sometimes noted p<sub>occ</sub>) before stimulus number i, and p<sub>i</sub> is the probability of release of a docked SV (sometimes noted p<sub>ves</sub>) following stimulus number i (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Vere-Jones, 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zucker, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Quastel, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Scheuss and Neher, 2001</xref>). In the following we will accept the P<sub>i</sub> = δ<sub>i</sub> p<sub>i</sub> relation as a guideline. Recent results calling for a qualification of this hypothesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Miki et al., 2018</xref>) will be discussed below.</p><p>Increasing evidence indicates that both facilitation and depression mostly follow changes in docking site occupancy, reflecting a trade-off between SV loss by exocytosis and SV gain by docking site replenishment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Pulido et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Miki et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Miki et al., 2018</xref>). Accordingly, we assume in the following that p<sub>i</sub> takes a common value, p, independently of i, so that P<sub>i</sub> = δ<sub>i</sub> p. For i = 1 we write δ<sub>1</sub> = δ, and P<sub>1</sub> = δ p, where δ is the resting docking site occupancy. In line with our previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Miki et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Miki et al., 2017</xref>), we further assume that all release sites have the same release probability and that they are located at equal distances from presynaptic voltage-dependent calcium channels.</p><p>While the value of P<sub>1</sub> is readily accessible by performing variance-mean analysis of SV counts, as explained above, separating p from δ poses a challenge. An attractive way to determine δ is to increase the amount of Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry until p reaches one because in this case, the relation P<sub>1</sub> = δ p becomes P<sub>1</sub> = δ. Therefore, measuring P<sub>1</sub> under very high release probability conditions provides a direct estimate of δ.</p><p>We therefore explored ways to increase p in the present work. Previous studies indicate that addition of TEA increases p in many synapses including PF-MLI synapses by broadening AP duration and increasing the amount of Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry per AP, mainly by blocking Kv3 channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sabatini and Regehr, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ishikawa et al., 2003</xref>). When applying TEA in granule cell recordings, we found in agreement with previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sabatini and Regehr, 1997</xref>) a decrease in voltage-dependent K<sup>+</sup> current amplitudes and an increase in AP duration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Furthermore, TEA increased the responses of PF-MLI synapses to AP stimulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>: compare first and second panel from above). Comparing released SV counts before and after the addition of TEA in the same experiment, as illustrated in the example of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, shows a marked increase in the presence of TEA. Average SV counts across experiments for the first AP were n<sub>1</sub> = 0.36 ± 0.06 in control and n<sub>1</sub> = 0.85 ± 0.26 in TEA (n = 6; p&lt;0.05, paired t-test). Variance-mean analysis of SV counts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, first and second graphs from top) showed no change of N upon application of TEA (individual experiments and corresponding means in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Given that N stays constant, the change in synaptic strength associated with TEA application is entirely mediated by an increase in P. After normalizing SV counts per docking site, we found that P<sub>1</sub> values increased from 0.103 to 0.213 in 1 mM TEA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).</p><p>Despite this marked increase in P<sub>1</sub>, the responses to an 8-AP train displayed roughly the same amount of facilitation with and without TEA. Paired-pulse ratio (PPR) values, obtained by calculating the ratio of n<sub>2</sub>/n<sub>1</sub>, were similar with and without TEA (two first columns in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). When examining the time course of n<sub>i</sub> values during the train, the maximum P<sub>max</sub> was attained earlier in TEA (for i = 3) than in control (for i = 5), but the shapes of the two curves were not strikingly different (compare pink and red curves in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). These observations are in line with the fact that the value of P<sub>1</sub> obtained in TEA (0.213) is far from the maximum attainable value of 1, leaving room for a significant increase of P linked to facilitation.</p><p>Finally, the value of P<sub>max</sub> in the presence of 1 mM TEA was 0.472, far below the maximum of 1. Therefore, increasing release probability by a combination of synaptic facilitation and of TEA application is not sufficient to bring the release probability to 1.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Saturation of P as a function of TEA concentration</title><p>A possible interpretation of the results above is that addition of 1 mM TEA was insufficient to bring the release probability of a docked SV (p) to its maximum of 1. To investigate this possibility, we tested 5 mM TEA in a new series of experiments, starting again from the same 1.5 mM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> control condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, third row). As documented below, Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry was substantially increased in 5 mM TEA compared to 1 mM TEA. Nevertheless, even with 5 mM TEA, failures were often observed in response to the 1 st AP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, third row), suggesting that P<sub>1</sub>, the probability that a site releases a SV after the 1<sup>st</sup> AP, was still far from reaching its maximum of 1. In these experiments, P<sub>1</sub> grew from 0.053 ± 0.018 without TEA to 0.146 ± 0.036 in 5 mM TEA. This represented a mean P<sub>1</sub> ratio of 3.0 in individual experiments, not significantly different from the 1.9-fold ratio obtained in the previous experiments with 1 mM TEA (unpaired t-test). Globally these results suggest that TEA increases P<sub>1</sub> only up to a certain point.</p><p>If p is close to 1 in both 1 mM and 5 mM TEA, then in view of the relation P<sub>1</sub> = p δ, P<sub>1</sub> is close to δ in both cases. Therefore, an obvious possible explanation for the limitation of P<sub>1</sub> near 0.2 is that this limit represents δ, the docking site occupancy. Starting with a common submaximal δ value leaves the same room for δ-driven facilitation in 1 mM TEA experiments and in 5 mM TEA experiments. In line with this suggestion, we found similar values for the PPR (2.47 ± 0.45 in 1 mM TEA vs. 1.80 ± 0.21 in 5 mM TEA; n. s.) and for P<sub>max</sub> (0.472 ± 0.059 in 1 mM TEA vs. 0.351 ± 0.080 in 5 mM TEA; n. s.) in 1 mM TEA and in 5 mM TEA.</p><p>In summary, values of P<sub>1</sub>, P<sub>max</sub> and PPR are similar in 1 mM TEA and in 5 mM TEA, suggesting saturation of p as a function of TEA concentration. In 5 mM TEA as in 1 mM TEA, the variance-mean curve remains restricted to the ascending limb of the parabola, where the release probability is less than 0.5 (grey thick lines in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, 2nd and 3rd panels from above).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Release statistics as a function of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration</title><p>In view of our failure to reach P = 1 by addition of TEA, we next studied SV release in elevated (3 mM) [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> conditions, both with and without TEA, and we compared the results with those previously obtained under control [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> (1.5 mM).</p><p>We first examined results in 3 mM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> without TEA. In 3 mM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub>, P<sub>1</sub> was increased compared to 1.5 mM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> (0.28 ± 0.03 vs. 0.089 ± 0.015; p&lt;0.01, unpaired t-test), and it reached a mean value similar to that obtained in 1.5 mM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> and TEA (0.28 ± 0.03 vs. 0.21 ± 0.06). Likewise P<sub>max</sub> was larger in 3 mM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> compared to 1.5 mM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> (0.46 ± 0.04 vs. 0.27 ± 0.03; p&lt;0.01, unpaired t-test), and was similar in 3 mM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> compared to 1.5 mM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> and TEA (0.46 ± 0.04 vs. 0.47 ± 0.06).</p><p>The finding that P<sub>1</sub> and P<sub>max</sub> take similar values in 3 mM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> and in 1.5 mM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> plus TEA could reflect a common limit to the strength of the synapse. Alternatively, it could be a sheer numerical coincidence. To distinguish between these two possibilities, we next tested the effects of adding 1 mM TEA starting in 3 mM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub>. P<sub>1</sub> significantly increased from 0.28 ± 0.03 to 0.51 ± 0.09 (p&lt;0.05, paired t-test; exemplar experiment in lowest 2 panels of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; group results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).

Therefore, whereas neither P<sub>1</sub> nor P<sub>max</sub> increased significantly when increasing the TEA concentration from 1 to 5 mM in 1.5 mM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> experiments, both P<sub>1</sub> and P<sub>max</sub> were significantly higher in 3 mM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> and 1 mM TEA compared to 3 mM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub>. These results indicate that combining [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> elevation with TEA application is an effective way to overcome the limitations in P apparent at high TEA concentrations with normal [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub>.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>TEA and [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> increase P by two different mechanisms</title><p>In view of the relation P = δ p, we propose as an interpretation of the above results that TEA application leads to an increase of p without a change in δ, whereas an increase in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> results in increases in both δ and p. In this interpretation, δ remains constant if [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> is constant, so that even if TEA increases p near its maximum p = 1, P remains limited by δ. This explains the limitation of P<sub>1</sub> values near 0.2 in 1.5 mM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). By contrast if [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> is increased the value of δ increases so that the maximum attainable for P<sub>1</sub> increases according to the change in δ. This explains the higher P<sub>1</sub> values observed when combining TEA and high [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub>, compared to applying TEA in normal [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E–F</xref>).</p><p>The proposal of differential effects of TEA and [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> on p and δ also helps explaining short-term plasticity results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. As detailed earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Pulido and Marty, 2018</xref>), models of synaptic function based on changes in docking site occupancy predict different effects of increasing p or δ on short-term synaptic plasticity. While all synapses become depressing if δ increases to the maximum δ = 1, some synapses with low δ values remain facilitating even if p increases to p = 1. This is because if the initial value of docking site occupancy is low, even if the first AP releases all docked SVs, replenishment of initially empty docking sites can overcompensate the loss of exocytosed SVs, resulting in facilitation. In the present case, while facilitation was prominent in 1.5 mM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub>, without and with TEA, it became weak or absent in 3 mM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> (yellow and green curves in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Simultaneously depression increased, particularly in the presence of TEA (green curve in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), and the value of the PPR decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). Overall, the finding that facilitation remains when applying TEA alone is consistent with a pure effect on p, while the more complex effects observed on short-term synaptic plasticity when increasing [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> are consistent with a mixed effect on p and δ.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Miniature current frequencies in elevated [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> and in TEA</title><p>In several synapses including MLI synapses onto Purkinje cells, increasing [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> leads to an increase of miniature current frequency, presumably following an increase in the presynaptic resting [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Llano et al., 2000</xref>). At PF-MLI synapses, we found that miniature EPSC frequency rose from 0.142 ± 0.033 Hz in 1.5 mM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> to 0.364 ± 0.040 Hz in 3 mM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> (p&lt;0.01; n = 6), while mean peak miniature EPSC amplitudes did not change significantly (93.6 ± 9.1 pA in 1.5 mM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> vs. 105.3 ± 20.4 pA in 3 mM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub>; p&gt;0.05; n = 6). These data suggest that elevating [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> results in an elevation of presynaptic [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> at PF-MLI synapses. By contrast, we found that TEA (1 mM) did not change miniature EPSC frequency (control frequency: 0.123 ± 0.014 Hz; TEA frequency: 0.116 ± 0.023 Hz, p&gt;0.05, n = 7). These results suggest that [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> elevation, but not TEA addition, leads to an increase in the presynaptic basal [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>. As SV replenishment is enhanced by elevations of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Neher and Sakaba, 2008</xref>), it is plausible that presynaptic [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> elevation increases the docking site occupancy δ.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Comparison of variance-mean analyses performed on SV counts and on EPSC peak amplitudes</title><p>A striking outcome of the experiments described so far is that in all cases, variance-mean parabolas were far from complete, as illustrated by the thick grey curves in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>. Specifically, in spite of our efforts, we were unable to attain a value of P larger than 0.66 in the above experiments (i. e., the value of P<sub>max</sub> in 3 mM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> and 1 mM TEA). This contrasts with many studies reporting P values of 0.9 or larger when performing mean-variance analysis of peak EPSC amplitudes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Branco and Staras, 2009</xref>). One possible reason for the discrepancy is that P is limited by δ, as mentioned above, and that the value of δ is particularly low in PF-MLI synapses. Another possible reason is methodological. In the traditional method of peak EPSC mean-variance analysis, receptor saturation or desensitization, as well as synaptic jitter, can lead to substantial errors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Clements, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Silver, 2003</xref>). These errors worsen at high release probability, and if they are not corrected, their effects tend to overestimate P and to underestimate N. While methods exist to correct for some of these errors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Silver, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Taschenberger et al., 2005</xref>), corrections are difficult to implement, often requiring dedicated experiments, and they are at best partial. To examine the potential consequences of the errors involved, we next compared in the same recordings the P value obtained from peak EPSC analysis with the value obtained from SV counts.</p><p>A comparison between the two kinds of variance-mean analyses is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> in an experiment using 3 mM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub>. The variance-mean parabola indicated a P<sub>1</sub> value of 0.307 with the SV count method (left, red triangles) and of 0.487 with the peak EPSC method (center, open purple rectangles); P<sub>max</sub> values were 0.436 with the SV count method and 0.710 with the peak EPSC method. As illustrated in this example, P estimates were invariably higher with the EPSC amplitude analysis than with the SV count analysis. The discrepancy became larger when correcting the variance for EPSC amplitudes for the variations in q values in the same experiment (filled purple rectangles, right panel: P<sub>1</sub> = 0.530, and P<sub>max</sub> = 0.779), as is usually done in peak amplitude variance-mean analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Silver, 2003</xref>). To perform the correction, we assumed a CV value of 0.30 for quantal amplitude variance within one synapse, based on previous estimates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Malagon et al., 2016</xref>). Average results revealed significant discrepancies in P<sub>1</sub> estimates in 3 mM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> (0.294 ± 0.032 with the SV count method vs. 0.612 ± 0.058 with the peak EPSC method, p&lt;0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>; note that the present values obtained with the peak EPSC method are in agreement with previous estimates in the same preparation using the same method: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ishiyama et al., 2014</xref>). Similarly, P<sub>max</sub> estimates were smaller with the SV count method than with the peak EPSC method (0.456 ± 0.025 vs. 0.806 ± 0.058, p&lt;0.01; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Estimated N values were larger with the SV counting method than with the peak EPSC method (3.94 ± 0.46 vs. 2.19 ± 0.29, p&lt;0.05; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), suggesting that the peak EPSC method leads to an underestimate of N. Finally, direct measurements of quantal current amplitudes (217 ± 22 pA) were significantly different from q estimates derived from EPSC amplitude variance-mean analysis (147 ± 24 pA, p&lt;0.01; green vs. purple means in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). These numbers indicate a significant (about 1.5-fold) under-estimate of q values with the EPSC amplitude variance-mean analysis compared to direct measurements. Altogether these results indicate that the peak EPSC amplitude mean-variance analysis leads to over-estimates of P<sub>1</sub> and P<sub>max</sub>, and to under-estimates of N and q, likely due to a combination of receptor saturation and synaptic jitter. Consequently, the difference between the moderate maximum P values found in this work, and higher values found in earlier studies, may partially arise from uncorrected errors linked to receptor saturation and synaptic jitter in these earlier studies.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Comparison between variance-mean analysis of SV counts and variance-mean analysis of peak EPSC amplitudes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Variance vs. mean plots calculated for different stimulus numbers (8 stimuli per plot) in a representative simple synapse experiment (3 mM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub>).

Therefore we next investigated the changes in Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry associated with [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> changes and with TEA applications. For this purpose, we performed two-photon imaging of single PF varicosities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) to determine Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry elicited by AP trains. We started fluorescence measurements about 30 min after establishing somatic whole-cell recording to allow dye equilibration in the imaged axonal area. Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry was evaluated as the relative increase of the peak fluorescence measurement of OGB-6F (ΔF/F<sub>0</sub>: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> shows an experiment where we compared ΔF/F<sub>0</sub> signals under control conditions and during TEA application, finding a reversible increase.

Three series of experiments were performed: adding 1 mM TEA starting from a 1.5 mM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> solution, as in panel B (n = 5); increasing the TEA concentration from 1 mM to 5 mM, starting in a 1.5 mM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> plus 1 mM TEA solution (n = 4); and adding 1 mM TEA in 3 mM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> (n = 5). Group results showed significant increases of Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry upon application of 1 mM TEA, both when starting from a 1.5 mM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> solution (control: 26.7 ± 3.6%; 1 mM TEA: 40.5 ± 3.6%; p&lt;0.01, paired t-test) and when starting from a 3 mM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> solution (control: 43.8 ± 11.6%; 1 mM TEA: 86.4 ± 25.2%; p&lt;0.05; paired t-test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, lower panel). Likewise, we found a significant increase of fluorescence measurements in 1.5 mM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> when increasing the TEA concentration from 1 to 5 mM (1 mM TEA: 70.8 ± 10.6%; 5 mM TEA: 100.7 ± 11.3%; p&lt;0.05; paired t-test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, lower panel). Therefore, even though our previous results indicate that P<sub>1</sub> does not increase when elevating the TEA concentration from 1 to 5 mM, the present imaging results show that Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry is substantially larger at the higher TEA concentration.

For this purpose, we combined together P<sub>1</sub> values obtained under the various experimental conditions of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, together with peak global [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>I</sub> data obtained from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, creating an experimental plot of P<sub>1</sub> as a function of peak global [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>I</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). In this plot, P<sub>1</sub> values are overall means derived from the paired control/TEA experiments of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> as well as from other experiments including the TEA/(TEA + 4-AP) experiments to be described below. In addition, P<sub>1</sub> values were corrected to only incorporate release events coming directly from docking sites ('one-step release'), as opposed to indirect release events coming from replacement sites ('two-step release': <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Miki et al., 2018</xref>). Because 2-step release events do not originate from docked SVs, they should not be considered in the estimate of δ. Fortunately, in ordinary experimental conditions, 2-step release appears only starting from the 2<sup>nd</sup> AP in a train, and is not detectable after the 1<sup>st</sup> AP. In these cases, no correction for P<sub>1</sub> is needed to account for 2-step release. Only in the most extreme condition of 3 mM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> + TEA was a correction necessary (by 18%). Also, peak global values from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> were corrected for partial dye saturation. To relate the corrected experimental results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> to the simulation in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, we note that in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, the ordinate is p, the release probability of docked SVs, whereas in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, the ordinate is P<sub>1</sub>, the global release probability in response to the first stimulus in a train. As already pointed out, P<sub>1</sub> data points incorporate both δ and p factors, according to the relation P<sub>1</sub> = δ p. Clearly, P<sub>1</sub> data differ from the curve in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> and furthermore, they cannot be fit from this curve by using a single scaling factor. However, acceptable fits are obtained when using two different scalings depending on [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). In these plots, δ appears as the asymptotic value of P<sub>1</sub> at high global [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>, yielding δ = 0.22 at 1.5 mM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> and δ = 0.47 at 3 mM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Altogether this analysis suggests that δ values increase as a function of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> and therefore, that changes in both δ and p contribute to the sensitivity of P as a function of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub>.</p></sec><sec id="s2-10"><title>Combined effects of TEA and 4-AP</title><p>It may be asked whether the above results may be extended to other blockers of potassium channels than TEA. Both in MLI terminals and in the calyx of Held, 4-AP increases synaptic transmission more efficiently than TEA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tan and Llano, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ishikawa et al., 2003</xref>). In MLI terminals, 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) markedly increases calcium entry whereas TEA alone is almost ineffective; combining TEA and 4-AP together leads to an even larger AP-induced calcium elevation than when applying 4-AP alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tan and Llano, 1999</xref>). In view of these earlier results, we expected that combining TEA and 4-AP in our preparation should lead to a very large presynaptic calcium entry. Nevertheless, supposing that the model of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> is valid, P<sub>1</sub> should not be able to increase beyond the value of δ. Group results showed P<sub>1</sub> values of 0.140 ± 0.053 in 1.5 mM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> and 1 mM TEA without 4-AP, and of 0.187 ± 0.048 after further addition of 15 μM 4-AP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). After adding 4-AP, both 2-step release and facilitation were very pronounced, probably due to a marked increase in calcium entry. After correction for 2-step release, P<sub>1</sub> in TEA + 4-AP was 0.125 ± 0.032, a value similar to that in TEA alone. Meanwhile, P<sub>max</sub> increased from 0.263 ± 0.046 in TEA alone to 0.550 ± 0.149 in TEA + 4-AP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>), a value similar to that obtained in 3 mM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> and 1 mM TEA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Thus, while P<sub>1</sub> was limited by the resting docking site occupancy, the synapse could deliver more SVs upon repetitive stimulation as SV replenishment was increased. In conclusion, whether calcium entry is increased with TEA alone or with a combination of TEA and 4-AP, P<sub>1</sub> remains limited by the value of δ.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Main finding</title><p>In the present work we take advantage of the recently developed method of SV counting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Malagon et al., 2016</xref>) to examine variations of the release probability of single docking sites (P) during short term synaptic plasticity, following addition of TEA, and when changing [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub>. Our main finding is that the synaptic strength at the beginning of an AP train (P<sub>1</sub>) has a maximum attainable value that depends on the value of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub>. With 1.5 mM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub>, the maximum of P<sub>1</sub> is 0.22 SV per AP and per release/docking site, whereas with 3 mM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub>, the maximum of P<sub>1</sub> is 0.47.</p><p>Our interpretation of this finding is that when the release probability of docked SVs, p, is close to 1, P<sub>1</sub> is limited by the resting docking site probability δ, and that δ is lower in 1.5 mM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> compared to 3 mM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub>. The maximum output per site gives an estimate of resting docking site occupancy, a basic parameter of synaptic function that has been difficult to evaluate.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Correcting release probability for docking site occupancy</title><p>Our results confirm earlier suggestions that δ is less than 1 at PF-MLI synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Miki et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Miki et al., 2018</xref>). In addition, we now provide reliable δ estimates. The present finding that δ = 0.22 under physiological conditions (1.5 mM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub>) implies that there is a large discrepancy between the release probability per docking site, P<sub>1</sub>, and the release probability per occupied docking site, p. By inverting the P<sub>1</sub> = δ p relation, we obtain from P<sub>1</sub> = 0.089 and δ = 0.22 that p = 0.39 in 1.5 mM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub>. At 3 mM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub>, we have P<sub>1</sub> = 0.28 and δ = 0.47, so that p = 0.60. Therefore both at 1.5 mM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> and at 3 mM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub>, the actual release probability of docked SVs is substantially higher than it would appear without the correction. In the presence of TEA, p values calculated from the pooled data of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> approach 1 (1.5 mM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub>: p = 0.85 in 1 mM TEA and p = 0.95 in 5 mM TEA; 3 mM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub>: p = 0.89 in 1 mM TEA, value corrected for 2-step release). Therefore in the present preparation, P<sub>1</sub> values in the presence of TEA give reasonably good approximations of δ.</p><p>This correction is important when relating release probability and local calcium profiles. For example, at synapses between PFs and Purkinje cells, P values are comparatively small, yet EGTA application experiments suggest tight coupling between SVs and Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry, indicating high p values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Schmidt et al., 2013</xref>). A low δ value at these synapses, similar to the value found here for PF-MLI synapses, is a plausible explanation for these apparently discrepant results.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Comparison with other preparations</title><p>Increasing evidence suggests that part of inter-synaptic variability may reside in differences in docking site occupancy. Specifically, synapses follow a gradient from low release probability, facilitating synapses to high release probability, depressing synapses, presumably depending on the proportion of occupancy of release sites by SVs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Pan and Zucker, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Pulido and Marty, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Neher and Brose, 2018</xref>). PF-MLI synapses have a low δ value in normal physiological conditions (0.22 at 1.5 mM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> according to the present study) and are facilitating, indicating that they belong to the first category, called 'tonic synapses' (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Pan and Zucker, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Neher and Brose, 2018</xref>). By contrast, SV release statistics at simple MLI-MLI synapses indicate a higher resting δ value near 0.5–0.7 in 2 mM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Trigo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Pulido et al., 2015</xref>). Furthermore MLI-MLI synapses are depressing, and altogether MLI-MLI synapses appear closer to the 'phasic synapse' category (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Pan and Zucker, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Neher and Brose, 2018</xref>).</p><p>Because of the difficulty of separating δ from p, estimates of δ in most preparations are not available. Nevertheless, earlier variance/mean analysis studies, often carried out on peak synaptic current amplitudes, give constraints on δ. Maximum P values reported in these studies are usually in the range 0.5–1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Branco and Staras, 2009</xref>). In view of the relation P = δ p, since p&lt;1, such large P values suggest resting δ values above 0.5. However these maximum P values are almost always obtained in high [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> conditions (calyx of Held: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Taschenberger et al., 2005</xref>; PF-MLI synapses: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ishiyama et al., 2014</xref>; fly neuromuscular junction: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Reddy-Alla et al., 2017</xref>; hippocampal cultures: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sakamoto et al., 2018</xref>). In view of the present evidence that δ increases as a function of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub>, the high P values at high [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> are compatible with δ values &lt; 0.5 under normal [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> conditions, at least in some (tonic) synapses. Apart from using high [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> conditions, another factor that may have contributed in some studies to high apparent P values is uncorrected synaptic jitter and receptor saturation, as documented above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). One notable exception is the climbing fibre-Purkinje cell synapse, that may represent an extreme case of phasic synapses, and that exhibits P values above 0.9 at normal [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Silver et al., 1998</xref>). Overall our conclusions appear well compatible with earlier P estimates obtained with variance/mean analysis of peak synaptic current amplitudes.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Possible mechanisms of changes of δ with [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub></title><p>An increase in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> likely acts on the docking site occupancy by inducing an increase in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> after reequilibration of the cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration. It is widely accepted that following docking site depletion, docking site replenishment is sensitive to the bulk [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Neher and Sakaba, 2008</xref>). This suggests that the proportion of occupied docking sites at rest may be enhanced by a [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> increase, as the equilibrium is shifted in favor of SV binding to the docking site. Recent electron microscopy studies are in accord with this proposal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kusick et al., 2018</xref>).

In the calyx of Held, as well as in MLI terminals, subthreshold presynaptic depolarization activates low-threshold voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, thus increasing release probability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Awatramani et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bouhours et al., 2011</xref>). Activation of Cl<sup>-</sup>-permeant presynaptic glycinergic or GABAergic receptors in these synapses engages this pathway, leading to a presynaptic [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> increase and to an enhancement of synaptic strength (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Turecek and Trussell, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Trigo et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zorrilla de San Martin et al., 2017</xref>). Activation of cationic channels by presynaptic nicotinic receptors, AMPA receptors, or NMDA receptors, is also able to increase presynaptic [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>, in various preparations including MLI terminals, and these actions have been shown to increase release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sharma and Vijayaraghavan, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rossi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rossi et al., 2012</xref>).

In view of the present results, it is possible that these effects are mediated at least in part by an increase in resting docking site occupancy. Altogether, [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>-driven changes of docking site occupancy appears as a simple and powerful mechanism of gain control of synaptic strength that may be used by various forms of neuromodulation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Recording procedures</title><p>Sagittal slices (200 μm thick) were prepared from the cerebellar vermis of Sprague-Dawley rats (P12<bold>‒</bold>P17) following the animal care guidelines of Paris Descartes University (approval no.

Two alternative procedures were used to find an appropriate location for electrical stimulation. In the first procedure, an electrical stimulation pipette was located in the molecular layer, above the dendritic field of the recorded MLI, and the pipette position and stimulation strength were adjusted to obtain minimal stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Miki et al., 2016</xref>).

Firstly, we made an average of single EPSCs obtained during asynchronous release to obtain a template in a given synapse. Then the average mEPSC was fit by triple-exponential function with five free parameters (rise time, amplitude, fast decay time constant, slow decay time constant, and amplitude fraction of slow decay). Next, mEPSC and individual data traces were deconvolved using the five parameters. The deconvolved mEPSC resulted in a narrow spike, and the deconvolved data traces resulted in sequences of spikes. Finally, we fit a given deconvolved trace by a sum of scaled narrow spikes in order to obtain the timing of each event. The amplitude parameter was free because the peak EPSC amplitude varied during a train due to receptor saturation and desensitization. The above procedure had a detection limit that caused a failure of separation of two events occurring within 0.2 ms.

The fusion rate at V<sub>0Ca-4Ca</sub> is l<sub>+</sub> x f<sup>0-4</sup>. b is a cooperativity factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lou et al., 2005</xref>). In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A-B</xref>, the probability of occupancy at docking site was set to 1. For the Ca<sup>2+</sup> uncaging simulation, we assumed step [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] increases from a basal [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] of 50 nM to 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, or 24 μM, and we calculated the release probabilities by dividing the total number of vesicle release between 0 and 5 ms by the docking site number. For the AP simulation, we used the local [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] obtained from Ca<sup>2+</sup> simulation at 40 nm distance from the nearest Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Miki et al., 2018</xref>). Global [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] was obtained at the center of a bouton in Ca<sup>2+</sup> simulation. The Ca<sup>2+</sup> simulation was described in detail in a previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Miki et al., 2018</xref>). Briefly, we calculated the spatiotemporal distribution of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] at a PF bouton. We used the bouton size of 0.9 × 0.5×0.5 μm<sup>3</sup> cuboid, and the Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel distributions based on the electron microscopy observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Miki et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Miki et al., 2018</xref>). The amplitude of Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through each channel during an AP was set at 0.2 pA and a fraction of channel open probability during an AP of ~0.7. We assumed a Gaussian-shaped Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx with a half-amplitude duration of 0.34 ms. Other model parameters were set following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Miki et al. (2018)</xref>. To create Ca<sup>2+</sup> waveforms having various amplitudes for the AP simulation, we multiplied the simulated local and global [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] by a factor of 0.25, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2 and 3 while keeping the resting [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] of 50 nM. We calculated the release probabilities by dividing the total number of vesicle release between 0 and 5 ms after the beginning of the local [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] increase by the number of docking sites.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Isabel Llano for her advice and support in two-photon imaging experiments.

Using a recently published method for counting released synaptic vesicles, the authors have studied variations of release probability of individual docking sites by changing the extracellular calcium concentration while blocking voltage-gated potassium channels. Using a sophisticated set of experiments the authors conclude that the maximum output per individual docking site allows for estimating the occupancy of the docking site under resting conditions.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Incomplete vesicular docking limits synaptic strength under high release probability conditions&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by Eve Marder as the Senior Editor, a Reviewing Editor, and three reviewers. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript, the authors continue their work aiming at a better understanding of the readily releasable pool of vesicles. To this end, they use a preparation allowing recording from a single-site synapse. This approach allows for counting synaptic vesicle fusion events rather than relying on the EPSC for mean-variance analyses. From this analysis, they estimate the number of release sites, and the release probability per site. By increasing the release probability of docked vesicles, they are able to estimate the fraction of release sites with docked vesicles. The work is a continuation of an already rather extensive body of data provided by the Marty group. Here they use different calcium concentrations and TEA in order to drive release probability to 1, which allows them to obtain a better estimate of the occupancy of vesicle docking sites.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>All reviewers agree that the manuscript is interesting, experimentally well done, and allows for further insights into the physiological foundation of the classical synaptic release parameters, thus deserving publication in <italic>eLife</italic> after appropriate revision. There was some disagreement between the reviewers concerning the use of TEA for blocking K-channels. After some discussion, the reviewers agreed on suggesting one set of additional experiments to strengthen the manuscript: To ensure that calcium influx is adequate to fuse all docked vesicles, an experiment should be carried out in which TEA is complemented with moderate concentrations of 4-AP (in the range of 10-20 uM). If, as expected, probability of fusion = 1.0 with TEA alone, further increases in calcium by blocking additional K-channels with 4-AP is not expected to change the response. Such an experiment would give more confidence that under the TEA conditions indeed maximal calcium concentrations are achieved as claimed.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>1) Authors assume that both p and δ are Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent but argue that Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx increased by K channel blocker (TEA increase from 1mM to 5 mM) has no effect on δ. The references quoted (subsection “TEA and [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> increase P by two different mechanisms”) do not seem to provide a support this argument. At least a spatial model to distinguish Ca<sup>2+</sup> increases, by elevation of external Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration and by TEA, would be necessary to propose this hypothesis.</p><p>2) In subsection “Saturation of P as a function of TEA concentration”, P1 values in 1 mM TEA and 5 mM TEA are compared, but Figure 1E indicates that control values (1.5 Ca<sup>2+</sup>, 0 TEA) are very different between two sets of experiments, therefore this comparison does not make sense unless the ratio to controls in individual experiments are compared. Likewise, at in subsection “Combining measurements of Ca2+ 334 entry with P measurements”, Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx is compared between two conditions to be similar (1 mM TEA / 3 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> (green in Figure 3C) vs 5 mM TEA / 1.5 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> (purple), with no controls across two sets of experiments.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The experiments are convincing, and the data provide a simple explanation for complex behaviors of synapses. For those interested in molecular mechanisms, the manuscript spins out a multitude of questions about how to square their model with ultrastructural data, and molecular models of docking and of modulation, including the roles of Doc2, synaptotagmins, and Munc13 proteins. These are largely unaddressed in the Discussion. But I feel it is better to keep the manuscript narrow than becoming a venue for speculation.</p><p>My critique mainly focuses on presentation.</p><p>1) Rationale. It is still not clear what conclusions had been made in previous manuscripts, and what were the shortcomings of these publications that this manuscript corrected. At first it seems like well-trod ground for the Marty lab – docking is limiting, increases in docking underlie facilitation. In the end, I had to reread all of the previous manuscripts to determine what had been learned here. In fact, docking values were slightly more (δ=0.45 Miki, 2016; δ=0.3 Miki, 2018) – so what has been learned? They should state succinctly what was previously known, describe the limitations in these previous manuscripts, specifically why it was difficult to precisely determine the docking site occupancy in their previous studies. And underscore the novel result, that is, that calcium increases the number of docked vesicles even before stimulation.</p><p>2) Abstract. The authors do not attempt to reach out to the general <italic>eLife</italic> reader, even in the Abstract – the significant take-home messages are lost in comments about jitter and saturation. The general reader will not understand the mode of action or the significance of TEA treatment. I appreciate the specific numbers; the mean N value should also be cited.</p><p>3) Acronyms. In the rest of the document, the English style is simple and direct, which is an achievement in itself. Acronyms such as 'AP', 'MLI', 'PF', and 'PPR', are not defined. I think the reader will also need an occasional reminder to distinguish 'P' from 'p' from &quot;release probability&quot; as they read on.</p><p>4) TEA. The conclusion that docking is limiting hangs on the argument that they have maximized p with 1mM TEA – 5mM TEA does not increase P1. But that claim is not fully supported. The alternative is that 1mM TEA saturates calcium influx. The experiment demonstrating that TEA has not saturated calcium influx does not come until Figure 3. In the meantime, I was convinced they were wrong. Rearranging the figures might improve the logic of the argument or noting that this will be demonstrated below. Moreover, the ΔF/F<sub>o</sub> data for 1mM TEA &amp; 1.5 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> varied dramatically between two comparisons in Figure 3. They were more convincingly demonstrated in the 2016 paper. Nevertheless, they achieve significance and the data are consistent with previous experiments; they can stand in my opinion.</p><p>5) Probability of release. subsection “Effect of adding 1 mM TEA on P”: What are the estimated p values for these values of P1?

Group results are shown in Figure 4—figure supplement 1 of the revised manuscript. Mean P1 values were 0.140 in TEA, and 0.187 in TEA + 4-AP. In TEA + 4-AP, both facilitation and 2-step release were surprisingly prominent, indicating very strong calcium entry. After correcting for 2-step release, the P1 value in TEA + 4-AP was 0.125, similar to the value in TEA alone. Therefore, the new data are in conformity with the prediction outlined by the Editor, that when starting in TEA, further addition of 4-AP should not increase P1 significantly. Put in other words, the new results suggest that 4-AP, just like TEA, acts on p but not on δ.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p></disp-quote><p> <italic>1) Authors assume that both p and δ are Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent but argue that Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx increased by K channel blocker (TEA increase from 1mM to 5 mM) has no effect on δ. The references quoted (subsection “</italic>TEA and [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> increase P by two different mechanisms”<italic>) do not seem to provide a support this argument. At least a spatial model to distinguish Ca<sup>2+</sup> increases, by elevation of external Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration and by TEA, would be necessary to propose this hypothesis.</italic> </p><p>The reference Pulido, 2018 helps explaining that, while increasing [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> to 3 mM and adding 1 mM TEA have similar effects on P1, the first manipulation severely decreases facilitation but the second does not. As shown in Pulido, 2018, docking site models predict that short term synaptic plasticity does not only depend on p, but also on δ, as well as on r, the probability of replenishment of an emptied docking site during one interpulse interval. Specifically, PPR = (1 – p) + pr + (1/ δ – 1) r (eq 5 in Pulido, 2018). As can be seen from this equation, when p increases to its maximum of p = 1, the PPR decreases to a minimum of r/ δ, which is larger than 1 (facilitating) if r &gt; δ. Therefore, certain synapses with low δ values remain facilitating even if p = 1. When on the other hand δ increases to its maximum of 1, the PPR decreases to 1 – p + pr, which is always smaller than 1 (as both p and r are smaller than 1). Therefore, all synapses become depressing if δ increases to its maximum of δ = 1. We have changed the text to make the argument clearer.</p><p>The new data with 4-AP in addition to TEA shows that in these conditions, P1 remains low while facilitation remains prominent (new Figure 4—figure supplement 1). This confirms that blocking voltage dependent K channels, either with TEA or with 4-AP, has different effects on synaptic function than increasing [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub>.</p><p>To address the issue of differences in mechanism, we have now included new data contrasting the effects of elevated [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> and adding TEA on miniature current frequencies. These experiments show that elevated [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> increases mini frequency, but that addition of TEA does not have any such effect. They are consistent with our suggestion that the basal presynaptic Cai is increased following the first maneuver, but not following the second one. Also, the new experiments mixing TEA and 4-AP (see above, response to Editor) gave results consistent with the hypothesis that TEA (or other K channel blockers) act on p, not on δ.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In subsection “Saturation of P as a function of TEA concentration”, P1 values in 1 mM TEA and 5 mM TEA are compared, but Figure 1E indicates that control values (1.5 Ca<sup>2+</sup>, 0 TEA) are very different between two sets of experiments, therefore this comparison does not make sense unless the ratio to controls in individual experiments are compared.

To acknowledge this, we have changed our text in subsection “Combining measurements of Ca<sup>2+</sup>376 entry with P measurements” to say that our results were only an indication that P1 had similar values in 1 mM TEA and in 5 mM TEA. The important point is that both in 1 mM TEA and in 5 mM TEA, P1 is far from its maximum value of 1. Likewise, we have attenuated the statement concerning 1 mM TEA / 3 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> and 5 mM TEA / 1.5 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> in subsection “Combining measurements of Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry with P measurements”. In Figure 4C, the various data points are presented with their respective error bars, and the scatter of experimental data is plainly apparent. In this figure all available results have been incorporated, so that means are slightly different from the means presented in Figure 1, that only reported the experiments with paired analysis. Therefore in Figure 4C, the n value is 9 for 1.5 Ca + 1 TEA, not 5, and the n value is 6 for 1.5 Ca + 5 TEA, not 4. Incorporating more data in the summary plot of Figure 4C gives more statistical weight to mean values. The point here is that the data cannot be fit with a single scaled version of the model curve in Figure 4B.</p><p>We have performed the ratio analysis suggested by the reviewer. The mean P1 ratio is 1.9 in 1 TEA, and 3.0 in 5 TEA, but the difference is not significant. We have incorporated this comparison in the revised in subsection “Saturation of P as a function of TEA concentration”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[…]</p><p>1) Rationale.

Only later in a train does 2-step release appear. As our assessment of δ values only relies on an analysis of P1, errors due to 2-step release are minimal. According to results exposed in Miki et al., 2018, 2-step release following the first AP becomes detectable only in the most extreme conditions (3 mM calcium and 1 mM TEA, or 1.5 mM calcium, 1 mM TEA and 4-AP, see above). This effect is accounted for as explained in in subsection “Combining measurements of Ca<sup>2+</sup>376 entry with P measurements”, by removing 2-step release events from the relevant points in the plot of Figure 4C.

In individual experiments we compared a control situation (either 1.5 or 3 external calcium) without TEA to a test situation with TEA (or in one series of experiments, we increased the TEA concentration). Thus, we cannot conclude from these experiments whether changing calcium would increase the basal calcium level. However, we do have evidence indicating an increase of intracellular calcium, from measurements of mini rates at the two external calcium concentrations. We find that the mini rate increases as a function of external calcium, suggesting a rise in internal calcium as well.
