SecA binds ribosomes and recognises nascent substrate proteins, but the molecular mechanism of nascent substrate recognition is unknown. We investigated the role of the C-terminal tail (CTT) of SecA in nascent polypeptide recognition. The CTT consists of a flexible linker (FLD) and a small metal-binding domain (MBD). Phylogenetic analysis and ribosome binding experiments indicated that the MBD interacts with 70S ribosomes. Disruption of the MBD only or the entire CTT had opposing effects on ribosome binding, substrate-protein binding, ATPase activity and in vivo function, suggesting that the CTT influences the conformation of SecA. Site-specific crosslinking indicated that F399 in SecA contacts ribosomal protein uL29, and binding to nascent chains disrupts this interaction. Structural studies provided insight into the CTT-mediated conformational changes in SecA. Our results suggest a mechanism for nascent substrate protein recognition.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>SecA</kwd><kwd>ribosome</kwd><kwd>protein translocation</kwd><kwd>protein secretion</kwd><kwd>metal-binding domain</kwd><kwd>SAXS</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/L019434/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jamshad</surname><given-names>Mohammed</given-names></name><name><surname>Huber</surname><given-names>Damon</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/P009840/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Knowles</surname><given-names>Timothy J</given-names></name><name><surname>Hughes</surname><given-names>Gareth W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MIBTP</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wynne</surname><given-names>Max</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FOR 1805</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kramer</surname><given-names>Günter</given-names></name><name><surname>Bukau</surname><given-names>Bernd</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFB 638</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kramer</surname><given-names>Günter</given-names></name><name><surname>Bukau</surname><given-names>Bernd</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>099266/Z/12/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mohammed</surname><given-names>Fiyaz</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>KR3593/2-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kramer</surname><given-names>Günter</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The interaction of SecA with its substrate proteins is regulated by its evolutionarily conserved C-terminal tail, which autoinhibits SecA unless SecA binds to the ribosome.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, approximately a quarter of all newly synthesised proteins are transported across the cytoplasmic membrane by the Sec machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cranford-Smith and Huber, 2018</xref>). Of these, the majority (~65%) require the activity of SecA for translocation across the membrane. SecA is an evolutionarily conserved and essential ATPase that is required for protein translocation in bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cranford-Smith and Huber, 2018</xref>). The catalytic core of SecA (amino acids ~1–832 in <italic>E. coli</italic>) contains five domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>): nucleotide binding domain-1 (NBD1; amino acids 9–220 and 378–411), the polypeptide crosslinking domain (PPXD; 221–377), nucleotide binding domain-2 (NBD2; 412–620), the α-helical scaffold domain (HSD; 621–672 and 756–832) and the α-helical wing domain (HWD; 673–755). Binding and hydrolysis of ATP at the NBD1/NBD2 interface cause conformational changes in the HSD and HWD, which are required for the translocation of substrate proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cranford-Smith and Huber, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Collinson et al., 2015</xref>). In addition, the PPXD undergoes a large conformational change, swinging from a position near the HWD (the ‘closed’ conformation) to a position near NBD2 (the ‘open’ conformation) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zimmer et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zimmer and Rapoport, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2015</xref>). SecA binds to substrate protein in the groove formed between the PPXD and the two NBDs, and the PPXD serves as a ‘clamp’ that locks unfolded substrate proteins into this groove when it is in the open conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zimmer and Rapoport, 2009</xref>).</p><p>SecA can recognise its substrate proteins cotranslationally. SecA binds to the ribosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Huber et al., 2011</xref>), and ribosome binding facilitates the recognition of nascent substrate proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Huber et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Huber et al., 2011</xref>). The binding site for SecA on the ribosome includes ribosomal protein uL23, which is located adjacent to the opening of the polypeptide exit channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Huber et al., 2011</xref>). Structural and biochemical studies indicate that ribosome binding is mediated by two regions in the catalytic core: the N-terminal α-helix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Singh et al., 2014</xref>) and the N-terminal portion of the HSD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Huber et al., 2011</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). The structure of the SecA-ribosome complex was recently determined at medium resolution (~11 Å) by cryo-electron microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Singh et al., 2014</xref>). However, the molecular mechanism governing the recognition of nascent substrate proteins is unknown.</p><p>In addition to the catalytic core, most SecA proteins contain a relatively long C-terminal tail (CTT; also known as the C-terminal linker [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hunt et al., 2002</xref>]), whose function is not well understood (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In <italic>E. coli</italic>, the CTT (833-901) contains of a small metal binding domain (MBD; 878–901) and a structurally flexible linker domain (FLD; 833–877). Although it is not required for protein translocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Or et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Or et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fekkes et al., 1997</xref>), <italic>E. coli</italic> strains producing a C-terminally truncated SecA protein display modest translocation defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Or et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Grabowicz et al., 2013</xref>).

Phylogenetic and sequence analysis of the CTT suggested that it could be involved in binding of SecA to ribosomes, which we confirmed using ribosome cosedimentation and chemical crosslinking approaches. Strikingly, disruption of the MBD alone or the entire CTT had opposing effects on multiple activities of SecA, suggesting that the CTT affects conformation of the catalytic core. Mass spectrometry, x-ray crystallography, and small-angle x-ray scattering experiments indicated that the FLD is bound in the substrate binding groove and affects the conformation of the PPXD. Finally, site specific chemical crosslinking suggested that binding of the MBD to the ribosome allows full-length SecA to interact with nascent substrate proteins.

Because initial fitting runs indicated that the CTT was in close proximity to the catalytic core in models of full-length SecA and SecAΔMBD, we fixed the position of the FLD in subsequent fits so that it was consistent with the Bpa crosslinking results. The resulting models suggested that the PPXD was positioned considerably closer to NBD2 (i.e. more ‘open’) in SecA and SecAΔMBD than in SecAΔCTT (p=2.0×10<sup>−5</sup> and 1.1 × 10<sup>−7</sup>, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). In models of SecAΔMBD and SecAΔCTT, the PPXDs in the two protomers of the dimers were positioned asymmetrically (p=1.8×10<sup>−8</sup> and 0.0085, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B–D,F</xref>). Finally, in models of full-length SecA, the MBD was positioned between NBD2 and the C-terminal portion of the HSD (amino acids 756–832) in both protomers of the dimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Localisation of the MBD to this region would position it directly adjacent to the ribosome-binding surface on the catalytic core (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Huber et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Singh et al., 2014</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our results indicate that the CTT controls the conformation of SecA and regulates its activity. Disruption of the MBD alone (i) increases the affinity of SecA for the ribosome, (ii) decreases the affinity of SecA for substrate protein, (iii) inhibits the ATPase activity of SecA, (iv) increases the thermal stability of SecA, (v) prevents SecA from undergoing a conformational change upon binding to nascent substrate protein and (vi) causes a defect in SecA function in vivo. However, disruption of both the MBD and the FLD results in a protein that behaves very similarly to full-length SecA, indicating that the FLD mediates these effects. Chemical crosslinking and structural modelling of the SAXS data for wild-type SecA suggest that the FLD interacts with the catalytic core (potentially binding in the substrate protein binding groove) and causes a conformational change in the PPXD. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gold et al. (2013)</xref> have suggested that opening of the PPXD when SecA is bound to substrate protein (<italic>i.e.</italic> enclosing the substrate protein within the binding groove by the PPXD clamp) activates the ATPase activity of SecA. Our work suggests that enclosure of the FLD by the PPXD has the opposite effect—that is, autoinhibition of SecA.</p><p>We propose that the MBD is the key for unlocking this autoinhibited conformation in the full-length protein. Previous work suggests that interaction of the MBD with SecB increases the affinity of SecA for polypeptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gelis et al., 2007</xref>). Our results raise the possibility that binding of the MBD to the ribosome activates SecA in a similar fashion. The absence of the MBD does not cause a strong defect in binding of SecA to ribosomes (indeed, SecAΔMBD has a higher affinity for ribosomes than full-length SecA and SecAΔCTT), and our results suggest that binding of the catalytic core to the ribosome would place the MBD in an ideal position to bind to the ribosomal surface. Thus, although the affinity of the MBD in isolation for the ribosome is relatively low, binding of the catalytic core could trigger binding of the MBD to the ribosome in the context of the full-length protein.</p><p>Taken together, our results allow us to propose a mechanism for the recognition of nascent substrate proteins by SecA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>): (i) interaction of the MBD with the ribosomal surface upon binding of the catalytic core of SecA to the ribosome destabilises the interaction between the FLD and the catalytic core; (ii) destabilisation of the FLD allows SecA to sample nascent polypeptides; (iii) the stable interaction of SecA with nascent substrate protein displaces the FLD from the substrate binding groove; and (iv) binding of SecA to nascent substrate protein causes a conformational change in SecA that leads to release from the ribosome.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.48385.019</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Diagram of the proposed mechanism for recognition of nascent substrate proteins by SecA.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) In solution, SecA occupies an autoinhibited conformation with the FLD bound stably in the substrate protein binding site and the PPXD in the open conformation.

One possibility is that autoinhibition prevents the spurious interaction of SecA with non-substrate proteins by only allowing it to interact with polypeptides in the presence of its ligands (<italic>e.g.</italic> translating ribosomes, SecB and potentially phospholipids/SecYEG) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Breukink et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gelis et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fekkes et al., 1999</xref>). Indeed, overproduction of substrate polypeptides causes a translocation defect in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wagner et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Müller et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Oliver and Beckwith, 1982</xref>), indicating that SecA can be overwhelmed by interactions with too many substrate proteins. In addition, the spurious translocation of cytoplasmic proteins can be toxic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">van Stelten et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Emr et al., 1978</xref>). Alternatively, the structure of the MBD could regulate the activity of SecA in response to physiological stress. For example, research by the Huber group suggests that the physiological ligand of the MBD is iron (BIORXIV/2019/613315). It is possible that the structure of the MBD is regulated in response to iron limitation or the redox state of the bound metal. If so, the partial activity of SecAΔMBD in vivo suggests that the CTT modulates the activity of SecA rather than inhibiting it completely.</p><p>Our results suggest that SecA<sup>Bpa852</sup>-biotin produces auto-crosslinks very efficiently. At least three factors could contribute to the high efficiency of auto-crosslinking in SecA<sup>Bpa852</sup>-biotin: (i) the amount of time the benzophenone group of the Bpa is in contact with the target molecule, (ii) the chemical reactivity of Bpa toward the target molecule, and (iii) the amount of time the benzophenone group stays in the activated state. First, the results of this study and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gelis et al., 2007</xref>) is consistent with the idea that the FLD is stably bound in the substrate protein-binding groove of SecA, which should result in a long-lived contact between position 852 and the amino acids lining the substrate binding groove. Second, although benzophenone can, in theory, react with any C-H bond, in practice it reacts with different efficiencies toward different amino acid side chains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wittelsberger et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lancia et al., 2014</xref>). Finally, the chemical environment surrounding a benzophenone group (<italic>e.g.</italic> hydrophobicity, pH, <italic>etc</italic>.) can influence its photo-reactive properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barsotti et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barsotti et al., 2017</xref>). Because Bpa is typically incorporated at surface-exposed positions in order to capture protein-ligand interactions, these environmental effects are normally negligible. However, the hydrophobic environment surrounding the side chain of position 852 when bound in the substrate binding groove could have a significant effect on its reactivity.</p><p>The basic features of the catalytic core of SecA are highly conserved amongst bacteria, but different bacterial species contain a diverse array of loops and extensions. For example, our phylogenetic analysis indicated that many species contain alternative CTTs with structures that are significantly different from that of <italic>E. coli</italic>. These differences could allow SecA to be regulated in response to interaction with a different subset of interaction partners. Nonetheless, many of these alternative CTTs are highly positively charged (<italic>e.g.</italic> those of many Actinobacteria), suggesting that they may retain the interaction with the ribosome. Some phylogenetic groups (<italic>e.g.</italic> the Cyanobacteria) lack a CTT entirely. However, most of these species contain large loops in between the conserved elements of the catalytic core of the protein. Indeed, <italic>E. coli</italic> SecA also contains a ‘variable’ subdomain in NBD2 (amino acids ~ 519–547), which has been proposed to regulate its activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Das et al., 2012</xref>). It is possible that the large loops in between the conserved features of the catalytic core could function analogously to the CTT in <italic>E. coli</italic> SecA.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or <break/>reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>Escherichia coli K-12</italic>)</td><td valign="top">MC4100</td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Casadaban, 1976</xref></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">F<sup>-</sup> <italic>araD139</italic> D<italic>lacU169 rpsL150 thi rbsR</italic></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>Escherichia coli K-12</italic>)</td><td valign="top">DRH1119</td><td valign="top">This paper</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">MC4100 Δ<italic>secA::Kan<sup>R</sup></italic> λ<sub>att</sub>::<italic>p<sub>lacUV5</sub>-secA</italic></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>Escherichia coli K-12</italic>)</td><td valign="top">DRH1120</td><td valign="top">This paper</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">MC4100 Δ<italic>secA::Kan<sup>R</sup></italic> λ<sub>att</sub>::<italic>p<sub>lacUV5</sub>-secA</italic>Δ<italic>MBD</italic></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>Escherichia coli K-12</italic>)</td><td valign="top">DRH1121</td><td valign="top">This paper</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">MC4100 Δ<italic>secA::Kan<sup>R</sup></italic> λ<sub>att</sub>::<italic>p<sub>lacUV5</sub>-secA</italic>Δ<italic>CTT</italic></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>Escherichia coli K-12</italic>)</td><td valign="top">DRH663</td><td valign="top">This paper</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">MC4100 Δ<italic>secA::Kan<sup>R</sup> + pDH663</italic></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>Escherichia coli B</italic>)</td><td valign="top">BL21(DE3)</td><td valign="top">Lab stock</td><td valign="top"><italic>Escherichia coli</italic> Genetic Stock Center (CGSC), Yale University, USA.

An in-line Superose 6 10/300 GL column (GE Healthcare) was used to ensure that the protein was free from aggregates and that it occupied a single oligomeric state during data collection. The sample-to-detector distance was 3 m, covering a range of momentum transfer s = 0.03–0.494 Å<sup>−1</sup> (s = (4π·sin θ)/ λ, where 2θ is the scattering angle, and λ = 0.992 Å is the X-ray wavelength). Data from the detector were normalised to the transmitted beam intensity, averaged, placed on absolute scale relative to water and the scattering of buffer solutions subtracted. All data manipulations were performed using PRIMUS<italic>qt</italic> and ATSAS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Petoukhov et al., 2012</xref>). The forward scattering <italic>I</italic>(<italic>0</italic>) and radius of gyration, <italic>R<sub>g</sub></italic> were determined by Guinier analysis.

Molecular masses of solutes were estimated from SAXS data by comparing the extrapolated forward scattering with that of a reference solution of bovine serum albumin.

Guinier analysis of the SAXS data indicated that the protein was dimeric under the conditions used for SAXS. Structural models of the <italic>E. coli</italic> SecA dimer were generated by aligning the structure of SecA in PDB file 2VDA to PDB files 2FSG, 2IBM, 2IPC, 1M6N, 1NL3 and 6GOX using PyMol v. 1.8.0.5 and refining using GROMACS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pronk et al., 2013</xref>). Because the CTT is not resolved in the structures used for modelling, these models were fitted to the SAXS spectrum of SecAΔCTT using FoXS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schneidman-Duhovny et al., 2016</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). The structures of full-length SecA, SecAΔMBD and SecAΔCTT were modelled by fitting the 2FSG dimer to the respective SAXS data by multi-step rigid body refinement using CORAL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Petoukhov et al., 2012</xref>). The positions of NBD1, NBD2, HSD and HWD were fixed in all models. The regions corresponding to residues 1–8, 220–231, 367–375 were defined as linkers and modelled as flexible. The PPXD was allowed rigid body movement in all three models. The FLD (residues 829–832 in SecAΔCTT and 829–880 in SecAΔMBD and full-length SecA) were modelled as flexible. For full length SecA, the MBD was modelled using PDB file 1S × 0 and allowed rigid-body movement. Because initial modelling indicated that the FLD was in close contact with the catalytic core, and because photocrosslinking indicated the FLD was bound in the substrate binding groove, residues 851–854 were modelled to form a small β-sheet with residues 222–225 and 373–375 and allowed rigid body movement. All ten independently generated fits for SecA and SecAΔMBD produced plausible structural models (χ<sup>2</sup> = 0.97 ± 0.02 and 1.87 ± 0.09, respectively). Ten of 15 of the fits of SecAΔCTT produced plausible structural models (χ<sup>2</sup> = 1.82 ± 0.18). In the remaining five fits, the position of the PPXD in one of the two protomers was inconsistent with previously published structures of SecA and occupied a non-realisitic conformation, suggesting increased mobility of the PPXD in SecAΔCTT.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank A McNally and members of the Bukau, Mayer, Henderson, Lund, Grainger, Cole and Rossiter groups for helpful advice and discussions.

The first decision letter after peer review is shown below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;The C-terminal tail of the bacterial translocation ATPase SecA modulates its activity&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and John Kuriyan as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>There are two main issues to be addressed experimentally:</p><p>1) Experiments to determine whether and which divalent metal(s) impact function of the C-terminal domain.

Experimental investigation of this issue is beyond the scope of this study, but discussing this issue is worthwhile.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>The manuscript submitted by the Huber lab relates to the regulation of the essential motor ATPase responsible for the bulk of bacterial protein secretion. The results build up to a hitherto unknown mechanism for its auto-inhibition and activation by nascent substrates at the ribosome exit site. The submission compiles high quality data, which have been sensibly interpreted, so the story is plausible. It is a story that should certainly be worth considering for those of us interested in SecA, and who have until now completely ignored the regulatory feature of the C-terminus. The paper will also be of interest to a much wider readership, and also for folk interested in the development of antibiotics. Thus, the work could be worthy of publication in <italic>eLife</italic> if the following points and suggestions can be addressed/considered.</p><p>To be addressed:</p><p>1) The metal binding site seems to have an important role here. Does it require metals to function? If so, which ones – Zn<sup>2+</sup>? Probably some/many of the experiments should be compared with and without divalent metals.</p><p>2) Figure 3A shows important evidence for interaction of flexible linker with the catalytic core by intra-molecular crosslinking of residue 852. The authors say the SecA-852 band is fully crosslinked, in contrast to 893 and 898, because of its higher apparent mobility. I would like the authors to redo this experiment, but with equal quantities of SecA, just to check that it is not a loading artefact. Also, why is the crosslink not induced by UV? Were the uncrosslinked samples kept in the dark at all times?</p><p>3) Concerning the X-ray structure. If the FLD influences the conformation of SecA, as stated, then it should be evident in the high-resolution structure. How does the new structure compare to others determined without the FLD? Did the full-length protein fail to crystallise? This figure could do with some improvement by colouring the different domains and highlighting the location of the C-terminus and FLD. The two monomers of the dimers could also be distinguished somehow.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>The study from Jamshad and colleagues investigates the function of the C-terminal domain of SecA, a key factor in protein export in bacteria. The authors show that in <italic>E. coli</italic> the C-terminal domain of SecA, as well as binding SecB, can also bind to the ribosome. Loss of the entire CTT leads to no obvious growth defect and actually enhances ribosome binding, suggesting that it likely has a regulatory function. Indeed through crosslinking, structural and functional analyses a model emerges where the metal binding domain of the CTT acts to control substrate loading in response to ribosome binding. Overall, the experiments are largely well performed and the study provides new insight into SecA function. Following attention to the points below I would be supportive of publication.</p><p>In Figure 1D the SUMU-CTT is in large excess over ribosomes, it would be important to see a 10% input to assess the efficiency of binding. It would also be informative to assess whether SecA lacking the CTT is able to inhibit binding.</p><p>In Figure 2B, the effect of the nascent chain is established by comparing empty 70S ribosomes with a stalled SecM RNC. This could reflect changes due to the nascent chain, but also the fact that the ribosomes are now programmed. This could be distinguished using a shorter nascent chain that has not yet emerged from the exit tunnel. Moreover, data from the Wintermeyer group also indicate that interaction of the nascent chain with the uL23 inside the tunnel can also trigger changes in binding of SRP, another exit site ligand, which also interacts via uL23.</p><p>In Figure 2D, there is no control to show that SecA is essential in the strain being used (e.g. control strain lacking exogenous SecA with and without IPTG). The writing on the back of the plate is also quite intrusive. It would be essential to show the expression levels of the proteins relative to endogenous levels of SecA. It could be that the mutants are unstable in vivo and this causes the phenotype.</p><p>The functional analysis of the mutants would be more complete if their ability to support protein translocation (either in vivo or in vitro) was evaluated.</p><p>In Figure 3, there is a loss of two peptides from the MS analysis. Was the crosslinked peptide also detectable? This would strengthen the identification of the two peptides as the crosslinking site.</p><p>Was the auto-crosslinked complex tested for structural analysis? This might have stabilised the CTD allowing it to be visualised.</p><p>Does the ∆MBD construct with the 852 suppressor also form the auto crosslink? This would strengthen the argument that the locked ∆MBD conformation is a state the wild-type protein also encounters and not a non-physiological dead-end state.</p><p>In addition to 852, crosslinkers were also incorporated in the MBD at positions 893 and 898, but it was not clear why these were not further analysed. In particular, it would seem logical to text if these give rise to crosslinking to rProteins as that might permit further pinpoint localisation of the MBD at the ribosome surface or relative to the rest of SecA.</p><p>If Figure 5C, what is higher UV-specific band seen just above the SUMO-SecA band with the 209 construct? Is this a crosslink to another ribosomal protein? If so, that might further define the positioning of SecA relative to the ribosome.</p><p>In Figure 5D, the crosslink to the ∆MBD seems smaller. Is it established that this is still a crosslink to uL29 and not a different rProtein? This would be important to establish and confirm that ∆MBD binds in the same position as the WT, but cannot reposition upon binding the nascent chain.</p><p>In the authors model, peptide binding leads to release of SecA and the substrate from the ribosome. Can this be tested by releasing the nascent chain in the RNC.SecA complex with puromycin?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>The authors investigated the functions of SecA's C-terminal tail. Sedimentation and crosslinking assays with the purified motor protein and purified ribosomes or nascent chain ribosome complexes revealed that the metal binding domain binds to the ribosomal surface. The binding event causes the PPXD to shift to the open conformation, thereby destabilizing the flexible linker domain, which – according to small-scale angle scattering experiments – resides in the substrate protein binding groove. In turn, the autoinhibition is released and SecA is able to sample nascent polypeptides.</p><p>The manuscript offers new insight into the recognition process between SecA and secretory polypeptides. The approach appears to be sound. Yet both membrane and SecYEG are missing in the emerging picture. That is, SecA's substantial affinity to lipid membranes and SecYEG is not mentioned. How do the newly determined K<sub>D</sub> values compare to those previously published for the interaction of SecA with lipid membranes and with the translocon? Does such affinity comparison favor SecA interactions with the nascent chain (i) in the cytoplasm or (ii) at the membrane surface?</p><p>[Editors’ note: what now follows is the editors’ decision letter after the first round of revisions.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting the revised manuscript entitled &quot;The C-terminal tail of the bacterial translocation ATPase SecA modulates its activity&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revision has been carefully reviewed by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor.</p><p>After carefully examining your responses to the editorial and reviewer comments, we find that the revision does not adequately address the concerns that were raised during review. Thus, the primary conclusions of this study are not supported with the level of rigor and depth expected for <italic>eLife</italic>. A detailed explanation of the concerns is provided below.</p><p>Editorial assessment of the author reply to reviewers:</p><p>The role of a metal requirement for MBD function was not examined satisfactorily. The sole experiment to address this issue, Figure 1D, is poorly controlled and uninterpretable. First, the signals in lane 7 and lane 2 are essentially indistinguishable (lane 7 is fainter, but the band is spread over a larger area, so the overall difference is hard to appreciate). Without replicates and statistics, one cannot reasonably infer relevance from such a modest difference. Even if one were to take the difference at face value, the effect cannot be attributed to the MBD from the information provided; it could possibly be due to an effect of EDTA on some part of the ribosome. There are no controls to verify that metal was in fact removed from the CTT. The authors have other experimental approaches at their disposal. For example, the purified CTT could be stripped of metal (e.g., with high concentration EDTA), the stripped metal and EDTA removed by dialysis or desalting, the extent of removal verified, and the metal-free CTT (compared to protein in which the metal was added back) used in the assays. Alternatively (or in addition), one could use mutants in the metal binding domain. In short, the issue of a metal requirement was not addressed.</p><p>The request to clarify the supposed UV-independent and highly efficient crosslinking from residue 852 was also not addressed adequately. This is a crucial experiment because it is the main direct evidence for the CTT engaging the catalytic core of SecA. The problem with UV-independence is that one cannot be certain the crosslink actually formed, with the alternative interpretation being a migration artefact with no crosslinks. The manuscript partially allays this concern, but the failure to detect a peptide is not especially strong evidence on its own. Based on what is shown, it could even be the case that BpA was not incorporated into 852 (amber suppression efficiency is known to be position-sensitive). While the authors could argue that the biotin blot shows amber suppression, this blot is very over-loaded and there is no negative control of a comparably overloaded SecA lacking the biotin tag. For these reasons, the conclusion that increased migration represents extremely efficient UV-independent intramolecular crosslinking through some unknown mechanism is not sufficiently compelling evidence to support a critical conclusion of the paper. If the authors' claim that this crosslink forms during the purification is correct, they can simply treat intact bacteria without or with UV, then harvest directly into SDS and monitor by blotting for the biotin tag. This should show a clear UV-dependent size shift to a position where the purified protein migrates. Other approaches are also feasible, including positioning BpA at nearby residues where the environment would be different, and hence, avoid constitutive UV-independent crosslinking. As it stands, a key conclusion of the study remains in doubt.</p><p>The request to provide the reader some estimate of the efficiency of binding in Figure 1D (first point of reviewer 2) was either ignored or misunderstood. The reviewer was asking simply to run 10% of the input sample on the same gel as the pulldowns so one could assess whether the amount pulled down was more or less than 10% of what went into the reaction. If it is far less, one could run 1% of the input (or whatever is roughly in the suitable range). The point is to provide the reader with a rough idea of how much is being pulled down in the experiment because this impacts how believable the findings are.</p><p>Similarly, the request to verify that SecA lacking the CTT fails to compete for binding in Figure 1D was also not addressed (second point of reviewer 2). This is a rather standard control, and it most certainly would affect the conclusions were it to compete similarly to WT SecA.</p><p>The reasonable request to test SecA levels in the different mutant strains relative to endogenous levels of SecA was addressed in a rather convoluted manner and did not adequately address the concern. IPTG-induced toxicity is not a good surrogate for expression levels because the basis of this toxicity could be different for different mutants (i.e., for some, it may have to do with SecA function, for others, it might have to do with protein aggregation or inappropriate interactions). It should be a straightforward matter to directly test expression levels by blotting using widely available SecA antibodies. Similarly, the request to directly test protein translocation is both reasonable and straightforward. The concern is not that SecA has some other function, but rather that ∆MBD is having its effect via a dominant toxicity unrelated to its function (which is certainly plausible).</p><p>The aberrant migration of the crosslink to ∆MBD relative to the corresponding crosslink to full length SecA in Figure 5D was not addressed. While it is true that ∆MBD migrates faster than wild type, the key concern was that the shift upon crosslinking was far smaller for ∆MBD than for full length, suggesting the possibility that the crosslinking partners are different. In this region of the gel, this difference in size shift is pretty substantial. It is therefore not acceptable to simply assume both crosslinks are to uL29.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what now follows is the decision letter after the authors submitted for further consideration.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;The C-terminal tail of the bacterial translocation ATPase SecA modulates its activity&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and John Kuriyan as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>This revised article generally satisfies the reviewer comments. As you will see below, reviewer 2 feels you should be more cautious in some of your conclusions that are not fully convincing, particularly the intramolecular crosslink. In reading the article and evaluating the revisions myself, I have similar reservations.</p><p>Please adjust the text accordingly and submit a final version as per the instructions below.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>The manuscript is a new submission of a paper previously submitted to <italic>eLife</italic>, of which I was a reviewer.</p><p>Following review there were substantial (but not major) problems that needed addressing with the support of additional experiments and controls. It turned out that these could not be fully resolved within 2 months and the paper was returned to the authors.</p><p>I've now read the cover letter carefully and looked at the relevant sections of the new manuscript, and the JBC submission (available at bioRxiv) concerning the metal binding site. The new data addresses my initial query about the nature of the metal ligand, and consequences of binding.</p><p>It seems to me that all other concerns have also been addressed and would be happy to see the manuscript published.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>The authors have now addressed most of the major issues I had identified from the first round of reviews. They nicely show that a programmed short nascent chain does not block the crosslink to uL29 strengthening the authors model. They also show the 10% input for the binding assay in Figure 1, this reveals that the level of binding is relatively low, probably 1-2% of the input protein, i.e. binding to around 10-20% of ribosomes. They have also now attempted the suggested competition assay control (for original Figure 1D) but obtained inconclusive results with the ∆CTT construct. I would agree this compromises the interpretation of the competition experiment, hence its removal is sensible. It is puzzling why the assay was so variable considering that the WT and ∆CTT constructs apparently behaved well for the structural analysis.</p><p>Protein levels of the in vivo expression of the constructs is now shown and look similar, albeit without a loading control. I still also think it would have been informative to also look at the effects of the SecA mutants on translocation rather than growth alone.</p><p>The revised section of the text dealing with the internal crosslink now doesn't actually mention the auto-crosslink formation, save in the section- and figure headings. The section should explain the behaviour of the three constructs +/- UV and then introduce the uv-independent crosslink explanation. Also, as I mentioned previously, and was discussed by the other reviewers, the lack of identification of the crosslinked peptide tempers the definitive confirmation that the faster-migrating band is actually crosslinked. So this remains a slight weak point in the manuscript.</p><p>The altered mobility of the ∆MBD-uL29 crosslink is now addressed by the use of mass-spectrometry to confirm its identity.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>I have no additional comments to the revised manuscript.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.48385.035</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the first round of peer review follow.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There are two main issues to be addressed experimentally:</p><p>1) Experiments to determine whether and which divalent metal(s) impact function of the C-terminal domain.

We feel that these revisions have significantly improved the manuscript, and we thank the reviewers for their very insightful feedback. We also have included a significant amount of new experimental material, which addresses the concerns raised in the decision letter. Our revisions include:</p><p>1) Crosslinking experiments indicating that SecA<sup>Bpa399</sup> crosslinks to uL29 on RNCs containing arrested nascent SecM that is too short to interact with SecA (Figure 5—figure supplement 1B). These results suggest that the loss of crosslinking to uL29 in Figures 5D and Figure 5—figure supplement 1A was the result of interaction of SecA with the nascent chain (i.e. was not due to the state of SecM-stalled ribosome).</p><p>2) Ribosome binding experiments indicating that the presence of a metal chelator partially inhibits binding of the CTT to the ribosome (Figure 1D). These results suggest that binding of the MBD to its metal cofactor is important for efficient binding to the ribosome.</p><p>We did not include experiments addressing the identity of the physiological metal ligand. The identity of the metal cofactor does not affect our conclusions, and the apparent identity of the metal cofactor (zinc) is well established. Furthermore, although we have accumulated a significant amount of evidence suggesting that the physiological metal ligand is actually iron, we feel that challenging the established knowledge merits its own publication. Indeed, we are in the process of preparing this work for publication. A portion of this work is already publicly available as an author pre-print at BioRxiv (doi: 10.1101/173039), and we have discussed the possible implications of this in the revised Discussion section.</p><p>The reviewers also asked that we discuss the interplay between the SecA-nascent chain interaction and the already established interaction of SecA with SecYEG and lipids, and we have expanded our discussion to accommodate this request.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>The manuscript submitted by the Huber lab relates to the regulation of the essential motor ATPase responsible for the bulk of bacterial protein secretion.

Unpublished research by our groups suggest that the physiological ligand of the MBD could be iron. However, we are not challenging the notion that MBD binds to zinc in the present work. Furthermore, both zinc and iron (as well as other metals) can promote the interaction of SecA with SecB. Determining the effect of any particular metal on the affinity of the MBD for the ribosome is extremely challenging. Ribosomes tend to contain large amounts of transition metal ions (including both zinc and iron). In addition, many cysteine-based iron-binding motifs will also bind to zinc with a similar or higher affinity. Because of the difficulty of these experiments and because the identity of the metal did not affect our conclusions, we did not address this topic.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Figure 3A shows important evidence for interaction of flexible linker with the catalytic core by intra-molecular crosslinking of residue 852.

We have noted the reproducibility of this experiment in the revised manuscript. We occasionally see that the protein migrates as a double band at early steps in purification but always converts to the aberrantly migrating form in Figure 3A and B following subsequent purification steps. We speculate that the reason for the increased efficiency of crosslinking is that the chemical environment surrounding position 852 activates the Bpa (or lowers the energy required for photoactivation of the Bpa). However, although the chemical basis for this increased efficiency is not known, it does not affect our conclusions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Concerning the X-ray structure.

The authors show that in E. coli the C-terminal domain of SecA, as well as binding SecB, can also bind to the ribosome. Loss of the entire CTT leads to no obvious growth defect and actually enhances ribosome binding, suggesting that it likely has a regulatory function. Indeed through crosslinking, structural and functional analyses a model emerges where the metal binding domain of the CTT acts to control substrate loading in response to ribosome binding. Overall, the experiments are largely well performed and the study provides new insight into SecA function. Following attention to the points below I would be supportive of publication.</p><p>In Figure 1D the SUMU-CTT is in large excess over ribosomes, it would be important to see a 10% input to assess the efficiency of binding.</p></disp-quote><p>The purpose of the experiments depicted in Figure 1D and E was to demonstrate that the MBD binds the ribosome and that it most likely does so at a specific site. Under physiological conditions the MBD is always connected to the catalytic core. The affinity of this domain for the ribosome in the absence of the catalytic core is not entirely relevant and does not affect our conclusion that the MBD binds to the ribosome near the site where full-length SecA binds the ribosome.</p><p>For the purposes of review, we note that preliminary experiments suggest that the affinity of SUMO-CTT for the ribosome is relatively weak. Lowering the input concentration of SUMO-CTT to 10% decreases the amount of co-sedimenting SUMO below the detection limit for western blotting. Concentrating the protein to carry out the converse experiment (10-fold more SUMO-CTT) results in protein solubility issues.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It would also be informative to assess whether SecA lacking the CTT is able to inhibit binding.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a technically challenging experiment that could provide limited (albeit potentially interesting) insight into the structure of the SecA-ribosome complex.

(Nat Struct Mol Biol. 15(5):494-9). This paper suggests that the SRP binds with high affinity to translating ribosomes containing a signal anchor that is still buried in the exit channel. The possibility of programmed ribosomes is a very intriguing, but there is very little evidence to support their existence. Because the ribosomal structure is thought to be relatively rigid, it is difficult to imagine how signals could transmitted from deep in the exit channel to the ribosomal surface. In addition, ribosome profiling experiments by the Bukau group (Nature. 536(7615):219-23) do not support the existence of the high-affinity SRP-ribosome complex proposed by Bornemann et al. in vivo. Finally, mechanistic models published in subsequent papers by the Wintermeyer group (e.g.Nucleic Acids Res. 45(20):11858-11866) appear to suggest that the SRP does not distinguish between ribosomes containing nascent signal anchor motifs buried in the exit channel and those that do not.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Figure 2D, there is no control to show that SecA is essential in the strain being used (e.g. control strain lacking exogenous SecA with and without IPTG).</p></disp-quote><p>The IPTG-dependent growth of these strains was noted in the Materials and methods section.

For example, investigating the rate of release would require kinetic measurements. As far as we understand, puromycin-induced release of arrested nascent polypeptides is very slow (and thereforelikely much slower than the binding kinetics of SecA for nascent chain). Fluorescence-based approaches may provide a more viable approach. However, these would take months or years to develop and optimise.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>The authors investigated the functions of SecA's C-terminal tail. Sedimentation and crosslinking assays with the purified motor protein and purified ribosomes or nascent chain ribosome complexes revealed that the metal binding domain binds to the ribosomal surface. The binding event causes the PPXD to shift to the open conformation, thereby destabilizing the flexible linker domain, which – according to small-scale angle scattering experiments – resides in the substrate protein binding groove. In turn, the autoinhibition is released and SecA is able to sample nascent polypeptides.</p><p>The manuscript offers new insight into the recognition process between SecA and secretory polypeptides. The approach appears to be sound. Yet both membrane and SecYEG are missing in the emerging picture. That is, SecA's substantial affinity to lipid membranes and SecYEG is not mentioned. How do the newly determined K<sub>D</sub> values compare to those previously published for the interaction of SecA with lipid membranes and with the translocon? Does such affinity comparison favor SecA interactions with the nascent chain (i) in the cytoplasm or (ii) at the membrane surface?</p></disp-quote><p>These are interesting questions, and we thank the reviewer for raising them. We have included additional discussion to address the interplay between these different forms of SecA.</p><p>[Editors' note: what now follows is the author responses to the editors’ decision letter after the first round of revisions.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Editorial assessment of the author reply to reviewers:</p><p>The role of a metal requirement for MBD function was not examined satisfactorily. The sole experiment to address this issue, Figure 1D, is poorly controlled and uninterpretable. First, the signals in lane 7 and lane 2 are essentially indistinguishable (lane 7 is fainter, but the band is spread over a larger area, so the overall difference is hard to appreciate). Without replicates and statistics, one cannot reasonably infer relevance from such a modest difference. Even if one were to take the difference at face value, the effect cannot be attributed to the MBD from the information provided; it could possibly be due to an effect of EDTA on some part of the ribosome. There are no controls to verify that metal was in fact removed from the CTT. The authors have other experimental approaches at their disposal. For example, the purified CTT could be stripped of metal (e.g., with high concentration EDTA), the stripped metal and EDTA removed by dialysis or desalting, the extent of removal verified, and the metal-free CTT (compared to protein in which the metal was added back) used in the assays. Alternatively (or in addition), one could use mutants in the metal binding domain. In short, the issue of a metal requirement was not addressed.</p></disp-quote><p>To address this issue, we have included new experimental results in Figure 1D in which we modified the metal-coordinating cysteines in SUMO-CTT with AMS. Ribosome co-sedimentation experiments indicate that AMS modification almost completely abolishes binding to the ribosome. These results indicate that the MBD must be correctly folded in order to bind to ribosomes. We have referenced these results in subsection “Binding of the CTT to the ribosome.”.</p><p>In addition, the original editor’s summary requested more detail about “which divalent metal(s) impact function of the C-terminal domain”. At the time of revision, we were in the process of preparing a manuscript to address this issue, which was not yet ready of submission. The results described in this manuscript strongly suggest that the physiological ligand of the MBD is iron. This manuscript is currently being revised for submission to the Journal of Biological Chemistry and is available as an author preprint through BioRxiv (doi: 10.1101/613315). We reference these new results and speculate on their significance in paragraph four of the Discussion section in the revised manuscript. In the resubmission, purified SecA, SUMO-CTT and SUMO-MBD are bound to zinc. The identity of the metal could affect the strength of the interaction with the ribosome. However, it clearly does not disrupt ribosome binding entirely. Furthermore, the Zn-bound form of SecA binds with high affinity to SecB and is functional in vitro. Finally, maintaining SecA in the iron-bound form is technically challenging for a large range of reasons (e.g. contaminating zinc in purification buffers, rapid oxidation of iron under standard experimental conditions, etc.).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The request to clarify the supposed UV-independent and highly efficient crosslinking from residue 852 was also not addressed adequately. This is a crucial experiment because it is the main direct evidence for the CTT engaging the catalytic core of SecA. The problem with UV-independence is that one cannot be certain the crosslink actually formed, with the alternative interpretation being a migration artefact with no crosslinks. The manuscript partially allays this concern, but the failure to detect a peptide is not especially strong evidence on its own. Based on what is shown, it could even be the case that BpA was not incorporated into 852 (amber suppression efficiency is known to be position-sensitive). While the authors could argue that the biotin blot shows amber suppression, this blot is very over-loaded and there is no negative control of a comparably overloaded SecA lacking the biotin tag. For these reasons, the conclusion that increased migration represents extremely efficient UV-independent intramolecular crosslinking through some unknown mechanism is not sufficiently compelling evidence to support a critical conclusion of the paper. If the authors' claim that this crosslink forms during the purification is correct, they can simply treat intact bacteria without or with UV, then harvest directly into SDS and monitor by blotting for the biotin tag. This should show a clear UV-dependent size shift to a position where the purified protein migrates. Other approaches are also feasible, including positioning BpA at nearby residues where the environment would be different, and hence, avoid constitutive UV-independent crosslinking. As it stands, a key conclusion of the study remains in doubt.</p></disp-quote><p>To address this issue, we present new evidence in Figure 4—figure supplement 1. In this figure, we purified SUMO-SecA-biotin and SUMO-SecA<sup>Bpa852</sup>-biotin via their C-termini directly from cell lysates using streptavidin-coated magnetic beads. The two most prominent bands in the C-terminally purified SUMO-SecA<sup>Bpa852</sup>-biotin migrated with molecular weights identical to full-length SecA-biotin and to the faster migrating species in Figure 4 (previously Figure 3), indicating that both species are full-length SUMO-SecA<sup>Bpa852</sup>-biotin. We have referenced these new results in subsection “Auto-crosslinking of the FLD in the substrate binding groove of SecA” of the revised text. Exposure of lysates to light did not significantly increase the amount of the lower (apparent) molecular weight species. However, this result is consistent with our model if (a) crosslinking is very efficient and (b) the different populations of SecA (autoinhibited and uninhibited) are stable. We also note that previous NMR studies (Gelis et al., 2007) and our SAXS results are consistent with the proposed site of crosslinking.</p><p>We have also included additional text to provide a clearer explanation for the high efficiency of auto-crosslinking of SUMO-SecA<sup>Bpa852</sup>-biotin (paragraph five in the Discussion section). To summarise: the efficiency of Bpa crosslinking is influenced by three factors: (i) the amount of time the benzophenone group of the Bpa is in contact with the target molecule, (ii) the chemical reactivity of Bpa toward the target molecule and (iii) the amount of time the benzophenone group stays in the activated state. First, the results of this study and others (Gelis et al., 2007) is consistent with the idea that the FLD is stably bound in the substrate protein-binding groove of SecA, which could result in a long-lived contact between position 852 and the binding pocket. Second, although benzophenone can, in theory, react with any C-H bond, in practice it reacts with different efficiencies toward different amino acid side chains (Lancia et al., 2014; Wittelsberger et al., 2006). Finally, environment (hydrophobicity, pH, etc.) influences the photo-reactive properties of many aromatic compounds. Indeed, the excitation and emission spectra of 4-hydroxy-benzophenone, which has the same photo-reactive group as Bpa, are strongly affected by hydrophobicity and pH (Barsotti et al., 2015; Barsotti et al., 2017). These environmental conditions are normally assumed to be negligible because Bpa is normally incorporated at surface-exposed positions because in order to capture protein-ligand interactions. However, because our results indicate that position 852 is buried in a hydrophobic groove, the environment surrounding the Bpa could affect the photo-reactive properties of the benzophenone in unexpected ways. Any (or all three) of these factors could have influenced the efficiency of auto-crosslinking in this experiment. We apologise for the unclear explanation for the high efficiency of crosslinking in our previous reply.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The request to provide the reader some estimate of the efficiency of binding in Figure 1D (first point of reviewer 2) was either ignored or misunderstood. The reviewer was asking simply to run 10% of the input sample on the same gel as the pulldowns so one could assess whether the amount pulled down was more or less than 10% of what went into the reaction. If it is far less, one could run 1% of the input (or whatever is roughly in the suitable range). The point is to provide the reader with a rough idea of how much is being pulled down in the experiment because this impacts how believable the findings are.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologise. We completely misunderstood what the reviewer was requesting. We have addressed this issue by including 10% loading controls in the new experimental results depicted in Figure 1D. These results suggests that &lt;20% of the ribosomes in the binding reaction are bound by SUMO-CTT in binding reactions containing 1 μM ribosome and 10 μM SUMO-CTT. Although this result suggests that the affinity of the MBD alone for the ribosome is relatively low, it is consistent with the decrease small decrease in the affinity of SecAΔCTT for the ribosome and it is consistent with the idea that the MBD normally binds to the ribosome in conjunction with the catalytic core. We have discussed have elaborated on these issues more extensively in paragraph two of the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Similarly, the request to verify that SecA lacking the CTT fails to compete for binding in Figure 1D was also not addressed (second point of reviewer 2). This is a rather standard control, and it most certainly would affect the conclusions were it to compete similarly to WT SecA.</p></disp-quote><p>As requested, we have repeated the binding competition experiment, but the results of this experiment were variable. The reason for the limited reproducibility is unclear. For example, it is possible that there is some experiment-to-experiment variability in the oxidation state of the metal-coordinating cysteines or in the bound metal cofactor in the MBDs of in SUMO-CTT and full-length SecA. However, the results presented in Figure 1 (and supplements) indicate that: (i) the MBD is well conserved (if not universally); (ii) the pattern of conservation suggests a binding partner besides SecB; (iii) the MBD binds to the ribosome; and (iv) the MBD binds to a site near uL23. Because it is possible to make these conclusions without the binding competition experiments, we have removed these results from the resubmitted manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The reasonable request to test SecA levels in the different mutant strains relative to endogenous levels of SecA was addressed in a rather convoluted manner and did not adequately address the concern. IPTG-induced toxicity is not a good surrogate for expression levels because the basis of this toxicity could be different for different mutants (i.e., for some, it may have to do with SecA function, for others, it might have to do with protein aggregation or inappropriate interactions). It should be a straightforward matter to directly test expression levels by blotting using widely available SecA antibodies. Similarly, the request to directly test protein translocation is both reasonable and straightforward. The concern is not that SecA has some other function, but rather that ∆MBD is having its effect via a dominant toxicity unrelated to its function (which is certainly plausible).</p></disp-quote><p>To address this issue, we present new results in Figure 2—figure supplement 3, which indicate that SecA is produced at similar levels in the three strains depicted in Figure 2D.

While it is true that ∆MBD migrates faster than wild type, the key concern was that the shift upon crosslinking was far smaller for ∆MBD than for full length, suggesting the possibility that the crosslinking partners are different. In this region of the gel, this difference in size shift is pretty substantial. It is therefore not acceptable to simply assume both crosslinks are to uL29.</p></disp-quote><p>To address this concern, we analysed the crosslinking adduct produced by SecA∆MBD<sup>Bpa399</sup> using LC-MS/MS.

They nicely show that a programmed short nascent chain does not block the crosslink to uL29 strengthening the authors model. They also show the 10% input for the binding assay in Figure 1, this reveals that the level of binding is relatively low, probably 1-2% of the input protein, i.e. binding to around 10-20% of ribosomes. They have also now attempted the suggested competition assay control (for original Figure 1D) but obtained inconclusive results with the ∆CTT construct. I would agree this compromises the interpretation of the competition experiment, hence its removal is sensible. It is puzzling why the assay was so variable considering that the WT and ∆CTT constructs apparently behaved well for the structural analysis.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the lack of reproducibility is puzzling given how reproducible the experiment was in the past.
