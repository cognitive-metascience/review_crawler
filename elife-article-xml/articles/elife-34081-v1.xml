lysine 4 (H3K4) to form H3K4me1, H3K4me2 and H3K4me3. Here, we determine the importance of COMPASS in maintaining gene expression across lifespan in budding yeast. We find that COMPASS mutations reduce replicative lifespan and cause expression defects in almost 500 genes. Although H3K4 methylation is reported to act primarily in gene repression, particularly in yeast, repressive functions are progressively lost with age while hundreds of genes become dependent on H3K4me3 for full expression. Basal and inducible expression of these genes is also impaired in young cells lacking COMPASS components Swd1 or Spp1. Gene induction during ageing is associated with increasing promoter H3K4me3, but H3K4me3 also accumulates in non-promoter regions and the ribosomal DNA. Our results provide clear evidence that H3K4me3 is required to maintain normal expression of many genes across organismal lifespan.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>histone</kwd><kwd>methylation</kwd><kwd>ageing</kwd><kwd>COMPASS</kwd><kwd>gene expression</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>088335,110216</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Della Rosa</surname><given-names>Monica</given-names></name><name><surname>King</surname><given-names>Michelle</given-names></name><name><surname>Houseley</surname><given-names>Jonathan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BBS/E/B/000C0423</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cruz</surname><given-names>Cristina</given-names></name><name><surname>Krueger</surname><given-names>Christel</given-names></name><name><surname>Horkai</surname><given-names>Dorottya</given-names></name><name><surname>Field</surname><given-names>Lucy</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010663</institution-id><institution>H2020 European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EpiGeneSys Network</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gao</surname><given-names>Qian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BI Core Capability Grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Houseley</surname><given-names>Jonathan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A widely studied chromatin modification associated with gene promoters is important for proper gene expression across organismal lifetime.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>H3K4me3 is ubiquitously observed on nucleosomes at the 5’ end of eukaryotic genes undergoing active transcription by RNA polymerase II (see for example [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barski et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bernstein et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Liu et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Zhang et al., 2009</xref>]).

Activation of Rad6/Bre1 and COMPASS recruitment also require interactions with the Ser-5 phosphorylated CTD of RNA polymerase II, providing a tight transcriptional connection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Krogan et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ng et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Xiao et al., 2005</xref>). COMPASS recruitment then occurs through interactions of Swd2 with active H2B-associated Rad6/Bre1, and of Set1/Spp1 with nascent mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Battaglia et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Luciano et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sayou et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Thornton et al., 2014</xref>). In mammals, additional CxxC domains in Cfp1 (the orthologue of yeast Spp1) and some SET-domain proteins further specify and diversify COMPASS activity, allowing DNA methylation-dependent activity and selective recruitment of COMPASS to promoter and enhancer sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brown et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Clouaire et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Thomson et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>The importance of H3K4me3 in transcription has been difficult to study as loss of Set1 also abrogates H3K4me1 and H3K4me2. Even so, loss of Set1 does not drastically impair transcription in yeast, and the extent to which subsets of genes are mis-regulated in <italic>set1</italic>Δ cells has been controversial with later studies reporting mostly gene upregulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Guillemette et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Margaritis et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Miller et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Santos-Rosa et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Venkatasubrahmanyam et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Weiner et al., 2012</xref>). This suggests a primarily repressive role for H3K4 methylation, particularly evident for ribosome synthesis factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Weiner et al., 2012</xref>), non-coding RNA-regulated genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Berretta et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Camblong et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Pinskaya et al., 2009</xref>) and heterochromatic regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Briggs et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Li et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Nislow et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Venkatasubrahmanyam et al., 2007</xref>). To determine the importance of H3K4me3 specifically, studies in yeast have focused on cells lacking Spp1 which is required for most (but not all) H3K4me3, and have observed virtually no impact on steady state gene expression or on acute gene induction during media shifts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Howe et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Margaritis et al., 2012</xref>). In contrast, loss of CFP1 in mammalian cells has concrete effects on gene expression, causing both up- and down-regulation of many genes in mouse ES cells and reduced transcription in oocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brown et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Yu et al., 2017</xref>). Interpretation of these observations is complicated by the additional binding modes of CFP1 that target COMPASS to promoters and enhancers, so loss of H3K4me3 may not be the only effect of CFP1 depletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brown et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hu et al., 2017</xref>). One specific report ties H3K4me3 mechanistically to activation of p53-regulated genes in response to DNA damage through recruitment of TAF3 in HCT116 cells, however this may be cell-type specific as the same response was not impaired in mouse ES cells lacking CFP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Clouaire et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lauberth et al., 2013</xref>). Overall, H3K4 methylation has the potential to both repress and activate transcription, but a general role for H3K4me3 in transcriptional activation remains unproven.</p><p>An association between histone modifications and ageing is well recognised (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Maleszewska et al., 2016</xref>]). For example, defects in H3K4, H3K36 and H3K27 methylation all affect lifespan presumably through impacts on gene expression, though in most cases the downstream expression differences remain obscure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alvares et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Greer et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Li et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Maures et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">McColl et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Sen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Siebold et al., 2010</xref>). Remarkably, a gross genome-wide loss of histones has been reported to accompany ageing in yeast and cultured human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Feser et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ivanov et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">O'Sullivan et al., 2010</xref>), leading to an opening of chromatin structure particularly at repressed promoters and causing widespread induction of normally repressed genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hu et al., 2014</xref>). General opening of chromatin structure has therefore been proposed to underlie many age-linked gene expression differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hu et al., 2014</xref>), and it is easy to imagine how alterations in canonical transcription-associated histone modifications could exacerbate these phenotypes. However, the impacts of histone modification defects on particular genes as cells age remain largely unknown due to the difficulty of de-convolving these from the massive impact of the ageing process itself.</p><p>Here we analyse the importance of H3K4me3 in facilitating gene expression across the lifetime of budding yeast, and find that H3K4me3 is critical for the full expression of many genes that are induced with age. This contrasts with and is separable from the well-characterised repressive function of H3K4 methylation, which we show declines with age. We validate the importance of H3K4 trimethylation in the inducible expression of a subset of genes, demonstrating a direct role for H3K4me3 in maintaining normal expression of many genes across organismal lifespan.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A transcriptomic dataset for ageing wild type and COMPASS mutants</title><p>A published micromanipulation screen of 264 yeast mutants found that cells lacking COMPASS components Swd1 or Swd3 have replicative lifespans ~ 20% shorter than wild type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Smith et al., 2008</xref>). Replicative lifespan measures the number of times a mother cell can divide before losing viability, compared to chronological lifespan which measures the time for which cells remain viable irrespective of cell division. To determine the importance of COMPASS in controlling gene expression and chromatin structure across replicative lifespan we introduced selected COMPASS mutants into the Mother Enrichment Program (MEP) background; the MEP facilitates isolation of highly aged yeast in sufficient quantities for standard molecular techniques, and provides simple comparative methods to assess lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lindstrom and Gottschling, 2009</xref>). The lifespan methods, although less precise than microdissection or microfluidics, are performed in the same growth conditions as for other molecular techniques and therefore allow integration of lifespan and molecular data. As expected, MEP <italic>swd1</italic>Δ cells show a substantial and significant defect in replicative lifespan, being only ~50% viable at 24 hr and almost completely inviable after 48 hr in YPD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Importantly, this lifespan defect was recapitulated in catalytic dead <italic>set1<sup>H1017L</sup></italic> and H3K4me3-defective <italic>spp1</italic>Δ mutants, showing that the lifespan defect results specifically from loss of H3K4me3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><p>As COMPASS has non-histone substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Zhang et al., 2005</xref>), we were concerned that this viability difference may not be attributable to H3K4 methylation. Introducing histone point mutations into the MEP background proved challenging, but we were able to create MEP haploids of H3<sup>K4A</sup> and H3<sup>K4R</sup>. Selection against daughter cells is imperfect in haploid MEPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lindstrom and Gottschling, 2009</xref>), a problem that can be partially offset by measuring viability at 24 hr, and at this point we observed that viability of the mutants was substantially and significantly reduced compared to the wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). COMPASS mutants also have a reduced chronological lifespan due to stimulation of apoptosis by the H3K79 methyltransferase Dot1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Walter et al., 2014</xref>); however no suppression of the replicative lifespan defect was observed in <italic>swd1</italic>Δ <italic>dot1</italic>Δ double mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>) so the replicative and chronological lifespan defects cannot be attributed to the same mechanism. Overall, although <italic>spp1</italic>Δ mutants have a very weak phenotype during normal growth, this mutation dramatically impairs lifespan as do all tested mutants that impact H3K4 methylation, indicating that H3K4me3 has a prominent function in ageing cells.</p><p>To understand the gene expression differences between wild-type and COMPASS mutants, we obtained mRNAseq profiles from multiple replicates of wild-type, <italic>swd1</italic>Δ, <italic>set1<sup>H1017L</sup></italic> and <italic>spp1</italic>Δ cells in log phase and aged for 7.5, 24 or 48 hr in YPD, forming a dataset of 52 libraries (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Principle component (PC) analysis of this dataset shows that PC1, 49% of variance, corresponds to age with both wild type and COMPASS mutant samples of equivalent ages having similar PC1 values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), although the log and 7.5 hr samples are similar and do not segregate well. PC2, 6% of variance, broadly segregates wild type from COMPASS mutant libraries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, note that wild type samples in blue/green lie towards the top whilst COMPASS mutants in yellow/red are largely in the lower half). The small effect of COMPASS genotype is not unexpected given previous reports, but shows that the gene expression phenotype caused by COMPASS mutation is separable from the gene expression phenotype caused by ageing. This gives us confidence that gene expression differences at equivalent times do not simply represent faster or slower ageing, which may otherwise be suggested based on the truncated lifespan of the COMPASS mutants.</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34081.005</object-id><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>mRNAseq libraries analysed in this work.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top"><italic>Genotype</italic></th><th valign="top"><italic>Log phase</italic></th><th valign="top"><italic>7.5</italic> hr</th><th valign="top"><italic>24</italic> hr</th><th valign="top"><italic>48</italic> hr</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">wild type</td><td valign="top">5</td><td valign="top">5</td><td valign="top">5</td><td valign="top">5</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><italic>swd1</italic>Δ</td><td valign="top">4</td><td valign="top">3</td><td valign="top">3</td><td valign="top">4</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><italic>set1</italic><sup>H1017L</sup></td><td valign="top">2</td><td valign="top">3</td><td valign="top">2</td><td valign="top">2</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><italic>spp1</italic>Δ</td><td valign="top">2 (3 more <break/>added in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>)</td><td valign="top">3</td><td valign="top">2</td><td valign="top">2 (3 more <break/>added in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>)</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>Differential expression analysis of the wild-type dataset identified 2842 out of 6662 annotated open reading frames (ORFs) that differ significantly between log and 48 hr, with very similar results in the <italic>swd1</italic>Δ mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>).

Genes upregulated with age are generally expressed at low levels in young cells, while genes that are highly expressed in young cells tend to be down-regulated with age relative to average as previously observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hu et al., 2014</xref>); in absolute terms, it has been shown that all yeast genes are actually induced to a greater or lesser extent during ageing, and we therefore refer to all gene expression changes as relative to average (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hu et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Age-related gene induction has been directly attributed to loss of histones, and we observe a strong correlation between age-linked gene expression and previously described changes following histone H3 depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gossett and Lieb, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hu et al., 2014</xref>). We were interested to know if any particular category of genes is upregulated with age but not histone depletion, and so filtered for genes that are upregulated 2-fold more than average with age but increase less than 2-fold on H3 depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> purple). We also filtered out genes repressed by the galactose to glucose shift used for H3 depletion in the Gossett and Lieb dataset, as the effect of H3 depletion for these genes is not determined.

We therefore performed a differential expression analysis to identify H3K4 methylation-dependent genes at different ages across all genes instead of only those unaffected by histone depletion. Compared to gene expression changes that occur during ageing the differences between wild type and COMPASS mutants are not large (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), so we pooled samples in the initial analysis to increase statistical power.

In contrast genes that are under-expressed in COMPASS mutants at log phase are under-expressed to a similar or greater extent throughout ageing compared to age-matched controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). These log phase data are in accord with previous results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Margaritis et al., 2012</xref>), but it is clear that the importance of COMPASS for gene expression changes with increasing age; in general, the repressive function of COMPASS has less impact and a positive function in gene expression is unmasked.</p><p>Starting with the 48 hr time point, we segregated under- and over-expressed genes and performed GO analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> and Table S1).

Although these genes were identified using a pooled dataset from three COMPASS mutants, all the COMPASS mutations had a similar effect on expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Furthermore, an equivalent analysis comparing wild type to <italic>swd1</italic>Δ identified 240 under-expressed genes at 48 hr of which 60% overlapped with those identified in the pooled COMPASS mutant dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref> and Table S1), and GO analysis of these 240 genes also indicated effects on cell wall biosynthesis and nicotinamide metabolism. Notably, in comparisons of wild-type to pooled COMPASS mutants or <italic>swd1</italic>Δ, the majority of genes affected by loss of COMPASS failed to be properly upregulated with age; this behaviour has not been observed in other transitions – Margaritis <italic>et al.</italic> examined the massive transcriptional reprogramming that accompanies the transition from stationary phase to log phase growth and found 220 genes mis-regulated of which only 24 (10%) were under-expressed in COMPASS mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Margaritis et al., 2012</xref>), compared to 297 (61%) of significantly altered genes that we observe in aged cells.</p><p>Differential expression in the pooled dataset could be attributed to mono-, di- or trimethylation of H3K4. To discover effects stemming purely from trimethylation, we sequenced three additional <italic>spp1</italic>Δ samples at log phase and after 48 hr ageing, giving five replicates in total. We employed a more relaxed significance threshold (p&lt;0.05) for differential expression analysis to reflect the fact that <italic>spp1</italic>Δ is not a complete loss-of-function mutant as some residual H3K4me3 is still present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>) and is therefore expected to cause a weaker phenotype; this yielded 104 significantly under-expressed genes in aged <italic>spp1</italic>Δ cells compared to wild type along with 19 over-expressed genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Despite the relaxed significance threshold, the under-expression phenotype remained highly consistent across replicates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>). GO analysis of the under-expressed genes again revealed significant enrichments for <italic>cell wall biogenesis</italic> and <italic>de novo NAD+ biosynthesis</italic> just as in the combined COMPASS mutant set, showing that proper expression of these genes is dependent on H3K4me3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Surprisingly, we also detected almost 300 genes differentially expressed between wild-type and <italic>spp1</italic>Δ in log-phase cells although the bulk of these showed very small differences (&lt;1.5 fold), in contrast to the 48 hr samples for which most differentially expressed genes were under-expressed and to a larger extent (&gt;1.5 fold) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).</p><p>The H3K4 trimethylation activity of COMPASS depends on Spp1 in vivo but not in vitro raising the possibility that loss of Spp1 may have different effects in aged cells, either not suppressing H3K4 trimethylation or impairing H3K4 dimethylation.

Again, these observations closely paralleled the ageing RNAseq data at 48 hr, and combined with the results from <italic>spp1</italic>Δ cells show that different H3K4 methylation states have different effects on gene expression for the <italic>BNA</italic> genes. We propose a model for this behaviour in the Discussion.</p><p>COMPASS has at least one non-histone substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Zhang et al., 2005</xref>), so to ensure that the effects on NAD+ biosynthesis genes result from H3K4 methylation we performed further experiments in histone mutants H3K4A and H3K4R. As before we used nicotinamide to induce expression of the <italic>BNA</italic> genes in haploid cells growing at log phase in YPD, and observed that the H3K4 mutants largely phenocopied the COMPASS mutants; H3K4 mutant phenotypes for <italic>BNA4-7</italic> are very similar to <italic>swd1</italic>Δ, while the phenotype for <italic>BNA1</italic> lies in-between that of <italic>swd1</italic>Δ and <italic>spp1</italic>Δ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E,F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D–F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B</xref>). This is consistent with COMPASS acting through H3K4 methylation to alter the expression of the <italic>BNA</italic> genes.</p><p>Together, these data show that COMPASS mutation affects the expression of NAD+ biosynthesis genes directly via H3K4 methylation, rather than through indirect age-induced changes in metabolism. They further provide strong evidence for a critical role of H3K4me3 in maintaining the normal expression of yeast genes. Although the 2-fold under-expression observed here in <italic>spp1</italic>Δ mutants is not a huge effect, <italic>BNA</italic> gene mRNA levels are tightly auto-regulated in response to NAD+ levels so this is likely to limit the production of NAD+ for the lifetime of the organism.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Age-linked changes in H3K4me3 distribution</title><p>Ageing in yeast is accompanied by widespread gene expression changes and a shift in chromatin structure. To understand how these differences affect individual promoters requires the genome-wide distribution of H3K4me3 to be determined, however mapping histone modifications in ageing yeast cells has proved extremely challenging as standard yeast chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) protocols require 100-1000x more cells than are available from routine ageing cell purifications (explaining the very limited genome-wide ageing ChIP data available for yeast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Sen et al., 2015</xref>]). To facilitate the analysis of ageing chromatin, we optimised a low-cell number yeast ChIP protocol that yields ChIPseq libraries from the 10<sup>6</sup> cells available through our standard ageing cell preparation methods, including a spike-in of <italic>Drosophila</italic> chromatin prior to cell lysis that facilitates absolute quantification of signals. Using this protocol, we obtained ChIPseq datasets for H3 and H3K4me3 in log phase cells and cells aged for 24 and 48 hr in duplicate, along with matched input DNA. Input samples confirmed known age-linked genetic changes including amplification of ribosomal DNA (rDNA) and telomeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Sinclair and Guarente, 1997</xref>), amplification of Chr. XII distal to the rDNA and amplification of Ty elements (predicted given increase in Ty element RNAs)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hu et al., 2014</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>), and all of these regions were therefore excluded from the initial chromatin analysis (Table S2). However, detection of these differences confirmed that ChIP samples derived from highly aged cells rather than contaminating daughters. We also restricted analysis of H3K4me3 peaks to genes for which the region TSS to TSS+ 500 bp could be unambiguously assigned by excluding short sense and antisense ORFs that overlap promoter regions. Overall, these limits define a set of 4806 genes which reflect well the spectrum of expression observed across all genes but for which copy number abnormalities and promoter ambiguities were minimised (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>).</p><p>With age, the signal from promoter associated H3K4me3 peaks increased and the spread of H3K4me3 signals was compressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Particularly notable is the progressive loss of repressed promoters with no detectable H3K4me3 peak (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> grey arrows). These observations are consistent with H3K4me3 peaks at inactive or low activity promoters becoming more prominent as would be expected from the genome-wide induction of low-expressed genes, and indeed we observe a strong positive correlation between age-linked gene induction and change in promoter H3K4me3 signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). By 48 hr, the promoter H3K4me3 peak also became less defined, due to increasing H3K4me3 in gene bodies and intergenic regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). This behaviour is somewhat variable across genes: for the 300 least induced genes, which are highly expressed throughout life, we observe on average a reduction of the H3K4me3 peak between 24 and 48 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>), but in contrast the 300 most induced genes, which have very low log phase expression, show a dramatic age-linked increase in H3K4me3 in the region round the TSS as well as the appearance of a small H3K4me3 peak (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>). We suspected that the general increase in H3K4me3 in non-promoter regions would reflect a widespread activation of cryptic promoters and spurious transcriptional initiation, leading to extensive pervasive transcription. To assess this, we quantified antisense poly(A)+RNA for annotated genes and found that antisense transcripts increase substantially with age and to a similar extent for all genes, despite clear differences in age-linked expression change for the sense mRNA (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1E</xref>). This upregulation of antisense transcription independent of sense transcript expression is indicative of a genome-wide increase in pervasive transcription. Overall, age-linked changes in promoter-associated H3K4me3 are consistent with genome-wide gene induction, but the tight promoter association of H3K4me3 is compromised in old cells and H3K4me3 accumulates in non-promoter regions in accord with an observed increase in pervasive transcription.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34081.011</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Age-linked dynamics of H3K4me3.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Violin plot of read counts for region from transcriptional start site (TSS) to TSS+ 500 bp for all genes lying outside excluded regions defined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref> and with unambiguous promoter regions (4806 genes). Read counts were normalised using <italic>Drosophila</italic> chromatin spike-ins, data are an average of two biological replicates at each time point.

Non-rDNA regions gain H3K4me3 between log and 48 hr of age as noted above, while rDNA H3K4me3 shows a striking rise from very low levels at log phase to the same level as non-rDNA regions by 48 hr consistent with a complete loss of rDNA silencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Li et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Pal et al., 2018</xref>).

However, the massive increase in rDNA copy number results in unexpected changes in global distributions of both H3K4me3 and H3: the combination of loss of rDNA silencing with increased copy number leads to the total amount of H3K4me3 in the genome increasing 2-fold by 48 hr, with the proportion of H3K4me3 in rDNA rising from 2.5% to 40% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>).

Multiple H3K4me3-binding proteins are present in yeast, which in turn are members of histone modifying and repositioning complexes. Binding of Yng1, Yng2 or Sgf29 would recruit NuA3, NuA4 or SAGA histone acetyl transferase complexes respectively, promoting local histone acetylation that should enhance transcriptional activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agalioti et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bian et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Pokholok et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Steunou et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Taverna et al., 2006</xref>).

We observed 43% of yeast genes to be differentially expressed during ageing, of which 17% show significantly different expression levels in COMPASS mutants after 48 hr. This means that as cells age, loss of H3K4 methylation has a dramatic effect on maintenance of normal gene expression patterns. We observed a progressive loss of the repressive capacity of H3K4 methylation as cells age, however this is probably not the cause of the lifespan defect, as the repressive activity is not impacted by <italic>spp1</italic>Δ whereas lifespan is similar in <italic>swd1</italic>Δ and <italic>spp1</italic>Δ cells. Rather, the most prominent gene expression effect was a failure to fully induce hundreds of genes in COMPASS mutants including <italic>spp1</italic>Δ. We validated this role of COMPASS for expression of NAD+ biosynthesis genes, but these constitute only a handful of the significantly mis-expressed genes and are unlikely to explain the shortened lifespan of COMPASS mutants alone. In reality, given the widespread age-linked gene mis-regulation in COMPASS mutants, it is not surprising that the lifespan of these cells is profoundly reduced.</p><p>ChIP experiments show that H3K4me3 is progressively gained at euchromatic promoters in accord with genome-wide gene induction, despite a mild reduction in H3 density. Spike-in normalisation was critical for obtaining accurate measurements of H3K4me3 as normalisation to internal standards erroneously shows loss of H3K4me3 with age, emphasising the importance of normalisation controls in ageing studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen et al., 2015</xref>). The increase in H3K4me3 across euchromatic promoters is however dwarfed by the massive accumulation of H3K4me3 in rDNA, resulting in &gt;2 fold increase in H3K4me3 across the genome. As noted above, H3K4me3 is involved in recruitment of pro-expression factors, but repressors such as the Set3 and Rpd3 complexes are recruited to H3K4me2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kim and Buratowski, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Pinskaya et al., 2009</xref>). It is largely this age-linked loss of repressive activity that allowed us to detect pro-expression activities of H3K4me3, and it is tempting to speculate that accumulation of H3K4me2 in amplified rDNA (which is strongly predicted based on our data) would titrate repressive factors. Similarly, although the density of H3 in euchromatin decreases in aged samples in our experiments as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hu et al., 2014</xref>), we find that this is more than offset by the increase in H3 associated with rDNA. It is not hard to imagine that cells struggle to maintain histone supply in the face of the almost doubling of genome size caused by profligate rDNA amplification; although different groups have reported either decreased or unchanging histone supply with age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Feser et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Janssens et al., 2015</xref>), there is no indication that supply increases to match demand caused by rDNA amplification. Although ERC formation has been widely suggested to drive ageing in yeast, there is little mechanistic data regarding the potential pathological activity of ERCs. It seems very likely to us that one result of rDNA amplification through ERC accumulation is to titrate histones and histone binding factors, and this will provide an important focus for future studies into age-linked gene expression change.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Strains and media</title><p>Yeast strains were constructed by standard methods and are listed in Table S3, oligonucleotide sequences are given in Table S4 and plasmids given in Table S5.

After adapter and quality trimming using Trim Galore (v0.4.2), RNAseq data were mapped to yeast genome R64-2-1 using HISAT v2.0.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kim et al., 2015</xref>) by the Babraham Institute Bioinformatics Facility. Mapped data were imported into SeqMonk v1.39.0 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/seqmonk/">https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/seqmonk/</ext-link>) and normalised based on the total number of reads mapping to the antisense strand of annotated open reading frames (opposite strand specific libraries), excluding the rDNA locus and the mtDNA. Exclusion of rDNA mapping reads from the normalisation is particularly important as in ageing cells a substantial fraction of reads derive from polyadenylated rDNA ncRNAs and can skew the distribution. DESeq2 analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Love et al., 2014</xref>) was performed within SeqMonk, comparing either five replicates of different time points in the wild-type dataset or comparing the five replicates of wild-type to pooled data from <italic>swd1</italic>Δ, <italic>set1</italic> and <italic>spp1</italic>Δ mutants at a given time point, using a p-value cut-off of 0.01 for analyses except comparisons of wild-type versus <italic>spp1</italic>Δ where a cut-off of 0.05 was applied. Hierarchical clustering analysis was performed using SeqMonk, and GO analysis of individual clusters performed using GOrilla (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://cbl-gorilla.cs.technion.ac.il/">http://cbl-gorilla.cs.technion.ac.il/</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Eden et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Eden et al., 2009</xref>).

Reads that mapped to the <italic>Drosophila</italic> genome were then remapped against the yeast genome and all cross-mapping reads discarded. Similarly cross-mapping reads from yeast to <italic>Drosophila</italic> were also discarded. For normalisation, in each dataset counts were performed of the total number of reads mapping to non-rDNA and non-mitochondrial regions of the yeast genome (Y) and the total number of uniquely mapping reads to the <italic>Drosophila</italic> genome (D). Normalisation factors were calculated using the formula (1/D<sub>ChIP</sub>) x (D<sub>input</sub>/Y<sub>input</sub>) and applied to yeast ChIP read counts.

The research described in the manuscript is worthy of praise because an extraordinary amount of work was done to obtain sufficient quantities of aged mother cells for RNAseq and ChIPseq analyses. Aging cells were obtained using the Mother Enrichment Program (MEP) system developed in the Gottschling lab. The authors verified that COMPASS mutants have significantly reduced replicative lifespans in the MEP background, results that were expected based on previous work. Analysis of RNAseq data from aging wild-type and COMPASS mutant cells by differential expression and GO analyses confirmed previous work that expression of more than one-third of annotated ORFs differ significantly between log phase cultures and aged mother cell cultures. In addition, the expression of similar categories of genes was found to be affected by aging in these and previous studies.</p><p>The authors performed differential expression analysis comparing RNAseq data from COMPASS mutants to wild-type cell data obtained at different ages in order to identify H3K4-methylation dependent genes. The results show that in log-phase cultures, a number of genes are over-expressed in COMPASS mutants when compared to wild-type cells, but this effect disappears as cells age. With age, more genes become under-expressed in COMPASS mutants. The results reveal a positive role for COMPASS in gene regulation during aging. By analyzing data from wild-type cells and COMPASS mutants during aging and comparing their data to published datasets, the authors identified nearly 300 genes whose expression is lower due to the loss of H3K4me3 during aging. The results show that COMPASS and H3K4me are required for normal levels of gene expression during aging, even though loss of COMPASS and H3K4me have relatively small effects on gene expression in log-phase cultures. Genes that are under-expressed in COMPASS mutants are required for cell wall organization and <italic>de novo NAD+ biosynthesis</italic>. The authors investigated the expression of several genes required for <italic>de novo NAD+ biosynthesis</italic> to verify a role for H3K4me in regulation of these genes.</p><p>The authors performed ChIPseq on aged cells to evaluate age-related changes in the distribution of H3K4me3 over annotated gene promoters. The ChIPseq results revealed that the peak of H3K4me3 usually associated with Pol II promoters decreases with age. Interestingly, even genes that are highly expressed in aged cells lack high levels of H3K4me3, a result that contributes to the authors' conclusion that H3K4me3 is a poor predictor of gene expression in aged cells.</p><p>All of the experiments are performed to acceptable high standards. The manuscript is well written. The discussion provides reasonable arguments that tie the new results in with previous work. The authors also discuss directions for future research.</p><p>The results of this study are likely to be of interest to scientists who study chromatin function, the regulation of gene expression, and aging.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript, the authors investigate the importance of H3K4me3 in regulating yeast replicative lifespan and gene expression. Replicative aging experiments were conducted on COMPASS mutants using the Mother Enrichment Program developed in the Gottschling lab. The authors show that lifespan is reduced by deletion of SWD1, which is important for all stages of H3K4 methylation, or SPP1, which has been shown to be selectively important for H3K4me3 in log phase cells. RNA-seq experiments were performed on wild type and mutant cells over a time course of aging, and the authors used these data to identify sets of genes that are either under- or over-expressed in the COMPASS mutants. The results indicate that Swd1, Spp1 and Set1 are important for normal levels of gene expression in aging cells. The primary role of Spp1, and presumably H3K4me3, appears to be as a positive regulator of genes induced upon aging. ChIP-seq experiments were performed to measure occupancy of H3K4me3 and H3 during aging. The authors conclude that H3K4me3 levels decline during aging even at genes that are upregulated. They thus argue that the expected positive correlation between H3K4me3 and gene expression is reduced during aging. While the authors have done a thorough job of analyzing gene expression during yeast replicative aging, the findings themselves, namely that mutations in the COMPASS complex affect the expression of a subset of genes, are not especially surprising. In addition, there are concerns about the way the studies were performed or interpreted that minimize the overall impact.</p><p>1) The authors have addressed the importance of H3K4me2 and H3K4me3 in replicative lifespan by measuring viability and gene expression changes in various COMPASS mutants. As they point out in their analysis of BNA gene expression levels, Set1 has been shown to target other substrates. Therefore, the changes in lifespan and gene expression as cells age may not be due to a loss of H3K4 methylation. This concern needs to be addressed. Lifespan of H3K4A or H3K4R mutants should be measured. Gene expression changes that are attributed to COMPASS during aging should be measured using the MEP method in the H3K4 mutants.</p><p>2) Many conclusions relate to the specific role of H3K4me3. As others have shown, in log phase cells, <italic>spp1∆</italic> leads to selective loss of H3K4me3 and retention of H3K4me2 and me1. The authors are measuring transcript levels in <italic>spp1∆</italic> mutants over a time course of replicative aging and are equating the effects to loss of H3K4me3 specifically. Because it's possible that the role or regulation of Spp1 changes as cells age, the authors need to confirm that H3K4me3 is lost in the <italic>spp1∆</italic> mutant in aging cells and that the other methyl states are retained.</p><p>3) The authors conclude that mutations in COMPASS cause &quot;widespread gene expression defects&quot;. When they separate out the effects of histone depletion that accompany aging, they identify 204 genes that are upregulated after wild type cells are aged for 48 hours in the MEP. Of these, 13% are said to be under-expressed in a strain that should lack all H3K4 methylation (<italic>swd1∆</italic>). This equates to 26-27 genes and doesn't seem widespread. An explanation is needed. Also do the <italic>spp1∆</italic> and set1<sup>H1017L</sup> mutants also affect this subset of genes?</p><p>4) The pooling together of data sets for various COMPASS mutants to improve statistical power is unconventional and reduces the information content. Why is this necessary? The authors show differential expression data for all the individual COMPASS mutants in Figure 2B,C,D, and Figure 2—Figure supplement 1. Are these data lacking in statistical significance?</p><p>5) Throughout the figures, the number of genes reported as significantly altered varies depending on the mutant, the time point, and whether genes are classified as over- or under-expressed. These numbers are given in parentheses, although I could not find a definition of this notation in the legends. The authors should better clarify their results, possibly with a table. How do the authors arrive at the number of ~4.5% of genes being impacted by COMPASS during replicative aging? Also, while this is not an insignificant number of genes, I'm not sure &quot;widespread&quot; accurately reflects the number of genes affected.</p><p>6) The five <italic>spp1∆</italic> replicates appear to have quite different levels of transcripts for the 19 overexpressed genes, raising concerns about those conclusions.</p><p>7) Figure 3 – In this figure, the authors follow up on the RNA-seq data, which indicate under-expression of BNA genes during aging in COMPASS mutants. Northern blots were done on log phase cells, not aging cells, to analyze the induction of the BNA genes in response to nicotinamide. There are several concerns with this figure. First, it's not clear how the analysis relates to BNA expression during aging. Second, the northern blots should be shown. Third, the authors conclude that induction of BNA1, BNA2, BNA4, BNA5 and BNA6 is impaired in <italic>spp1∆</italic> cells. From the way the data are presented, it appears that both the basal and induced levels of expression are lower in the spp1 mutant, but it's not clear that the fold induction is greatly impaired. Fold induction values should be given. Finally, because they lack all K4 methylation, the H3K4A and H3K4R mutants would be expected to phenocopy the <italic>swd1∆</italic> mutant for induction of the BNA genes. It is difficult to know from the presented graphs whether this is the case. It's also not clear why these mutants would phenocopy <italic>spp1∆</italic> and not <italic>swd1∆</italic>, as the authors suggest for certain BNA genes. An explanation is needed.</p><p>8) As the Tyler lab originally showed for aging cells, the method for normalizing ChIP-seq or MNase-seq data can have profound effects on interpretations when global changes in histone occupancy occur. It doesn't appear that the authors used a spike-in control to normalize their histone occupancy data or that the H3K4me3 ChIP-seq data are normalized relative to total H3. The lack of normalization to spike-ins and total histone levels confounds interpretations. Using the MEP strategy, Hu et al., (2014) reported a 50% decrease in nucleosome occupancy as cells age. The aging effect on H3 ChIP signals shown in Figure 4 and associated supplement appears much smaller than 50%. The discrepancy with the spike-in normalized data from the Tyler lab raises concerns about whether the data of Cruz et al., are properly normalized. This is a major concern as the authors’ main conclusions rest on these results.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34081.028</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor and feel that the following points need to be addressed prior considering the revised manuscript.</p><p>1) The reviewers requested for you and co-authors to normalize the ChIP-seq data.</p></disp-quote><p>We have set up a normalised low-cell number ChIP method using a spike-in of <italic>Drosophila</italic> chromatin introduced at cell lysis to allow corrections for loss of material during sample processing and differences in ChIP efficiency. We think that this provides a much more accurate measure of ChIP signals from young and aged cells. This was well worth the effort as the normalised ChIP data reveal that H3K4me3 is not lost with age but rather accumulates and is re-distributed within the genome, an observation that fits much better with the main message of the paper regarding the importance of H3K4me3 in gene expression. The new ChIP data is otherwise very similar to our previous data, with H3K4me3 showing reduced dynamic range in aged cells and reduced definition of the promoter peak due increased signal in non-promoter regions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Furthermore, it is requested that you and co-authors conduct RLS assays on H3K4 mutants.</p></disp-quote><p>We have performed this experiment, now Figure 1—figure supplement 1C. Results are in accord with the previous mutant analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Also, Western analysis on H3K4me states in the spp1 mutant during aging is also suggested by the reviewers as an essential data for revision.</p></disp-quote><p>We have performed this experiment, now Figure 2—figure supplement 1E. We show that the effect of <italic>spp1</italic>Δ on H3K4me3 and H3K4me2 is the same in young and aged cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[…] 1) The authors have addressed the importance of H3K4me2 and H3K4me3 in replicative lifespan by measuring viability and gene expression changes in various COMPASS mutants. As they point out in their analysis of BNA gene expression levels, Set1 has been shown to target other substrates. Therefore, the changes in lifespan and gene expression as cells age may not be due to a loss of H3K4 methylation. This concern needs to be addressed. Lifespan of H3K4A or H3K4R mutants should be measured. Gene expression changes that are attributed to COMPASS during aging should be measured using the MEP method in the H3K4 mutants.</p></disp-quote><p>We have had considerable difficulty in introducing histone point mutations into the MEP background both by sporulation and by delitto perfetto for reasons that remain unclear, as we have had no problem using either method to introduce other mutations in the same background. Nonetheless, we were able to obtain a set of haploid H3K4 mutants in the MEP background, and these show similar lifespan defects to the COMPASS mutants (Figure 1—figure supplement 1C), although we have to perform the assay at an earlier time point since the MEP is not as tight in haploids as diploids, as noted in the original description of the system (Lindstrom and Gottschling, 2009). Because of these issues, we were not able to perform gene expression studies in these mutants, but we note that in the validation of BNA gene expression, the histone point mutant phenotypes were coherent with the effects of COMPASS being exerted through H3K4 methylation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Many conclusions relate to the specific role of H3K4me3. As others have shown, in log phase cells, spp1∆ leads to selective loss of H3K4me3 and retention of H3K4me2 and me1. The authors are measuring transcript levels in spp1∆ mutants over a time course of replicative aging and are equating the effects to loss of H3K4me3 specifically. Because it's possible that the role or regulation of Spp1 changes as cells age, the authors need to confirm that H3K4me3 is lost in the spp1∆ mutant in aging cells and that the other methyl states are retained.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a good point. We have added a Western blot for H3K4me2 and H3K4me3 in log phase and 24 hour aged cells in Figure 2—figure supplement 2E. This clearly shows that H3K4me3 is absent in <italic>spp1</italic>Δ cells irrespective of age, while H3K4me2 is unaffected by loss of Spp1 at either age. Both antibodies we have tried against H3K4me1 give a very low signal and did not reveal detectable bands from the small amount of protein available from an ageing purification. However, given that H3K4me2 is unaffected we consider it highly unlikely that H3K4me1 is altered.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors conclude that mutations in COMPASS cause &quot;widespread gene expression defects&quot;. When they separate out the effects of histone depletion that accompany aging, they identify 204 genes that are upregulated after wild type cells are aged for 48 hours in the MEP. Of these, 13% are said to be under-expressed in a strain that should lack all H3K4 methylation (swd1∆). This equates to 26-27 genes and doesn't seem widespread. An explanation is needed. Also do the spp1∆ and set1<sup>H1017L</sup> mutants also affect this subset of genes?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer has misunderstood our point here. From the initial tightly restricted dataset of 204 genes, we found that 13% were under-expressed in aged but not log phase cells. This observation leads us to expand this analysis to the whole genome, finding almost 500 genes to be misregulated in aged COMPASS mutants, and it is this value we describe as ‘widespread’. We have reworded for clarity. Yes, the 26 genes are also under-expressed in the spp1 and set1<sup>H1017L</sup> mutants, we have noted this in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The pooling together of data sets for various COMPASS mutants to improve statistical power is unconventional and reduces the information content. Why is this necessary? The authors show differential expression data for all the individual COMPASS mutants in Figure 2B, C, D, and Figure 2—figure supplement 1. Are these data lacking in statistical significance?</p></disp-quote><p>The reason for pooling the data was that producing 4-5 replicates for each time point for each mutant would have taken a prohibitive amount of time; each ageing cell purification represents a substantial investment (reviewer 1 notes that the dataset we have already obtained of aged samples for RNAseq and ChIPseq is “an extraordinary amount of work”). Although comparing wild-type to <italic>swd1</italic>∆ alone also provides quite a large number of significantly differentially expressed genes, the GO categories enriched proved to be less informative than those obtained through the pooled strategy. However, we take the reviewers point that this is non-standard, and we have therefore provided data comparing the wild-type to <italic>swd1</italic>∆ alone in Figure 2—figure supplement 1C. Because the pooled dataset was not informative about effects of H3K4me3, we had already included additional data for <italic>spp1</italic>∆ at log and 48 hours to allow significant differentially expressed genes to be detected for wild-type versus <italic>spp1</italic>∆ at these time-points (see Supplementary file 1).</p><p>Of the figures questioned, in Figures 2B and Figure 2—figure supplement 1A/B the genes shown are significantly different when comparing the wild-type replicate set to the pooled replicates of the <italic>swd1</italic>∆/<italic>spp1</italic>∆/<italic>set1</italic><sup>H1017L</sup>. These differences are not necessarily significant comparing the wild-type to any individual mutant. In Figures 2C and 2D, the genes shown are significantly different between wild-type and <italic>spp1</italic>∆ at the indicated time points.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Throughout the figures, the number of genes reported as significantly altered varies depending on the mutant, the time point, and whether genes are classified as over- or under-expressed. These numbers are given in parentheses, although I could not find a definition of this notation in the legends. The authors should better clarify their results, possibly with a table. How do the authors arrive at the number of ~4.5% of genes being impacted by COMPASS during replicative aging? Also, while this is not an insignificant number of genes, I'm not sure &quot;widespread&quot; accurately reflects the number of genes affected.</p></disp-quote><p>The numbers given in parenthesis are simply the actual number of genes found to be differentially expressed based on a DESeq2 analysis – we have re-worded the figure legends to be clearer about precisely what is shown. We have also included a table summarising the DESeq2 data (Table S1) as the reviewer suggests. The figure of 4.5% is calculated from 297 genes being significantly under-expressed in the pooled COMPASS mutant dataset compared to the wild-type at 48 hours, relative to the 6604 ORFs annotated in the yeast genome database (297/6604*100=4.497%).</p><p>We agree that we have used the word “widespread” to represent both the upregulation of gene expression with age (which affects almost all genes) and the 4.5% of genes we detect as H3K4 dependent, and this is inconsistent. We have therefore changed the wording in the abstract (the only place we can find where this word was used in this context) to give the number of genes affected and remove the word “widespread”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The five spp1∆ replicates appear to have quite different levels of transcripts for the 19 overexpressed genes, raising concerns about those conclusions.</p></disp-quote><p>We did not intend to suggest that the 19 overexpressed genes were consistent and agree with the reviewer that they are not. Rather, we restricted our conclusions to the under-expressed set which is highly reproducible across replicates. We have changed the wording slightly for clarity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Figure 3 – In this figure, the authors follow up on the RNA-seq data, which indicate under-expression of BNA genes during aging in COMPASS mutants. Northern blots were done on log phase cells, not aging cells, to analyze the induction of the BNA genes in response to nicotinamide. There are several concerns with this figure. First, it's not clear how the analysis relates to BNA expression during aging. Second, the northern blots should be shown. Third, the authors conclude that induction of BNA1, BNA2, BNA4, BNA5 and BNA6 is impaired in spp1∆ cells. From the way the data are presented, it appears that both the basal and induced levels of expression are lower in the spp1 mutant, but it's not clear that the fold induction is greatly impaired. Fold induction values should be given. Finally, because they lack all K4 methylation, the H3K4A and H3K4R mutants would be expected to phenocopy the swd1∆ mutant for induction of the BNA genes. It is difficult to know from the presented graphs whether this is the case. It's also not clear why these mutants would phenocopy spp1∆ and not swd1∆, as the authors suggest for certain BNA genes. An explanation is needed.</p></disp-quote><p>First: We are slightly surprised by this concern as in Figure 3 and Figure 3—figure supplement 1 we provide side-by-side comparisons of the induction of the <italic>BNA</italic> genes in log phase and during ageing. Generally, we think it is major strength of our analysis that we could recapitulate the effects observed during ageing in log phase cells, as this removes concerns about indirect effects stemming from age-related physiological differences.</p><p>Second: We have included example northern blots as Figure 3—figure supplement 2.</p><p>Third: We were not claiming that induction is affected per se, rather that gene expression is affected in general, which affects both the basal and induced level, but is most easily seen as an apparent reduction in the induced level and have changed wording in a few places where this was less than clear. Of course, in many cases where we see a reduction in the induced level it is most likely a combination of effects on the basal level and the induction, but in one case (<italic>BNA4</italic>) induction is substantially reduced without the basal level being altered. We have now included a table of fold changes so readers can judge this for themselves in Figure 3—figure supplement 2C.</p><p>Finally: As noted in the response to reviewer 1 point 9, we agree that actually the effects of the histone mutants are equivalent to the effect of <italic>swd1</italic> in all cases except for <italic>BNA1</italic> and even here the histone mutant expression lies in between the effects seen in <italic>swd1</italic> and <italic>spp1</italic> mutants, and therefore still largely reflects the complete loss of H3K4 methylation. We have changed the text appropriately, and this certainly makes the conclusions more logical.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) As the Tyler lab originally showed for aging cells, the method for normalizing ChIP-seq or MNase-seq data can have profound effects on interpretations when global changes in histone occupancy occur. It doesn't appear that the authors used a spike-in control to normalize their histone occupancy data or that the H3K4me3 ChIP-seq data are normalized relative to total H3. The lack of normalization to spike-ins and total histone levels confounds interpretations. Using the MEP strategy, Hu et al., (2014) reported a 50% decrease in nucleosome occupancy as cells age. The aging effect on H3 ChIP signals shown in Figure 4 and associated supplement appears much smaller than 50%. The discrepancy with the spike-in normalized data from the Tyler lab raises concerns about whether the data of Cruz et al., are properly normalized. This is a major concern as the authors’ main conclusions rest on these results.</p></disp-quote><p>We are grateful to the reviewer for compelling us to perform these experiments as the results are extremely informative. We have now optimised a low cell-number ChIP method for yeast including a <italic>Drosophila</italic> chromatin spike-in added at the point of cell lysis. This allows us to correct for loss of material during processing (considerable and variable in low cell number applications in our experience) and also for differences in ChIP efficiency.</p><p>The spike-in normalised H3K4me3 data reveals that although definition and dynamic range of promoter-associated H3K4me3 peaks are lost with age as we originally concluded, this is not due to a global loss of the mark but rather to a genome-wide gain, with additional H3K4me3 being deposited at promoters of low expressed genes but also accumulating in other regions of the genome. This observation makes much more sense in the context of the genome-wide gene induction associated with ageing. Therefore, our data still shows global changes and altered distribution of H3K4me3 with age but fits much better with the main focus of this paper, which is the importance of H3K4me3 in facilitating gene expression.</p><p>We are aware that this result is at odds with our original Western blotting data, which showed a reduction in H3K4me3 with age, and we have considered carefully the root of this discrepancy. We normalised the Western blot to total protein levels as other have previously described, however this assumes that the per-cell total protein content does not change with age and we are not sure this assumption is correct. Ribosomal protein constitutes 10-25% of total protein (Warner, 1971, Warner 1999), and is a particularly large part of the well-defined low molecular weight protein bands that are most easily used in total protein normalisation for histones. However, studies using both shotgun mass spectrometry of total protein and microfluidic analysis of a GFP-labelled ribosomal protein have concluded that ribosomal protein levels rise substantially with age (Janssens 2015, Janssens 2016). We also find by northern blotting that the total amount of rRNA rises 3-fold across 48 hours relative to <italic>ACT1</italic> or <italic>PGK1</italic> mRNA (which are stable across age in both our analysis and that of Hu et al.,); since rRNA is neither synthesised nor stable in the absence of stoichiometric ribosomal proteins, this implies a substantial increase in ribosomal protein per cell with age (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>). This changing normalisation control would result in an apparent loss of H3K4me3 with age.</p><fig id="respfig1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34081.020</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Ratio of rRNA to ACT1 mRNA levels in wild-type cells across age.</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-34081-resp-fig1-v1"/></fig><p>The reviewer’s general concern about H3 levels is not resolved by our new normalisation. Our data does show that histones redistribute to rDNA regions in aged cells rather than being lost entirely from the genome, and we note that an equivalent redistribution is detectable in the MNase-seq data of Hu et al. The dynamics of histone occupancy with age are therefore much more complex than a simple genome-wide reduction in occupancy. We further note that H3 ChIPseq and MNase-seq are not perfectly comparable and these studies utilised very different growth conditions (carbon source was raffinose/galactose in Hu et al. as opposed to glucose in our study). A detailed dissection of histone loss and re-distribution during ageing is outside the scope of this work, which is focused on H3K4 methylation, but this is certainly an important issue that we will attempt to resolve in future studies.</p></body></sub-article></article>
