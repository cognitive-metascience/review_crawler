of the hypoxia-sensitive cells that trigger amniote respiratory reflexes – carotid body glomus cells, and ‘pulmonary neuroendocrine cells’ (PNECs) - are obscure. Homology has been proposed between glomus cells, which are neural crest-derived, and the hypoxia-sensitive ‘neuroepithelial cells’ (NECs) of fish gills, whose embryonic origin is unknown. NECs have also been likened to PNECs, which differentiate in situ within lung airway epithelia. Using genetic lineage-tracing and neural crest-deficient mutants in zebrafish, and physical fate-mapping in frog and lamprey, we find that NECs are not neural crest-derived, but endoderm-derived, like PNECs, whose endodermal origin we confirm. We discover neural crest-derived catecholaminergic cells associated with zebrafish pharyngeal arch blood vessels, and propose a new model for amniote hypoxia-sensitive cell evolution: endoderm-derived NECs were retained as PNECs, while the carotid body evolved via the aggregation of neural crest-derived catecholaminergic (chromaffin) cells already associated with blood vessels in anamniote pharyngeal arches.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.21231.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.21231.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21231.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The carotid bodies are small glands found in either side of our neck, near the carotid artery. When the level of oxygen in our blood drops, specialized cells in the carotid bodies signal to the brain to increase our heart rate and make us breathe more rapidly and deeply. As a result, more oxygen is delivered to our cells.</p><p>Fish have similar oxygen-sensitive cells in their gills, known as neuroepithelial cells, that detect changes in the oxygen levels in the surrounding water and their blood. It has been suggested that after our vertebrate (back-boned animal) ancestors moved onto land, the neuroepithelial cells in their gills eventually evolved to form the carotid bodies. Knowing whether this is true would allow researchers to better understand how our ancestors were able to adapt to an obligate air-breathing lifestyle on land.</p><p>If the carotid body did evolve from ancestral neuroepithelial cells, we would expect that they would both develop from the same kind of cells in the embryo. Carotid body cells develop from a group of cells called neural crest cells, which give rise to many tissues, including nerve cells. Hockman et al. have now investigated whether neuroepithelial cells also develop from neural crest cells.</p><p>Hockman et al. labelled the neural crest cells in the embryos of zebrafish, frogs and lampreys using techniques such as injecting the cells with fluorescent dye or genetically modifying the cells to make fluorescent proteins. Unexpectedly, the neuroepithelial cells that developed in the gills of these embryos did not contain these fluorescent labels, meaning that they did not develop from the neural crest cells. The patterns of gene activity found in the developing neuroepithelial cells were also different from those in the carotid body. Further investigation revealed that neuroepithelial cells develop from the lining of the mouth and gills and may be related to a similar population of oxygen-sensitive cells found in the lungs.</p><p>Overall, it appears that the carotid body did not evolve from ancestral neuroepithelial cells. However, Hockman et al. did find some cells near blood vessels in the gills of zebrafish that had developed from neural crest cells. Equivalent cells in our ancestors could therefore be the cells that evolved into carotid bodies. A first test of this theory will be to determine whether or not these cells are oxygen-sensitive.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi"

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>During hypoxia in vertebrates, respiratory reflexes such as hyperventilation are triggered by neurotransmitter release from hypoxia-sensitive serotonergic cells associated with pharyngeal arch arteries, as well as in the lungs and/or gills (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">López-Barneo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cutz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Jonz et al., 2016</xref>). In amniotes, these are the ‘glomus cells’ of the carotid body, located at the bifurcation of the common carotid artery (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Nurse, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">López-Barneo et al., 2016</xref>), and the ‘pulmonary neuroendocrine cells’ (PNECs) of lung airway epithelia, found either as solitary, flask-shaped cells, or collected into ‘neuroepithelial bodies’ (NEBs), preferentially located at airway branch points (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cutz et al., 2013</xref>). Glomus cells respond to hypoxia in arterial blood by releasing stored neurotransmitters including acetylcholine, ATP, the catecholamine dopamine, and serotonin (the latter two most likely acting as autocrine/paracrine neuromodulators) (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Nurse and Piskuric, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Nurse, 2014</xref>). These excite afferent terminals of the carotid sinus nerve (a branch of the glossopharyngeal nerve, arising from neurons in the petrosal ganglion) in mammals (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Nurse and Piskuric, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Nurse, 2014</xref>), and of the vagal nerve (arising from neurons in the nodose ganglion) in birds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kameda, 2002</xref>). The afferent nerves relay signals to the nucleus of the solitary tract within the hindbrain, to elicit respiratory reflex responses such as hyperventilation (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Teppema and Dahan, 2010</xref>). PNECs respond to hypoxia by releasing stored serotonin and various neuropeptides onto vagal afferents, and are thought to act as hypoxia-sensitive airway sensors (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cutz et al., 2013</xref>; also see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Branchfield et al., 2016</xref>). PNECs also provide an important stem-cell niche for regenerating the airway epithelium after injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Reynolds et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Guha et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Song et al., 2012</xref>) and were recently shown to be the predominant cells of origin for small cell lung cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Park et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Sutherland et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Song et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>The evolution of glomus cells was critical for the transition from aquatic life, where externally facing hypoxia-sensors are essential for monitoring the variable oxygen levels in water, to fully terrestrial life, where reflex responses to variations in internal oxygen levels are more important, given the stability of oxygen levels in air (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Burleson and Milsom, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Milsom and Burleson, 2007</xref>). However, the evolutionary history of glomus cells - and, indeed, PNECs - is uncertain. One commonly suggested hypothesis (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Milsom and Burleson, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hempleman and Warburton, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Jonz et al., 2016</xref>) is that glomus cells are homologous to the chemosensory ‘neuroepithelial cells’ (NECs) of fish gills. These were originally identified within the primary epithelium of the gills in various teleosts and a shark, as innervated cells (isolated or clustered) containing dense-cored vesicles; formaldehyde-induced fluorescence revealed the presence of biogenic amines, identified as serotonin, while electron microscopy following exposure of trout to acute hypoxia revealed fewer vesicles, which appeared degranulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dunel-Erb et al., 1982</xref>). In vitro patch-clamp studies on NECs isolated from zebrafish and catfish gills (identified by neutral red, a vital dye that stains monoamine-containing cells including serotonergic PNECs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Youngson et al., 1993</xref>), confirmed that teleost gill NECs are hypoxia-sensitive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Jonz et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Burleson et al., 2006</xref>). The conventional marker for teleost gill NECs is serotonin: although non-serotonergic gill NECs were identified in adult zebrafish by immunoreactivity for synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2, these may represent immature NECs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Jonz and Nurse, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Jonz et al., 2004</xref>). NECs are found near efferent gill arteries and on the basal lamina of the gill epithelia, facing the flow of water, hence can detect hypoxia and other stimuli in either blood or external water (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Jonz et al., 2016</xref>). Like glomus cells (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Nurse, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">López-Barneo et al., 2016</xref>), zebrafish gill NECs also respond to acid hypercapnia (increased CO<sub>2</sub>/H<sup>+</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">López-Barneo et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Buckler, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Jonz et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Qin et al., 2010</xref>). The putative shared evolutionary ancestry of glomus cells and gill NECs (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Milsom and Burleson, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hempleman and Warburton, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Jonz et al., 2016</xref>) is supported by many similarities: both are associated with pharyngeal arch arteries (the carotid body develops in association with the third pharyngeal arch artery, which will form the carotid artery), provided with afferent innervation by glossopharyngeal and/or vagal nerves, and have background ('leak') K<sup>+</sup> currents that are inhibited by hypoxia, resulting in membrane depolarization, activation of voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, and neurotransmitter release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">López-Barneo et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Buckler, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Jonz et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Qin et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>If glomus cells and gill NECs evolved from the same ancestral cell population, they should share a common embryonic origin. Glomus cells are neural crest-derived, as demonstrated in birds by quail-chick neural fold grafts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Le Douarin et al., 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Pearse et al., 1973</xref>), and in mouse by <italic>Wnt1-Cre</italic> genetic lineage-tracing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Pardal et al., 2007</xref>), but the embryonic origin of NECs is unknown. Lack of immunoreactivity for the HNK1 antibody, which labels migrating neural crest cells in many but not all vertebrates, has been reported for NECs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Porteus et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">2014</xref>). However, the carbohydrate epitope recognized by the HNK1 antibody (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Voshol et al., 1996</xref>) is borne by multiple glycoproteins and glycolipids, and gene or antigen expression in itself cannot indicate lineage. An alternative to the hypothesis that gill NECs and glomus cells evolved from a common ancestral cell population is that NECs share ancestry with PNECs, to which they were originally likened (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dunel-Erb et al., 1982</xref>). Hypoxia-sensing by PNECs, as in NECs and glomus cells, involves inhibition of a K<sup>+</sup> current by hypoxia (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cutz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Nurse, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">López-Barneo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Jonz et al., 2016</xref>). In contrast to the neural crest origin of glomus cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Le Douarin et al., 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Pearse et al., 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Pardal et al., 2007</xref>), PNECs have an intrinsic pulmonary epithelial origin: the first experimental support for this was provided by a tritiated thymidine labeling study of hamster lung development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hoyt et al., 1990</xref>), later confirmed by mouse genetic lineage-tracing studies using <italic>Id2-CreER<sup>T2</sup></italic>, <italic>Shh-Cre</italic>, <italic>Nkx2.1-Cre</italic>, and <italic>Sox9-Cre</italic> driver lines that showed a common origin for all lung airway epithelial cell types, including PNECs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Rawlins et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Song et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kuo and Krasnow, 2015</xref>).</p><p>Here, we demonstrate that neural crest cells do not contribute to gill NECs: instead, these are endoderm-derived. This refutes the hypothesis that glomus cells and gill NECs evolved from a common ancestral cell population, and instead supports an evolutionary relationship between NECs and PNECs, whose endodermal origin we confirm in mouse. We also show that the transcription factor Phox2b, which is required for glomus cell development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dauger et al., 2003</xref>), is not expressed by gill NECs (or by PNECs), arguing against the possibility of cell-type homology between glomus cells and gill NECs via activation of the same genetic network. Finally, we report the discovery of neural crest-derived chromaffin (catecholaminergic) cells associated with blood vessels in the pharyngeal arches of juvenile zebrafish, which we speculate could share an evolutionary ancestry with glomus cells. Given these results, we propose a new model for the evolution of hypoxia-sensitive cells during the transition to terrestrial life.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Carotid body glomus cells develop from the neural crest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Le Douarin et al., 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Pearse et al., 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Pardal et al., 2007</xref>), while PNECs differentiate in situ within pulmonary airway epithelia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hoyt et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Rawlins et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Song et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kuo and Krasnow, 2015</xref>).

Intriguingly, in lampreys, catecholaminergic (chromium salt-staining, i.e., ‘chromaffin’) cells were reported a century ago in association with large blood vessels not only in the trunk, but also as far rostrally as the second branchial arch, ‘in the walls of the segmental veins as these run round the notochord’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Giacomini, 1902</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gaskell, 1912</xref>).

We reasoned that if present in lamprey, such cells might also be present in the zebrafish. We sectioned metamorphic juveniles and identified similar clusters of catecholaminergic cells in close association with blood vessels in the gill arches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7d–e’’’</xref>).

This involved a change from aquatic respiration in an environment with low oxygen solubility, to obligate air-breathing in an environment with more stable oxygen levels. It has been proposed that this transition was accompanied by a switch from a dispersed population of externally oriented hypoxia-sensitive cells in the gills that monitored the highly variable external oxygen levels, to one dominant site of hypoxia-sensitive cells that focused on monitoring internal oxygen states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Burleson and Milsom, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Milsom and Burleson, 2007</xref>). Current hypotheses suggest that this change was accompanied by the evolution of the glomus cells of the carotid body from an ancestral population of gill NECs (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Milsom and Burleson, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hempleman and Warburton, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Jonz et al., 2016</xref>). This was entirely plausible, given their common association with pharyngeal arch arteries, afferent innervation by glossopharyngeal and/or vagal nerves, and hypoxia-sensitive K<sup>+</sup> currents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">López-Barneo et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Buckler, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Jonz et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Qin et al., 2010</xref>). However, glomus cells are neural crest-derived (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Le Douarin et al., 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Pearse et al., 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Pardal et al., 2007</xref>) and the hypothesis is not compatible with our demonstration that neural crest cells do not contribute to gill NECs in zebrafish, or their presumed homologues in <italic>Xenopus</italic> and lamprey, or to similar innervated serotonergic cells (putative NECs) in the orobranchial epithelium of all three anamniote species. In contrast, we found that these cells are endoderm-derived, like PNECs, which differentiate in situ within pulmonary airway epithelia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hoyt et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Rawlins et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Song et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kuo and Krasnow, 2015</xref>) and whose endodermal origin we demonstrated using <italic>Sox17-Cre</italic> lineage-tracing in mouse. This suggests that gill NECs, and putative NECs in the orobranchial epithelium if these prove to be hypoxia-sensitive, more likely share a common ancestor with PNECs. Denervation experiments in various fishes (a shark, as well as some teleosts) have shown that hypoxia-sensitive and/or CO<sub>2</sub>-sensitive chemoreceptors involved in ventilation responses are located in the orobranchial cavity, as well as in the gills, although their cellular identity has not been confirmed (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Milsom, 2012</xref>). Furthermore, putative NECs (identified by morphology, innervation and serotonin immunoreactivity, although not as yet shown to be hypoxia-sensitive) have been reported in the epithelium of the air-breathing organs (where present) of ray-finned fishes, lobe-finned lungfishes and amphibians (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Jonz et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hsia et al., 2013</xref>). Anamniote air-breathing organs likely evolved from out-pocketings of the caudal orobranchial epithelium after the evolution of gills and NECs (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hsia et al., 2013</xref>). Taken together, this leads us to speculate that hypoxia-sensitive NECs in the epithelia of the gills and orobranchial cavity of ancestral vertebrates were retained in the air-breathing organs of both anamniotes and amniotes. Testing this hypothesis for the evolutionary origin of PNECs must await evidence for the hypoxia-sensitivity of the putative NECs in the orobranchial epithelium of anamniotes.</p><p>Putative NECs have also been identified via serotonin immunoreactivity in the skin of developing zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Jonz and Nurse, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Coccimiglio and Jonz, 2012</xref>) and of adult mangrove killifish, which respire through the skin as well as the gills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Regan et al., 2011</xref>). Our genetic lineage-tracing data in zebrafish show that these cells are not neural crest-derived. If these serotonergic cells in the embryonic skin indeed prove to be hypoxia-sensitive NECs, then we suggest that NECs are likely a ‘local epithelial’ rather than uniquely endodermal cell type, i.e., that they can differentiate within epithelia of either ectodermal or endodermal origin, like taste buds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barlow and Northcutt, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Stone et al., 1995</xref>) and the ameloblast (enamel-forming) layer of teeth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Soukup et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>It remained formally possible that, despite their different embryonic origins, gill NECs and glomus cells could be homologous cell types via activation of the same genetic network. However, we found that the transcription factor Phox2b, which is critical for glomus cell development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dauger et al., 2003</xref>), is not expressed by embryonic zebrafish gill NECs, putative NECs in the orobranchial epithelium, or their putative homologues in lamprey embryos.

Glomus cells are catecholaminergic, and they are strikingly similar to the neural crest-derived chromaffin (i.e., catecholaminergic) cells of the adrenal medulla. For example, in fetal or neonatal mammals, adrenal chromaffin cells release catecholamines in direct response to hypoxia, like glomus cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Comline and Silver, 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cheung, 1989</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Seidler and Slotkin, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Thompson et al., 1997</xref>). This ‘non-neurogenic’ response to hypoxia, in the absence of neural input, facilitates the transition to air-breathing in neonates by stimulating lung fluid absorption and regulating cardiovascular function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Seidler and Slotkin, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Thompson et al., 1997</xref>). The sensitivity of adrenal chromaffin cells to hypoxia is lost upon postnatal cholinergic innervation of the adrenal gland, although at least some hypoxia-responsive chromaffin cells persist in the adult adrenal medulla (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">García-Fernández et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Levitsky and López-Barneo, 2009</xref>) (also see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">López-Barneo et al., 2016</xref>). Furthermore, hypoxia inhibits K<sup>+</sup> currents in adrenal chromaffin cells, as in glomus cells (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">López-Barneo et al., 2016</xref>), and the ‘set point’ of hypoxia sensitivity is controlled in both glomus cells and adrenal chromaffin cells by mutual antagonism between the oxygen-regulated transcription factors hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (Hif1α/HIF1a) and hypoxia-inducible factor 2-alpha (Hif2α/HIF2a) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Yuan et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>These similarities led us to re-visit century-old reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Giacomini, 1902</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gaskell, 1912</xref>) of chromaffin (chromium salt-staining, i.e., catecholaminergic) cells associated with large branchial arch blood vessels in lamprey. We confirmed the existence of these catecholaminergic cells in ammocoete-stage sea lamprey, and went on to discover catecholaminergic cells associated with pharyngeal arch blood vessels in juvenile zebrafish, whose neural crest origin we demonstrated by genetic lineage-tracing. We speculate that the carotid body may have evolved via the aggregation of such cells, and their subsequent acquisition of serotonergic properties and afferent innervation by glossopharyngeal and/or vagal afferents, such that they became incorporated into the afferent arm of respiratory reflexes. In order to test this hypothesis, it will be necessary to investigate whether these blood vessel-associated catecholaminergic cells in anamniotes secrete catecholamines in response to hypoxia. Glomus cells in the carotid body are enveloped by glial-like sustentacular cells, also neural crest-derived (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Le Douarin et al., 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Pearse et al., 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Pardal et al., 2007</xref>), which have been shown to act as adult stem cells for the production of new glomus cells under hypoxic conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Pardal et al., 2007</xref>). Hypotheses for carotid body evolution must also take these cells into account.</p><p>The amphibian carotid labyrinth, a maze-like vascular expansion at the bifurcation of the carotid artery, is sensitive to oxygen levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ishii et al., 1966</xref>) and considered a carotid body homologue (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kusakabe, 2009</xref>). It contains both serotonergic and catecholaminergic cells, innervated by glossopharyngeal and/or vagal nerves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Reyes et al., 2014</xref>), with both efferent and afferent synapses (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kusakabe, 2009</xref>). Furthermore, the glomus cells in the carotid labyrinth are enveloped by fine processes of sustentacular cells (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kusakabe, 2009</xref>). In adult amphibians, the carotid labyrinth is hypothesized to replace the NECs of the larval gills as the primary site of the chemosensors responsible for maintaining respiratory homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kusakabe, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Jonz and Nurse, 2006</xref>). Direct electrophysiological evidence is lacking for which cells are hypoxia-responsive, however, and their embryonic origin has not been established. Further investigation of the development and physiology of the carotid labyrinth in amphibians, and of the neural crest-derived catecholaminergic cells that we discovered in association with pharyngeal arch blood vessels in zebrafish, should help to test our new hypothesis for carotid body evolution.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>A new model for amniote hypoxia-sensitive cell evolution</title><p>Given our lineage-tracing data, we present a new model for the evolution of the hypoxia-sensitive cells involved in amniote respiratory reflexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).

This model can be viewed as more parsimonious, since both embryonic lineage (neural crest versus endoderm) and function (physiological versus environmental oxygen monitoring) are maintained during the proposed evolutionary history of glomus cells and PNECs.

The work focuses largely on lineage and physical fate mapping studies to trace the embryological origin of the neuroendocrine cells (NEC) in gills of non-amniotic species (zebrafish, lamprey and frogs) and to test whether these NEC correspond to the glomus or PNEC of amniotes (mice). They show that gill NEC do not derive from neural crest cells, unlike the glomus cells, but arise by in situ differentiation of the gill epithelium and thus are rather homologous to amniote pulmonary NEC (PNEC) than to glomus NEC. The study addresses a complex question and includes various genetic and cell labeling approaches in zebrafish, <italic>Xenopus</italic>, lamprey and mouse. This is a large body of work that is both interesting and carefully done. However in the present version several issues are left to be resolved. Many can be handled by modifications to the text, softening statements and providing more details or clarity. However, there is also a need for additional experimental data.</p><p>Major revisions:</p><p>1) Results from the lineage tracing and knockout studies provided here are overall clear and supportive in their claim that PNECs in amniotes and NEC anamniotes are endoderm-derived. However, there are important gaps of knowledge and uncertainties regarding the role of NEC as hypoxia-sensitive cells in the species they analyze. This raises questions on whether the title of this paper &quot;Evolution of the hypoxia-sensitive cells in amniote respiratory reflexes&quot; can be justified. The authors need to deal with these issues in the text and consider modifying the title. Specifically:</p><p>A) Patch-clamp studies provide evidence that gill NECs of zebrafish and catfish are hypoxia sensitive. However, there is a lack of evidence that the oropharyngeal putative NEC (innervated serotonergic cells) of anamniotes are hypoxia-sensitive (subsection “NECs are endoderm-derived, suggesting homology with PNECs, not glomus cells”, first paragraph). This weakens their proposed hypothesis that &quot;hypoxia-sensitive NECs in the epithelia of the gills and orobranchial cavity of ancestral vertebrates were retained in air-breathing organs of both anamniotes and amniotes&quot;.</p><p>B) The authors state that putative hypoxia-responsive NECs have been reported in the skin of anamniotes (zebrafish, killifish). However, they do not comment on whether these NEC differentiate in situ from ectodermal skin progenitors or originate from migrating neural crest cells (like melanocytes). This may add complexity to their model, given that oropharyngeal NEC (shown to be non-neural crest-derived) have not yet been proven to be hypoxia-sensitive. Are there hypoxia-responsive and unresponsive NEC in anamniotes?</p><p>2) Points related to the issue of homology:</p><p>A) What does define structures as &quot;homologous&quot;? Given the focus of this manuscript, the authors should provide a definition or give more stringent criteria to consider structures &quot;homologous&quot;.</p><p>B) What is the functional significance of the homology between these cells in anamniotes and amniotes? Does this provide any evolutionary advantage? The discussion does not lead to clear insights into this issue and it should be addressed.</p><p>C) In the third paragraph of the Introduction: The authors mention that &quot;if glomus cells and NECs are homologous, they should share a common embryonic origin&quot; and in the first paragraph of the subsection “NECs are endoderm-derived, like PNECs”: “Overall our data show that anamniote NECs are not neural crest-derived, hence cannot be homologous to glomus cells&quot;. The authors need to properly qualify these statements. While embryonic origins generally do support homology (defined as similarity resulting from common ancestry), especially for more complex tissues and structures, modern EvoDevo has shown repeatedly that homologous cell types (cells whose similarly is so extensive that they must be evolutionarily related) can sometimes have different embryonic origins. Perhaps the most dramatic example of this are ectomesenchymal NCC derivatives, e.g. NCC-derived smooth muscle and bone are clearly homologous to mesoderm-derived smooth muscle or bone, despite originating from different germ layers. If NECs and Glomus cells were shown to activate the same genetic network, they could be considered homologous despite disparate embryonic origins.</p><p>D) With respect to the anamniote evolutionary homologs of glomus cells, the authors only establish a superficial similarity. There is no proof that the catecholaminergic neural crest-derived cells in zebrafish have any hypoxia-sensing role, the hypothesis for homology is highly speculative. The authors need to qualify or soften their hypothesis by noting this lack of evidence for hypoxia-sensing.</p><p>3) Aside from serotonin immunoreactivity, chromium staining/tyrosine hydroxylase, and various general neural markers, nothing is known about the gene-regulatory identity of NECs, PNECs, glomus cells, and the newly described chromaffin cells. Thus, it is formally possible that glomus cells and NECs may activate identical gene-regulatory programs, while PNECs and NECs could be very different at the level of the transcription factors and other developmental regulators they utilize, and are thus similar due to convergence. The use of serotonin (5-HT) as a marker of NECs should be confirmed with a second NEC-specific marker that does not label neurons as well. There is evidence for serotonin-negative NECs (Jonz et al. 2004); it should be mentioned that the NECs described in this study are not comparable to those. Ideally, it would be important to have 1 or more molecular markers for developmental regulators (aside from terminal differentiation/effector proteins like serotonin) that confirm the proposed homologies.</p><p>4) Although figures are well done, the overall choice of colors used in immunofluorescence (IF) images (green/magenta) does not yield optimal assessment of the patterns or resolution details. This is particularly problematic when double labeling needs to be demonstrated. In several instances there seems to be a disconnect between the perceived and the described co-localization of signals in the figures and text. A combination of red and green should minimize this issue and is recommended to be used in all IF images.</p><p>5) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A, B</xref> there are at least 2 clearly labeled Wnt1-Cre;R26-YFP+ epithelial cells in the field. Both are closely associated with Ascl1-expressing cells (or could even be expressing Ascl1, depending on sectioning angle). These cells are not indicated in the figure or commented on in the text. As noted above, the use of red/green colors in these images would likely help in clarifying whether there is overlap in YFP-Ascl1. How frequently these cells are seen? Do they appear at other developmental stages and how frequently? Is this an artifact or real? This is relevant, given the focus of this paper on the contribution of neural crest cells to the NEC lineage. In addition, neural crest-derived cells in the epithelium, if confirmed, is an important observation.</p><p>6) It is interesting to see that the number of putative NECs seems to be unchanged in zebrafish that are missing neural crest derivatives. Their development seems to be unaffected even when their usual developmental environment is largely disrupted. This is an intriguing result and would be made more so by examination of a greater number of embryos as the current statistics show a lot of variation.</p><p>7) The lineage tracing of Sox17 using reporter mice in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A-D</xref> does not include double staining (βGal-5HT). Moreover, it is not explained that this reporter labels both epithelial and mesenchymal components nor why it was used. Half of 5-HT positive cells were also positive for a sox17 induced reporter in zebrafish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Is this a consequence of the sections including many non-NEC (or otherwise non-endoderm derived) serotonergic cells, or does it reflect somewhat low levels of the inducible Cre in these fish, leading to unsaturated reporter switching? Some discussion of this in the text would be appreciated.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21231.018</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Major revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) Results from the lineage tracing and knockout studies provided here are overall clear and supportive in their claim that PNECs in amniotes and NEC anamniotes are endoderm-derived.

This raises questions on whether the title of this paper &quot;Evolution of the hypoxia-sensitive cells in amniote respiratory reflexes&quot; can be justified. The authors need to deal with these issues in the text and consider modifying the title. Specifically:</italic> </p><p><italic>A) Patch-clamp studies provide evidence that gill NECs of zebrafish and catfish are hypoxia sensitive.

This weakens their proposed hypothesis that &quot;hypoxia-sensitive NECs in the epithelia of the gills and orobranchial cavity of ancestral vertebrates were retained in air-breathing organs of both anamniotes and amniotes&quot;.</italic> </p><p>Indeed, there is no direct evidence that the putative NECs in the orobranchial epithelium are hypoxia-sensitive, although we did note in the Introduction that: “Denervation experiments in various fishes (a shark, as well as some teleosts) have shown that hypoxia-sensitive and/or CO<sub>2</sub>sensitive chemoreceptors involved in ventilation responses are located in the orobranchial cavity, as well as in the gills, although their cellular identity has not been confirmed (reviewed by Milsom, 2012).” We have now moved the above text and associated information to the Discussion (subsection “Gill NECs are endoderm-derived, suggesting shared ancestry with PNECs, not glomus cells”, first paragraph), where its relevance will hopefully be clearer. We have also clarified that our hypothesis for PNEC evolution is speculative, and that testing this hypothesis must await evidence for the hypoxia-sensitivity of the putative NECs in the orobranchial epithelium of anamniotes (see aforementioned paragraph). We have also amended the “Hypoxia-sensitive cells” label in the schematic summary figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, formerly <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) to “Putative hypoxia-sensitive cells”.</p><p><italic>B) The authors state that putative hypoxia-responsive NECs have been reported in the skin of anamniotes (zebrafish, killifish). However, they do not comment on whether these NEC differentiate in situ from ectodermal skin progenitors or originate from migrating neural crest cells (like melanocytes). This may add complexity to their model, given that oropharyngeal NEC (shown to be non-neural crest-derived) have not yet been proven to be hypoxia-sensitive. Are there hypoxia-responsive and unresponsive NEC in anamniotes?</italic> </p><p>The embryonic origin of putative skin NECs (identified so far only in embryonic zebrafish and adult killifish, i.e., two teleost fish species) had not previously been investigated. In response to this comment, we performed additional neural crest lineage-tracing experiments in zebrafish: we now provide experimental data showing that the putative skin NECs in embryonic zebrafish are not neural crest-derived (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Videos 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">2</xref>; subsection “Zebrafish NECs are not neural crest-derived”, fourth paragraph).</p><p>The comment also made us realise that our original wording about the putative skin NECs was ambiguous: they have not been shown directly (e.g. by patch-clamp) to be hypoxia-sensitive, although the putative NECs increase in area in response to hypoxia in killifish, while the usual decline in the number of the putative zebrafish NECs seen with age is reduced or delayed by hypoxia, and accelerated by hyperoxia. We have clarified this in the text (see aforementioned paragraph and subsection “Gill NECs are endoderm-derived, suggesting shared ancestry with PNECs, not glomus cells”, second paragraph).</p><p>Overall, we feel that our title is justified. Zebrafish gill NECs, mammalian carotid body glomus cells and mammalian PNECs have all been shown to be directly sensitive to hypoxia, and are all proposed to play a role in mediating respiratory reflexes. By exploring their development, and suggesting a new model for the evolution of both glomus cells and PNECs in light of our experimental data, our manuscript explores the evolution of the hypoxiasensitive cells involved in amniote respiratory reflexes. Direct physiological studies are of course still needed to confirm the hypoxia-sensitivity of the putative NECs in the orobranchial epithelium, as well as the putative gill and orobranchial NECs in <italic>Xenopus</italic> and lamprey: we hope that our manuscript will stimulate further work in this area. (If you insist, we can of course change the title, but we would appreciate suggestions as to what you feel would be more appropriate.)</p><p><italic>2) Points related to the issue of homology:</italic> </p><p><italic>A) What does define structures as &quot;homologous&quot;? Given the focus of this manuscript, the authors should provide a definition or give more stringent criteria to consider structures &quot;homologous&quot;.</italic> </p><p>We now specify that we are testing whether gill NECs and glomus cells derive from a common ancestral cell population (Introduction, third and fourth paragraphs; subsection “Gill NECs are endoderm-derived, like PNECs”, first paragraph; Discussion subsection “Gill NECs are endoderm-derived, suggesting shared ancestry with PNECs, not glomus cells”, heading and first paragraph).</p><p><italic>B) What is the functional significance of the homology between these cells in anamniotes and amniotes? Does this provide any evolutionary advantage? The discussion does not lead to clear insights into this issue and it should be addressed.</italic> </p><p>We have added text to the first paragraph of the Discussion to address this comment.</p><p><italic>C) In the third paragraph of the Introduction: The authors mention that &quot;if glomus cells and NECs are homologous, they should share a common embryonic origin&quot; and in the first paragraph of the subsection “NECs are endoderm-derived, like PNECs”: “Overall our data show that anamniote NECs are not neural crest-derived, hence cannot be homologous to glomus cells&quot;. The authors need to properly qualify these statements. While embryonic origins generally do support homology (defined as similarity resulting from common ancestry), especially for more complex tissues and structures, modern EvoDevo has shown repeatedly that homologous cell types (cells whose similarly is so extensive that they must be evolutionarily related) can sometimes have different embryonic origins. Perhaps the most dramatic example of this are ectomesenchymal NCC derivatives, e.g. NCC-derived smooth muscle and bone are clearly homologous to mesoderm-derived smooth muscle or bone, despite originating from different germ layers. If NECs and Glomus cells were shown to activate the same genetic network, they could be considered homologous despite disparate embryonic origins.</italic> </p><p>This is a very valid point brought up by the reviewers: separate embryonic origin does not necessarily rule out homology. As suggested, we investigated whether NECs and glomus cells activate the same genetic network. We have added new expression data to show that Phox2b, which is essential for glomus cell development (Dauger et al., 2003, Development, 130, 663542), is not expressed by zebrafish gill NECs, or by their putative counterparts in lamprey, or by putative NECs in the orobranchial epithelium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A-J</xref>’ in the revised manuscript; subsection “NECs do not express Phox2b, which is essential for glomus cell development”, first paragraph). Hence, NECs and glomus cells cannot be considered to be homologous cell types by virtue of activating the same genetic network. We now refer to this possibility explicitly (Introduction, last paragraph, subsection “NECs do not express Phox2b, which is essential for glomus cell development”, first and last paragraphs, subsection “Gill NECs are endoderm-derived, suggesting homology shared ancestry with PNECs, not glomus cells”, last paragraph). We also show that, like NECs, PNECs in mouse and chicken do not express Phox2b (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6K-M</xref>’ in the revised manuscript; subsection “NECs do not express Phox2b, which is essential for glomus cell development”, second paragraph).</p><p><italic>D) With respect to the anamniote evolutionary homologs of glomus cells, the authors only establish a superficial similarity. There is no proof that the catecholaminergic neural crest-derived cells in zebrafish have any hypoxia-sensing role, the hypothesis for homology is highly speculative. The authors need to qualify or soften their hypothesis by noting this lack of evidence for hypoxia-sensing.</italic> </p><p>We agree that this is a speculative hypothesis: we have qualified the wording to indicate this (Introduction, last paragraph, subsection “Candidate glomus cell homologues in fish: neural crest-derived chromaffin cells associated with pharyngeal arch blood vessels”, last paragraph, subsection “A new hypothesis for carotid body evolution”, second paragraph and subsection “A new model for amniote hypoxia-sensitive cell evolution”), and added sentences noting the need for evidence of hypoxia-sensitivity (see the aforementioned paragraphs). We have also amended the “Hypoxia-sensitive cells” label in the schematic summary figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, formerly <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) to “Putative hypoxia-sensitive cells”.</p><p><italic>3) Aside from serotonin immunoreactivity, chromium staining/tyrosine hydroxylase, and various general neural markers, nothing is known about the gene-regulatory identity of NECs, PNECs, glomus cells, and the newly described chromaffin cells. Thus, it is formally possible that glomus cells and NECs may activate identical gene-regulatory programs, while PNECs and NECs could be very different at the level of the transcription factors and other developmental regulators they utilize, and are thus similar due to convergence.</italic> </p><p>As noted in the response to point 2C, we have now provided data showing that NECs and PNECs do not express Phox2b, hence are genetically distinct from glomus cells.</p><p><italic>The use of serotonin (5-HT) as a marker of NECs should be confirmed with a second NEC-specific marker that does not label neurons as well.</italic> </p><p>Unfortunately, there are no NEC-specific markers. Serotonin is the conventional marker for NECs. Other published NEC markers, such as the synaptic vesicle protein SV2, label neurons as well. We have added more information into the Introduction about how fish gill NECs were first identified, and the use of serotonin as the conventional marker for these cells (Introduction, second paragraph).</p><p><italic>There is evidence for serotonin-negative NECs (Jonz et al. 2004); it should be mentioned that the NECs described in this study are not comparable to those.</italic> </p><p>We now include information about these cells in the Introduction (second paragraph). We note that both Jonz et al. (2004, J. Physiol., 560, 737-52) and the previous paper by the same group reporting the existence of serotonin-negative NECs (using expression of the synaptic vesicle protein SV2; Jonz &amp; Nurse, 2003, J. Comp. Neurol., 461, 117) speculate that these cells are immature NECs; we have included this in our description (see aforementioned paragraph).</p><p><italic>Ideally, it would be important to have 1 or more molecular markers for developmental regulators (aside from terminal differentiation/effector proteins like serotonin) that confirm the proposed homologies.</italic> </p><p>As noted in the response to point 2C, we have added new data showing that gill NECs, putative gill NECs, putative orobranchial NECs, and PNECs, all lack Phox2b expression, which is essential for glomus cell development (Dauger et al., 2003, Development, 130, 6635-6642).</p><p><italic>4) Although figures are well done, the overall choice of colors used in immunofluorescence (IF) images (green/magenta) does not yield optimal assessment of the patterns or resolution details. This is particularly problematic when double labeling needs to be demonstrated. In several instances there seems to be a disconnect between the perceived and the described co-localization of signals in the figures and text. A combination of red and green should minimize this issue and is recommended to be used in all IF images.</italic> </p><p>The use of red and green together disadvantages red-green colour-blind readers, i.e., 5-10% of all male readers. Using green with magenta, instead of red, is recommended to enable colour-blind readers to see the data being presented – for further information, please see the ‘Color Universal Design’ website: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jfly.iam.u-%C2%ADtokyo.ac.jp/color/index.html">http://jfly.iam.u-tokyo.ac.jp/color/index.html</ext-link>.</p><p>We do not know which specific images are deemed to be problematic. Cells of interest are indicated with arrows and single-channel images are shown, when necessary, to confirm localization for any channel signal that may be harder to see in the merged image. However, we have amended some figure panels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A-B’’’</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> panels E-E’’’) to show the single channels in grey-scale and the triple-merge image in red, green and blue, since the Color Universal Design website says that this approach is acceptable for colour-blind readers.</p><p><italic>5) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A, B</xref> there are at least 2 clearly labeled Wnt1-Cre;R26-YFP+ epithelial cells in the field. Both are closely associated with Ascl1-expressing cells (or could even be expressing Ascl1, depending on sectioning angle). These cells are not indicated in the figure or commented on in the text. As noted above, the use of red/green colors in these images would likely help in clarifying whether there is overlap in YFP-Ascl1. How frequently these cells are seen? Do they appear at other developmental stages and how frequently? Is this an artifact or real? This is relevant, given the focus of this paper on the contribution of neural crest cells to the NEC lineage. In addition, neural crest-derived cells in the epithelium, if confirmed, is an important observation.</italic> </p><p>The two fainter green, out-of-focus spots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref> panels A,A’ are an artefact from the GFP immunostaining (we were unable to find any epithelial staining in panels B,B’). We have replaced panels A,A’ with a higher-power image of the same section, to try to show this more clearly, and have commented on the fainter out-of-focus spots in the legend. We did not see any reporter-positive cells in the epithelium, consistent with an earlier, comprehensive analysis of the neural crest contribution to the intrinsic ganglia of the lungs using the same <italic>Wnt1-Cre/R26R-EYFP</italic> mouse line (Freem et al., 2010, J. Anat., 217, 651-664).</p><p>Similarly, the recent analysis of <italic>Wnt1-Cre;;Rosa26<sup>Zsgreen/+</sup></italic>embryos showing that there was no neural crest contribution to PNECs – which we confirm in our manuscript – described reporter expression in the lungs only in the subepithelial intrinsic ganglia (Kuo &amp; Krasnow, 2015, Cell, 163, 394-405).</p><p><italic>6) It is interesting to see that the number of putative NECs seems to be unchanged in zebrafish that are missing neural crest derivatives. Their development seems to be unaffected even when their usual developmental environment is largely disrupted. This is an intriguing result and would be made more so by examination of a greater number of embryos as the current statistics show a lot of variation.</italic> </p><p>We have shown that the putative NECs in the orobranchial epithelium differentiate in situ. There is no a priori reason to think that the development of the orobranchial epithelium would be disrupted by the absence of neural crest cells in the surrounding mesenchyme: neural crest cells are not required for pharyngeal pouch formation, for example (Veitch et al., 1999, Curr. Biol., 9, 1481-1484). Adding more numbers for these experiments, which involve counting all putative NECs in the entire orobranchial region, would not be trivial, and we do not feel that this would be relevant for the main thrust of the paper. We have added a sentence to the main text to clarify that we counted all putative NECs in the orobranchial region, with 294 putative NECs counted in total across three <italic>tfap2a<sup>mob</sup>;;foxd3<sup>mos</sup></italic> larvae and 244 putative NECs counted in total across three wild-type siblings (subsection “Zebrafish NECs are not neural crest-derived”, third paragraph). Also in this paragraph, we realised that we had not cited the original papers describing the <italic>tfap2a<sup>mob</sup></italic> and <italic>foxd3<sup>mos</sup></italic> mutants: now added.</p><p><italic>7) The lineage tracing of Sox17 using reporter mice in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A-D</xref> does not include double staining (βGal-5HT).</italic> </p><p>We have performed additional experiments using the <italic>Sox17<sup>2A-iCre</sup></italic>driver line crossed to the <italic>R26R<sup>tdTomato</sup></italic>reporter line, which has enabled double immunostaining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E-E’’’</xref>).</p><p><italic>Moreover, it is not explained that this reporter labels both epithelial and mesenchymal components nor why it was used.</italic> </p><p>We explained in the legend to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A-D</xref> that in <italic>Sox17<sup>2A-iCre/+</sup>;R26<sup>R/+</sup></italic>mice, all endoderm-derived lineages, as well as vascular endothelial cells and the haematopoietic system, constitutively express β-galactosidase. We have now added this information about the <italic>Sox17<sup>2AiCre</sup></italic>driver line into the main text (subsection “Gill NECs are endoderm-derived, like PNECs”, first paragraph).</p><p><italic>Half of 5-HT positive cells were also positive for a sox17 induced reporter in zebrafish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Is this a consequence of the sections including many non-NEC (or otherwise non-endoderm derived) serotonergic cells, or does it reflect somewhat low levels of the inducible Cre in these fish, leading to unsaturated reporter switching? Some discussion of this in the text would be appreciated.</italic> </p><p>The relatively low labelling efficiency likely results from a lack of optimization of the 4-OHT dose for the <italic>Tg(sox17:creER<sup>T2</sup>;cmlc2:DsRed</italic>) driver in combination with this particular switchable reporter line (Mosimann et al., 2011). We now state this in the text (subsection “Gill NECs are endoderm-derived, like PNECs”, third paragraph).</p></body></sub-article></article>
