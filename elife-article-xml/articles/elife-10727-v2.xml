Interestingly, GLS1 and GLS2 display contrasting functions in tumorigenesis with elusive mechanism; GLS1 promotes tumorigenesis, whereas GLS2 exhibits a tumor-suppressive function. In this study, we found that GLS2 but not GLS1 binds to small GTPase Rac1 and inhibits its interaction with Rac1 activators guanine-nucleotide exchange factors, which in turn inhibits Rac1 to suppress cancer metastasis. This function of GLS2 is independent of GLS2 glutaminase activity. Furthermore, decreased GLS2 expression is associated with enhanced metastasis in human cancer. As a p53 target, GLS2 mediates p53’s function in metastasis suppression through inhibiting Rac1. In summary, our results reveal that GLS2 is a novel negative regulator of Rac1, and uncover a novel function and mechanism whereby GLS2 suppresses metastasis. Our results also elucidate a novel mechanism that contributes to the contrasting functions of GLS1 and GLS2 in tumorigenesis.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.10727.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.10727.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10727.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Healthy cells in the body derive most of their energy from a sugar called glucose. However, cancer cells grow and divide much more rapidly than normal cells and so require larger amounts of energy to sustain themselves. Therefore, many cancer cells can alter their metabolism so that they can obtain more energy from a molecule called glutamine or other alternative sources.</p><p>Cancer cells obtain glutamine from the blood and use an enzyme called glutaminase to convert it into another type of molecule. Human cells produce two forms of glutaminase called GLS1 and GLS2. Even though both enzymes share many common features, they have different effects on cancer cells. GLS1 promotes tumor formation, while GLS2 has the opposite effect. However, it is not clear why these enzymes behave so differently.</p><p>Zhang, Liu et al. now investigate how GLS2 suppresses the progression of tumors. The experiments show that GLS2, but not GLS1, can directly bind to a protein called Rac1 that normally promotes the spread of tumor cells around the body. GLS1 inhibits the activity of Rac1, but this happens independently of the enzyme’s glutaminase activity. Zhang, Liu et al. altered the levels of GLS2 in liver cancer cells and then injected these cells into mice. Cells that had low levels of GLS2 were able to spread and form tumors in distant sites like the lung. In contrast, smaller and fewer lung tumors were observed in mice that had been injected with cells that produced high levels of GLS2.</p><p>Zhang, Liu et al.’s findings reveal a new role for GLS2 that may help to explain why it affects tumor progression differently from GLS1. Further work is now needed to explore whether targeting Rac1 could be a potential therapy for cancers that have lost GLS2.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.10727.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.10727.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>GLS2</kwd><kwd>p53</kwd><kwd>Rac1</kwd><kwd>metastasis</kwd><kwd>tumor suppression</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1R01CA143204</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Feng</surname><given-names>Zhaohui</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1R01CA160558</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hu</surname><given-names>Wenwei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01CA169182-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bhanot</surname><given-names>Gyan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The GLS2 enzyme suppresses cancer metastasis by interacting with the small GTPase Rac1 and inhibiting its activity.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Metabolic changes are a hallmark of cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Berkers et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cairns et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ward and Thompson, 2012</xref>). Increased glutamine metabolism (glutaminolysis) has been recognized as a key metabolic change in cancer cells, along with increased aerobic glycolysis (the Warburg effect) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Berkers et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cairns et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">DeBerardinis et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hensley et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ward and Thompson, 2012</xref>). Glutamine is the most abundant amino acid in human plasma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hensley et al., 2013</xref>). Glutamine catabolism starts with the conversion of glutamine to glutamate, which is converted to α-ketoglutarate for further metabolism in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. Recent studies have shown that increased glutamine metabolism plays a critical role in supporting the high proliferation and survival of cancer cells by providing pools of the TCA cycle intermediates, as well as the biosynthesis of proteins, lipids, and nucleotides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Berkers et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cairns et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">DeBerardinis et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hensley et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ward and Thompson, 2012</xref>).</p><p>Glutaminase (GLS) is the initial enzyme in glutamine metabolism, which catalyzes the hydrolysis of glutamine to glutamate in cells. Two genes encode glutaminases in human cells: GLS1 (also known as kidney-type glutaminase), and GLS2 (also known as liver-type glutaminase). GLS1 and GLS2 proteins exhibit a high degree of amino acid sequence similarity, particularly in their glutaminase core domains. While GLS1 and GLS2 both function as glutaminase enzymes in glutamine metabolism, recent studies show that they have very different functions in tumorigenesis. GLS1 is ubiquitously expressed in various tissues, and its expression can be induced by the oncogene MYC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gao et al., 2009</xref>). GLS1 is frequently activated and/or overexpressed in various types of cancer, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gao et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Thangavelu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Wang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Xiang et al., 2015</xref>). GLS1 has been reported to promote tumorigenesis in different types of cancer, including HCC, which is mainly attributable to its glutaminase activity and role in promoting glutamine metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gao et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Thangavelu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Wang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Xiang et al., 2015</xref>). By contrast, GLS2 is specifically expressed in only a few tissues, including the liver tissue. Recent studies including ours have shown that <italic>GLS2</italic> is a novel target gene of the tumor suppressor p53. GLS2 is transcriptionally up-regulated by p53 and mediates p53’s regulation of mitochondrial function and anti-oxidant defense in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Suzuki et al., 2010</xref>). Considering the critical role of p53 and its pathway in tumor suppression, the identification of <italic>GLS2</italic> as a p53 target gene strongly suggests a potentially important role of GLS2 in tumor suppression. Recent studies have shown that, in contrast to the tumorigenic effect of GLS1, GLS2 displays a tumor suppressive function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Liu et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Suzuki et al., 2010</xref>). GLS2 expression is frequently reduced in HCC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Liu et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Suzuki et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Xiang et al., 2015</xref>). Ectopic expression of GLS2 greatly inhibited the growth and colony formation of HCC cells in vitro and the growth of HCC xenograft tumors in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Liu et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Suzuki et al., 2010</xref>). Given that GLS1 and GLS2 both function as glutaminase enzymes, the mechanisms underlying their contrasting roles in tumorigenesis remain unclear.</p><p>In this study, immunoprecipitation (IP) followed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MC-MS) analysis was employed to screen for potential proteins interacting with GLS2. The small GTPase Rac1 was identified as a novel binding protein for GLS2. Rac1 cycles between inactive guanosine 5′-diphosphate (GDP)-bound and active guanosine 5'-triphosphate (GTP)-bound forms in cells, and regulates a diverse array of cellular events, including actin dynamics. The Rac1 signaling is frequently activated in various types of cancer, in which it plays a critical role in promoting migration, invasion and metastasis of cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bid et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Heasman and Ridley, 2008</xref>). We found that GLS2 binds to Rac1, and inhibits the interaction of Rac1 with its guanine-nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) such as Tiam1 and VAV1, which would normally activate Rac1. Thus, GLS2 inhibits Rac1 activity, which in turn inhibits migration, invasion and metastasis of cancer cells. This function of GLS2 requires the C-terminus of GLS2 and is independent of its glutaminase activity. In contrast, GLS1 does not interact with Rac1 to inhibit Rac1 activity, and consequently, cannot inhibit cancer metastasis via this pathway. p53 plays a pivotal role in suppressing cancer metastasis, but its underlying mechanism is not fully understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Muller et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Vousden and Prives, 2009</xref>). Our results further show that, as a direct downstream target of p53, GLS2 mediates p53’s function in metastasis suppression through inhibiting the Rac1 signaling. Taken together, our results demonstrated that GLS2 is a novel negative regulator of Rac1, and plays a critical role in suppression of metastasis through its negative regulation of Rac1 activity. Our results also revealed that GLS2 plays an important role in mediating the function of p53 in suppression of cancer metastasis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Rac1 is a novel GLS2 interacting protein</title><p>GLS2 was reported to interact with several proteins although the biological functions of these interactions remain unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Boisguerin et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Olalla et al., 2001</xref>).

Since the C-terminus of GLS2 (GLS2-C139) does not contain the glutaminase core domain, which encodes the glutaminase catalytic domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>) and hence lacks glutaminase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>), these results demonstrate that the binding of GLS2 to Rac1 is independent of its glutaminase activity.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>GLS2 interacts with Rac1-GDP and inhibits the Rac1 activity</title><p>As a molecular switch, Rac1 cycles between inactive GDP-bound and active GTP-bound forms in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bid et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Heasman and Ridley, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Raftopoulou and Hall, 2004</xref>).

PAK1 (p21-activated kinase 1) is a critical Rac1 effector protein. It has been well established that the p21-binding domain of PAK1 binds specifically to the Rac1-GTP but not Rac1-GDP in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Galic et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hayashi-Takagi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Palacios et al., 2002</xref>). Based on this fact, the GST-p21-binding domain of PAK1 pull-down assays have been widely used to measure the levels of Rac1-GTP in cells as a standard method to analyze the Rac1 activity in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Galic et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hayashi-Takagi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Palacios et al., 2002</xref>). We found that ectopic expression of GLS2-Flag greatly decreased the levels of Rac1-GTP measured by p21-binding domain of PAK1 pull-down assays in Huh-1 and HepG2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), as well as Hep3B and Huh-7 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). In contrast, the expression of GLS2-Flag did not affect the levels of total Rac1 protein in these cells measured by western blot assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>), indicating that GLS2 inhibits Rac1 activity. Consistently, knockdown of GLS2 greatly increased the levels of Rac1-GTP but not total Rac1 in Huh-1 and HepG2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) as well as in Hep3B and Huh-7 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B,C</xref>). The endogenous levels of GLS2 in these HCC cells and the levels of GLS2-Flag in HCC cells transduced with GLS2-Flag expression vectors were shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A–D</xref>. It has been known that Rac1 binds to PAK1 and results in the auto-phosphorylation of PAK1 at multiple sites, including Ser199/204, leading to PAK1 activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chong et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Heasman and Ridley, 2008</xref>). Therefore, we further investigated the effect of GLS2 on Rac1 activity by detecting the Ser199/204 phosphorylation of PAK1 in cells. Ectopic expression of GLS2-Flag in Huh-1 and HepG2 cells greatly reduced Ser199/204 phosphorylation of PAK1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), whereas GLS2 knockdown enhanced Ser199/204 phosphorylation of PAK1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>), which further indicates that GLS2 inhibits the Rac1 activity in HCC cells. In contrast, ectopic GLS1 expression or GLS1 knockdown did not affect the Rac1 activity in HCC cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D,E</xref>).</p><p>Consistent with WT GLS2, the C-terminus of GLS2, GLS2-C139, specifically bound to the DN Rac1-T17N but not CA Rac1-G12V in Huh-1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). Furthermore, ectopic expression of GLS2-C139 greatly inhibited the Rac1 activity in Huh-1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). In contrast, GLS2-ΔC139, which did not bind to Rac1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>), failed to inhibit the Rac1 activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). This result indicates that the interaction between GLS2 and Rac1 is critical for GLS2 to inhibit the Rac1 activity. Furthermore, the function of GLS2 in binding to and inhibiting Rac1 is independent of its glutaminase activity since the C-terminus of GLS2 (GLS2-C139) lacks the glutaminase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Collectively, these results revealed that GLS2 is a novel negative regulator of the Rac1 signaling; GLS2 inhibits the Rac1 activity through its interaction with Rac1-GDP, and furthermore, this function of GLS2 requires the C-terminus of GLS2 and is independent of GLS2 glutaminase activity.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>GLS2 inhibits the interaction of Rac1-GDP with Rac1 GEFs to negatively regulate Rac1</title><p>We further investigated the mechanism by which GLS2 inhibits Rac1.

GLS2 bound to Rac1-GDP through its Switch I &amp; II regions, which is also the binding domain for Rac1 GEFs Tiam1 and VAV1. Thus, GLS2 blocked the binding of Tiam1 and VAV1 to Rac1-GDP, and inhibited the Rac1 activation by Tiam1 and VAV1. We found that GLS2 inhibited migration and invasion of HCC cells in vitro and lung metastasis of HCC cells in vivo. Blocking the Rac1 signaling by expression of Rac1-T17N or knockdown of Rac1 largely abolished GLS2’s function in inhibiting metastasis. These results demonstrate a novel and important role of GLS2 in suppressing cancer metastasis, and also reveal that GLS2 binding to Rac1-GDP to inhibit Rac1 activity is a critical underlying mechanism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>).</p><p>GLS1 plays a critical role in promoting tumorigenesis through enhancing glutamine metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gao et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Thangavelu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Wang et al., 2010</xref>). It is unclear why GLS1 and GLS2 have contrasting roles in tumorigenesis, although they both function as the glutaminase enzymes. While the glutaminase core domains of GLS1 and GLS2 show high homology, their C-termini show relatively low homology. In this study, we found that GLS2 bound to Rac1 through its C-terminus and inhibited the Rac1 activity to suppress migration and invasion of HCC cells. This effect requires the C-terminus of GLS2 and is independent of its glutaminase activity. In contrast, GLS1 does not bind to Rac1 or inhibit Rac1 activity. Considering the critical role of Rac1 in cancer, our results provide a novel mechanism for the different roles of GLS1 and GLS2 in tumorigenesis, particularly with respect to cancer metastasis. In addition to Rac1, GLS2 may interact with other proteins to regulate their functions, which in turn contributes to GLS2’s function in tumor suppression. Future studies should shed light on the further mechanisms of GLS2 in tumor suppression.</p><p>p53 plays a critical role in suppressing cancer metastasis.

These results demonstrate that GLS2 is a novel and critical mediator for p53 in suppressing metastasis, and also reveal a novel mechanism by which p53 inhibits Rac1.</p><p>HCC is one of the most common types of cancer and the third leading cause of cancer death worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">El-Serag and Rudolph, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jemal et al., 2011</xref>). The high malignancy and poor prognosis of HCC has been related with the high metastatic characteristic of HCC; however, the mechanism underlying HCC metastasis is not well understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">El-Serag and Rudolph, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Tang, 2001</xref>). Considering that GLS2 is frequently down-regulated in HCC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Liu et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Suzuki et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Xiang et al., 2015</xref>), our findings that GLS2 inhibits HCC metastasis and loss of GLS2 promotes HCC metastasis provide a novel mechanism contributing to high metastatic characteristic of HCC. These results strongly suggest that the GLS2/Rac1 signaling could be a potential target for therapy in cancer, particularly in HCC.</p><p>In summary, our results demonstrate that GLS2 is a novel negative regulator of Rac1, and plays a novel and critical role in suppression of metastasis through its negative regulation of the Rac1 activity. Furthermore, our results also reveal that GLS2 is a critical mediator for p53 in suppression of cancer metastasis.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell lines, vectors and shRNA</title><p>HepG2 (p53-WT) and Hep3B (p53-null) cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA).

An emerging question is why the glutaminase isozymes GLS1 and GLS2, despite being enzymatically equivalent, appear to serve opposite roles in tumorigenesis, with recent studies showing a tumor suppressive activity of GLS2.</p><p>Here, the authors provide an explanation for this – they show that GLS2, but not GLS1, binds to and inhibits Rac1. This is done independently of enzymatic activity, via the binding of GLS2 to the switch regions of Rac1, preventing the binding of Rac1 GEFs. Through a series of gain-of-function and loss-of-function based experiments in multiple cell lines and in vivo, the authors show that this mechanism is responsible for the migration/metastasis inhibiting activities of GLS2. Furthermore, as GLS2 has been reported to be a target of p53, the authors show that GLS2 inhibition of Rac1 mediates in large part the known suppressive properties of p53 on migration and metastasis.</p><p>The question on hand is highly relevant to understanding the regulation of cancer cell metastasis, and to understanding the role of the glutaminases in cancer. While the role in cancer of the genes addressed in the study were already known, the core mechanism of the study, the inhibitory role of GLS2 on Rac1, is novel, well detailed, and nicely ties together previous knowledge of p53/GLS2/Rac1 in metastasis. Overall, experiments are well designed and very well executed, with convincing results. There are a few concerns and issues that need to be addressed in order to strengthen the study. They are listed in order of importance below:</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Despite the previous studies on GLS2 showing its negative effects on cell proliferation/viability, the authors only focus on the migration/metastasis aspect here. This is an important and obvious missing control since decreased cell viability can indirectly impact migration/invasion/metastasis. Is GLS2 inhibition of Rac1 involved in the previously reported effects of GLS2 on cell survival? In the effects of p53 on survival? While it is unlikely that the results on cell migration/metastasis are artifacts of effects on cell viability, especially in light of the increased migration following GLS2 loss, cell viability for a few key conditions need to be examined and discussed.</p><p>2) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C and D</xref>, the lack of an additive effect of knocking down p53 and GLS2 suggests but does not prove that GLS2 mediates p53's function in inhibiting Rac1.

Recent reports including ours show that GLS2 negatively regulates cell proliferation (Hu et al., PNAS, 2010; Suzuki et al., PNAS, 2010). Results from our recent study suggest that inhibition of AKT signaling is an important mechanism contributing to the inhibitory effect of GLS2 on cell proliferation (Liu et al., Oncotarget, 2014). In the current study, we found that GLS2 inhibits Rac1 activation. Rac1 activation promotes cell proliferation. It is therefore possible that the inhibition of Rac1 by GLS2 is an additional mechanism contributing to the role of GLS2 in negative regulation of cell proliferation, which is worth further investigation in a future study. In this study, we focused the effect of GLS2 on migration, invasion and metastasis of HCC cells. Therefore, a serum-free medium was used in in vitrotrans-well assays to determine the abilities of migration and invasion of cells with ectopic expression of GLS2, knockdown of endogenous GLS2 or their control cells. Serum starvation induces G0/G1 cell cycler arrest and inhibits cell proliferation. Under this experiment condition for 36 h (the length for migration and invasion transwell assays), GLS2 (either ectopic expression or knockdown of GLS2) does not have an obvious effect on cell proliferation as well as cell viability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). These results strongly suggest that the effect of GLS2 on migration and invasion is not due to the effect of GLS2 on cell viability or proliferation. As suggested, we have also added <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A, B</xref> as controls to show that no significant difference in the viability and number of HCC cells among different groups was observed after being cultured in a serum-free medium for 36 h at the end of trans-well assays in HCC cells with Rac1 or p53 knockdown.</p><p><italic>2) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C and D</xref>, the lack of an additive effect of knocking down p53 and GLS2 suggests but does not prove that GLS2 mediates p53's function in inhibiting Rac1. A more direct experiment to verify this would be to see if overexpression of GLS2 nullifies the effects of p53 knockdown on Rac1 activation and Tiam1/Vav1 binding.</italic> </p><p>Thanks for this good suggestion. We did the experiments as suggested, and found that overexpression of GLS2 largely abolished the effects of p53 knockdown on Rac1 activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>) and Tiam1/Vav1 binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). These data are consistent with our results showing the lack of an additive effect of knocking down p53 and GLS2 on Rac1 activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>) and Tiam1/Vav1 binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). These results together strongly suggest that GLS2 mediates p53's function in inhibiting Rac1. These new data have been added to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>.</p><p><italic>3) Endogenous expression levels of GLS1 and GLS2 expression levels for the four HCC cell lines used in the study should be shown. Also, what is the degree of overexpression of GLS2 or GLS2 fragments in the experiments, relative to endogenous GLS2?</italic> </p><p>As suggested, we presented the endogenous GLS1 and GLS2 protein levels in different HCC cells in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A, 2B</xref>.</p><p>Due to relatively narrow quantitative linear range of western-blot assays, we measured the mRNA levels of endogenous GLS2 and exogenous GLS2 in HCC cells by Taqman real-time PCR assays. We also included two normal liver tissues as controls. Compared with normal liver tissues, the mRNA level of endogenous GLS2 is greatly reduced (by around 10-20-fold) in HCC cells, and the exogenous GLS2 in HCC cells with ectopic GLS2 expression is around two-three fold higher than normal liver tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C</xref>).</p><p>The GLS2 fragments are mutant GLS2 with deletion of different domains, it is difficult to detect their mRNA levels in cells with the same sets of primers for real-time PCR assays and directly compare their expression with the levels of endogenous GLS2 in cells. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>, the protein levels of these Flag-tagged GLS2 fragments are similar to the levels of the wild-type GLS2-Flag in cells as measured by western-blot assays with the anti-Flag antibody. According to the results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>, the mRNA expression levels of these different GLS2 fragments in cells should be similar to that of WT GLS2-Flag, which is around two-three-fold higher than endogenous GLS2 in normal tissues, and 20-60-fold higher than the endogenous GLS2 in these HCC cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C</xref>).</p></body></sub-article></article>
