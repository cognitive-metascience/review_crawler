determine endosome identity and promote long-range organelle transport. Here we report that ankyrin-B (AnkB), through integrating all three systems, functions as a critical node in the protein circuitry underlying polarized recycling of α5β1-integrin in mouse embryonic fibroblasts, which enables persistent fibroblast migration along fibronectin gradients. AnkB associates with phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI3P)-positive organelles in fibroblasts and binds dynactin to promote their long-range motility. We demonstrate that AnkB binds to Rab GTPase Activating Protein 1-Like (RabGAP1L) and recruits it to PI3P-positive organelles, where RabGAP1L inactivates Rab22A, and promotes polarized trafficking to the leading edge of migrating fibroblasts. We further determine that α5β1-integrin depends on an AnkB/RabGAP1L complex for polarized recycling. Our results reveal AnkB as an unexpected key element in coordinating polarized transport of α5β1-integrin and likely of other specialized endocytic cargos.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.20417.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.20417.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.20417.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The membranes that surround animal and other eukaryotic cells are in a state of flux. Small fluid-filled sacs known as vesicles form from the membrane and move into the cell, while other vesicles are returning with cargos of chemicals. These processes allow cells to rapidly adjust the composition of their surfaces for different activities, such as migrating to other parts of the body. Like rock climbers, migrating cells need to hang onto nearby surfaces as they move and so vesicles deliver sticky “adhesion” proteins to the front of migrating cells.</p><p>At least three different kinds of molecule are involved in delivering vesicles to a particular end of the cell. Fat molecules known as phosphoinositide lipids act as markers to identify different vesicles, while proteins called GTPases determine which direction the third type of molecules (known as molecular motors) will move the vesicles across the cell. However, it is still not clear how these molecules work together to transport specific cargos to the front of cells during migration.</p><p>Now, Qu et al. discover that a protein called ankyrin-B coordinates the directional transport of specific vesicles within migrating cells. Biochemical experiments in cells isolated from mouse embryos show that ankyrin-B recognizes vesicles containing specific phosphoinositide lipids and attaches to them. Ankyrin-B then recruits molecular motors and another protein called RabGAP1L, which regulates the activity of GTPases, to direct the movements of the vesicles. Microscopy experiments reveal that this machinery is essential to transport cell adhesion proteins and other specific cargos to the front of migrating cells.</p><p>The next step following on from this work will be to examine how ankyrin-B and RabGAP1L behave in cells that are still inside the body of the animal. Future experiments will identify other cargos that use this machinery to reach the cell membrane and investigate how cells recognize and select these cargos for transport.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.20417.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.20417.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>Endosomal transport</kwd><kwd>α5β1-integrin</kwd><kwd>Ankyrin-B</kwd><kwd>RabGAP1L</kwd><kwd>haptotaxis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Qu</surname><given-names>Fangfei</given-names></name><name><surname>Lorenzo</surname><given-names>Damaris N</given-names></name><name><surname>Bennett</surname><given-names>Vann</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM110155</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>King</surname><given-names>Samantha J</given-names></name><name><surname>Brooks</surname><given-names>Rebecca</given-names></name><name><surname>Bear</surname><given-names>James E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Ankyrin-B – through interactions with PI3P lipids, dynactin and RabGAP1L – functions as a critical node in the protein circuitry underlying polarized recycling of α5β1-integrin to enable haptotaxis along fibronectin gradients.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The currently accepted view that plasma membranes of eukaryotic cells are in a state of flux due to rapid internalization and recycling of membrane proteins received its first experimental support in a prescient 1976 paper by Ralph Steinman and his colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Steinman et al., 1976</xref>). Steinman (later awarded a Nobel Prize for the discovery of dendritic cells) observed that a surface area equivalent to the entire plasma membrane was internalized every 2 hr in L-cells, which implied a rate of turnover for the bulk plasma membrane much faster than that of individual membrane proteins known at that time. His non-intuitive conclusion was that the majority of internalized membrane was returned to the cell surface in the form of small vesicles:</p><p>“A plausible morphologic mechanism for membrane recycling is that it involves the production of tiny vesicles capable of returning large amounts of surface membrane, with very little content, to the cell surface”</p><p>Steinman’s conjecture of membrane recycling through small vesicles was soon validated with the discovery of receptor-mediated endocytosis and of the return of endosomal receptors to the plasma membrane following separation from ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pearse and Bretseher, 1981</xref>). Membrane recycling is now recognized as a fundamental property of nucleated cells required for diverse functions, including cell migration, cytokinesis, receptor signaling, and synaptic transmission.</p><p>Much progress has been made in elucidating the molecular components required for the highly selective sorting and trafficking of Steinman’s 'tiny vesicles', now termed endosomes. These include identification of numerous small GTPases, as well as of phosphoinositide lipids, together with their effectors and regulators, which collaborate to determine the endosomal identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Balla, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jean and Kiger, 2012</xref>). In addition, diverse molecular motors that promote both long-range and local endosomal transport have been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Granger et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Despite these remarkable findings, it is not clear how the individual activities associated with endosomes are integrated to promote a highly regulated and precise delivery of particular membrane proteins to specific cellular locations in polarized cells. One plausible mechanism is through scaffolding proteins capable of simultaneously recruiting and modulating the activity of motor and signaling complexes at endosomal membranes. For instance, the molecular scaffolds JNK interacting proteins 1 and 3 (JIP1 and JIP3) promote axonal transport through binding both protein kinases and the small G protein Arf6 on intracellular membranes. Moreover, JIP1 and JIP3 regulate kinesins directly and dynein indirectly through interaction with the dynactin complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fu and Holzbaur, 2013</xref>). The kinesin motor Kif16B provides another example, which, through direct binding of both PI3P lipids and the small G protein Rab14, promotes the transport of FGFR2-endosomes to the fast-growing ends of microtubules during early embryonic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hoepfner et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Ueno et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>AnkB is a member of the vertebrate ankyrin family of plasma membrane-organizing proteins that, in contrast to Ankyrin-G (AnkG) and Ankyrin-R (AnkR), associates with intracellular organelles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">He et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lorenzo et al., 2014</xref>). AnkB promotes axonal transport and growth through coupling dynactin to organelles containing PI3P lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lorenzo et al., 2014</xref>). AnkB is broadly expressed, suggesting it may coordinate organelle transport in multiple cellular contexts. Here, we report that AnkB, through binding to PI3P lipids, dynactin, and the Rab GTPase-regulating protein RabGAP1L, functions as a master integrator of endosomal transport, which promotes polarized trafficking of PI3P-positive endosomes bearing α5β1-integrin to the leading edge of migrating fibroblasts.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>AnkB promotes long-range transport of PI3P-positive organelles</title><p>AnkB promotes fast axonal transport by coupling the motor adaptor dynactin to PI3P-positive organelles in neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lorenzo et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, we hypothesized that AnkB also contributes to the long-range transport of PI3P-positive organelles in other cell types. We selected primary cultures of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) because these cells express 220 kDa AnkB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), and are a standard laboratory model that have been extensively studied with respect to organelle transport. We first examined the dynamics of AnkB-positive organelles by tracking the motility of vesicles expressing 220 kDa AnkB-mCherry in AnkB null (<italic>Ank2<sup>-/-</sup></italic>) MEFs isolated from postnatal day 0 (PND0) <italic>Ank2<sup>-/-</sup> </italic>mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Scotland et al., 1998</xref>). It is important to note that over-expression of 220 kDa AnkB is lethal for MEFs, and it was critical to express 220 kDa AnkB-mCherry in an AnkB null background. We observed that a subset of WT AnkB-mCherry-associated organelles exhibited fast long-range motility, with a net velocity greater than 4 µm/s and a persistence greater than 0.5, which is consistent with long-range, fast microtubule-based transport (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.20417.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>AnkB is a PI3P-lipid effector in MEFs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) AnkB immunoblot (IB) of whole cell lysate from WT and <italic>Ank2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> MEFs.

DD1320AA AnkB-mCherry-positive organelles showed shorter-range motility, reduced net velocity (velocity &lt; 4 µm/s, persistence &lt; 0.5), and completely lacked a population with fast long-range motion (velocity &gt; 4 µm/s, persistence &gt; 0.5), which is otherwise observed in <italic>Ank2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> MEFs expressing WT AnkB-mCherry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Hence, these results demonstrate that AnkB provides long-range motility to a subset of organelles by coupling them through dynactin to either dynein or kinesin motors.</p><p>AnkB harbors a highly conserved basic pocket within the second ZU5 (ZU5<sup>C</sup>) domain that specifically binds PI3P lipids and is required for AnkB’s association with axonal cargos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, yellow surface) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lorenzo et al., 2014</xref>). To examine if AnkB also associates with organelles through PI3P lipids in MEFs, we labeled PI3P lipids using the GFP-2xFYVE<sup>EEA1</sup> domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Schink et al., 2013</xref>). Live microscopy revealed that over 70% of WT AnkB-mCherry-positive vesicles detected were PI3P-positive, and around 45% of PI3P-positive organelles were associated with WT AnkB-mCherry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). In sharp contrast, mutant R1194A AnkB-mCherry, which cannot bind PI3P lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lorenzo et al., 2014</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> red circle), failed to localize to PI3P-positive organelles, and was instead diffusely distributed throughout the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–E</xref>).</p><p>We next sought to uncover the identity of AnkB-positive structures in live MEFs by coexpressing WT AnkB-mCherry and organelle markers in <italic>Ank2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> MEFs. Although WT AnkB-mCherry expressed was preferentially localized to Rab5-positive early endosomes, it also exhibited partial overlap with Rab11-positive recycling endosomes and LAMP1-positive lysosomes. Moreover, we detected a restricted association of AnkB-mCherry with puncta at mitochondria ends. In contrast, we observed almost no localization of AnkB-mCherry to either Golgi or ER membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B,D</xref>). We also examined the association of PI3P lipids with multiple organelles in fixed MEFs using the GFP-2xFYVE<sup>EEA1</sup> probe and antibodies against endogenous organelle-specific proteins. As expected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gillooly et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Di Paolo and De Camilli, 2006</xref>), PI3P lipids were enriched in endo-lysosomal membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C,E</xref>), which closely resembled AnkB’s subcellular distribution pattern in MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B,D</xref>).

In addition, RabGAP1L contains an N-terminal phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domain and a kinesin-like domain of unknown function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hidaka et al., 2000</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).</p><p>Co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) and co-localization experiments using affinity-purified antibodies against AnkB and RabGAP1L, which recognize single polypeptides of 220 kDa and 93 kDa in MEFs, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>), showed that endogenous AnkB and RabGAP1L interact in cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> top). Interestingly, the AnkG death domain (AnkG DD), which is 65% homologous with the AnkB DD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>), did not interact with RabGAP1L in Y2H assays (data not shown). Similarly, full-length endogenous AnkG did not co-immunoprecipitate with RabGAP1L from MEF lysates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> bottom). Thus, AnkB either gained the ability to bind to RabGAP1L after the divergence of AnkB and AnkG in early vertebrate evolution, or AnkG lost this activity.</p><p>We performed a proximity ligation assay (PLA) as well as immunofluorescence assay to further assess the association of endogenous AnkB and RabGAP1L, and to identify the sites of their interaction in MEFs. PLA produces a positive signal when putative binding partners are within less than 40 nm of each other, which allows the DNA labels of antibodies against these proteins to form double strands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Söderberg et al., 2006</xref>).

The lack of association between RabGAP1L and AnkG suggested that divergent sites in the sequences of AnkB DD and AnkG DD may mediate the AnkB DD-RabGAP1L interaction. Binding assays between RabGAP1L and AnkB with alanine mutations in seven of its DD charged residues diverging from AnkG’s DD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>, red box) showed that the E1537A substitution significantly weakened the interaction with RabGAP1L, while the reverse-charge mutant E1537K blocked their association (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). The E1537 site, highly conserved among vertebrate AnkB proteins, resides on the surface of the crystal structure of AnkB DD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1F</xref>).</p><p>Within the AnkB DD interacting portion of RabGAP1L, the highly conserved, positively charged residues 783KKLKK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>) provided potential candidates for interaction with AnkB DD. We found that reversing the charge of the surface exposed 783KK residues to EE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>) abolishes RabGAP1L binding to AnkB DD in Y2H assays (data not shown).

Rab22A is a vertebrate Rab GTPase closely related to Rab5 that localizes to early endosomes, where it interacts with the early endosomal antigen 1 (EEA1) and the Rab5 guanine nucleotide exchange factor Rabex-5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kauppi et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zhu et al., 2009</xref>).

We evaluated whether RabGAP1L recruitment to Rab22A-positive organelles depends on AnkB.

Thus, our results establish AnkB as a key nodal element in the protein circuitry required for α5β1-integrin recycling and for directional fibroblast migration on fibronectin gradients.<fig-group><fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.20417.019</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Model of AnkB-mediated mechanism for endosomal transport.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Model of AnkB-mediated mechanism for the recruitment of RabGAP1L to PI3P/Rab22A-positive endosomal compartments, which is critical for the maturation and recycling of α5β1-integrin containing endosomes.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.20417.019">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.20417.019</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="postscript" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-20417-fig8-v2"/></fig><fig id="fig8s1" position="float" specific-use="child-fig"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.20417.020</object-id><label>Figure 8—figure supplement 1.</label><caption><title>AnkB and RabGAP1L co-localize at the corpus callosum in the CNS and costameres in skeletal muscle.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Immunofluorescent staining of endogenous AnkB (red) and RabGAP1L (green) in WT PND30 mice brain.

Human AnkB, RabGAP1L, and Rab22A all have homologues in ghost sharks and zebrafish with a high level of sequence similarity, including nearly complete conservation of their AnkB-RabGAP1L binding sites. In contrast, residues required for interaction between AnkB and RabGAP1L are highly divergent in the closest homologues of <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> and <italic>C. elegans</italic>. Human AnkB and its paralogue AnkG exhibit over 70% sequence conservation, with only a few localized regions of divergence. One highly divergent site between these two ankyrins is an unstructured peptide connecting the MBD and the first ZU5 domain, which through intramolecular inhibition, prevents interactions between AnkB and membrane partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">He et al., 2013</xref>). Here, we identify an additional divergent site within AnkB’s DD that allows AnkB, but not AnkG, to bind to RabGAP1L. AnkB, likely gained RabGAP1L-binding activity after divergence of AnkB and AnkG proteins in early vertebrate evolution, although, alternatively, AnkG may have lost this function. Similarly, RabGAP1L differs from its paralogue RabGAP1 primarily in the C-terminal residues required to bind AnkB.</p><p>A functional prediction, based on the recent evolution of the AnkB/RabGAP1L-based pathway, is that it will engage a subset of cargos with specialized roles in vertebrate physiology. In support of this idea, Rab22A, an AnkB/RabGAP1L substrate identified in this study, participates in recycling of other specialized cargos, including the Menkes copper transporter, the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and the major histocompatibility complex class I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Holloway et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Maldonado-Báez and Donaldson, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Weigert et al., 2004</xref>). Interestingly, Rab22A shares 70% sequence identity with Rab22B/Rab31, also implicated in the endosomal transport of specialized cargos such as EGFR and the p75 neurotrophin receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baeza-Raja et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chua and Tang, 2014</xref>). It will be of interest to determine whether Rab22B is a RabGAP1L substrate, and whether it also depends of AnkB for its inactivation. Likewise, it will be important to identify the full complement of membrane-associated proteins engaged by the AnkB/RabGAP1L pathway.</p><p>As an initial step in further elucidating the physiological role(s) of the AnkB/RabGAP1L interaction, we performed a proximity ligation assay as well as immunofluorescent staining of total AnkB and RabGAP1L in brain and skeletal muscle tissues from PND 30 mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>). We detected a strong PLA signal in the corpus callosum in the CNS and costameres in skeletal muscle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1B,D</xref>). Interestingly, AnkB is required for preservation of the corpus callosum and assembly of costameres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Scotland et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lorenzo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ayalon et al., 2008</xref>). The cellular role of the AnkB/RabGAP1L interaction remains to be further characterized in more specialized mice models such as E1537K AnkB knock-in mice lacking RabGAP1L-binding activity.</p><p>An AnkB mutation eliminating interaction with the dynactin complex impairs but does not abolish α5β1-integrin recycling to the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). The residual α5β1-integrin transport may operate through alternative mechanisms to recruit motor proteins to AnkB-associated organelles, and facilitate their traffic from the perinuclear compartment to the plasma membrane. One potential candidate is the kinesin-3 family member KIF16B, which binds directly to PI3P lipids and promotes outward transport of Rab5-associated early endosomes to the cell surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hoepfner et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>Inactivation of Rab22A by RabGAP1L through its TBC domain likely contributes to the maturation of early endosomes. GTP-bound Rab22A directly associates with the Rab5 GEF Rabex-1, which activates Rab5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zhu et al., 2009</xref>). Alternatively, conversion of Rab22A to its GDP form through the AnkB-mediated recruitment of RabGAP1L would be expected to reduce Rab5 activation, thus promoting loss of early endosome identity. Another possibility is that RabGAP1L perform functions independent of GAP-activity, similar to p120RasGAP, which competes with, instead of inactivating, Rab21in binding to integrin α cytoplasmic tails to promote integrin recycling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mai et al., 2011</xref>). However, whether and how loss of Rab22A association with early endosomes lead to the polarized transport of organelles preferentially to the front of migrating fibroblasts remains to be elucidated.</p><p>The regulation of GTPases and their adaptor proteins also involves kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Stenmark, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Frasa et al., 2012</xref>). Specifically, previous studies had shown that Diacylglycerol kinase α (DGKα) is required for Rab-coupling protein (RCP)-dependent integrin trafficking and Akt mediated phosphorylation of ACAP1, a GAP for Afr6, is required for integrin recycling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rainero et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Li et al., 2005</xref>). Although the kinase(s) that regulate RabGAP1L activity has not been identified, it remains to be a possible regulatory mechanism for sensing directional cues during haptotaxis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).</p><p>Integrin dynamics has been the focus of intense investigation with particular attention from investigators in the fields of cancer cell metastasis, and angiogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">De Franceschi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Caswell et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dozynkiewicz et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Paul et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tian et al., 2012</xref>). Interestingly, Rab22A also contributes to exosome biogenesis and shedding from primary tumor cells and tumor metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wang et al., 2014b</xref>). Our discovery of an AnkB/RabGAP1L pathway as a key regulator of Rab22A localization and activity, and of α5β1-integrin polarized transport, offers new insights into the molecular circuitry underlying fibroblast and endothelial cell migration and tumor metastasis, as well as potential new targets for regulation.</p><p>Long-range transport and targeting of integrins underlies neurite outgrowth and neuronal migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anton et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Condic, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Condic and Letourneau, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wu and Reddy, 2012</xref>). Moreover, proper levels and dynamics of α5β1-integrin complexes, shown to localize to nerve growth cones, are required in multiple stages of brain development and synaptic function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bi et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Graus-Porta et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Marchetti et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yanagida et al., 1999</xref>).

It is, thus, conceivable that similar to its roles in migrating fibroblasts, an AnkB/RabGAP1L pathway might facilitate the 440 kDa AnkB-mediated axonal growth cone behavior, axonal guidance and synaptogenesis.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mouse lines and animal care</title><p>All animal care and procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Duke University.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Anna Akhmanova as the Senior Editor, Johanna Ivaska as the Reviewing Editor, and three reviewers including Jim Norman (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission. All the reviewers found the study largely convincing and interesting. Therefore, we would like to invite resubmission of a satisfactorily revised manuscript.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript, the authors demonstrated a role of Ankyrin-B (AnkB) with its binding partner RabGAP1L in polarized trafficking of α5β1 integrin. They first showed that AnkB mediates not only axonal trafficking in neurons as reported previously but also long-range transport of PI3P-containing organelles such as early endosomes and lysosomes in non-neuronal cells. In migrating fibroblasts, α5β1 integrin was found to be one of the important cargos of this trafficking pathway and was recycled in a polarized manner during persistent cell migration. To investigate the mechanism of how AnkB functions, the authors identified RabGAP1L, a GAP for Rab22A, as a novel binding partner of AnkB. From structural and evolutionary perspectives, they carefully determined critical residues for the interaction between AnkB and RabGAP1L. Finally, they showed that the interactions of AnkB with RabGAP1L, PI3P, and in part dynactin are required for polarized recycling of α5β1 integrin in migrating fibroblasts by a yet undefined mechanisms of cargo recruitment. There are also some data suggesting that AnkB may contribute to haptotaxis toward the α5β1 integrin ligand, fibronectin.</p><p>Overall, the study is mostly well-designed and high quality, and these findings advance our knowledge of how a scaffolding protein organizes Rab GTPases, phosphoinositides, and microtubule motors during polarized endosomal trafficking.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The rationale behind the choice of the model system (MEFs) is unclear limiting the biological relevance of these findings. In the first paragraph of the subsection “AnkB promotes long-range transport of PI3P-positive organelles” the authors mention that they wanted to investigate whether AnkB contributes to long-range transport of vesicles also in cell types other than neurons. They proceed by jumping into overexpression of AnkB in MEFs. Why MEFs? What is the biological relevance of long-range transport in these cells? Which tissues/organs, other than the CNS, express AnkB? What is the evidence from the <italic>AnkB<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice that fibroblast function would be compromised in the absence of AnkB? The MEFs are obviously a convenient model system for structure-function cell biological experimentation but a clear indication of the biological relevance of this pathway would be important to warrant publication in a journal like <italic>eLife</italic>. It would seem more relevant to include neurons in this study, also given the expertise of the Bennett laboratory and show the effect of the ANKB-E1537K mutant (RabGAP1L-binding-deficient) on axonal transport in neurons.</p><p>2) Data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref> are currently not convincing as the MEFs are hardly haptotaxing (an FMI of 0.1 is very low and hardly significantly different from 0.0). The authors should present spider/track plots and possibly vector plots rather than just this FMI metric, which is not really meaningful on its own as well as some movies of the cells in the FN gradient. Alternatively, the authors are encouraged to identify another cell line with stronger haptotaxis or to explore possibilities of looking at migration in 3D microenvironments.</p><p>3) What is lacking in the present study is the direct evidence that Rab22A is responsible for trafficking of α5β1 integrin downstream of the AnkB-RabGAP1L pathway. Does knockdown of RabGAP1L or overexpression of a constitutively active mutant of Rab22A phenocopy the deficiency in <italic>AnkB<sup>-/-</sup></italic> cells?</p><p>4) A rescue experiment using WT and a GAP activity-deficient mutant of RabGAP1L is highly recommended to determine whether RabGAP1L-mediated Rab22A inactivation is actually involved in persistent cell migration.</p><p>5) Currently, imaging of endogenous AnkB and RabGAP1L are lacking. Given the functionality of the antibodies in immunofluorescence based assays (PLA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>)) the authors need to provide staining of the endogenous to validate their observations obtained with the over-expressed tagged constructs.</p><p>6) The Introduction and Discussion of the paper are inadequately referenced in regard of the existing literature on α5 integrin trafficking. Two labs in particular (Ivaska and Norman) have published numerous papers over of the last 15 years on this process, which elucidate a fair degree of the machinery responsible for controlling the endosomal trafficking of α5β1, and many other workers have complimented this and added other components to the machinery. For instance, Rab21, p120RasGAP (Ivaska), RCP (Norman, Ivaska), DGKα (Norman), ACAP1 (Hsu), WASH (Machesky/Norman), SNX17 (Cullen, Fassler) and EHD1 (Caplan) are known regulators of α5β1-integrin endosomal recycling, and Rab25 (Norman) and CLIC3 (Norman) control recycling of active α5β1-integrin from late endosomes/lysosomes. This fairly extensive body of literature should be adequately cited and discussed.</p><p>7) The authors should define clearly what they mean by polarised delivery of α5β1 to the cell front. If one demonstrates (as they have) a greater number of vesicles leaving the front portion of the perinuclear region and proceeding toward the cell front than to the back, this is good, but it's not evidence to support Bretscher's postulate that integrins are disengaged from the substratum and the cell rear and then moved to the front in vesicles. As the paper currently stands, it reads a little like their evidence does support such a process.</p><p>Also, they need to mention that there are papers demonstrating spatial restriction of α5β1 recycling at the cell front (Norman) and 'polarised delivery' specifically to the cell rear (Norman, Straube). All of these things are likely going on in various proportions at the same time, so the situation is far more complex than Mark Bretscher envisaged and this need careful discussion.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.20417.022</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>[…] Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) The rationale behind the choice of the model system (MEFs) is unclear limiting the biological relevance of these findings.

They proceed by jumping into overexpression of AnkB in MEFs.</italic> </p><p>All experiments with the expression of fluorescently tagged ankyrin-B were done in primary MEFs isolated from ankyrin-B null (<italic>Ank2 <sup>-/-</sup></italic>) mice that have complete depletion of 220kDa ankyrin-B (as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We were particularly careful not to overexpress ankyrin-B since this led to cell death and mentioned this in the first paragraph of the subsection “AnkB promotes long-range transport of PI3P-positive organelles”. To make it clear to readers, we stated the genotype of MEFs we have used in every figure legend.</p><p><italic>Why MEFs? What is the biological relevance of long-range transport in these cells?</italic> </p><p>As noted at the beginning of the Results, we wanted to extend the novel finding of a role of ankB in organelle transport in neurons to another cell type. We selected MEFs because these cells are a standard laboratory model that have been extensively characterized with respect to organelle transport. Moreover, we are using primary MEFs isolated from PND 0 neonates without any transformation or extensive passage. In addition, ankyrin-B null MEFs directly isolated from <italic>Ank2<sup>-/-</sup></italic>mice can be rescued with wild-type levels of ankyrin-B, making it a perfect system to dissect out the molecular mechanism underlying the ankB-mediated organelle transport.</p><p>We have added a sentence describing the rationale behind using MEFs to study the function of ankyrin-B in organelle transport at the beginning of the Results section.</p><p><italic>Which tissues/organs, other than the CNS, express AnkB? What is the evidence from the AnkB<sup>-/-</sup> mice that fibroblast function would be compromised in the absence of AnkB? The MEFs are obviously a convenient model system for structure-function cell biological experimentation but a clear indication of the biological relevance of this pathway would be important to warrant publication in a journal like eLife.</italic> </p><p>AnkB is broadly expressed in multiple tissues other than CNS, including heart, skeletal muscle, pancreas and fat tissue, liver and skin. It is difficult to assign a specific physiological role of ankyrin-B in MEFs or define an exact phenotype as a direct evidence for compromised fibroblast function since ankyrin-B null (<italic>Ank2 <sup>/-</sup></italic>) mice die soon after birth with multisystem abnormalities including cardiac arrhythmia, severe CNS abnormalities, congenital myopathy, and pancreatic insufficiency (Scotland et al., 1998; Tuvia et al., 1999; Mohler et al., 2003; Ayalon et al., 2008; Healy et al., 2009; Lorenzo et al., 2014; Lorenzo et al., 2015). We include new data based on the proximity ligation assay demonstrating a nanoscale ankyrin-B-RabGAP1L interaction in commissural axons in the CNS and costameres in skeletal muscle as well as the immunofluorescence staining of total AnkB and RabGAP1L in these tissues in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref> and mention the result in the fourth paragraph of the Discussion. To address the biological significance of these interactions, an E1537K AnkB knock-in mouse would be an ideal model to study. Unfortunately, the development of a knock-in mouse takes at least a year and, in our opinion, is beyond the scope of this initial discovery paper.</p><p><italic>It would seem more relevant to include neurons in this study, also given the expertise of the Bennett laboratory and show the effect of the ANKB-E1537K mutant (RabGAP1L-binding-deficient) on axonal transport in neurons.</italic> </p><p>As described above, we did not use neurons because our purpose was to determine if cells other than neurons utilized ankyrin-B in organelle transport.</p><p>However, a potential role of neuronal specific isoform of ankyrin-B (440 kDa AnkB) has been suggested in axonal growth cones and axonal guidance been implicated (Kunimoto, 1995). While it is definitely worth investigating the phenotype of growth cones baring E1537K 440 kDa AnkB and the role of 440 kDa AnkB-RabGAP1L interaction in axonal guidance and synaptogenesis, we believe this is beyond the scope of this current paper, but worth future studies in our lab. This is mentioned in the last paragraph of the Discussion.</p><p><italic>2) Data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref> are currently not convincing as the MEFs are hardly haptotaxing (an FMI of 0.1 is very low and hardly significantly different from 0.0).</italic></p><p>Our key determinant of whether cells are haptotaxing is whether the 95% confidence intervals of the forward migration index (FMI) encompass 0. The FMI metric has been used in many previous publications (King et al. 2016, Chan et al. 2014, Asoken et al. 2014) to determine haptotactic fidelity. Although a value of 0.1-0.2 is low when compared to those often obtained for chemotaxis of cells such as neutrophils, the value is similar to FMI values for fibroblast haptotaxis that have previously been published (King et al. 2016, Chan et al. 2014), and is in the range expected for a process that is a response to short-range insoluble cues. In response to the reviewers’ concerns regarding the FMI values we have included the FMI value obtained for IA32 fibroblasts run in the same experiments as our MEFs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>. These are a cell type that we have previously published haptotaxis FMIs with, to show that this value is similar to the WT MEFs. It is also mentioned in the first paragraph of the subsection “AnkB/RabGAP1L interaction promotes directional cell migration”. Crucially, the FMI values obtained for the WT MEFs and the <italic>Ank2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> MEFs rescued by WT-ankB-GFP are significantly different from those obtained for <italic>a<sup>-/-</sup></italic>MEFs and the <italic>AnkB<sup>-/-</sup></italic> MEFs rescued by E1537K-ankB-GFP, demonstrating an effect on haptotaxis.</p><p> <italic>The authors should present spider/track plots and possibly vector plots rather than just this FMI metric, which is not really meaningful on its own as well as some movies of the cells in the FN gradient.</italic> </p><p>We agree that a visual representation of haptotaxis with rose plots is a good idea and we have now included rose plots, which have been published in various directional migration studies and should give a clear visual representation of the migration. They are now shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>. We understand the reviewers’ request for the inclusion of example movies of the cells in the FN gradient. However, unfortunately unlike other forms of directed migration such as chemotaxis, haptotaxis is extremely difficult to see by eye in the movies (hence the aforementioned lower FMI values) with analysis of the tracks being absolutely required to ascertain whether the cells are haptotaxing or not. Additionally, there are only a few cells per movie. Therefore, we respectfully feel that inclusion of these movies would not help with the readers understanding in this case, and rather would detract from the purpose of their inclusion, and so have not included them here.</p><p><italic>Alternatively, the authors are encouraged to identify another cell line with stronger haptotaxis or to explore possibilities of looking at migration in 3D microenvironments.</italic> </p><p>We have addressed the reviewers’ concerns regarding our MEFs haptotacic fidelity by including the FMI values of a previously published cell line (IA32 fibroblasts) that was run simultaneously with our MEFs. These cells show a similar FMI value to our WT MEFs, as is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>, demonstrating that the FMI values seen are not low for a haptotaxis measurement in fibroblasts. We acknowledge that it would be informative to evaluate the role of AnkB-RabGAP1L pathway in cell migration in a more physiological relevant 3D micro-environment and its role in metastasis, and have mentioned this point in the Results section, last paragraph. However, we think these experiments are beyond the scope of this initial discovery paper.</p><p><italic>3) What is lacking in the present study is the direct evidence that Rab22A is responsible for trafficking of α5β1 integrin downstream of the AnkB-RabGAP1L pathway. Does knockdown of RabGAP1L or overexpression of a constitutively active mutant of Rab22A phenocopy the deficiency in AnkB<sup>-/-</sup> cells?</italic> </p><p>To address the requirement of RabGAP1L in α5β1-integrin trafficking, we generated MEFs with shRNA-mediated knockdown of RabGAP1L. Cells with ~70% knockdown of RabGAP1L exhibited multiple deficits including altered morphology and cell death. Therefore, it would be difficult to perform as well as hard to interpret the endosomal trafficking or integrin recycling experiment in RabGAP1L knockdown cells. We mention this result in a new subsection: &quot;Balanced Rab22A activity is critical for β1-integrin recycling&quot;, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref> now summarizes the characterization of the growth and survival rate of RabGAP1L knock-down cells.</p><p>To address the concerns regarding the lack of direct evidence that Rab22A is responsible for trafficking of α5β1-integrin downstream of the AnkB-RabGAP1L pathway, we performed β1-integrin recycling assay in MEFs overexpressing WT Rab22A or constitutively active Rab22A. WT MEFs over-expressing WT Rab22A showed a reduced rate of β1-integrin recycling. The deficit was more severe in MEFs expressing constitutively active Q64L Rab22A, suggesting that the balanced Rab22A activity is critical for β1-integrin recycling. The result is summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref> and mentioned in a new subsection: &quot;Balanced Rab22A activity is critical for β1-integrin recycling&quot;.</p><p><italic>4) A rescue experiment using WT and a GAP activity-deficient mutant of RabGAP1L is highly recommended to determine whether RabGAP1L-mediated Rab22A inactivation is actually involved in persistent cell migration.</italic> </p><p>As we described above, shRNA-mediated knock down of RabGAP1L is lethal. Expression of shRNA-resistant WT RabGAP1L simultaneously after activation of the shRNA system rescued the lethal phenotype. However, expression of GAP-deficient RabGAP1L (R584A RabGAP1L) did not restore viability. It is therefore difficult to interpret cell migration because these cells are likely in the process of dying. This result suggests that RabGAP1L plays critical roles in cellular events in addition to polarized transport of α5β1-integrin and cell migration, which itself is an interesting question worth investigating in future studies. Therefore, we have summarized these results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref> and stated this finding in the first paragraph of the subsection “Balanced Rab22A activity is critical for β1-integrin recycling”.</p><p><italic>5) Currently, imaging of endogenous AnkB and RabGAP1L are lacking. Given the functionality of the antibodies in immunofluorescence based assays (PLA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>)) the authors need to provide staining of the endogenous to validate their observations obtained with the over-expressed tagged constructs.</italic> </p><p>We examined the distribution of endogenous RabGAP1L as well as ankyrin-B using the same antibodies employed in the proximity ligation assay. We have confirmed the co-localization of Ankyin-B and RabGAP1L by immunofluorescence staining of endogenous proteins and added this result in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1H</xref>. The result is stated in the fifth paragraph of the subsection “AnkB directly recruits RabGAP1L to PI3P-positive organelles” as well. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref> now summarizes our analysis of endogenous RabGAP1L localization to PI3P-positive organelles and Rab22A-positive organelles in WT and AnkB <sup>-/-</sup> MEFs and these results are mentioned in the last paragraph of the subsection “AnkB directly recruits RabGAP1L to PI3P-positive organelles” and in the first paragraph of the subsection “AnkB promotes dissociation of Rab22A from PI3P-associated organelles through recruitment of RabGAP1L”.</p><p><italic>6) The Introduction and Discussion of the paper are inadequately referenced in regard of the existing literature on α5 integrin trafficking. Two labs in particular (Ivaska and Norman) have published numerous papers over of the last 15 years on this process, which elucidate a fair degree of the machinery responsible for controlling the endosomal trafficking of α5β1, and many other workers have complimented this and added other components to the machinery. For instance, Rab21, p120RasGAP (Ivaska), RCP (Norman, Ivaska), DGKα (Norman), ACAP1 (Hsu), WASH (Machesky/Norman), SNX17 (Cullen, Fassler) and EHD1 (Caplan) are known regulators of α5β1-integrin endosomal recycling, and Rab25 (Norman) and CLIC3 (Norman) control recycling of active α5β1-integrin from late endosomes/lysosomes. This fairly extensive body of literature should be adequately cited and discussed.</italic> </p><p>We thank reviewers for this detailed reminder about the existing literature dealing with α5-integrin trafficking. In the Introduction, we mainly focused on general issues related to endosomal trafficking and did not discuss specific cargo. The first mention of integrin trafficking occurred in the Results section: &quot;Identification of α5β1-integrin trafficking as an AnkB-dependent cargo&quot;. We have attempted to properly cite appropriate papers in Results and Discussion sections in this revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>7) The authors should define clearly what they mean by polarised delivery of α5β1 to the cell front. If one demonstrates (as they have) a greater number of vesicles leaving the front portion of the perinuclear region and proceeding toward the cell front than to the back, this is good, but it's not evidence to support Bretscher's postulate that integrins are disengaged from the substratum and the cell rear and then moved to the front in vesicles. As the paper currently stands, it reads a little like their evidence does support such a process.</italic> </p><p><italic>Also, they need to mention that there are papers demonstrating spatial restriction of α5β1 recycling at the cell front (Norman) and 'polarised delivery' specifically to the cell rear (Norman, Straube). All of these things are likely going on in various proportions at the same time, so the situation is far more complex than Mark Bretscher envisaged and this need careful discussion.</italic> </p><p>We regret confusion caused by term &quot;polarized delivery of α5-integrin&quot;. To clarify, we are specifically looking at the transport of perinuclear α5-integrins either to the front or rear of migrating cells. We do not intend to make any claim in regards to the origin of these integrins, regardless of whether they are internalized from the cell rear or the cell front. To make it clear to readers, we specifically changed &quot;polarized transport/delivery of α5-integrins&quot; to &quot;polarized transport/delivery of perinuclear α5-integrins&quot; in the text. Regarding a detailed discussion of Mark Bretscher’s model, we make a single reference to his 1989 and 1992 papers, which were written before contributions of Rabs were understood. We changed &quot;polarized delivery&quot; to &quot;polarized delivery from cytoplasmic compartments to the leading edge of migrating fibroblasts&quot; in the subsection “Identification of α5β1-integrin as an AnkB/RabGAP1L-dependent cargo”, where we cited his papers. His finding (Bretscher, 1989) actually stated internalization occurred all over the cell and did not specify a particular location: &quot;[…] This directed flow is produced by the endocytosis of lipids plus receptors randomly over the cell surface combined with their return to the cell surface at the leading edge […] the fibronectin receptor follows a similar course to other circulating receptors&quot;. We acknowledge that recent studies utilizing the photoactivation strategy (Zech et al., 2011; Dozynkiewicz et al., 2012) revealed that the situation of integrin trafficking/recycling is much more complex than the initial Brescher's model and feel that a detailed discussion of all of the subsequent papers on this topic is more appropriate for a review focused on integrins, which we cite (Caswell et al., 2009; Bridgewater et al., 2012; Arjonen et al., 2012; De Franceschi et al., 2015).</p></body></sub-article></article>
