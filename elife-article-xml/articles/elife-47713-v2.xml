(NLR) receptors detect pathogen effectors and initiate an immune response. Since their discovery, NLRs have been the focus of protein engineering to improve disease resistance. However, this approach has proven challenging, in part due to their narrow response specificity. Previously, we revealed the structural basis of pathogen recognition by the integrated heavy metal associated (HMA) domain of the rice NLR Pikp (Maqbool et al., 2015). Here, we used structure-guided engineering to expand the response profile of Pikp to variants of the rice blast pathogen effector AVR-Pik. A mutation located within an effector-binding interface of the integrated Pikp–HMA domain increased the binding affinity for AVR-Pik variants in vitro and in vivo. This translates to an expanded cell-death response to AVR-Pik variants previously unrecognized by Pikp in planta. The structures of the engineered Pikp–HMA in complex with AVR-Pik variants revealed the mechanism of expanded recognition. These results provide a proof-of-concept that protein engineering can improve the utility of plant NLR receptors where direct interaction between effectors and NLRs is established, particularly where this interaction occurs via integrated domains.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>plant disease resistance</kwd><kwd>protein engineering</kwd><kwd>NLR receptor</kwd><kwd>rice</kwd><kwd>rice blast</kwd><kwd>protein structure</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/J004553</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>S</surname><given-names>Kamoun</given-names></name><name><surname>MJ</surname><given-names>Banfield</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/P012574</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>S</surname><given-names>Kamoun</given-names></name><name><surname>MJ</surname><given-names>Banfield</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/M02198X</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>M</surname><given-names>Franceschetti</given-names></name><name><surname>S</surname><given-names>Kamoun</given-names></name><name><surname>MJ</surname><given-names>Banfield</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010663</institution-id><institution>H2020 European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>743165</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>S</surname><given-names>Kamoun</given-names></name><name><surname>MJ</surname><given-names>Banfield</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004034</institution-id><institution>John Innes Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>JC</surname><given-names>De la Concepcion</given-names></name><name><surname>M</surname><given-names>Franceschetti</given-names></name><name><surname>MJ</surname><given-names>Banfield</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000324</institution-id><institution>Gatsby Charitable Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kamoun</surname><given-names>Sophien</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>15H05779</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Terauchi</surname><given-names>Ryohei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Structure-led protein engineering can expand the effector recognition profile of plant intracellular NLR immune receptors, providing a proof-of-principle for the development of novel disease resistance mechanisms in plants.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Protein engineering offers opportunities to develop new or improved molecular recognition capabilities that have applications in basic research, health and agricultural settings. Protein resurfacing, where the properties of solvent-exposed regions are changed (often by mutation), has been used extensively in diverse areas from antibody engineering for clinical use to the production of more stable, soluble proteins for biotechnology applications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chapman and McNaughton, 2016</xref>).</p><p>Intracellular nucleotide binding, leucine-rich repeat (NLR) receptors are key components of plant innate immunity pathways. They recognize the presence or activity of virulence-associated, host-translocated pathogen effector proteins and initiate an immune response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kourelis and van der Hoorn, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cesari, 2018</xref>). Because they confer resistance to disease, plant NLRs are widely used in crop breeding programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dangl et al., 2013</xref>). However, the recognition spectra of plant NLRs tend to be very specific, and pathogens may delete detected effectors from their genome or evolve novel effector variants that are not detected by the NLRs to re-establish disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yoshida et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>The potential of engineering NLRs to overcome these limitations, or to detect new effector activities, is emerging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rodriguez-Moreno et al., 2017</xref>). Gain-of-function random mutagenesis has achieved some success in expanding the activation sensitivity or effector recognition profiles of NLRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Segretin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Giannakopoulou et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Harris et al., 2013</xref>). An alternative strategy, in which NLRs perceive protease effectors through their activity on engineered host proteins, can lead to expanded recognition profiles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carter et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Helm et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kim et al., 2016</xref>). When detailed knowledge of the direct binding interfaces between an effector and an NLR are known, there is potential for protein resurfacing to modify interactions and thereby impact immune signaling.</p><p>Plant NLRs are modular proteins that are defined by their nucleotide-binding (NB-ARC) and leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domains, but that also have either an N-terminal coiled-coil (CC) or a Toll/Interleukin-1/Resistance-protein (TIR) signaling domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Takken and Goverse, 2012</xref>). Many NLRs also contain non-canonical integrated domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kroj et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sarris et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bailey et al., 2018</xref>). Integrated domains are thought to be derived from ancestral virulence-associated effector targets that directly bind pathogen effectors (or host proteins; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fujisaki et al., 2017</xref>) or are modified by them, thereby initiating an immune response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cesari et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Le Roux et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Maqbool et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sarris et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">De la Concepcion et al., 2018</xref>). These domains present an exciting target for protein engineering approaches to improve NLR activities. NLRs containing integrated domains (often called the ‘sensor’) typically function in pairs, requiring a second genetically linked NLR (the ‘helper’) for immune signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Białas et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Eitas and Dangl, 2010</xref>).</p><p>Two rice NLR pairs, Pik and Pia, contain an integrated Heavy Metal Associated (HMA) domain in their sensor NLR that directly binds effectors from the rice blast pathogen <italic>Magnaporthe oryzae</italic> (also known as <italic>Pycularia oryzae</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Maqbool et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cesari et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ortiz et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Guo et al., 2018</xref>). The integrated HMA domain in the sensor NLR Pik-1 directly binds the effector AVR-Pik. Co-evolutionary dynamics has driven the emergence of polymorphic Pik-1 HMA domains and AVR-Pik effectors in natural populations, and these display differential disease-resistance phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Costanzo and Jia, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kanzaki et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yoshida et al., 2009</xref>). The Pikp NLR allele only responds to the effector variant AVR-PikD, but the Pikm allele responds to AVR-PikD, AVR-PikE, and AVR-PikA. These phenotypes can be recapitulated in the model plant <italic>Nicotiana benthamiana</italic> using a cell-death assay, and are underpinned by differences in effector–receptor binding interfaces that lead to different affinities in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Maqbool et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">De la Concepcion et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>We hypothesized that by combining naturally occurring favorable interactions observed across different interfaces, as defined in different Pik-HMA/AVR-Pik structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Maqbool et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">De la Concepcion et al., 2018</xref>), we could generate a Pik NLR with improved recognition profiles. Here, we graft an interface from Pikm onto Pikp by mutating two residues in Pikp (Asn261Lys, Lys262Glu), forming Pikp<sup>NK-KE</sup>. This single-site mutation strengthens the cell-death response in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> to AVR-PikD, and gains a Pikm-like response to AVR-PikE and AVR-PikA. We show that this gain-of-function phenotype correlates with increased binding affinity of the effectors by the Pikp<sup>NK-KE–</sup>HMA domain in vitro and in vivo, and demonstrate that this mutation results in a Pikm-like structure for Pikp<sup>NK-KE</sup> when in complex with AVR-Pik effectors. Finally, we confirm that the newly engineered interface is responsible for the expanded response of Pikp<sup>NK-KE</sup> by mutation of the effectors.</p><p>This study serves as a proof-of-concept for the use of protein resurfacing by targeted mutation to develop plant NLR immune receptors with new capabilities. In the future, such approaches have the potential to improve disease resistance in crops.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Structure-informed engineering expands Pikp-mediated effector recognition in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic></title><p>By comparing protein interfaces in the structures of Pikp-HMA and Pikm-HMA bound to different AVR-Pik effectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Maqbool et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">De la Concepcion et al., 2018</xref>), we hypothesized that we could engineer expanded effector recognition capabilities by point mutation of Pikp.

By contrast, in Pikm, where the position of the lysine is shifted one residue to the N-terminus, no looping-out is required to locate the lysine within the pocket (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A [right panel], B [right panel], C and D</xref>). In the Pikp<sup>NK-KE</sup> mutant, the position of this key lysine is shifted one residue to the N-terminus compared to that in the wild-type, so that it occupies the same position in the Pikp<sup>NK-KE</sup> sequence as in the Pikm sequence. In the crystal structures of Pikp-HMA<sup>NK-KE</sup> in complex with either AVR-PikD or AVR-PikE, we see that this region of the HMA adopts a Pikm-like conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A [middle panel], B [middle panel], C and D</xref>), with no looping-out of the preceding structure. This confirms that in making the Pikp<sup>NK-KE</sup> mutant, we have resurfaced Pikp to have a more robust, Pikm-like interface in this region.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.47713.020</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>The Pikp<sup>NK-KE</sup>-HMA mutant adopts a Pikm-like conformation at the effector-binding interface.</title><p>Schematic view of the different conformations adopted by Pikp-HMA, Pikp-HMA<sup>NK-KE</sup> and Pikm-HMA at interface 3 when in complex with AVR-PikD or AVR-PikE.

NLR-integrated domains are a particularly attractive target for protein engineering because they interact directly with pathogen effectors (or host effector targets). Further, where tested, their binding affinities in vitro correlate with in planta immunity phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Maqbool et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">De la Concepcion et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Guo et al., 2018</xref>), allowing biochemical and structural techniques to inform NLR design directly.</p><p>Here, we show that the recognition profile of the rice NLR Pikp can be expanded to include different AVR-Pik variants by engineering the binding interface between these proteins. This strengthens the hypothesis that tighter binding affinity between effectors and integrated HMA domains correlates with increased immune signaling in plants. This was previously shown for both natural alleles of Pik (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Maqbool et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">De la Concepcion et al., 2018</xref>) and for Pia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Guo et al., 2018</xref>), but is now also shown for an engineered NLR. We propose this may be a general model for integrated domains that directly bind effectors.</p><p>Natural variation in Pik NLRs has given rise to different effector recognition profiles, and contributions from different binding interfaces were suggested to underpin this phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">De la Concepcion et al., 2018</xref>). In particular, a more favorable interaction at one interface (interface 3) in Pikm, compared to that in Pikp, was concluded to have evolved to compensate for changes in binding at a different site (interface 2). Here, through mutation of residues in Pikp (forming Pikp<sup>NK-KE</sup>), we have combined favorable interfaces from Pikp and Pikm into a single protein. This has resulted in an expanded recognition phenotype for effector binding and response in planta. In vitro, the binding of Pikp<sup>NK-KE</sup>-HMA to effector variants is consistently higher than that of Pikm-HMA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). This is likely to be underpinned by differences in a cluster of key residues within interface 2 (spatially equivalent residues Val222, Lys228, and Glu230 in Pikp, and Ala223, Gln229, and Val231 in Pikm) that form more energetically favorable contacts, including water-mediated hydrogen bonds. However, despite a positive trend (which is significant in some cases), the levels of cell death mediated by Pikm and Pikp<sup>NK-KE</sup> in planta are comparable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplements 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">4</xref>).</p><p>Although the Pikp<sup>NK-KE</sup> mutant did not deliver a cell-death response in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> to the stealthy AVR-PikC effector variant, it did show a gain-of-binding in vitro, as well as weak binding in Y2H and in in planta co-IP. It is surprising that the gain-of-binding for AVR-PikC in vitro, unlike that for AVR-PikA, does not correlate directly with gain of in vivo interactions or cell-death response in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic>. We hypothesize that this gain-of-binding for AVR-PikC observed in vitro is not sufficiently robust, especially in the context of the full-length NLR, for binding or for triggering immune signaling. Nevertheless, this work sets the scene for future interface engineering experiments that may further improve the response profiles of Pik NLRs to currently unrecognized effector variants. It also suggests that future work should test the disease resistance profile of <italic>M. oryzae</italic> strains carrying the different effector variants in rice expressing the engineered receptor.</p><p>The integrated HMA domain in the NLR RGA5 (the sensor of the Pia NLR pair in rice) binds to <italic>M. oryzae</italic> effectors AVR1-CO39 and AVR-Pia via a different interface, and it has been suggested that these binding sites are mutually exclusive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Guo et al., 2018</xref>). This raises the possibility that an HMA domain could be engineered to bind and respond to multiple effectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Guo et al., 2018</xref>). Recently, the Pikp-HMA domain was shown to interact with AVR-Pia at the same interface as that used by the RGA5-HMA domain, and this probably underpins the partial resistance of rice plants to <italic>M. oryzae</italic> expressing AVR-Pia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Varden et al., 2019</xref>). This presents a starting point for the use of Pikp as a chassis for such studies.

For detection of complexes in planta, leaf tissue was collected 3 days post infiltration (dpi), frozen, and ground to fine powder in liquid nitrogen using a pestle and mortar. Leaf powder was mixed with two times weight/volume ice-cold extraction buffer (10% glycerol, 25 mM Tris [pH 7.5], 1 mM EDTA, 150 mM NaCl, 2% w/v PVPP, 10 mM DTT, 1x protease inhibitor cocktail [Sigma], 0.1% Tween 20 [Sigma]), centrifuged at 4,200 g/4°C for 20–30 min, and the supernatant was passed through a 0.45 μm Minisart syringe filter. The presence of each protein in the input was determined by SDS-PAGE and western blot. Pik-1 and AVR-Pik effectors were detected by probing the membrane with anti-FLAG M2 antibody (SIGMA) and anti c-Myc monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz), respectively. For immunoprecipitation, 1.5 ml of filtered plant extract was incubated with 30 μl of M2 anti-FLAG resin (Sigma) in a rotatory mixer at 4°C. After three hours, the resin was pelleted (800 g, 1 min) and the supernatant removed. The pellet was washed and resuspended in 1 ml of IP buffer (10% glycerol, 25 mM Tris [pH 7.5], 1 mM EDTA, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20 [Sigma]) and pelleted again by centrifugation as before. Washing steps were repeated five times. Finally, 30 μl of LDS Runblue sample buffer was added to the agarose and incubated for 10 min at 70°C. The resin was pelleted again, and the supernatant loaded onto SDS-PAGE gels prior to western blotting. Membranes were probed with anti-FLAG M2 (Sigma) and anti c-Myc (Santa Cruz) monoclonal antibodies.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title><italic>N. benthamiana</italic> cell-death assays</title><p><italic>A. tumefaciens</italic> GV3101 vectors carrying Pikp-1, Pikm-1, or Pikp-1<sup>NK-KE</sup> were resuspended in induction media (10 mM MES [pH 5.6], 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> and 150 µM acetosyringone) and mixed with Pikp-2 (or Pikm-2 in the Pikm cell-death assay), AVR-Pik effectors, and P19 at OD<sub>600</sub> 0.4, 0.4, 0.6 and 0.1, respectively.

Photos were taken using a Nikon D4 camera with a 60 mm macro lens, ISO set 1600 and exposure ~10 secs at F14. The filter was a Kodak Wratten No.8 and white balance was set to 6250 degrees Kelvin. Blak-Ray longwave (365 nm) B-100AP spot light lamps were moved around the subject during the exposure to give an even illumination. Images shown are representative of three independent experiments, with internal repeats. The cell death index used for scoring was as presented previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Maqbool et al., 2015</xref>). Dotplots were generated using R v3.4.3 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.r-project.org/">https://www.r-project.org/</ext-link>) and the graphic package ggplot2 (Wickham, H., 2009).

All individual data points are represented as dots.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Cell-death scoring: ion leakage</title><p>For ion-leakage quantification, plants were infiltrated with the relevant constructs on two different leaves. At 5 dpi, leaves were detached and two leaf discs with a diameter of 8 mm (one disc per leaf spot) were collected and floated in 1.5 mL of Milli-Q water. Conductivity (µS/cm) was measured immediately after transferring the leaf disc to water (time zero) using a LAQUAtwin EC-33 conductivity meter (Horiba UK Ltd). Leaf discs were then incubated for 6 h at room temperature with gentle shaking before measuring the final conductivity. The assay was carried out in six biological replicates with a total of 40 technical replicates (2 discs x 40 plants). Conductivity data for each sample were exported and plotted using R v3.4.3 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.r-project.org/">https://www.r-project.org/</ext-link>) and the function ggplot2 (Wickham, H., 2009).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Crystallization, data collection and structure solution</title><p>For crystallization, Pikp-HMA<sup>NK-KE</sup> in complex with AVR-PikD or AVR-PikE were concentrated following gel filtration. Sitting drop vapor diffusion crystallization trials were set up in 96 well plates, using an Oryx nano robot (Douglas Instruments, United Kingdom). Plates were incubated at 20°C, and crystals typically appeared after 24–48 hr. For data collection, all crystals were harvested from the Morpheus HT-96 screen (Molecular Dimensions), and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen.

Briefly, in this process all autofluorescence (cell-death) scores in samples under comparison were ranked, irrespective of sample. The mean ranks of the control and test sample were taken and a bootstrap process was begun on ranked test data, in which samples of equal size to the experiment were replaced and the mean rank calculated. After 1000 bootstrap samples, rank means were calculated, a distribution of the mean ranks was drawn and its 2.5 and 97.5 quantiles calculated. If the mean of the control data is outside of these boundaries, the control and test means were considered to be different. Quantitative data from ion-leakage (cell-death) and SPR assays were analyzed by preparing a linear mixed effects model of sample on ion leakage/SPR and post-hoc comparisons performed for sample contrasts using Tukey’s HSD method in the R package nlme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pinheiro and Bates, 2019</xref>) and in lsmeans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lenth, 2016</xref>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by the BBSRC (grants BB/J004553, BB/P012574, BB/M02198X), the ERC (proposal 743165), the John Innes Foundation, the Gatsby Charitable Foundation, and JSPS KAKENHI 15H05779.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Thorsten Nürnberger as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Detlef Weigel as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Engineering of plant NLR-type immune receptors for expanded effector recognition is an exciting and promising tool for future molecular breeding approaches. All reviewers agreed that this study provides a substantial step forward in our understanding on how to achieve this goal. While highly supportive of your work, the reviewers request some revisions, as listed below.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The quality of the Y2H data is not sufficient. Here, growth on triple or quadruple dropout medium supplemented with different 3AT concentrations that accentuate growth differences is required. Likewise, cell death phenotypes observed upon overexpression in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> require proper quantification and statistical evaluation.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This is a really nice and technically challenging complement to a number of papers of this laboratory. There is no doubt that it would make a nice contribution to <italic>eLife</italic>. My only concern is about quantification of cell death in this study. Here, the authors may resort to ion leakage measurements that are certainly better quantifiable than the cell death index chosen here.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The manuscript at hand introduces an engineered variant of the rice NLR protein Pikp, the design of which was inspired by another rice NLR named Pikm. The authors argue that this Pikp variant, named Pikp<sup>NK-KE</sup> binds the <italic>Magnaporthe oryzae</italic> effector variants AVR-PikA and AVR-PikE in addition to the cognate ligand AVR-PikD of wild-type Pikp. Binding of Pikp<sup>NK-KE</sup> to AVR-PikA and AVR-PikE was shown in various ways including yeast-two-hybrid assay (Y2H), cell death assay in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic>, co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) (the latter two using recombinant protein from <italic>E. coli</italic>, HMA domain only). In addition, the authors determined two crystal structures of the HMA domains of Pikp<sup>NK-KE</sup> in complex with AVR-PikD and of Pikp<sup>NK-KE</sup> in complex with AVR-PikE at 1.6 Å and 1.85 Å, respectively. The authors compare these crystal structures with previously published crystal structures of wild-type Pikp and Pikm bound to AVR-PikD and AVR-PikE. They conclude with using this structural information to develop effector variants that are not bound and unrecognized by the Pikp<sup>NK-KE</sup> receptor, to which end they used cell death assay, Y2H and Co-IP.</p><p>As few studies exist that succeeded at engineering NLRs with novel specificity, the article is highly relevant to scientist within the field of plant immunity and beyond. I believe the study can be helpful and serve as a template to scientists who have similar endeavors of designing novel immune receptors. The novelty of the resolved structures lies in the mechanistic insight into effector binding of an engineered NLR.</p><p>For those reasons, I recommend publication of the manuscript in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>However, major points need to be addressed before publication which are listed as follows:</p><p>1) Figure 2A and B: Why binding of AVR-PikC in case of Pikp<sup>NK-KE</sup>? Requires more substantial discussion with special focus on differences in yeast, tobacco and in vitro.</p><p>2) Figure 2—figure supplement 3: Discuss (by using crystal structure) why binding of pHMA<sup>NK-KE</sup> is consistently higher than mHMA.</p><p>3) Figure 4B: Control missing. Why not show mutation of N46 in AVR-PikE and corresponding residue in AVR-PikA?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>This article describes structure-guided engineering of the Pikp NLR immune receptor from rice that recognizes the effector AVR-PikD from the blast fungus <italic>Magnaporthe oryzae</italic>. Engineering of the integrated HMA decoy domain of Pikm1 domain was performed to expand its recognition spectrum to the AVR-Pik allelic variants AVR-PikA and AVR-PikE. For this, the work builds on previous work on structural and functional characterization of the HMA domains of Pikm1 and PikP1.</p><p>The manuscript is very interesting, extremely well written and documented and provides a first example of structure guided engineering of an NLR immune receptor for extended recognition specificity. However, several weaknesses require revision:</p><p>- An important drawback of the study is that there is no analysis of the engineered Pikp-1<sup>NK-KE</sup> mutant in rice plants to test whether it confers indeed an extended recognition specificity and resistance spectrum in transgenic rice.</p><p>- Another important weakness are the Yeast two hybrid data that are not convincing (cf specific comments).</p><p>- The <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> &quot;cell death&quot; assay should be improved by measuring fluorescence intensity on infiltrated spots and performing statistical analysis on these quantitative results.</p><p>- co-IP experiments with the isolated HMA domain (wt and mutant) would strengthen the study (c.f. specific comments).</p><p>Specific Comments:</p><p>Results and data, images and graphs &quot;monitoring cell death in a well-established <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> assay&quot;: all images intended to show <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> cell death show autofluorescence, not cell death. Graphs are also based on autofluorescence induction and not cell death. Previous publications suggest that the cell death response is rather weak. Description of the experiments should be more accurate here and throughout the text. In addition, I do not understand why auto fluorescence is not quantified using image analysis software but interpreted visually (with a 6 level scoring system). Quantitative measurements combined with robust statistical analysis should be performed rather than scoring and qualitative interpretation of results from scoring. Differences between AVRPik-C and AVRPik-A on Pikp-1<sup>NK-KE</sup> on the photo in Figure 1B seems quite subtle in particular if one assumes that this is among the most differential images that were obtained.</p><p>Figure 1—figure supplement 2 -Statistical test to conclude on difference is missing. Unclear what is meant by &quot;qualitatively stronger response&quot;.</p><p>Figure 2A and 4B – Y2H experiments provide only weak support for the author's claims (in certain cases no support at all): growth differences between the different yeast clones are, in most cases, rather subtle and often don’t correlate with the activity and in vitro binding data. E.g. in Figure 2A, Pikp-HMA/ARVPikD and Pikp-HMA/AVR-PikA grow identically and Pikp-HMA/AVR-PikE even grow better. Pikp-HMA/AVR-PikE growth is stronger than Pikp-HMA NK/KE/AVR-PikE. In Figure 4B, all clone seem to grow the same. Differences in color are not always easy to appreciate and rely on subjective interpretation. I would like to see growth on triple or quadruple dropout medium supplemented with different 3AT concentrations that accentuate growth differences and allow to unambiguously differentiate between growth strength of different yeast clones. If authors prefer to rely on β-Galactosidase activity, they should provide quantitative data from enzyme assays. Also apparent inconsistencies between Y2H and SPR or <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> cell death assays should be addressed in the text. For Pikp-HMA<sup>NK/KE</sup>, a negative control (unrelated effector) should be provided since it seems to interact with all AVR-Pik constructs that were tested including some that are expected to not interact or to interact only very weakly (e.g. AVRPikD-H46E). It should be indicated on the figure that HMAs are fused to BD and Avr's to AD.</p><p>Figure 2C and Figure 4C: It would be interesting to see co-IP experiments with the isolated HMA domain (wt and mutant) to compare, on the one hand, to the other experiments with the isolated HMA domain (SPR and Y2H) and on the other to full-length Pikp1 variants.</p><p>Figure 2B and Figure 2—figure supplements 2 and 3 – SPR experiments: Binding of C is similar to binding of A and E. Statistical analysis should be performed to determine if there are differences. Why do authors not calculate affinities from SPR and discuss differences in affinities? One question to address would be, can the weak differences in affinity between C and A (or E) explain recognition specificity?</p><p>Figure 3—figure supplement 1: It looks to me as if the QtPISA interaction radar for Pikp-HMA<sup>NK/KE</sup>/AVR-PikE does not support that binding is biologically relevant. Area is highly similar to the one for Pikp-HMA/AVR-PikE. Please comment on this point.</p><p>Introduction, fourth paragraph: recognition does not necessarily rely on binding.

We screened different concentrations from 0.2µg/ml to 1µg/ml (0.2 µg/ml being the standard concentration in the Matchmaker protocol), our new figures show results for Aureobasidin A concentrations of 0.2, 0.4 and 0.8µg/ml. We hope you agree that this has improved the quality of the Y2H data (making it more robust), and that the results are clearer. Further, we have added a negative control, AVR-Pii, an unrelated effector from <italic>M. oryzae</italic>.</p><p>For the cell death assays, we do not think it appropriate to quantify the autofluorescence from the images as during acquisition the UV lamp is moved on a gantry and uniform light distribution is not guaranteed to allow this level of accuracy (we have added details to the Materials and methods about image acquisition). Therefore, we have chosen to develop the ion leakage assay to quantify cell death as an additional experiment. This has the added advantage of being another independent measure of immunity-related readouts in this study. As can be seen, the ion leakage assay compliments the scoring from autofluorescence very well. This includes a comparison between Pikp and Pikm that was the subject of our previous manuscript published in Nature Plants (direct comparison not included here, although is available).</p><p>Regarding statistics, as the data from the cell death assays is categorical, we use estimation methods to highlight differences. For the quantitative data (ion leakage assays and SPR binding data), we have used statistical analysis and Tukey’s HSD, and adjusted the text of the manuscript to take the results into account where necessary. In recognition of his contribution to this part of the manuscript, we have added an author, Dan MacLean, to the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>This is a really nice and technically challenging complement to a number of papers of this laboratory.
