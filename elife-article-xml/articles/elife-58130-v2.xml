Moreover, a <italic>rsc1</italic>Δ mutation, but not <italic>rsc2</italic>Δ, is lethal with histone mutations that confer partial unwrapping. Rsc1/2 isoforms both cooperate with the DNA-binding proteins Rsc3/30 and the HMG protein, Hmo1, to remodel partially-unwrapped nucleosomes, but show differential reliance on these factors. Notably, genetic impairment of these factors strongly reduces the expression of genes with wide nucleosome-deficient regions (e.g., ribosomal protein genes), known to harbor partially-unwrapped nucleosomes. Taken together, Rsc1/2 isoforms are specialized through composition and interactions to manage and remodel partially-unwrapped nucleosomes.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>chromatin remodeling</kwd><kwd>Rsc1</kwd><kwd>Rsc2</kwd><kwd>nucleosome</kwd><kwd>Hmo1</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Brad Cairns Investigator</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schlichter</surname><given-names>Alisha</given-names></name><name><surname>Kasten</surname><given-names>Margaret M</given-names></name><name><surname>Cairns</surname><given-names>Bradley R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CA042014</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Parnell</surname><given-names>Timothy J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A SWI/SNF-family chromatin remodeling subcomplex from yeast is identified (RSC1) that is specialized to slide nucleosomes residing on DNA sequences that confer partial nucleosome unwrapping, with assistance from accessory factors.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Nucleosomes regulate transcription in diverse ways and can either block or attract transcriptional regulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Workman and Kingston, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Iyer, 2012</xref>). At promoters, nucleosome positioning and/or occupancy plays a central role in regulating transcription factor binding, with transitions in nucleosome positioning typically accompanying activation. SWI/SNF-family ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes (CRCs) have evolved to conduct nucleosome sliding and ejection, and enable transcription factor access to DNA. These CRCs are complex in both composition and mechanism; they utilize a catalytic ATPase to translocate DNA around nucleosomes to conduct nucleosome sliding and eviction, and contain an additional set of proteins to help target and regulate each complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Clapier and Cairns, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lorch and Kornberg, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Narlikar et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>The SWI/SNF-family remodeler, RSC (Remodels the Structure of Chromatin), from the budding yeast <italic>S. cerevisiae,</italic> is both essential and abundant, and has long served as a prototype CRC. RSC complex (like others in the SWI/SNF family) is found in more than one compositional subtype, and contains either Rsc1 or its highly-related paralog, Rsc2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cairns et al., 1999</xref>). Rsc1 and Rsc2 are orthologs of the mammalian polybromo, as both contain multiple bromodomains, a bromodomain-adjacent homology (BAH) domain, and a DNA binding motif (AT Hook or HMG box). Additional RSC compositional variation has been suggested, involving the association of two additional paralogous RSC subunits, Rsc3 and Rsc30 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Campsteijn et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chambers et al., 2012</xref>), which are zinc cluster DNA-binding proteins with affinity for GC-rich sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Badis et al., 2008</xref>). <italic>RSC1</italic> and <italic>RSC2</italic> are redundant for viability (<italic>rsc1</italic>Δ <italic>rsc2</italic>Δ mutants are inviable), however loss of only one confers mild but dissimilar phenotypes, suggesting overlapping essential functions alongside limited unique functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baetz et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chambers et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cairns et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bungard et al., 2004</xref>). To gain further understanding regarding the roles of RSC1 and RSC2 complexes, we characterized Rsc1- and Rsc2-containing complexes through purification and in vitro biochemical assays, alongside in vivo genetic and genomic characterization. Both approaches converged to reveal an interplay of functional roles for Rsc1/2, Rsc3/30 and a partner high-mobility group (HMG) domain protein, Hmo1, in managing partially-unwrapped nucleosomes.</p><p>Partially-unwrapped nucleosomes are defined here as those in which the DNA has released (or displays a tendency to release) from the histone octamer at one or both of the symmetric locations where DNA enters/exits the nucleosome, while the central DNA gyre maintains association with the octamer. DNA sequences differ in their affinity for histone octamers and propensity to form nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anderson et al., 2002</xref>); stiff homopolymer AT tracts deter nucleosome formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Segal and Widom, 2009</xref>) whereas those with short (5 bp) alternating AT and GC tracts more easily adopt nucleosomal curvature, providing a lower cost in energy for nucleosome formation. The commonly used ‘601’ nucleosome positioning sequence is synthetic, was selected for high affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lowary and Widom, 1998</xref>), and displays a 5 bp AT/GC alternating pattern. In contrast, the <italic>5S</italic> rRNA gene sequence is naturally occurring and of lesser affinity (comparable to genome averages) in comparison to 601 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Polach and Widom, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dong et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Li and Widom, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Zhou et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mauney et al., 2018</xref>). Here, there is some debate whether the entry/exit DNA ends of the <italic>5S</italic> positioning sequence displays higher or lower rates of detachment from the octamer than the 601 sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">North et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Zhou et al., 2019</xref>). However, recent work using small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) with salt titration to compare the unwrapping dynamics of the <italic>5S</italic> and 601 nucleosomes demonstrates that the <italic>5S</italic> nucleosome unwraps more rapidly and at lower salt concentrations than the 601 nucleosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mauney et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Prior work has revealed the presence of partially-unwrapped ‘fragile’ nucleosomes at promoters with an especially wide nucleosome deficient region (NDR), and co-incidence of RSC, including at the majority of ribosomal protein genes (RPGs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kubik et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brahma and Henikoff, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Knight et al., 2014</xref>). Indeed, in silico size fractionation of RSC-bound nucleosomes provides evidence that RSC occupies wrapped nucleosomes at the +1 and −1 promoter positions, as well as a partially-unwrapped nucleosome interposed between those two displaying lower/fractional occupancy – the basis for the appearance of a large NDR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brahma and Henikoff, 2019</xref>). As partially-unwrapped nucleosomes are likely conformationally diverse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bilokapic et al., 2018</xref>), RSC may have evolved to both recognize and remodel these nucleosomes. Prior work with the Rsc2-containing form of RSC revealed altered remodeling outcomes for partially-unwrapped (H3 R40A) nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Somers and Owen-Hughes, 2009</xref>), further questioning whether an alternative form of RSC might better manage them. RSC mobilization of partially-unwrapped nucleosomes may allow sets of transcription factors regulated access to a section of DNA without keeping the region constitutively nucleosome-free – which may provide regulatory benefits and help maintain genome stability (see Discussion). Here, we provide multiple lines of evidence that a set of proteins in RSC (Rsc1, Rsc3/30), and interacting with RSC (Hmo1), cooperate to help remodel partially-unwrapped nucleosomes in vitro and in vivo.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The Rsc3/30 heterodimer preferentially associates with the RSC1 complex via the CT2 domain</title><p>Rsc1 and Rsc2 are highly similar proteins (45% identical, 62% similar), with high homology present in the bromodomains, BAH domain, and the CT1 region – whereas the CT2 region, which is required for Rsc1 or Rsc2 assembly into RSC, is considerably more divergent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cairns et al., 1999</xref>). We began by exploring whether these Rsc1- or Rsc2-containing subtypes differ in composition, beyond Rsc1/2 themselves. To determine, we purified RSC sub-complexes using a TAP tag (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Puig et al., 2001</xref>) on either Rsc1 or Rsc2, which revealed Rsc3/30 at apparent stoichiometric levels in the Rsc1-containing complex, but substoichiometric levels in the Rsc2-containing complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chambers et al., 2012</xref>).

Here, co-immunoprecipitation revealed strong Rsc3 association with Rsc1, and with Rsc2 derivatives only if they contained the CT2 region of Rsc1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Conversely, strong Rsc3 association with Rsc1 was lost when Rsc1 contained the CT2 region of Rsc2. Similar approaches involving internal Rsc1/2 deletions and additional swap positions provided further refinement, narrowing the region on Rsc1 responsible for strong Rsc3/30 association to residues 617–777 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A–D</xref>). Several structures of RSC-nucleosome complexes have recently been published (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wagner et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Ye et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Patel et al., 2019</xref>). However, as Rsc1, Rsc2, Rsc3, and Rsc30 are within the flexible regions, these structures contain only partial models (or lack density/models). While the Rsc1-Rsc3/30 interaction has not been resolved structurally, crosslinks were observed between Rsc2 CT2 and Rsc3/30 heterodimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wagner et al., 2020</xref>), an interaction we find to be much stronger in Rsc1.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>The RSC1 complex slides <italic>5S</italic> nucleosomes better than the RSC2 complex</title><p>Having defined and isolated the four main RSC subtypes (RSC1 or RSC2, +/- Rsc3/30; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), we then tested for differences in ATPase activity, and remodeling efficiency, by examining nucleosomes of typical wrapping/affinity, such as those formed with the sea urchin <italic>5S</italic> DNA nucleosome positioning sequence (NPS) and recombinant yeast histones. First, all four RSC complexes displayed similar DNA-dependent ATPase activities in typical <italic>V</italic><sub>max</sub> determinations with plasmid DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The activity of one complex, RSC1-3/30, plateaued earlier than the other RSC complexes, but otherwise the two complexes behaved similarly. However, major differences were observed with <italic>5S</italic> nucleosomes – RSC1 complex displayed much greater sliding activity than RSC2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> for quantification).

This could result from an altered position of the octamer along the DNA, from the partial unwrapping of DNA from the octamer, or possibly from the creation of a hexasome during the remodeling reaction (which would create a more ‘open’ and unwrapped structure). To determine whether the slower-migrating RSC remodeled product was the result of H2A/H2B dimer loss from the nucleosome, we assembled 174 bp <italic>5S</italic> nucleosomes using yeast octamers that were fluorescently labeled with Oregon Green (OG) on H2A (Q114C) and conducted sliding assays with RSC1-3/30 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A</xref>). The ratio of H2A to DNA was calculated for both the ‘start’ and ‘slid’ bands at each time point, normalized to the starting nucleosomal band (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3B</xref>). Here, the ‘slid’ band maintained a dimer to DNA ratio similar to the starting nucleosome, rather than that predicted for a hexasome or tetrasome, supporting the identity of the slower-migrating band being an intact nucleosome. We will, therefore, refer to this band on the native gel as the ‘slid’ nucleosome position.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title><italic>rsc1</italic>Δ mutation is lethal in combination with histone mutations that confer partial unwrapping</title><p>In principle, a variety of factors might underlie better relative remodeling by RSC1 complexes on <italic>5S</italic> nucleosomes. To provide insight into Rsc1/2 differences and to help guide further in vitro approaches, we conducted unbiased genetic screens to identify histone mutations that are selectively lethal with <italic>rsc1</italic>Δ or <italic>rsc2</italic>Δ mutations. Here, we utilized an alanine scanning approach in which each of the histone residues is separately mutated to alanine. To implement, we created <italic>rsc1</italic>Δ or <italic>rsc2</italic>Δ deletions (separately) within a ‘histone shuffle’ strain (<italic>rsc1</italic>Δ or <italic>rsc2</italic>Δ<italic>, h3-h4</italic>Δ [<italic>H3-H4.URA3</italic>]) and combined those with a library encoding all viable histone H3-H4 alanine substitutions on <italic>TRP1</italic>-marked plasmids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nakanishi et al., 2008</xref>). We then assessed viability following forced loss of the wild-type <italic>H3-H4</italic> plasmid on 5FOA-containing medium. Histone mutations that are lethal with both <italic>rsc1</italic>Δ and <italic>rsc2</italic>Δ, or lethal uniquely with <italic>rsc2</italic>Δ, were found distributed throughout the nucleosome. In striking contrast, those mutations that were lethal specifically with <italic>rsc1</italic>Δ mapped exclusively within the H3 αN helix region – the position where DNA enters/exits the nucleosome (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–B</xref>). Furthermore, the specific H3 αN helix mutations obtained in our screen overlap strongly with those reported to increase partial unwrapping using FRET formats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ferreira et al., 2007</xref>), whereas alanine substitutions that did not show a phenotype (P43A, E50A, K56A) had little effect on FRET/unwrapping (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). Given the results from the H3-H4 screen, we then performed a screen combining <italic>rsc1</italic>Δ or <italic>rsc2</italic>Δ with H2A-H2B mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nakanishi et al., 2008</xref>). In keeping with the results above, we find <italic>rsc1</italic>Δ-specific synthetic lethality primarily with mutations in the H2A C-terminus which interact with the H3 αN helix, as well as with specific histone-DNA contacts (H2A R78 and H2A R30; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Taken together, our genetic results, which encompass the entire nucleosome, strongly suggest that synthetic lethality in <italic>rsc1</italic>∆ strains is due to decreased ability of RSC2 complexes to remodel partially-unwrapped nucleosomes relative to RSC1 complexes.</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Summary of Histone H3-H4 screen with <italic>rsc1</italic>∆ and <italic>rsc2</italic>∆.</title><p>Library of <italic>TRP1</italic>-marked plasmids containing H3-H4 residues mutated to alanine were transformed into <italic>h3-h4</italic>Δ [<italic>H3-H4.URA3</italic>] (YBC1939), <italic>rsc1</italic>Δ <italic>h3-h4</italic>Δ [<italic>H3-H4.URA3</italic>] (YBC2090) or <italic>rsc2</italic>Δ <italic>h3-h4</italic>Δ [<italic>H3-H4.URA3</italic>] (YBC3040), and spotted to SC-TRP, or SC-TRP + 5FOA to force the loss of the WT histone plasmid and test for synthetic lethality.

First, we tested whether the CT2 domain of Rsc1, which interacts better with Rsc3/30 than its counterpart in Rsc2, could confer growth when placed within a Rsc2 derivative. Here, growth was clearly restored to <italic>rsc1</italic>Δ H3 G44A and <italic>rsc1</italic>Δ H3 R40A combinations with a plasmid encoding Rsc1 or Rsc2 bearing the Rsc1 CT2, but not with Rsc2 or Rsc1 bearing the Rsc2 CT2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Additional domain swap experiments localize this complementation to the Rsc3/30 association region in Rsc1 (aa 617–777) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>). As a complementary approach, we tested for <italic>RSC3</italic> or <italic>RSC30</italic> high-copy plasmid suppression.

Taken together, improving the association/functionality of Rsc3/30 suppresses phenotypes associated with αN helix histone mutations – further linking Rsc1/2 and Rsc3/30 to partial nucleosome unwrapping.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Rsc1/2 differences are largely independent of bromodomain-histone interactions</title><p>We then tested the alternative hypothesis that the bromodomains of Rsc1/2 might interact differently with the main acetylated histone residue withinthe αN helix, H3 K56. However, the H3 K56A mutation was not lethal in combination with either <italic>rsc1</italic>Δ or <italic>rsc2</italic>Δ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). We then further tested H3 K56Q, which mimics the acetylated form. The K56Q mutation confers synthetic lethality when combined with <italic>rsc1</italic>Δ, but not with <italic>rsc2</italic>Δ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Furthermore, domain swaps involving the highly homologous bromodomains and BAH domains between Rsc1 and Rsc2 did not confer phenotypic differences, nor did these swaps alter the synthetic lethality of <italic>rsc1</italic>Δ with histone αN helix mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Notably, H3 K56A has little effect on DNA unwrapping, whereas K56Q promotes unwrapping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ferreira et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Masumoto et al., 2005</xref>) – and is lethal with <italic>rsc1</italic>Δ, further supporting an unwrapping function as being responsible for the phenotype. Thus, the lethality with <italic>rsc1</italic>Δ does not appear linked to bromodomains or histone acetylation, in agreement with findings that H3K56 acetylation does not enhance RSC binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Neumann et al., 2009</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>RSC2 complexes are deficient in remodeling partially-unwrapped nucleosomes</title><p>Our genetic results prompted the examination of sliding by the RSC1 and RSC2 complexes on <italic>5S</italic> nucleosomes bearing a mutation (e.g., H3 R40A) predicted to confer partial unwrapping. Although sliding of nucleosomes bearing H3 R40A by either form of RSC is reduced relative to wild-type (WT) <italic>5S</italic> nucleosomes, RSC1 complexes were markedly more active than RSC2 complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref> for quantification), reinforcing the difference between RSC1 and RSC2. Additionally, both RSC1 and RSC2 complexes bind H3 αN helix mutant <italic>5S</italic> nucleosomes similarly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>), demonstrating that initial nucleosome binding is not inhibited by this octamer mutation, suggesting downstream remodeling activity as the affected step. To confirm and better define the extent of partial unwrapping observed on our 174 bp <italic>5S</italic> nucleosome with yeast octamers, we conducted ExoIII-S1 nuclease mapping (which removes DNA that is either outside of, or not well wrapped in a nucleosome; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Flaus, 2011</xref>), and combined this with a high-throughput paired-end sequencing approach to define the endpoints and proportion of the nuclease-protected species. We found WT 174 bp <italic>5S</italic> yeast nucleosomes display a fully-wrapped side (position 158), and a side of partial unwrapping, in agreement with asymmetric <italic>5S</italic> nucleosome unwrapping previously shown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Winogradoff and Aksimentiev, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen et al., 2014</xref>). Here, WT nucleosomes displayed a much higher proportion of largely-wrapped species (≥135 bp) than did H3 R40A nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5</xref>). Since RSC2 is more deficient than RSC1 in repositioning H3 R40A nucleosomes, the mapping supports the hypothesis that RSC1 complexes manage partially-unwrapped nucleosomes better than RSC2 complexes. We note that H3 R40A <italic>5S</italic> nucleosomes are likely to have a distinct conformation that is not distinguished in our nuclease protection assay, since remodeling by both RSC1 and (more so) by RSC2 complexes is inhibited by the H3 αN helix mutation (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref> with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). These mutant octamers may enforce a greater degree of openness or distance between the <italic>5S</italic> DNA ends, as demonstrated previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ferreira et al., 2007</xref>), and thereby inhibit RSC activity (perhaps the transition of binding to DNA translocation, see Discussion) – a nucleosome perturbation better managed by RSC1 complexes.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>RSC cooperates with Hmo1 to remodel partially-unwrapped nucleosomes</title><p>Hmo1 is an HMGB family protein that stabilizes fragile/partially-unwrapped nucleosomes, particularly at rRNA and ribosomal protein gene promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hall et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Panday and Grove, 2017</xref>). Unlike other HMGB proteins which have an acidic CTD that promotes bending and nucleosome destabilization, Hmo1 is unique in containing a basic lysine rich C-terminal extension, and has been shown to stabilize chromatin and perform the functions of a linker histone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Panday and Grove, 2016</xref>). Hmo1 is proposed to bind near the nucleosome dyad and use its basic extension to bind linker DNA and prevent bending (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Panday and Grove, 2017</xref>), which may also improve wrapping and thus cooperate with RSC1 or RSC2 to promote remodeling.

However, possible issues of sensitivity with earlier data combined with the ability to perform more advanced approaches and analyses prompted ChIP-seq experiments to reveal possible differences. Recent examination of Sth1/RSC occupancy by the ‘cut and run’ MNase approach (which would have superimposed and not distinguished between Rsc1 and Rsc2 occupancy) revealed general enrichment for RSC complexes at many +1 and −1 nucleosomes, as well as high enrichment of RSC within the NDR of genes with very wide NDRs (e.g., ribosomal protein genes). Notably, these wide NDR regions/promoters have been shown to contain RSC bound to partially-unwrapped nucleosomes, rather than the complete lack of nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brahma and Henikoff, 2019</xref>).

Indeed, the high fractional occupancy of Pol III complexes likely underlies the lack of Hmo1 at tDNAs, as Pol III factors would likely compete with Hmo1 for DNA binding and can remove nucleosomes during transcription.

This spectrum can undergo selection to create regions where nucleosome formation, positioning, and/or turnover is favored or disfavored, properties which can be utilized at promoters and enhancers to help regulate transcription factor binding, transcription, and ultimately fitness. These biophysical properties work in concert (and sometimes in opposition) with the action of chromatin remodelers, which utilize ATP to move nucleosomes to either favored or disfavored positions, and to eject nucleosomes to provide regulated access of transcription factors to DNA. The commonness in yeast of stiff/disfavored DNA sequences at proximal promoters, juxtaposed to bendable/favorable sequences at the −1 and +1 positions (especially at constitutive or highly transcribed genes), raises the possibility that chromatin remodelers may have undergone specialization to manage the remodeling of both fully wrapped and partially-unwrapped nucleosomes.</p><p>We begin by briefly discussing prior studies that address the extent of partial unwrapping of <italic>5S</italic> or 601 DNA sequences. It has been established that the 601 sequence displays higher overall affinity for the histone octamer than does the <italic>5S</italic> sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Thåström et al., 1999</xref>).

It is worth noting, this work inserted a LexA binding sequence into both the <italic>5S</italic> and 601 sequences (by replacing the existing sequence) which involves the region that unwraps from the octamer. Notably, a set of subsequent studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mauney et al., 2018</xref>) used small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) to compare the native/unaltered sea urchin <italic>5S</italic> to 601 nucleosomes, which showed that the <italic>5S</italic> sequence unwraps more rapidly and at lower salt concentrations than does 601.</p><p>Here, we provide several lines of evidence that the RSC1 complex can slide partially-unwrapped nucleosomes better than its paralog, the RSC2 complex. Furthermore, as RSC is assisted by additional proteins (e.g., Hmo1) that augment this function in vivo, RSC can be thought of as two functional entities: ‘Rsc2 with Hmo1’ and ‘Rsc1 with Rsc3-30’, with strong phenotypes only observed when both entities are impaired (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). First, we find that RSC1 acts more efficiently on <italic>5S</italic> nucleosomes, and retains activity on nucleosomes bearing H3 R40A, a mutation that favors unwrapping, whereas RSC2 is relatively impaired. Second, an unbiased genetic screen revealed synthetic lethality with <italic>rsc1</italic>Δ αN helix combinations, but not <italic>rsc2</italic>Δ αN helix combinations, strongly suggesting that the RSC2 complex has more difficulty remodeling partially-unwrapped nucleosomes. Third, Hmo1 stabilizes nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Panday and Grove, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Panday and Grove, 2017</xref>), and we observe synthetic phenotypes with <italic>rsc1</italic>Δ <italic>hmo1</italic>Δ mutants, but not with <italic>rsc2</italic>Δ <italic>hmo1</italic>Δ mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), suggesting that Rsc2 relies much more on Hmo1 for functional cooperativity than does Rsc1. This result is paralleled in our remodeling experiments, which show a more pronounced rescue of <italic>5S</italic> nucleosome sliding by RSC2 complexes than RSC1 complexes with recombinant Hmo1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). We note that as nucleosome binding affinity is very similar between RSC1 and RSC2 complexes, the defect/challenge in remodeling with the RSC2 complex may involve a step downstream of binding, perhaps involving the ability of the complex to commit to the initiation of DNA translocation, which may be sensitive to the conformation of the nucleosome. Alternatively, nucleosome conformation/wrapping may impact the efficiency of DNA translocation – termed ‘coupling’ – which involves the probability of each ATP hydrolysis resulting in 1 bp of productive DNA translocation, a property known to be regulated in RSC complex by the actin-related proteins, Arp7 and Arp9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Clapier et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Szerlong et al., 2008</xref>). Finally, we emphasize that partially-unwrapped nucleosomes are not preferred by RSC1 complex over wrapped nucleosomes; RSC1 simply manages partially-unwrapped nucleosomes better than does RSC2 complex.</p><p>Initially, it may seem counter-intuitive for partial unwrapping of a nucleosome to impede rather than enhance RSC remodeling. However, we note that partial unwrapping is not an intermediate to full unwrapping by CRCs – as full unwrapping followed by full octamer re-wrapping is not the mechanism of nucleosome sliding. Therefore, a partially-unwrapped nucleosome is not necessarily a remodeling intermediate, and therefore not necessarily stimulatory. Instead, we suggest that sliding involves a 1 bp/ATP DNA translocation mechanism imposed on a fully wrapped, or partially-wrapped nucleosome. Here, we suggest that partial unwrapping results in a nucleosome conformation that can indeed be encountered/bound by RSC1/2 complexes, but resists transition to the DNA translocation phase of remodeling – with RSC2 complexes less able to conduct this transition than RSC1 complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). A second related model would be that RSC1 complex might better induce or stabilize a wrapped nucleosome conformation that is more conducive to initiating or continuing remodeling.</p><p>Above, we show that the product of remodeling (using <italic>5S</italic> nucleosomes formed with yeast octamers) migrates more slowly than does the initial substrate, and (by using Oregon Green-labeled H2A) that the product is not a hexasome or tetrasome involving H2A-H2B dimer loss. Nucleosome migration is determined by both the octamer position along the DNA (center vs end-positioned), and the overall shape of the octamer-DNA complex, including the extent to which the product/slid nucleosome is wrapped – as partial unwrapping and an ‘open’ conformation would be predicted to result in a slower migrating species through a native gel, just as a more ‘compact’ conformation results in a faster migrating species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chakravarthy et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>The mammalian polybromo protein (PBRM1) helps define the PBAF sub-complex of mammalian SWI/SNF complex, and is similar in domain composition to the combination of Rsc1/2 and the Rsc4 protein (which contains multiple bromodomains). PBRM1 also contains an HMG domain, which is notably absent in the Rsc1, 2, and 4 combination of domains. Here, we speculate that the Hmo1 protein and the HMG domain of PBRM1 may have functional similarities in managing DNA wrapping, which can be tested in future work.</p><p>RSC contains two proteins with affinity for GC-rich sequences: the paralogs Rsc3 and Rsc30. Here, we reveal a higher avidity of the Rsc3/30 module for the RSC1 complex, localize the region of interaction of Rsc3/30 with Rsc1/2 to the beginning of the CT2 domain, and provide genetic evidence that the preferred interaction of Rsc3/30 with Rsc1 has functional consequences. A current curiosity is the observation – true for both Rsc1 and Rsc2 complexes – that the presence of Rsc3/30 moderately inhibits remodeling, while the genetics supports a positive role for Rsc3/30 in assisting Rsc1/2 function. One obvious role for Rsc3/30 is in targeting RSC to GC-rich promoter sequences such as ribosomal protein genes, which likely underlies the essential nature of Rsc3/30 function. Here, future work may explore whether Rsc3/30 serve a regulatory role in the remodeling reaction, with their modest attenuation function relieved in the proper regulatory contexts of DNA sequence (e.g., GC richness) and protein composition (e.g., Hmo1, others) to help confer environmental sensing and properly regulate RPGs.</p><p>In favorable growth conditions, approximately 50% of the transcriptional effort of RNA Pol II is directed at RPGs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Warner, 1999</xref>). Our work supports and greatly extends the prior work of others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Knight et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hepp et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wade et al., 2004</xref>) that <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> has evolved many ways to ‘poise’ chromatin at RPG promoters in a relatively ‘open and ready’ format. These promoters have evolved to be less favorable to nucleosomes by bearing regions of ‘stiff’ AT-rich DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Segal and Widom, 2009</xref>) (note: Rsc1/2 each bear an AT hook), are punctuated by GC-rich DNA (known Rsc3/30 binding sites), and use histone acetylation (e.g., H3 K56ac) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Neumann et al., 2009</xref>), Hmo1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hall et al., 2006</xref>), DNA-binding general regulatory factors (e.g., Rap1, Abf1) and chromatin remodeling complexes such as RSC and SWI/SNF complex – that together help keep these regions nucleosome deficient and partially-unwrapped (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kubik et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hepp et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brahma and Henikoff, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Reja et al., 2015</xref>). While RSC1 and RSC2 complexes appear largely redundant at most genes, and can both be assisted at RPG promoters by Hmo1, our work supports the notion that the RSC1 complex, through its ability to better manage partially-unwrapped nucleosomes and preferential association with Rsc3/30, has become specialized to help perform this role (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). This combination of specialization and partial redundancy provides this system the needed robustness and the ability to conduct rapid and sophisticated activation/regulation of this important RPG class – attributes which may contribute to fitness in diverse environments.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource"

These labeled yeast octamers were assembled into nucleosomes with the 174 bp <italic>5S</italic> NPS and purified as described above.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>ATPase assays</title><p>Measurement of ATP hydrolysis was as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Saha et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wittmeyer et al., 2004</xref>) using a color (malachite green) absorbance assay that quantitatively measures released free phosphate. Time courses were performed on two separate purifications of each type of RSC complex. Reactions were performed in triplicate. Activities were measured at V<sub>max</sub> using double-stranded Bluescript plasmid as the substrate.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Nucleosome sliding assay</title><p>Nucleosome sliding assays were performed as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Clapier et al., 2016</xref>) with the following modifications. Reactions were conducted in 10 mM Tris [pH 7.4], 50 mM KCl, 3 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, 1 mM ATP with 20 nM mononucleosomes at 30°C and 400 rpm shaking in a Thermomixer (Eppendorf). The amount of remodeler varied. Sliding reactions on 205 bp 601 nucleosomes used 10 nM RSC. Sliding reactions on 174 bp <italic>5S</italic> nucleosomes used 30 nM RSC unless otherwise indicated. Aliquots were removed at each time point and reactions were stopped by adding 10 mM EDTA + 200 ng competitor DNA (Bluescript plasmid). Samples were loaded with 10% glycerol on a 4.5% (37.5:1) native polyacrylamide gel and run in 0.4x TBE for 45 min at 110 V constant. Gels were stained with ethidium bromide solution and scanned on a Typhoon Trio (Amersham, GE).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Nucleosome gel shift assays</title><p>Nucleosome gel shift assays were conducted similarly to the nucleosome sliding assay described above with the following modifications. Reactions were conducted in the absence of ATP and at 30°C for 20 min with 20 nM mononucleosomes. The RSC remodelers were added at 30 and 60 nM. The reactions were loaded on to 3.8% (37.5:1) native polyacrylamide gels and run in 0.4x TBE for 55 min at 110 V constant without addition of any stop solution or competitor. Gels were stained with ethidium bromide solution and scanned on a Typhoon Trio.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Histone mutant screen</title><p>Null mutations in <italic>rsc1</italic> and r<italic>sc2</italic> were crossed into the H3/H4 shuffle strain WZY42 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Zhang et al., 1998</xref>). Strains YBC1939 (WZY42), YBC2090 and YBC3040 and YBC3221 and YBC3547 were transformed in 96 well plate format with a TRP-marked histone H3-H4 or H2A-H2B mutant plasmid library respectively, obtained from and screened as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nakanishi et al., 2008</xref>). Transformants were spotted to SC-TRP plates, replica plated again to SC-TRP plates after 2 days, followed by replica plating to SC-TRP and SC-TRP + 5FOA. Synthetic lethality with mutations in the H3 αN helix were confirmed by a second round of individual transformations and shuffles.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Recombinant nucleosome mapping</title><p>The position and wrapping of the recombinant nucleosomes were determined by sequencing the protected DNA fragment after treating assembled nucleosomes with Exonuclease III and S1 nuclease. Approximately 400–800 fmol of nucleosomes purified from sucrose gradients was digested with a 5–25U titration of ExoIII enzyme (New England Biolabs) for 1, 2, or 3 min at 37°C in ExoIII Buffer (10 mM Tris [pH 8], 50 mM NaCl, 3 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>). Reactions were moved to ice, S1 Buffer and NaCl were added (30 mM NaOAc [pH 4.6], 1 mM ZnOAc, 5% glycerol, and 300 mM NaCl final concentration), and treated with 50U S1 for 30 min at room temperature. Tris [pH 8.8] and EDTA were added to final concentrations of 88 mM and 14 mM, respectively, and heated to 70°C for 10 min. SDS was added to 1%, vortexed, and iced. The protected DNA fragments were cleaned up on a Qiagen MinElute PCR purification column and eluted in 30 μl EB. The level of digestion was determined for each sample on a 4.5% (37.5:1) native polyacrylamide 0.4x TBE gel as described above.</p><p>Libraries were made from the above protected fragments using the NEBNext ChIP-Seq MasterMix Set (New England Biolabs) with the following modifications. Samples did not go through the initial End-Repair. A custom adaptor with an 8 bp unique molecular identifier (UMI) was ligated onto the dA-tailed samples. The UMI Adaptor was created from an oligo based on the standard NEBNext adaptor sequence incorporating eight random nucleotides at the 5’ end of the oligo (see oligo sequence in File Supplement 2). To create the UMI Adaptor, 25 μM oligo (synthesized by IDT) was first heated to 95°C and slow cooled to room temperature in Duplex Buffer (100 mM KOAc, 30 mM HEPES [pH 7.5]). The ends of the annealed UMI Adaptor were filled in using Klenow (New England Biolabs). The reaction was stopped with EDTA and heat. The adaptor was cleaned up on a Micro Bio-Spin six chromatography column (Bio-Rad) equilibrated with water. A dT-tail was added to the adaptor with Klenow exo- (New England Biolabs). The UMI Adaptor was cleaned up on a Micro Bio-Spin six column and eluted in water. The UMI Adaptor was diluted to 1.14 μM final concentration for use in library preparations. High-throughput sequencing was performed by Illumina’s protocol for 50 bp paired-end runs on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 or a MiSeq.</p><p>The embedded UMI code was first extracted from the Fastq files using the script embedded_UMI_extractor from the package UMIScripts (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/HuntsmanCancerInstitute/UMIScripts">https://github.com/HuntsmanCancerInstitute/UMIScripts</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Parnell, 2019a</xref>). Output Fastq sequences were then aligned to an index comprised of the recombinant sea urchin <italic>5S</italic> or 601 sequence using Novocraft Novoalign (version 3.8.2), giving the adapter sequences for trimming. After alignment, PCR-duplicate reads were identified and marked based on the UMI information with the UMISripts application bam_umi_dedup. The 5’ start positions for each alignment, discarding duplicates, were recorded as a bigWig file with 1 bp resolution using the application bam2wig from the BioToolBox package (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/tjparnell/biotoolbox">https://github.com/tjparnell/biotoolbox</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Parnell, 2020a</xref>). Separate bigWig files were generated for each length of alignments (92–169 bp). To normalize for sequencing read depth, alignment counts were scaled to an equivalent of 100K reads (calculated from the total sum of alignments without regard to alignment length). Count matrices for each length at each position on the reference sequence and for each sample were then collected using the BioToolBox application get_datasets from the bigWig files. Count matrices were analyzed with Microsoft Excel employing a 5% cutoff of the normalized fragment count.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>ChIP seq and analysis</title><p>Yeast cultures from yHN1 (YBC1544-RSC1.9XMYC) and yHN2 (YBC1545; RSC2.9XMYC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ng et al., 2002</xref>) were grown in SC-TRP at 30°C with two biological replicates. Cultures were harvested at OD<sub>600</sub> = 0.8, and crosslinked with 1% formaldehyde final for 30 min at room temperature. Cultures were quenched with 0.2M glycine for 5 min. Chromatin extracts were prepared by bead-beating, and chromatin was liberated with micrococcal nuclease. Immunoprecipitation was performed using anti-cMyc 9E11 (Abcam). DNA was isolated for input and IP samples and assembled into a library using Illumina protocols and sequenced as single end reads on an Illumina sequencer.</p><p>Fastq sequences were aligned to the yeast genome (UCSC version SacCer3) with NovoCraft Novoalign (version 3.8.2), allowing for one random alignment for multi-mapping reads. To maintain processing consistency between single-end and paired-end alignments, paired-end was aligned as single-end by ignoring the second read. Alignments were processed using the MultiRepMacsChIPSeq pipeline (version 10.1, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/HuntsmanCancerInstitute/MultiRepMacsChIPSeq">https://github.com/HuntsmanCancerInstitute/MultiRepMacsChIPSeq</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Parnell, 2020b</xref>). Since MNase-digested chromatin yields high levels of coordinate-duplicate alignments (observed mean of 65%, range 57% to 74%), duplicate alignments were randomly subsampled to a uniform rate of 40% to remove sample bias while retaining relative signal intensity. Alignments over ribosomal DNA, telomeric sequences, mitochondrial chromosome, and other high copy sequences were excluded. Fragment coverage tracks were generated by extending alignments in the 3’ direction by 160 bp in all fragments. We note that there may be some between-sample biases in the distribution of MNase-digested fragment lengths, particularly with RSC-enriched fragments, but rationalized that uniformity of processing should help minimize these biases. Replicates were depth-normalized (Reads Per Million) prior to combining as an average after confirming reasonable similarity to each through standard correlation metrics. Log2 fold enrichment of ChIP signal over non-enriched nucleosome signal (Input) was generated with Macs2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>) without background lambda correction. Hmo1 ChIPs (GSM1509041) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Knight et al., 2014</xref>) were re-processed in a similar manner.</p><p>NDRs were determined by first determining all nucleosome positions in the genome using the software package biotoolbox-nucleosome (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/tjparnell/biotoolbox-nucleosome">https://github.com/tjparnell/biotoolbox-nucleosome</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Parnell, 2019b</xref>) with the Input MNase sample alignments. To reduce mapping noise and increase efficacy of calling positions, ‘skinny’ nucleosome coverage was used rather than midpoint data. Fragment coverage was generated by shifting the 5’ alignment coordinate in the 3’ direction by 37 bp and extending 74 bp, essentially recording the predicted central portion of the nucleosome. After mapping nucleosomes, NDRs were extracted by calculating all inter-nucleosomal intervals and selecting for those with lengths between 75 and 600 bp and occurring over or adjacent to a defined protein-coding gene TSS. NDRs were sorted by decreasing length and aligned by the edge closest to the TSS; NDRs between divergent promoter pairs are represented once.</p><p>Data were collected with applications from the BioToolBox package (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/tjparnell/biotoolbox">https://github.com/tjparnell/biotoolbox</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Parnell, 2020a</xref>). Mean occupancy of RSC and Hmo1 were collected over the NDRs using the application get_datasets, while spatial data surrounding NDRs and tDNAs were collected with get_relative_data. Heat maps were generated in R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">R Development Core Team, 2018</xref>) with pHeatmap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kolde, 2019</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor (me) and a Senior Editor (Kevin Struhl). The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Blaine Bartholomew (Reviewer #1).</p><p>Based on the individual reviews (below) and then further consultations, we regret to inform you that your paper was not accepted for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. Everybody appreciated the work that went into isolating and analyzing the different RSC variants. There were some concerns about interpretation and quantitation of the in vitro remodeling experiments, although those concerns might be addressed with a little additional work. However, the main criticism was voiced by reviewer 2, who felt that there was a disconnect between the in vitro and in vivo experiments, and therefore that the conclusion that Rsc1 was specialized for partially unwrapped nucleosomes was not strongly justified. After consultation between the reviewers and editors, we felt that these issues would be difficult to address within the window that <italic>eLife</italic> sets for revisions. We hope that these reviews will help you with a future version of the paper.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The authors have carefully characterized the functional differences between the Rsc1 and Rsc2 forms of the RSC ATP-dependent chromatin remodeler and their interplay with Rsc3/Rsc30, two DNA binding subunits of the RSC complex. They found the key difference to be in the two repeats present at the C-terminus of Rsc1 and Rsc2 with the repeat closest to the end helping to regulate the association of Rsc3/30 to the complex. The remodeling differences were only observed between the RSC1 and RSC2 complexes with 5S DNA nucleosomes and not with 601, which suggested the difference might reside in the ability to handle nucleosomes that could be partially unwrapped from the beginning. The combination of biochemistry and genetic experiments are powerful and complementary in this study. However, some of the biochemical experiments were not as well designed as needed to effectively compare the enzymatic differences between the two enzymes or to ascertain as to the experimental reproducibility. The quantitation of nucleosome remodeling assays like that shown in Figure 2C with their corresponding replicates is not displayed and would be clearer if plotted in a line-graph with standard deviation shown for each time point rather than displayed for only of the replicates as a histogram. As it is currently, it is not possible to know what the deviation was like between the replicates. It also seems that they if properly quantitated the authors would also be able to determine the rates of nucleosome movement. The ATPase assays also don't seem to be as effective for comparing difference as they only measure Vmax and measure the extent of ATPase hydrolysis at only one time point with a high concentration of ATP. In their approach it would be easy to miss if there were indeed differences in their ability to hydrolyze ATP. The binding assays are also deficient in that there are only two titration points, there is no quantitation of this data and thus it is also not possible to ascertain as to the standard deviation between the technical replicates similar to the remodeling assays. I was also concerned since remodeling with the 5S DNA nucleosome seems to be generally less efficient than expected and raises questions as to why this might be. Could the linker DNA be too short in the 5S nucleosomes for the Rsc3/30 to bind and be the reason why the addition of Rsc3/30 is inhibitory when based on the genetic data is expected to stimulate the activity of the complex?</p><p>They use a powerful approach with a series of histone point mutations to identify histone region(s) that might contribute to the enzymatic differences between the RSC1 and RSC complexes and observed that mutations in the H3 α N helix are synthetically lethal when only RSC2 was present. These are very complementary observations and provide an orthogonal approach to indicate it is the high propensity of unwrapping DNA from the end of the nucleosome that is crucial for these differences. I did however find it odd that in the context of the 5S nucleosomes that H3 R40A mutation appears to weaken these interactions (Figure 3—figure supplement 3); whereas in the context of the 601 nucleosome the same mutation appears to stabilize these interactions over wild type (Figure 4—figure supplement 2 panel B). Does this mean that the destabilizing effect observed with H3 R40A is nucleosome specific and may vary depending on the DNA sequence and would this complicate the authors interpretation? The experiments in Figure 3E indicate that both RSC1 and RSC2 are inhibited by DNA unwrapping from the nucleosome surface, but to different extents. Is it a problem that DNA unwrapping is inhibitory for both forms of RSC and wouldn't it change some of the later interpretations?</p><p>The experimental setup in which Hmo1 is added is not adequate to effectively compare how much Hmo1 stimulates the RSC1 versus the RSC2 complex because only 1 time point is used for both enzymes in the remodeling assays. In essence remodeling with RSC1 is much further along because of the time window used, while RSC2 is not and as such you are not able to determine the difference in the stimulation of remodeling when Hmo1 is added. Also, I wasn't clear how an HMG-like protein would help stabilize the wrapping of DNA onto the nucleosome?</p><p>The MNase ChIP-seq was a good addition as it helped re-examined the potential differences in the genome-wide Rsc1 and Rsc2 localization and the difference is evident at the tRNA genes and ribosomal protein genes. The RNA-seq also aids in this regard and combined with the other experiments provides a compelling story.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript, Cairns and colleagues investigate the potential for in vitro and in vivo distinctions between two forms of the RSC remodeling enzyme that contain either the Rsc1 or Rsc2 subunit. The first half of the manuscript describes extensive biochemical studies with mononucleosomes, comparing the activities of RSC1 and RSC2 complexes. The authors report that the RSC1 complex remodels a 5S nucleosome substrate more efficiently than the RSC2 complex, and that the RSC2 complex has greater problems remodeling a 5S nucleosome harboring a H3-R40A substitution derivative. H4-R40 is located in the H3 N-helix, and the authors find nice synthetic lethality phenotypes between many substitution derivatives in the H3-N helix and a rsc1 deletion strain. Together the data suggest that RSC2 may have a general problem (compared to RSC1) remodeling 5S nucleosomes with alterations in the H3-N helix. Previous work from the Owen-Hughes group has reported that these H3-N helix substitutions lead to increased breathing (spontaneous unwrapping) of entry/exit DNA and increased nucleosome thermal mobility. The authors suggest that RSC1 may be specialized to remodel partially unwrapped nucleosomes. Consistent with this view, they how that RSC1 and RSC2 are proficient at remodeling a more stably wrapped, 601 nucleosome. These in vitro studies lead the authors to predict that RSC1 may play a larger function at genes where RSC is known to engage partially unwrapped nucleosomes, specifically the ribosomal protein (RP) genes. To this end, the carry out extensive ChIP-seq analyzes of Rsc1 and Rsc2, as well as RNA-seq analyzes in rsc1 and rsc2 deletion strains. Contrary to the model, these data reinforce the view that Rsc1 and Rsc2 are functionally redundant at the majority of target genes, including RP genes. The only large different is that Rsc1 appears to play a dominant role at rDNAs. Notably, rDNAs are not known to contain alternative nucleosome structures that would link these functional data with the biochemistry. In general, this work illustrates differences between RSC1 and RSC2 complexes for remodeling a 5S mononucleosome substrate (but not a 601), distinct genetic interactions with histone substitutions, but no clear functional correlation of these results with gene targets or unwrapped nucleosomes in vivo.</p><p>1) One major concern with the biochemistry data is the remodeling results with the 5S substrates. This substrate appears to be a center-positioned nucleosome (10N16), but after remodeling, the &quot;slid&quot; product migrates much slower on the native gels. This is counter to every other published sliding assay for RSC or SWI/SNF-like enzymes. These enzymes always move nucleosomes towards or off DNA ends. These always lead to faster migrating species on native gels. For examples, see work from Owen-Hughes with the MMTV A nucleosome (Ferreira et al., 2007) or the 601 nucleosome shown here. Given the mobility of this remodeled species, it is more likely that this product represents a histone dimer loss event, leading to a hexosome or tetrasome. Alternatively, perhaps it is some type of product where the nucleosome is slid off the end and free DNA has re-captured an exposed histone surface (Kassabov et al., 2003). It is unclear why the authors see such a product specifically with a 5S nucleosome, as faster migrating species have been observed with this element previously (Jaskeliof et al., 2000), and early DNase I footprinting assays using the same template shown here gives rise to a &quot;naked DNA&quot; pattern after RSC remodeling, consistent with the nucleosome moved off the DNA ends (Cairns et al., 1996). The identity of this novel species is important for interpreting the data for how histone substitutions or Rsc3/Rsc30 impacts this novel reaction. It also leads to worries that this particular substrate is not representative of typical remodeling events.</p><p>2) The authors interpret the impact of H3-N helix substitutions as due to their impact on nucleosome unwrapping. They also argue that 5S is distinguished from 601, based on unwrapping dynamics. It is important to realize that the unwrapping phenotypes were determined by the Owen-Hughes lab using an MMTV A nucleosome, and in some cases also a 601. Note that a H3-K56Q substitution has a large impact on unwrapping a 601 (Neumann et al., 2009). Furthermore, on an MMTV A nucleosome (and/or a 601 nuc), these substitutions stimulate the remodeling activity of the RSC2 complex. This is certainly true for H3-R40A and for H3-K56Q. Indeed, the Owen-Hughes group has argued that RSC2 activity is stimulated by histone substitution derivatives that enhance unwrapping and intrinsic thermal mobility. This is completely opposite of the conclusions and models described here.</p><p>3) Figure 4C. This is not an optimal experiment to measure interactions between Hmo1 and RSC in vivo. Sonication of chromatin may yield an average size of ~250-500bp, but the distributions are normally large. This experiment should at least be performed with Mnase trimmed cores. Most likely this will not work, as previous work has shown that Hmo1 needs linker DNA to bind to mononucleosomes (Hepp et al., 2014).</p><p>4) Figure 3—figure supplement 3. These mapping data for the 5S mononucleosomes seem odd. Historically, the 5S rRNA gene is not considered a perfect nucleosome positioning sequence. Previous mapping data has indicated that the major translational position only reflects 50% of the population, with the remaining nucleosomes offset by 10 bp intervals. It is surprising then that the mapping work yields a unique right boundary at position 158. Could the &quot;unwrapped&quot; left boundaries really be alternate translational frames, and the right boundaries that might be positioned at the full-length ends (position 174) were not included? It also seems odd that only the left end is &quot;unwrapped&quot; by the H3-R40A substitution.</p><p>5) The general interest of this work relies on what is stated in the title that RSC1 is specialized to remodel partially unwrapped nucleosomes and such nucleosome remodeling specialization is important for a particular gene target, such as RP genes. Unfortunately, the in vivo data do not support this model. All of the results show that Rsc1 and Rsc2 share a nearly identical binding profile (with the exception of tDNA), and single deletion strains have nearly no impact on RNA levels, especially RP genes. Furthermore, it is very odd that the only mutant that impacts RP gene expression is the rsc2 rsc30 double mutant. In contrast, the rsc1 rsc30 has little impact. In a simple interpretation, this suggests that Rsc2 is sufficient to support RP gene expression, even without Rsc30. This is not consistent with the main conclusions of the biochemistry or the title.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>In this paper, Schlichter et al., compare the Rsc1 and Rsc2 versions of RSC remodeling complex. They find that Rsc2 complexes have reduced affinity for Rsc3/30, and map this difference to the CT2 domain. While the four different complexes (Rsc1 or Rsc2, +/- Rsc3/30) have similar affinity for nucleosomes and ATPase activity, the Rsc1 complexes have stronger nucleosome remodeling activity. They screened histone mutant libraries and found specific synthetic lethality with rsc1 δ in H3 alphaN domain or H3 K56Q (but not A) mutants. These differences correlate with partial nucleosome unwrapping (citing an earlier FRET study). Interestingly, the H3 alphaN synthetic lethality is suppressed if Rsc1 CT2 domain swapped into Rsc2. Using in vitro assays and ChIP experiments the authors build a case that Rsc1 functions preferentially at promoters with wide NDRs (particularly ribosomal protein genes and tDNAs), where partially unwrapped nucleosomes may be more prevalent. Overall, the combination of in vitro biochemistry and correlational in vivo work seems persuasive. The paper is well written and the data relatively clear. Understanding the functional differences between the closely related RSC complexes (or other remodeler families) is of significant interest to the field.</p><p>Some specific questions and comments:</p><p>1) Does swapping the CT2 domain of Rsc1 into Rsc2 also suppress the synthetic lethality with K56Q?</p><p>2) Subsection “RSC2 complexes are deficient in remodeling partially-unwrapped nucleosomes”: The authors conclude that Rsc1 complex is more active for remodeling unwrapped nucleosomes because it has more activity on the R40A nucleosomes than Rsc2. But that is also true for WT 5S nucleosomes. Given that R40A is unlikely to completely disrupt wrapping, isn't it possible that remodeling only occurs when the nucleosomes are wrapped, and R40A simply reduces the time spent in the wrapped conformation? This idea seems supported by the fact that R40A has less effect in the 601 DNA sequence. Following this line of reasoning, could Rsc1 do a better job in inducing unwrapped nucleosomes to adopt the wrapped &quot;remodelable&quot; configuration? The discussion seems to be moving in this direction, but it this is the authors' model it could be made clearer and perhaps foreshadowed more strongly in the results.</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Specialization of the Chromatin Remodeler RSC to Mobilize Partially-Unwrapped Nucleosomes&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

Although the genetic evidence is consistent with your model, reviewer 2 (supported by reviewer 3) cites published data saying the difference in 5S versus 601 unwrapping is not as clear as suggested in your text:</p><p>&quot;Introduction. The authors cite 4 papers in support of the statement that &quot;entry/exit DNA displays higher level of detachment from the octamer&quot; (for 5S in comparison to 601). However, none of these papers compare 5S to 601. Polach and Widom, 1995 used 5S, and Li and Widom, 2004 used 601. In the cited review (Zhou et al., 2019), they discuss in detail the comprehensive study by the Poirier group (North et al., 2012; not cited) where they do directly compare 5S and 601 nucleosomes in FRET-based unwrapping assays. Contrary to expectations, a 5S nucleosome unwraps less than 601 at the edge. This is shown to be due to the first 7bp of the 5S sequence at the entry/exit site. Thus, even though 601 has a higher overall affinity, the unwrapping dynamics are higher than 5S. These data are also consistent with published work showing that the 5S sequence has a higher affinity for H2A/H2B dimers (cited in Zhou et al., 2019). Notably, the higher affinity of 601 for octamers is due to AT repeats surrounding the dyad (and contacting the H3/H4 tetramer), not really the edges. As discussed by the authors, differences in how they interpret their data and other work (e.g., older Owen-Hughes work on α N-helix substitutions) may be due to the differences in histone octamer source – yeast vs <italic>Xenopus</italic>. Perhaps yeast dimers have a higher affinity for 601, rather than 5S. However, without extensive discussion, the authors' current conclusions seem to contradict several previously published papers. In general, the remodeling assays don't support a simple model where RSC1 remodels unwrapped nucleosomes better than RSC2. Note that I am not questioning the data at all – they are solid and very well done. I worry that the conclusions may just not be so simple.&quot;</p><p>In your revised manuscript, please address this point. I took a look at the paper cited by the reviewer (North et al., 10215) and it does seem to claim that 601 unwraps its ends more that 5S. If the reviewer's summary of the literature is accurate, please modify your statements (and model Figure 6) concerning 5S versus 601 accordingly, and factor that into your discussion and interpretations. If you feel those results can be reconciled, or are not applicable, to your model, please explain why in your Discussion section.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.58130.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the authors resubmitted a revised version of the paper for consideration. What follows is the authors’ response to the first round of review.]</p><p>We carefully considered the reviewer comments and your editorial comments – and over the last several months we successfully addressed the vast majority, including those that were indicated as the most important. These efforts have substantially improved our study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>The authors have carefully characterized the functional differences between the Rsc1 and Rsc2 forms of the RSC ATP-dependent chromatin remodeler and their interplay with Rsc3/Rsc30, two DNA binding subunits of the RSC complex. They found the key difference to be in the two repeats present at the C-terminus of Rsc1 and Rsc2 with the repeat closest to the end helping to regulate the association of Rsc3/30 to the complex. The remodeling differences were only observed between the RSC1 and RSC2 complexes with 5S DNA nucleosomes and not with 601, which suggested the difference might reside in the ability to handle nucleosomes that could be partially unwrapped from the beginning. The combination of biochemistry and genetic experiments are powerful and complementary in this study. However, some of the biochemical experiments were not as well designed as needed to effectively compare the enzymatic differences between the two enzymes or to ascertain as to the experimental reproducibility. The quantitation of nucleosome remodeling assays like that shown in Figure 2C with their corresponding replicates is not displayed and would be clearer if plotted in a line-graph with standard deviation shown for each time point rather than displayed for only of the replicates as a histogram. As it is currently, it is not possible to know what the deviation was like between the replicates. It also seems that they if properly quantitated the authors would also be able to determine the rates of nucleosome movement.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that additional replicates and display modes would improve the manuscript. We have quantified replicates of the sliding assays as the reviewer recommends and these are now included as additional supplemental figures for each assay. Figure 2—figure supplement 1, Figure 3—figure supplement 3, Figure 4—figure supplement 2, Figure 4—figure supplement 3B, Figure 4—figure supplement 4, and Figure 4—figure supplement 6.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The ATPase assays also don't seem to be as effective for comparing difference as they only measure Vmax and measure the extent of ATPase hydrolysis at only one time point with a high concentration of ATP. In their approach it would be easy to miss if there were indeed differences in their ability to hydrolyze ATP.</p></disp-quote><p>We have replaced the ATPase bar graph with an ATPase time course in Figure 2B.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The binding assays are also deficient in that there are only two titration points, there is no quantitation of this data and thus it is also not possible to ascertain as to the standard deviation between the technical replicates similar to the remodeling assays.</p></disp-quote><p>We observe strong differences in RSC remodeling between wt 5S and H3R40A 5S yNucs using nuc:RSC ratios of 1:1.5. Our nucleosome binding assays were conducted at nuc:RSC ratios of 1:1.5, as well as 1:3. Since the nuc binding assay utilizes the conditions used in the remodeling assay, this indicates that RSC1 and RSC2 bind to wt and R40A 5S yeast nucleosomes similarly under these conditions. Additional titration points would require increasing the amount of RSC complex in the assay relative to the amount of nucleosome. Currently this would be challenging because the remodeler concentration required for these higher titration points would be difficult to obtain while remaining within assay parameters for a crisp RSC:Nuc gelshift band. In addition, the higher remodeler concentration would be needed for all four RSC complexes, which would require four new preps which are not feasible to produce at this time. However, we have included the technical replicates for the current experiments as support in the Supplementary Figure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I was also concerned since remodeling with the 5S DNA nucleosome seems to be generally less efficient than expected and raises questions as to why this might be. Could the linker DNA be too short in the 5S nucleosomes for the Rsc3/30 to bind and be the reason why the addition of Rsc3/30 is inhibitory when based on the genetic data is expected to stimulate the activity of the complex?</p></disp-quote><p>We note that we do conduct our work under catalytic conditions, with excess substrate. Regarding length, we have lengthened 5S NPS to 198bp with similar, though more complicated, remodeling results because this NPS resulted in 2 different nucleosome ‘slid’ positions. However, as there was no striking difference with the Rsc3/30 in vitro effect (same result as with shorter DNA), we have not presented experiments using this longer NPS in the paper. Furthermore, it is clear RSC sliding is much more efficient on the 5S nucleosome in the presence of Hmo1, which we discuss in depth in the paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>They use a powerful approach with a series of histone point mutations to identify histone region(s) that might contribute to the enzymatic differences between the RSC1 and RSC complexes and observed that mutations in the H3 α N helix are synthetically lethal when only RSC2 was present. These are very complementary observations and provide an orthogonal approach to indicate it is the high propensity of unwrapping DNA from the end of the nucleosome that is crucial for these differences. I did however find it odd that in the context of the 5S nucleosomes that H3 R40A mutation appears to weaken these interactions (Figure 3—figure supplement 3); whereas in the context of the 601 nucleosome the same mutation appears to stabilize these interactions over wild type (Figure 4 —figure supplement 2 panel B). Does this mean that the destabilizing effect observed with H3 R40A is nucleosome specific and may vary depending on the DNA sequence and would this complicate the authors interpretation?</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, the H3 R40A mutation causes further unwrapping of the 5S nucleosome, whereas it has little effect on a 601 nucleosome. We agree that the destabilizing effect is likely nucleosome specific depending on DNA sequence, and that the effect is greater with a DNA sequence that has a lesser affinity for the octamer. We would expect the greatest effect on further destabilization to be at regions with sequences that are inherently partially unwrapped (similar to 5S) such as those found at RPGs and other wide NDRs (“fragile/MNase sensitive nucleosomes”).</p><p>We note that reviewer 3’s comments (see below) for grouping the wrapped and unwrapped products together and listing percentages for the individual species was indeed helpful, will assist in the interpretation here. In keeping, we have made these changes to Figure 3—figure supplement 5 and Figure 4—figure supplement 5.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The experiments in Figure 3E indicate that both RSC1 and RSC2 are inhibited by DNA unwrapping from the nucleosome surface, but to different extents. Is it a problem that DNA unwrapping is inhibitory for both forms of RSC and wouldn't it change some of the later interpretations?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct, and we needed to make this point more clearly in our revision, as two reviewers had questions here. To clarify, our data and model are indeed that wrapped nucleosomes are better substrates for both RSC1 and RSC2 complexes, but RSC1 can remodel the unwrapped version better than RSC2 – especially when unaided by other proteins. We have now stated this clearly in two locations in the revision – both in the Results section and in the Discussion section. Furthermore, our data supports RSC complex as two redundant functional entities that manage partially-wrapped nucleosomes: ‘Rsc2 with Hmo1’ and ‘Rsc1 with Rsc3-30’ – and one must significantly impair both entities for a strong phenotype (see below).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The experimental setup in which Hmo1 is added is not adequate to effectively compare how much Hmo1 stimulates the RSC1 versus the RSC2 complex because only 1 time point is used for both enzymes in the remodeling assays. In essence remodeling with RSC1 is much further along because of the time window used, while RSC2 is not and as such you are not able to determine the difference in the stimulation of remodeling when Hmo1 is added.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree, and for this reason different time point and remodeler concentrations are shown in supplemental Figure 4—figure supplement 3, so that the “fast” remodelers are tested when they aren’t “further along.” These results reinforce our conclusions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, I wasn't clear how an HMG-like protein would help stabilize the wrapping of DNA onto the nucleosome?</p></disp-quote><p>Hmo1 has been shown to stabilize chromatin and perform the functions of a linker histone. Unlike other HMGB proteins which have an acidic CTD that promotes bending, Hmo1 is relatively unique in this class as it contains a basic lysine rich C-terminal extension. Hmo1 is predicted to bind near the nucleosome dyad and use its basic extension to bind linker DNA and prevent bending and improve wrapping. Additionally, nucleosomes in an <italic>hmo1</italic> null display increased MNase sensitivity. (Panday and Grove, 2016; Panday and Grove, 2017). We have incorporated additional text in the manuscript to convey this to the reader.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The MNase ChIP-seq was a good addition as it helped re-examined the potential differences in the genome-wide Rsc1 and Rsc2 localization and the difference is evident at the tRNA genes and ribosomal protein genes. The RNA-seq also aids in this regard and combined with the other experiments provides a compelling story.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for appreciating these experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[…] 1) One major concern with the biochemistry data is the remodeling results with the 5S substrates. This substrate appears to be a center-positioned nucleosome (10N16), but after remodeling, the &quot;slid&quot; product migrates much slower on the native gels. This is counter to every other published sliding assay for RSC or SWI/SNF-like enzymes. These enzymes always move nucleosomes towards or off DNA ends. These always lead to faster migrating species on native gels. For examples, see work from Owen-Hughes with the MMTV A nucleosome (Ferreira et al., 2007) or the 601 nucleosome shown here. Given the mobility of this remodeled species, it is more likely that this product represents a histone dimer loss event, leading to a hexosome or tetrasome. Alternatively, perhaps it is some type of product where the nucleosome is slid off the end and free DNA has re-captured an exposed histone surface (Kassabov et al., 2003). It is unclear why the authors see such a product specifically with a 5S nucleosome, as faster migrating species have been observed with this element previously (Jaskeliof et al., 2000), and early DNase I footprinting assays using the same template shown here gives rise to a &quot;naked DNA&quot; pattern after RSC remodeling, consistent with the nucleosome moved off the DNA ends (Cairns et al., 1996). The identity of this novel species is important for interpreting the data for how histone substitutions or Rsc3/Rsc30 impacts this novel reaction. It also leads to worries that this particular substrate is not representative of typical remodeling events.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a highly relevant point, and we thus thought it important to quantitatively assess whether the slower migrating species in the sliding assay could be due to dimer loss during RSC remodeling. We addressed this issue directly by examining 5S sliding on fluorescently-labeled yeast nucleosomes. Here, we assembled 174bp 5S yeast nucleosomes labeled with Oregon Green at Q114C of H2A, and used them in RSC sliding reactions. RSC1 complex remodeled these labeled nucleosomes resulting in a slower migrating band, as we have seen with remodeled unlabeled 5S nucleosomes. If H2A/H2B dimer was lost from the slid product during remodeling, then we would expect a reduction in the dimer to DNA ratio when normalized to the ratio observed in the starting nucleosomes. However, the dimer to DNA ratio does not decrease in the slid product, and instead is very similar to the starting nucleosomes. This data has been added to the paper as Figure 2—figure supplement 3.</p><p>The reviewer states that all nucleosomes positioned near or off of DNA ends will always lead to faster, not slower, migrating species on native gels. A complex’s migration through a native gel is affected by its overall shape as well as charge. It is known that different DNA sequences have different degrees of inherent stiffness and flexibility. It seems reasonable that some DNA sequences protruding from a nucleosome could alter its migration on a native gel. This would be a property of the specific NPS and nucleosomes. For example, Chakravarthy et al., (2012) (Bowman lab) reported remodeled nucleosomes that ran aberrantly fast on native gels which showed a smaller effective size for the particle and greater compaction.</p><p>After examining, we did not consider the mononucleosome sliding results of the 5S template used in the Jaskelioff, 2000 paper as comparable to our 5S mononucleosome sliding. The Jaskelioff template is 416 bp with 2 copies of the 5S NPS (compatible with di-nucleosome formation and examination) while ours is a 174 bp fragment with a single 5S NPS, for mononucleosome formation and examination. Thus, it seems entirely possible that these two templates would migrate differently on native gels before or after remodeling.</p><p>Although we believe our Oregon Green labeling has resolved the H2A/B dimer issue for our experiments, we will mention that some hexasomes migrate slower than nucleosomes (Chen et al., 2017), while others run faster (Levendosky et al., 2016, Brehove et al., 2019, Mazurkiewicz et al., 2006). Indeed, the Mazurkiewicz, 2006 paper shows Sea Urchin 5S hexasomes and nucleosomes on 146 bp and 207 bp NPS fragments and their experiments show hexasomes running faster than the corresponding nucleosome.</p><p>Regarding the early 5S DNase I footprinting after RSC remodeling (Cairns, 1996), where the product resembles naked DNA. I agree with the reviewer that this observation is consistent with dimer loss – reinforcing the need for conducting the Oregon Green experiment. As the dimers are shown to remain, I believe that RSC has moved these nucleosomes out of their initial/preferred rotational phase to a superposition of all rotational phases, and thus the DNaseI patterns will resemble naked DNA – with the fraction of end position nucleosomes lacking (as the reviewer notes) octamer protection.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors interpret the impact of H3-N helix substitutions as due to their impact on nucleosome unwrapping. They also argue that 5S is distinguished from 601, based on unwrapping dynamics. It is important to realize that the unwrapping phenotypes were determined by the Owen-Hughes lab using an MMTV A nucleosome, and in some cases also a 601. Note that a H3-K56Q substitution has a large impact on unwrapping a 601 (Neumann et al., 2009). Furthermore, on an MMTV A nucleosome (and/or a 601 nuc), these substitutions stimulate the remodeling activity of the RSC2 complex. This is certainly true for H3-R40A and for H3-K56Q. Indeed, the Owen-Hughes group has argued that RSC2 activity is stimulated by histone substitution derivatives that enhance unwrapping and intrinsic thermal mobility. This is completely opposite of the conclusions and models described here.</p></disp-quote><p>There are indeed apparent differences with prior results, but we believe they can be reconciled. First, the type of NPS sequence and DNA length are important factors for nucleosome wrapping and H3-α N helix mutations may behave differently in the context of the Sea Urchin 5S nucleosomes examined here than in the context of other NPS previously studied. More to the point, we consider it reasonable and likely that histone origin (e.g., yeast, <italic>Drosophila</italic>, <italic>Xenopus</italic>, or chicken) influences nucleosome wrapping, and underlies differences in observations. Our experiments utilize yeast remodeler with yeast octamers (nucleosomes), whereas the papers cited (and the majority in the field) use a variety of octamer sources for the in vitro work, but rarely have people used yeast remodelers with yeast nucleosomes. Our lab has observed differences in remodeler activities based on octamer source, and therefore we elected to use only yeast octamers to test yeast RSC derivatives, as we believe this provides a higher degree of confidence in the results.</p><p>We mapped the positioning of the wild-type and mutant recombinant nucleosomes used in this study, which supports the hypothesis that canonical Sea Urchin 5S sequence with yeast nucleosomes are less well wrapped than original Widom 601 yeast nucleosomes, and that RSC1 and RSC2 behave differently on these two templates. The H3 R40A mutation was not sufficient to unwrap the yeast Widom 601 nucleosome nor did it affect RSC sliding on yeast 601 nucs in our experiments.</p><p>Importantly, while the Owen-Hughes group does indeed show an increase in the initial rate of repositioning (1.2-2x -measured as the sum of all remodeled products) by RSC for the same H3 mutations where we see lethality with <italic>rsc1∆</italic> (e.g., H3R40A; subsection “Well-wrapped nucleosomes are remodeled comparably by both RSC1 and RSC2 complexes”). Importantly, they also show that when these mutant nucleosomes are remodeled by RSC2 and run on a native polyacrylamide gel, they show significantly altered products compared to WT – so the distribution of products is highly affected. So, while there may be aspects of remodeling that are enhanced, proper remodeling to completion appears impaired (see subsection “Well-wrapped nucleosomes are remodeled comparably by both RSC1 and RSC2 complexes”). This improper remodeling by RSC2 of R40A is therefore supported by our in vivo genetic studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Figure 4C. This is not an optimal experiment to measure interactions between Hmo1 and RSC in vivo. Sonication of chromatin may yield an average size of ~250-500bp, but the distributions are normally large. This experiment should at least be performed with Mnase trimmed cores. Most likely this will not work, as previous work has shown that Hmo1 needs linker DNA to bind to mononucleosomes (Hepp et al., 2014).</p></disp-quote><p>This is a good point, and our DNA fragment size following sonication using the Bioruptor Pico is predominantly 150-300 bp. In addition, we have now repeated the experiment from crosslinked MNase-treated chromatin extracts as suggested by the reviewer and still see co-immunoprecipitation. This is included as Figure 4—figure supplement 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Figure 3—figure supplement 3. These mapping data for the 5S mononucleosomes seem odd. Historically, the 5S rRNA gene is not considered a perfect nucleosome positioning sequence. Previous mapping data has indicated that the major translational position only reflects 50% of the population, with the remaining nucleosomes offset by 10 bp intervals. It is surprising then that the mapping work yields a unique right boundary at position 158. Could the &quot;unwrapped&quot; left boundaries really be alternate translational frames, and the right boundaries that might be positioned at the full-length ends (position 174) were not included? It also seems odd that only the left end is &quot;unwrapped&quot; by the H3-R40A substitution.</p></disp-quote><p>We used paired-end sequencing after ExoIII and S1 digestion to map the recombinant yeast nucleosomes and agree the 5S is not a perfect NPS. Paired-end sequencing gives fragment length, start and end points for each individual fragment, and number of reads indicating strength of fragment representation, which we provide. We have improved the display of our mapping data as suggested by reviewer 3. Our wild type 5S nucleosome mapping is in agreement with the asymmetric unwrapping previously shown for the 5S NPS by Winogradoff and Aksimentiev, 2019).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The general interest of this work relies on what is stated in the title that RSC1 is specialized to remodel partially unwrapped nucleosomes and such nucleosome remodeling specialization is important for a particular gene target, such as RP genes. Unfortunately, the in vivo data do not support this model. All of the results show that Rsc1 and Rsc2 share a nearly identical binding profile (with the exception of tDNA), and single deletion strains have nearly no impact on RNA levels, especially RP genes. Furthermore, it is very odd that the only mutant that impacts RP gene expression is the rsc2 rsc30 double mutant. In contrast, the rsc1 rsc30 has little impact. In a simple interpretation, this suggests that Rsc2 is sufficient to support RP gene expression, even without Rsc30. This is not consistent with the main conclusions of the biochemistry or the title.</p></disp-quote><p>I believe these comments are a result of our inadequate description of our interpretations and model. First, we agree that (beyond tDNAs) the binding profiles of Rsc1 and Rsc2 are nearly identical. That fact was stated in the manuscript and consistent with our model, but we did not do an adequate job stating the model. To rectify, we now have sections in the expanded Discussion section on the issue of how RSC1 complexes better manage partially-unwrapped nucleosomes after (independent of) the initial nucleosome binding step. Therefore, if the initial binding is not affected, then the genomics should show them both occupying the same Pol II genes.</p><p>Second, we clarify in key locations how the in vitro and in vivo data are largely consistent, and that although Rsc1/2 are at the same locations, they can have partially overlapping/redundant, and partially unique functions – summarized in Figure 5—figure supplement 2 and in the Model figure (Figure 6). Put succinctly, our data supports RSC as two partially redundant functional entities: ‘Rsc2 with Hmo1’ and ‘Rsc1 with Rsc3-30’ – and one must significantly impair both entities for a strong phenotype in vivo (see Figure 5—figure supplement 2C). We note that in vitro tests on particular nucleosome substrates cannot encompass the complexity of genome sequences that RSC manages. However, there is general agreement in the data to support differences in the ability of RSC1 versus RSC2 to manage partially-unwrapped nucleosomes – as the best current model to explain our genetic, biochemical and genomic data.</p><p>Regarding RP gene expression in particular, we find that yeast prior to the whole genome duplication do not have Rsc1, and as neither <italic>rsc1</italic> nor <italic>rsc30</italic> nulls are inviable, RSC2 (with Hmo1) must be sufficient to support RP gene expression. The <italic>rsc1</italic>, <italic>rsc2</italic>, and <italic>rsc1 rsc30</italic> mutations have mild effects because of this built in redundancy that Rsc2/Hmo1 can perform the role when <italic>RSC1</italic> is absent. In the <italic>rsc2 rsc30</italic> mutation, RSC2 complex is absent, and the RSC1 complex is now impaired due to loss of <italic>RSC30</italic>, which causes a significant impact on RP expression. As mentioned above, we have included a table depicting the redundancy relationship in Figure 5—figure supplement 2C.</p><p>We speculate that Rsc1, as a later evolutionary adaptation, seems to be specialized to help remodel these regions. RSC1 is only 20% of total RSC complexes, yet has a slightly higher occupancy at RPGs, wide NDRs and tDNAs than RSC2. While the differences in occupancy and expression may not appear that substantial as a result of the redundancy, having nucleosomes poised in a specialized state that is “better” handled by one form of RSC provides for rapid and regulated action in response to environmental signals, and likely provides a fitness advantage to yeast in the wild.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>[…] Some specific questions and comments:</p><p>1) Does swapping the CT2 domain of Rsc1 into Rsc2 also suppress the synthetic lethality with K56Q?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes it does. This is shown in Figure 3—figure supplement 2B.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Subsection “RSC2 complexes are deficient in remodeling partially-unwrapped nucleosomes”: The authors conclude that Rsc1 complex is more active for remodeling unwrapped nucleosomes because it has more activity on the R40A nucleosomes than Rsc2. But that is also true for WT 5S nucleosomes. Given that R40A is unlikely to completely disrupt wrapping, isn't it possible that remodeling only occurs when the nucleosomes are wrapped, and R40A simply reduces the time spent in the wrapped conformation? This idea seems supported by the fact that R40A has less effect in the 601 DNA sequence. Following this line of reasoning, could Rsc1 do a better job in inducing unwrapped nucleosomes to adopt the wrapped &quot;remodelable&quot; configuration? The discussion seems to be moving in this direction, but it this is the authors' model it could be made clearer and perhaps foreshadowed more strongly in the results.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, the idea that Rsc1 could do a better job inducing the wrapped conformation, likely via its onboard Rsc3/30 module which could bind the DNA and help “wrap” or stabilize the nucleosome (much like Hmo1) fits nicely within our model. The alternative is that RSC1 complex could be more tolerant of a partially-wrapped nucleosome to initiate DNA translocation. We include both of these possibilities in the new Discussion.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what follows is the authors’ response to the second round of review.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[…] In your revised manuscript, please address this point. I took a look at the paper cited by the reviewer (North et al., 10215) and it does seem to claim that 601 unwraps its ends more that 5S. If the reviewer's summary of the literature is accurate, please modify your statements (and model Figure 6) concerning 5S versus 601 accordingly, and factor that into your discussion and interpretations. If you feel those results can be reconciled, or are not applicable, to your model, please explain why in your Discussion section.</p></disp-quote><p>Again, we would like to thank the reviewers and editors for their efforts in reviewing and helpful comments – which improved the manuscript – and for their appreciation of the quality and significance of the work. We were delighted to have the paper provisionally accepted at <italic>eLife</italic>. Below we address the one remaining request from the editors and reviewer.</p><p>One reviewer expresses concern that our paper conveys a more simplified conclusion (nucleosome partial unwrapping) than merited for differences between Rsc1 versus Rsc2, given that a prior paper has found that the 601 DNA sequence displays more unwrapping from the nucleosome edge (entry/exit) than does the <italic>5S</italic> sequence (North et al., 2012). The reviewer is right to point out this paper, and we agree that additional discussion would be helpful to reconcile their observations with ours. To fully address, we will discuss a major caveat with the North et al., paper, discuss subsequent published work showing higher unwrapping with <italic>5S</italic> compared to 601, and emphasize that with our nucleosomes (using yeast octamers with either sea urchin <italic>5S</italic> or the Widom 601 sequence), the <italic>5S</italic> displays more unwrapping than does the 601 nucleosome.</p><p>First, we utilized the sea urchin <italic>5S</italic> sequence, while the North et al., paper used <italic>Xenopus</italic>, <italic>5S</italic> – so the DNA sequences are slightly different. Second, and much more importantly, North et al. make a significant alteration to both the <italic>5S</italic> and 601 sequences by inserting the LexA binding sequence within the region that unwraps from the octamer. In addition, the authors state that without LexA bound, <italic>5S</italic> has a lower FRET efficiency than 601, possibly due to increased unwrapping by the first few base pairs of the <italic>5S</italic>. Third, there are additional studies, subsequent to North et al. (e.g., Chen et al., 2014 and Mauney et al., 2018) that used small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) to compare native/unaltered sea urchin <italic>5S</italic> to the Widom 601 sequence, which showed that the <italic>5S</italic> unwraps more rapidly and at lower salt concentrations than does 601. Fourth, our studies utilize yeast octamers to form nucleosomes, which we consider best suited to the study of yeast remodelers, rather than the more common usage of either <italic>Drosophila</italic> or <italic>Xenopus</italic> histones. Here, yeast octamers might behave somewhat differently in their wrapping properties.</p><p>Importantly, rather than simply relying on prior studies, and given that our studies use yeast octamers with the <italic>5S</italic> and 601 sequences, we directly examined the extent of unwrapping with the <italic>5S</italic> and 601 nucleosomes used in our studies. To this end, we performed ExoIII-S1 nuclease mapping combined with high throughput sequencing to determine the extent of unwrapping in our starting nucleosomal templates, and found that <italic>5S</italic> nucleosomes are unwrapped to a greater extent than 601 nucleosomes, and that the H3 R40A mutation enhances the unwrapping of the <italic>5S</italic>, but not the 601 template. (Figure 3—figure supplement 5, and Figure 4—figure supplement 5B). Our mapping studies are thus in agreement with the findings from Chen et al., 2014 and Mauney et al., 2018. Taken together with our genetics results, and the positive impact (in vitro and in vivo) of Hmo1, which is predicted to improve wrapping – we conclude that partial nucleosome unwrapping provides the most parsimonious explanation for the differences observed in remodeling capacity between Rsc1 and Rsc2 complexes.</p><p>To address this issue in the manuscript, we have added content and these additional references to the Introduction, made a clearer statement about our mapping of the unwrapping of the <italic>5S</italic> and 601 starting templates in the Results section, and added a paragraph to the Discussion section.</p></body></sub-article></article>
