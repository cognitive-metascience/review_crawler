plays a cytoprotective role in the unfolded protein response (UPR), required for cells to survive ER stress. Activation of ATF6α promotes cell survival in cancer models. We used cell-based screens to discover and develop Ceapins, a class of pyrazole amides, that block ATF6α signaling in response to ER stress. Ceapins sensitize cells to ER stress without impacting viability of unstressed cells. Ceapins are highly specific inhibitors of ATF6α signaling, not affecting signaling through the other branches of the UPR, or proteolytic processing of its close homolog ATF6β or SREBP (a cholesterol-regulated transcription factor), both activated by the same proteases. Ceapins are first-in-class inhibitors that can be used to explore both the mechanism of activation of ATF6α and its role in pathological settings. The discovery of Ceapins now enables pharmacological modulation all three UPR branches either singly or in combination.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.11878.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.11878.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11878.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Newly made proteins must be folded into specific three-dimensional shapes before they can perform their roles in cells. Many proteins are folded in a cell compartment called the endoplasmic reticulum. The cell closely monitors the quality of the work done by this compartment. If the endoplasmic reticulum has more proteins to fold than it can handle, unfolded or misfolded proteins accumulate and trigger a stress response called the unfolded protein response. This increases the capacity of the endoplasmic reticulum to fold proteins to match the demand. However, if the stress persists, then the unfolded protein response instructs the cell to die to protect the rest of the body.</p><p>A protein called ATF6α is one of three branches of the unfolded protein response. This protein is found in the endoplasmic reticulum where it is inactive. Endoplasmic stress causes ATF6α to move from the endoplasmic reticulum to another compartment called the Golgi apparatus. There, two enzymes cut ATF6α to release a fragment of the protein that then moves to the nucleus to increase the production of the machinery needed to fold proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum.</p><p>Errors in protein folding can cause serious diseases in humans and other animals. Drugs that target ATF6α might be able to regulate part of the unfolded protein response to treat these diseases. However, no drugs that act on ATF6α had been identified. Now, two groups of researchers have independently identified small molecules that specifically target ATF6α.</p><p>Gallagher et al. screened over 100,000 compounds for their ability to reduce the activity of ATF6α-regulated genes. The experiments reveal that a class of small molecules termed Ceapins can selectively block the activity of ATF6α during endoplasmic reticulum stress, but had no effect on other proteins involved in the unfolded protein response. Furthermore, when human cells experiencing stress were treated with Ceapins, a greater number of cells died in comparison to cells that had not received Ceapins. An accompanying study by Gallagher and Walter reports on the mechanism by which Ceapins act on ATF6α.</p><p>Independently, Plate et al. identified a type of small molecule that can activate ATF6. Together, the findings of Gallagher et al. and Plate et al. may lead to the development of new drugs for treating diseases associated with incorrect protein folding in the endoplasmic reticulum.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.11878.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.11878.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>endoplasmic reticulum</kwd><kwd>unfolded protein response</kwd><kwd>small molecule screening</kwd><kwd>ATF6-alpha</kwd><kwd>site-1-protease</kwd><kwd>ER to Golgi trafficking</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Collaborative Innovation Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gallagher</surname><given-names>Ciara M</given-names></name><name><surname>Garri</surname><given-names>Carolina</given-names></name><name><surname>Cain</surname><given-names>Erica L</given-names></name><name><surname>Ang</surname><given-names>Kenny Kean-Hooi</given-names></name><name><surname>Wilson</surname><given-names>Christopher G</given-names></name><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Steven</given-names></name><name><surname>Hearn</surname><given-names>Brian R</given-names></name><name><surname>Jaishankar</surname><given-names>Priyadarshini</given-names></name><name><surname>Arkin</surname><given-names>Michelle R</given-names></name><name><surname>Renslo</surname><given-names>Adam R</given-names></name><name><surname>Walter</surname><given-names>Peter</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004410</institution-id><institution>European Molecular Biology Organization</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Long Term Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gallagher</surname><given-names>Ciara M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F32CA1777128</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cain</surname><given-names>Erica L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Fundacion Ciencia Para La Vida</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Project Basal PFB-16 and CONICYT</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Garri</surname><given-names>Carolina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>QB3 Malaysia Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ang</surname><given-names>Kenny Kean-Hooi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Walter</surname><given-names>Peter</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Ceapins enable selective pharmacological inhibition of the cytoprotective transcriptional response to endoplasmic reticulum stress through ATF6α without affecting other branches of the unfolded protein response.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Most secreted and transmembrane proteins utilize the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) as a dedicated folding compartment. It is estimated that about one third of all newly synthesized proteins pass through the ER, where they fold and assemble into multi-subunit complexes, and where post-translational modifications such as disulfide bridge formation and glycosylation occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Braakman and Hebert, 2013</xref>). Dedicated quality control mechanisms ensure that only properly folded proteins exit the ER. These mechanisms are part of the cell’s 'proteostasis network' and include chaperone systems to aid in protein folding and ER associated degradation (ERAD) to remove terminally misfolded proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ruggiano et al., 2014</xref>). In addition, the ER has the ability to adjust its folding capacity upon demand through activation of a homeostatic signaling network, called the unfolded protein response (UPR). The UPR directs cell fate - cells that cannot restore homeostasis then initiate apoptosis to prevent secretion or cell surface presentation of misfolded, non-functional proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lu et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Three principal transmembrane sensors of the UPR independently monitor folding stress in the ER – IRE1, PERK and ATF6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gardner et al., 2013</xref>). These UPR branches function cooperatively to decrease the load of incoming polypeptides and to increase both the protein folding and degradative capacity of the ER through regulation of transcription and translation.</p><p>ATF6 and IRE1 increase the folding capacity of the ER by upregulating transcription of UPR target genes. ATF6 is a membrane-tethered transcription factor activated by regulated trafficking and proteolysis producing ATF6-N, the ATF6 fragment that constitutes the functional transcription factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Haze et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ye et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2002</xref>). In contrast, the highly conserved kinase-endoribonuclease IRE1 removes an intron from the mRNA encoding the UPR effector XBP1 allowing translation of XBP1s ('s' for spliced), the functional transcription factor variant of this protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yoshida et al., 2001</xref>). ATF6-N and XBP1s bind to ER stress response (ERSE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yoshida et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Roy and Lee, 1999</xref>) and unfolded protein response (UPRE) elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yamamoto et al., 2004</xref>), respectively in the promoters of UPR target genes. ATF6 upregulates transcription of chaperones, foldases and lipid synthesis genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yamamoto et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adachi et al., 2008</xref>), while XBP1 upregulates ER chaperones and the ERAD machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lee et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acosta-Alvear et al., 2007</xref>). Decreasing the load of proteins entering the ER is coordinated by IRE1 and PERK. Regulated IRE1-dependent mRNA decay (RIDD) cleaves ER-targeted mRNAs leading to their degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hollien et al., 2009</xref>). PERK, a second transmembrane kinase, phosphorylates itself and the α-subunit of the initiation factor (eIF2-α) leading to transient inhibition of cap-dependent translation and an increase in translation of UPR effectors with upstream open reading frames (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Harding et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sidrauski et al., 2015</xref>), including the transcription factor ATF4 and the apoptotic effector CHOP. The balance between survival and death is controlled temporally. Both IRE1 and ATF6 signaling attenuate after prolonged ER stress, removing most of the cytoprotective functions of the UPR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Haze et al., 2001</xref>). PERK signaling is maintained and, through CHOP, commits the cell to apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zinszner et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Palam et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>This dual capacity of the UPR to boost the protein folding capacity or drive cell death has been implicated in many disease models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ryno et al., 2013</xref>). Many small molecule inhibitors and activators of the PERK and IRE1 enzymes have been isolated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Maly and Papa, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Maurel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mendez et al., 2015</xref>). In contrast, no pharmacological agents promoting the selective modulation of ATF6 have been developed, in part due to the fact that, unlike IRE1 and PERK, ATF6 is not an enzyme.</p><p>Two closely related homologs define the ATF6 family of ER stress sensors; ATF6α and ATF6β, which respond to the same stress inducers and are activated with similar kinetics. ATF6α and ATF6β act redundantly during development as single knockout mice are viable and fertile while double knockout animals are pre-implantation lethal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yamamoto et al., 2007</xref>). Conversely, ATF6α and ATF6β do not appear to act redundantly during ER stress as ATF6α knockout cells or animals die when challenged with ER stressors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yamamoto et al., 2007</xref>). The transcriptional targets of ATF6β and its role during ER stress remain poorly defined.</p><p>Regulation of ATF6 signaling is by spatial separation of the substrate, ATF6, in the ER and the proteases, site-1 and site-2 proteases (S1P and S2P, respectively), in the Golgi apparatus: upon ER stress ATF6 moves from the ER to the Golgi apparatus. The mechanism by which ATF6 trafficking is regulated is poorly understood but the transport requires the COPII coat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nadanaka et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Schindler and Schekman, 2009</xref>), which is not unique to ATF6. Inhibition of ATF6 was achieved by inhibiting the proteases that release it from the membrane – S1P and S2P, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ye et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Okada et al., 2003</xref>). These proteases do not uniquely process ATF6 but also play essential roles in regulating cholesterol homeostasis via processing of SREBP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brown and Goldstein, 1997</xref>) and lysosome biogenesis via processing of the α/β-subunit precursor of the N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphotransferase complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Marschner et al., 2011</xref>). Their pleiotropic engagement limits the usefulness of S1P and S2P inhibitors for studies of the UPR.</p><p>To date, the ATF6 signaling pathway was considered 'undruggable'. Here we developed cell-based screens to identify a series of pyrazole amides as the first selective inhibitors of the ATF6α branch of the UPR. We show in the accompanying manuscript that these compounds trap ATF6α in the ER in discrete foci, which inspired us to name the compounds 'Ceapins' from the Irish verb 'ceap' meaning 'to trap' (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gallagher and Walter, 2016</xref>). Ceapins do not inhibit activation of either IRE1 or PERK in response to ER stress, nor do they inhibit trafficking and cleavage of SREBP in response to low sterols or ATF6β in response to ER stress. Through structure-activity studies we increased the potency of the series ten-fold to an IC<sub>50</sub> of 600 nM. Inhibition of ATF6α with Ceapin analogs has no toxicity in unstressed cells but increases the sensitivity of cells to ER stress inducers, closely mimicking the genetic ablation of ATF6α in mice. This makes Ceapins the most selective class of ATF6α inhibitors identified to date and the first to act through a mechanism distinct from protease inhibition or general trafficking between the ER and the Golgi.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Isolation of small molecule inhibitors of ATF6 mediated transcription of UPR targets</title><p>To isolate small molecule modulators of ATF6 signaling, we used an assay based on the activation of transcription of ATF6 target genes.

To begin mapping the action of the inhibitors to the steps of ATF6 activation, we next determined the subcellular localization of ATF6α using a cell line that stably expresses GFP-ATF6α (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–D</xref>). Using an antibody against GRP94 to mark the ER and a DNA stain to mark the nucleus, we examined the ratio of GFP intensity between the nucleus and the ER.

Upon ER stress, GFP-ATF6α translocated to the nucleus and colocalized with DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, yellow in merged image).

Using CellProfiler (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carpenter et al., 2006</xref>), we used the GRP94 and DNA images to generate masks for the ER and nuclei, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). We next calculated the ratio of nuclear to ER GFP signal (nuc:ER ratio) for each cell and plotted the nuc:ER ratios for the unstressed and stressed cells as histograms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). The distributions showed a wide range of responses within the population of cells in each well. To compare wells treated with different inhibitors, we extracted from these distributions a single metric representing the percentage of stressed cells for each well, as described in the Methods. This allowed us to convert single cell measurements of GFP-ATF6α from the images to compare across plates. We performed these analyses in biological triplicates. Statistical evaluation of unstressed and stressed controls yielded a mean Z’ of 0.7 +/- 0.18, which is an exceptionally robust read-out for a cell- and image-based high-throughput assay. We further validated the analyses using S1P inhibitor as a positive control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E and F</xref>).

We next assessed compounds displaying well-shaped dose-response curves and IC<sub>50</sub>’s &lt; 19 μM in both Tg and Tm ERSE-luciferase assays for their ability to inhibit induction of endogenous ATF6α target genes, GRP78 (encoding the ER HSP70 BiP) and HERPUD1 (encoding a ubiquitin-domain-containing protein involved in ERAD) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yamamoto et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adachi et al., 2008</xref>). This qPCR assay did not rely on the presence of reporters and proved the most stringent (a workflow for the screen is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). Of the Class 1 inhibitors, only one consistently blocked ATF6α target gene upregulation: Ceapin-A1 ('A1' standing for Analog 1 the founding compound in the series described below).</p><p>Ceapin-A1 inhibited both ERSE-luciferase induction by both Tg (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) and Tm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>) and induction of GRP78 mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) with an IC<sub>50</sub> = 4.7 ± 1.1 μM and to the same extent as the S1P inhibitor. Inhibition of IRE1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cross et al., 2012</xref>) had little effect in the same assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>). In contrast, inhibition of the integrated stress response (ISR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sidrauski et al., 2013</xref>) showed a decrease in ATF6α target gene induction, as previously reported for PERK knockout cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wu et al., 2007</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). By these criteria, Ceapin-A1 behaved like a selective inhibitor of ATF6α.</p><p>Since Ceapin-A1 treatment of stressed cells resulted in the same punctate localization of GFP- ATF6α as the S1P inhibitor in the nuclear translocation assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref>), we next investigated if Ceapin-A1 was in fact an S1P inhibitor. To this end, we monitored the processing of endogenous SREBP1 in HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Cells grown in lipoprotein-deficient media activate SREBP processing, indicated by the presence of faster migrating, cleaved SREBP-N (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, lanes 1 and 11). This cleavage was blocked by the addition of either sterols (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, lanes 2 and 12) or increasing concentrations of the S1P inhibitor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, lanes 7–10) to the cell culture media. Addition of Ceapin-A1 to 25 μM (&gt; five times its IC<sub>50</sub>) had no effect on lipoprotein depletion-mediated SREBP processing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, lanes 3–6). Therefore, Ceapin-A1 neither inhibits S1P nor S2P and emerges as the first small molecule inhibitor of ATF6 that does not inhibit SREBP or other pathways known to use these proteases.</p><p>We then analyzed the cleavage of ATF6α directly, using a stable HEK293 based cell line that expressed FLAG-tagged ATF6α from an inducible promoter. Induction of ER stress led to cleavage of full-length ATF6α to produce the faster migrating, active transcription factor ATF6α-N (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, lanes 1 and 2). Surprisingly, in the presence of the S1P inhibitor, ER stress-induced cleavage of ATF6α was not blocked (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, lanes 3 and 4). This was unexpected, given that inhibition of S1P prevented both nuclear translocation of GFP- ATF6α (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and F</xref>) and upregulation of ATF6α target genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">3</xref>). As a first clue on how to resolve the paradox, we observed that the cleavage product, henceforth referred to as ATF6α-M, produced in the presence of the S1P inhibitor migrated more slowly on SDS polyacrylamide gels than the product ATF6α-N produced by ER stress alone.</p><p>We next analyzed the subcellular localization of ATF6α-M using differential centrifugation. In contrast to ER stressed cells, where ATF6α was recovered in the membrane fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, lane 12) and ATF6α-N is in the nuclear fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, lane 7), both ATF6α and ATF6α-M were recovered in in the membrane fraction in cells treated with ER stress inducer and the S1P inhibitor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, lane 14). We therefore denoted this fragment as ATF6α-M, since it remains membrane-bound and as such is incapable of entering the nucleus and activating ATF6α target genes. The transmembrane protein PERK and the transcription factor ATF4 served as controls for membrane and nuclear fractions respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). We observed the same fragment in cells expressing a variant of ATF6α, in which the S1P cleavage site was mutated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>), indicating that an alternate protease generated ATF6α-M and that ATF6α-M was not a substrate for subsequent membrane-release by S2P cleavage. Importantly, cells treated with both ER stress inducer and Ceapin-A1 did not show any ATF6α cleavage product (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, lanes 5, 10, 15). This difference strongly suggested that the mechanism of inhibition of ATF6α processing by Ceapin-A1 is not via protease inhibition, but that ATF6α is trapped in a place or state where it cannot be cleaved. For this reason, we chose to name the chemical scaffold of the inhibitor 'Ceapin', after the Irish verb ‘ceap’ meaning to trap.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Synthesis of a more potent Ceapin scaffold analog: Ceapin-A7</title><p>The original hit Ceapin-A1 is an <italic>N</italic>-benzyl pyrazol-4-yl amide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). We used the ERSE-luciferase assay to guide structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies aimed at defining the essential pharmacophore within the Ceapin scaffold. We found that all four rings present in Ceapin-A1 are necessary for activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Thus, deletion of the furan ring (as in Ceapin-A2) led to a loss of detectable activity in the ERSE-luciferase assay. Among several aryl and heteroaryl rings examined in place of the furan, only a simple phenyl ring as in Ceapin-A3 (IC<sub>50</sub> 6.9 ± 0.7) afforded activity comparable to Ceapin-A1 (IC<sub>50</sub> = 4.9 ± 1.2 μM). The benzyl substituent on the pyrazole ring was similarly sensitive to modification. Thus, analogs lacking the ortho and para chloro substituents (Ceapin-A4) or bearing methyl in place of the benzyl group (Ceapin-A5) were inactive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and D</xref>). Further SAR of ring substitution in the benzyl side chain revealed that substitution at both the ortho and para position with spheroid hydrophobes was optimal for activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Thus, the 2,4-dibromobenzyl analog Ceapin-A6 was about two-fold more potent than Ceapin-A1, while the corresponding bis-trifluoromethyl congener Ceapin-A7 (IC<sub>50</sub> = 0.59 ± 0.17 μM) was approximately ten-fold more potent than Ceapin-A1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C and D</xref>). In contrast, analogs bearing a single trifluoromethyl group at either the para (Ceapin-A8) or ortho position (Ceapin-A9) were notably less potent than Ceapin-A7.

Cells treated with both Tm and Ceapin-A7 contained the unglycosylated form of ATF6α but not ATF6α-N (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, lane 3), indicating that despite the accumulation of unglycosylated proteins, ATF6α was not cleaved.

ATF6α and ATF6β show 41% identity in their amino acid sequences, with both S1P and S2P cleavage sites conserved.

Given the similarity between these related proteins, we next tested if Ceapins inhibit processing of ATF6β in response to ER stress. To this end, we treated U2-OS cells either with Tg or Tm in the absence or presence of increasing concentrations of Ceapin-A7 or with S1P inhibitor and analyzed the migration pattern of both endogenous ATF6α and ATF6β-derived bands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>).

To this end, we stained cells with annexin V, which measures phosphoserine flipping as a marker for apoptotic cells, and 7-aminoactinomycin D (7AAD), a membrane impermeable dye taken up only by cells with compromised plasma membranes as a marker for late apoptotic / necrotic cell death. We treated cells with or without ER stressor at different concentrations in the absence or presence of Ceapin-A7 and analyzed the cells by flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Cells treated with Ceapin-A7 alone showed no difference in cell death compared to vehicle alone, consistent with previous work demonstrating that homozygous ATF6α knockout mice are viable and fertile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yamamoto et al., 2007</xref>). At low concentrations of ER stress (10 nM Tg), inhibition of ATF6α did not enhance cytotoxicity, however as the concentration of ER stressor was increased (30 nM and 90 nM), ATF6α inhibition resulted in a two-fold increase in apoptotic cells compared to cells treated with ER stressor alone. Thus human cells treated with ER stress and Ceapin-A7 phenocopy the results obtained using genetic ablation of ATF6α in mouse models. Ceapins therefore define a first-in-class series of ATF6α inhibitors that selectively blocks ATF6α and not ATF6β, SREBP or other UPR branches without relying on inhibition of the proteases that are also used by other critical signaling pathways.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this work we describe the isolation, specificity and chemical refinement of the Ceapin scaffold, the first selective and highly potent pharmacological inhibitors of the ATF6α branch of the UPR. The ATF6α pathway is the least well-understood UPR branch – its mechanism of activation in response to ER stress remains unknown, and the lack of unique enzymes in the pathway precluded development of biochemical assays for screening purposes. Prior to this work, the few compounds shown to inhibit ATF6α signaling (PDI and S1P inhibitors) target important housekeeping enzymes that are shared among multiple pathways and hence elicit pleiotropic effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Maurel et al., 2015</xref>). Indeed, ATF6 was considered 'undruggable' (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Maly and Papa, 2014</xref>). Our study highlights the value of combining chemical biology with cell-based screening to identify precise tools for ‘intractable’ pathways, as amply demonstrated in other pioneering work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cassidy-Stone et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Schreiber et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>To identify Ceapins, we combined cell-based screens to isolate a highly selective inhibitor of ATF6α. Using a broad range of secondary assays for different steps of pathway activation, we built a toolbox of small molecules with which to interrogate ATF6α signaling at different points. We successfully isolated compounds that act both upstream of proteolytic cleavage, corresponding to the early stages of activation of ATF6α, and downstream of nuclear import, corresponding to transcriptional activation. From over 100,000 compounds screened, we found one, Ceapin-A1, that is not only selective for ATF6α but acts precisely at its initial activation stage that currently is the least understood step. As we detail in the accompanying manuscript, Ceapins induce rapid, reversible clustering of ATF6α, preventing exit of ATF6α from the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gallagher and Walter, 2016</xref>).</p><p>Ceapins inhibit activation of ATF6α in response to ER stress without inhibiting ATF6β or SREBP activation, two other ER-bound transcription factors that are similarly trafficked and processed by S1P and S2P in the Golgi apparatus. Ceapins also do not inhibit the IRE1 or PERK branches of the UPR, indicating that the compounds do not generally interfere with sensing ER stress. Further underscoring their high selectivity, Ceapins show no toxicity to unstressed cells, consistent with the fact that ATF6α knockout mice are viable and fertile. Loss of ATF6α becomes detrimental when cells or animals are treated with ER stressors, and Ceapin action mimics this effect. Thus Ceapins promise to be invaluable, first-in-class tools to investigate the role of ATF6α independently or in combination with inhibition of other UPR branches in models of human disease.</p><p>Efforts to study the role of ATF6α in disease models have been limited to knockdown or overexpression experiments. ATF6α was shown to be required for the survival of dormant tumor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Schewe and Aguirre-Ghiso, 2008</xref>). In a cystic fibrosis model, knockdown of ATF6α was shown to increase delivery of the poorly folded △F508 variant of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator to the plasma membrane where it could function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kerbiriou et al., 2007</xref>). Thus ATF6α inhibitors could be beneficial in diseases where decreased ER quality control would ameliorate cell function. In contrast, enhancing ATF6α activity using inducible activation of ATF6α-N increased quality control of protein folding in the ER and decreased secretion and extracellular aggregation of amyloidogenic proteins involved in light chain amyloidosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cooley et al., 2014</xref>). Ceapins offer a new strategy to investigate the role of ATF6α in existing disease models without requiring the introduction of knockdown or overexpression constructs. While the pharmacokinetic properties of current Ceapin analogs limit their usefulness in animal studies, continued SAR studies to improve metabolic stability offer promise for the future.</p><p>Much is made in reviews about the therapeutic potential of modulating the UPR and proteostasis networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ryno et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lindquist and Kelly, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brandvold and Morimoto, 2015</xref>). While there has been an explosion in small molecule modulators of the UPR, it is still unclear which kinds of modulations open therapeutic windows for individual disease states. Some cell types exclusively activate one branch, others all three, and often it is not even clear whether down- or up-regulation of one branch or the other would lead to the desired outcome. In the UPR network, extensive cross-talk between the three branches further complicates the issue, with both compensation and interdependence between the UPR branches having implications for how to manage UPR modulation for therapeutic benefit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wu et al., 2007</xref>). For example, both PERK and ATF6 act downstream of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) mediated cell survival and angiogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Karali et al., 2014</xref>). Additionally, inhibition of IRE1 alone in models of diabetes led to hyper-activation of ATF6 that led to severe nephropathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Madhusudhan et al., 2015</xref>). As these examples illustrate, appreciating the level of cross talk and compensation between UPR branches is essential to the design of successful UPR-based therapeutic strategies. To date, this was only possible for IRE1 and PERK. With the identification of Ceapins, we finally have tools to modulate all three branches and to unleash the full potential of UPR modulation that has remained theoretical up to this point.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plasmid construction</title><sec id="s4-1-1"><title>ERSE-luciferase reporter</title><p>A DNA sequence containing 5 copies of the ERSE element: <named-content content-type="author-callout-style1">CCAAT</named-content>CGGCGGCCT<named-content content-type="author-callout-style2">CCACG</named-content> (red = NF-Y binding, blue = ATF6 binding) spaced by nine nucleotides was synthesized, PCR amplified with 5’ BglII and 3’ Acc65I overhangs and cloned using BglII / Acc65I into pGL4.28 (Promega, E846A) which contains a minimal CMV promoter upstream of the luc2CP gene, a synthetically derived luciferase sequence with humanized codon optimization and hCL1 and PEST destabilization sequences.

The means of three independent experiments performed in duplicate were graphed in GraphPad Prism.</p></sec><sec id="s4-23"><title>Abbreviations used</title><p>7AAD: 7-aminoactinomycin D</p><p>ATF: Activating Transcription Factor</p><p>CFTR: Cystic Fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator</p><p>CHOP: CCAAT-enhancer binding proteins (C/EBP) Homologous Protein</p><p>CMV: Cytomegalovirus</p><p>ERSE: ER Stress response Element</p><p>GFP: Green Fluorescent Protein</p><p>GRP: Glucose Regulated Protein</p><p>HEK293T: Human embryonic Kidney 293T cells.</p><p>IRE1: Inositol Requiring Enzyme One</p><p>MCP: Minimal cytomegaloviral promoter</p><p>PERK: Protein Kinase R (PKR)-like Endoplasmic Reticulum Kinase</p><p>RIDD: Regulated IRE1-Dependent Decay</p><p>Tg: Thapsigargin</p><p>Tm: Tunicamycin</p><p>U2-OS: U2 Osteosarcoma cells</p><p>UPRE: Unfolded Protein Response Element</p><p>VEGF: Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor</p><p>XBP1: X-box Binding Protein One</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors thank Carmela Sidrauski and Diego Acosta-Alvear for valuable input on high-throughput screening of UPR pathways and Samantha Zeitlin for input on high-content screening.

Using a cell-based reporter screen, just over 100K compounds were screened with extensive secondary screens to yield a single compound designated Ceapin-A1 that specifically inhibits ATF6α activation without effect on other arms of the UPR nor interfering with basic mechanisms involved in ATF6α processing. The molecule was altered further to yield several variants including inactive Ceapin-A5 and a higher potency Ceapin-A7. This is the first time the ATF6α pathway has been successfully &quot;drugged&quot; and completes the range of inhibitors for all three arms of the mammalian UPR. Interestingly, the authors also shed new light on the SKI-1/S1P inhibitor pf-429242's effect on ATF6 processing, which was previously not known in detail as it was used primarily to study its effects on viral membrane proteins.</p><p>Minor points:</p><p>1) Introduction, second paragraph: &quot;principle&quot; should be &quot;principal&quot;; &quot;co-operatively&quot; should be corrected.</p><p>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>.

Does this apply to Ceapin-A1? If so, please indicate the range. In other words, are a fraction of cells entirely unresponsive?</italic> </p><p>We have now included these data as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>. The range for Ceapin-A1 is similar to the other treatments – the difference between treatments is not the range per se but the position of the histogram on the X-axis. In the secondary screen, a fraction of the cells are indeed unresponsive to Ceapin-A1 (see where the threshold crosses the histogram for Ceapin-A1). This concentration of this aliquot of Ceapin-A1 inhibits nuclear translocation of GFP-ATF6 to 35.07 ± 18.15%.</p><p>This low activity is because the concentration of active Ceapin-A1 tested in the secondary screen is below its IC<sub>50</sub>. Ceapin-A1 in the library is less active than repurchased stocks (IC<sub>50</sub> of 8.49 μM compared to 4.9 ± 1.2 μM in ERSE-luciferase assays). Additionally, for the secondary screen all compounds were tested at a single concentration of 6.6 μM, which is below the IC<sub>50</sub> of the library aliquot of Ceapin-A1. For this reason, these data were not included in the original version of the manuscript as they report on the potency of Ceapin-A1 in the library stock and not the potency of fresh stocks.</p><p><italic>7) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>: The authors should comment on why the compounds that passed through multiple filters should act so poorly on activation of endogenous genes.</italic> </p><p>We do not know the reason for this discrepancy. We exclusively focused on the Ceapin series after obtaining the results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>, which validated the effects of the compound on endogenous gene expression and additionally had an increased stringency filter applied.

We performed differential centrifugation on U2-OS cells and looked for endogenous ATF6α and ATF6β. We detected both ATF6α-N and ATF6β-N in the nuclear extract of cells subjected to ER stress.</p><p>Although both ATF6α and ATF6β were cleaved in ER stressed cells treated with the site-1 protease inhibitor, analogous to the full-length proteins, neither cleavage product was detected in the nuclear fraction, indicating that neither ATF6α-N nor ATF6β-N were generated. These data suggest that the cleavage product detected by the anti-ATF6β antibody is ATF6β-M.</p><p>In ER stressed cells treated with Ceapin-A7 we reproducibly found that while ATF6α is not cleaved and there is no ATF6α-N in the nuclear fraction, ATF6β is cleaved and ATF6β-N is present in the nuclear fraction. These data strengthen the argument that Ceapins specifically inhibit processing of ATF6α but not ATF6β.</p><p><italic>12) Abstract, the phrase &quot;detrimental in cancer models&quot; is confusing.
