Nevertheless, macrophages engulf a portion of the hypha, generating incompletely sealed tubular phagosomes. These frustrated phagosomes are stabilized by a thick cuff of F-actin that polymerizes in response to non-canonical activation of integrins by fungal glycan. Despite their continuity, the surface and invaginating phagosomal membranes retain a strikingly distinct lipid composition. PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> is present at the plasmalemma but is not detectable in the phagosomal membrane, while PtdIns(3)P and PtdIns(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> co-exist in the phagosomes yet are absent from the surface membrane. Moreover, endo-lysosomal proteins are present only in the phagosomal membrane. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching revealed the presence of a diffusion barrier that maintains the identity of the open tubular phagosome separate from the plasmalemma. Formation of this barrier depends on Syk, Pyk2/Fak and formin-dependent actin assembly. Antimicrobial mechanisms can thereby be deployed, limiting the growth of the hyphae.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34798.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Billions of microorganisms live on, and in, the human body. Known as the human microbiome, most of these microscopic hitchhikers are harmless. But, for people with a compromised immune system, common species can sometimes cause disease. For example, the yeast <italic>Candida albicans</italic>, which colonises between 30 and 70% of the population, is normally harmless, but can switch to a disease-causing version that makes branching structures called hyphae. These hyphae grow fast, piercing and damaging the tissues around them.</p><p>Immune cells called macrophages usually engulf invading microbes. These cells recognise sugars on the outside of <italic>C. albicans</italic>, and respond by wrapping their membranes around the yeast, drawing the microorganism in, and sealing it into closed structures called phagosomes. Then, the macrophages fill the phagosomes with acid, enzymes and destructive chemicals, which breaks the yeast down. Yet, <italic>C. albicans</italic> hyphae grow larger than macrophages, making them difficult to control.</p><p>Maxson et al. have now tracked the immune response revealing how macrophages try to control large hyphae. The immune cells were quick to engulf <italic>C. albicans</italic> in its normal yeast form, but the response slowed down in the presence of hyphae. Electron microscopy revealed that the large structures were only partly taken in. Rather than form a closed phagosome, the macrophages made a cuff around the middle of the hypha, leaving the rest hanging out.</p><p>The process starts with a receptor called CR3, which detects sugars on the outside of the hyphae. CR3 is a type of integrin, a molecule that sends signals from the surface to the inside of the immune cell. A network of filaments called actin assemble around the hypha, squeezing the membrane tight. The macrophage then deploys free radicals and other damaging chemicals inside the closed space. The seal is not perfect, and some molecules do leak out, but the effect slows the growth of the yeast. When a phagosome cannot engulf an invading microbe, a state that is referred to as being “frustrated”, the leaking of damaging chemicals can harm healthy tissues and lead to inflammation and disease.</p><p>These findings reveal that macrophages do at least try to form a complete seal before releasing their cocktail of chemicals. Understanding how the immune system handles this situation could open the way for new treatments for <italic>C. albicans</italic> infections, and possibly similar diseases related to “frustrated engulfment” (such as asbestos exposure, where asbestos fibers are also too large to engulf). However, one next step will be to find out what happens to partly engulfed hyphae, and how this differs from the fate of fully engulfed yeast.</p></abstract><kwd-group

that colonizes the epithelial surfaces of 30–70% of healthy individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Perlroth et al., 2007</xref>). However, in immune-compromised individuals, <italic>C. albicans</italic> can cause invasive, life-threatening disease. The mortality rate for infected patients is 46–75%, with candidiasis classified as the fourth most common nosocomial bloodstream infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Brown et al., 2012</xref>). Invasive candidiasis is correlated with a switch of <italic>C. albicans</italic> from its yeast form to a hyphal form, a shift that can be induced in vitro by nutrient deprivation among other cues (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Sudbery, 2011</xref>). In vivo, <italic>C. albicans</italic> hyphae are capable of invading epithelium and endothelium; in addition <italic>C. albicans</italic> is capable of forming recalcitrant biofilms and inducing inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Sudbery, 2011</xref>). These conditions activate host defense mechanisms for the control and clearance of <italic>C. albicans</italic>, mounted predominantly by phagocytic cells of the innate immune system.</p><p>Phagocytes can effectively sense, internalize and kill invasive <italic>C. albicans.</italic> Accordingly, impairment of the phagocytic response, e.g. by elimination of macrophages and neutrophils, is associated with disseminated candidiasis (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Netea et al., 2015</xref>). Phagocytic cells possess receptors that bind the <italic>C. albicans</italic> cell wall and trigger uptake of the fungus into a phagosome. The <italic>C. albicans</italic> cell wall is composed mostly (80–90%) of polysaccharides, containing ≈ 60% β-(1,3) and -(1,6) glucans, and ≈ 40% O- and N-linked mannans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Ruiz-Herrera et al., 2006</xref>). As such, the main non-opsonic phagocytic receptors for <italic>C. albicans</italic> are the C-type lectin family of receptors, including Dectin1, the mannose receptor, and DC-SIGN (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Hardison and Brown, 2012</xref>). The phagosome typically matures rapidly after closure, evolving into an acidic, degradative and microbicidal compartment. Acquisition of antimicrobial properties by this compartment depends on its ability to accumulate and retain toxic compounds, including reactive oxygen species (ROS). Superoxide produced by the NADPH oxidase undergoes dismutation into hydrogen peroxide in the acidic luminal environment generated by the V-ATPase, which additionally favors the catalytic activity of various hydrolases. Transporters such as NRAMP-1, that antagonize microbial growth by depleting the phagosome of nutrients, also depend on phagosomal H<sup>+</sup> for the extrusion of metal ions.</p><p>Unlike most other microbes, <italic>C. albicans</italic> presents a distinct problem for phagocytes. The hyphal form of <italic>C. albicans</italic> can grow at a rate of 18.8 μm hr<sup>−1</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">GOW and Gooday, 1982</xref>), quickly exceeding the size of the phagocytes themselves. The challenge is greatest for macrophages, which migrate to infection sites later than the polymorphonuclear cells, and thus encounter growing hyphae (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Erwig and Gow, 2016</xref>). Despite being remarkably plastic, macrophages have difficulty engulfing the much larger <italic>C. albicans</italic> hyphae, an impasse that no doubt contributes to the pathogenesis of candidiasis.</p><p>The aim of the current study was to examine the dynamic and complex process of <italic>C. albicans</italic> phagocytosis by macrophages. We found that attempts to engulf large hyphae result in the formation of incomplete (frustrated) phagosomes, which nevertheless segregate a section of the hypha, preferentially exposing it to microbiostatic products. The mechanism and fungal components underlying the formation of the diffusion barrier established by the phagocyte when generating the frustrated phagosome was analyzed using a combination of imaging, pharmacological and genetic approaches.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Phagocytosis of <italic>C. albicans</italic> hyphae</title><p>To optimize the phagocytosis of <italic>C. albicans</italic>, which has a cell wall rich in β-glucans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Gow et al., 2011</xref>), we used RAW 264.7 macrophages stably expressing the Dectin1 receptor (RAW-Dectin1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Esteban et al., 2011</xref>). Yeast or hyphal forms of <italic>C. albicans</italic> expressing BFP (<italic>Candida</italic>-BFP; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Strijbis et al., 2013</xref>) were used as targets to facilitate their visualization. Under the conditions used to generate them, <italic>C. albicans</italic> hyphae were considerably longer (&gt;15 μm) than the macrophages (8–10 μm in diameter). After 1 hr of co-incubation with the macrophages the yeast form was fully engulfed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), while a significant number of hyphal <italic>C. albicans</italic> were only partially internalized (68.5% ± 4.5, while 31.5% ± 4.6 were fully internalized; 1019 events from 12 independent experiments), which was verified using fluorescent concanavalin A to label exposed hyphae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). This was similar to the frustrated engulfment of &gt;20 μm <italic>C. albicans</italic> hyphae reported earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Lewis et al., 2012</xref>). Transmission electron microscopy confirmed that most hyphae were only partially internalized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) and, in addition, revealed the existence around the neck of the frustrated phagosome of a low-contrast structure seemingly devoid of membrane-bound organelles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, inset), previously interpreted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Strijbis et al., 2013</xref> as accumulated actin. Indeed, this region corresponded to an actin-rich cuff-like structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>); F-actin was so highly accumulated at the cuff that the remainder of the cellular actin could only be visualized when images were overexposed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, inset). Note that the remainder (i.e. the base) of the frustrated phagocytic cup was virtually devoid of F-actin. 3D visualization verified the continuous accumulation of F-actin around the neck of the tubular phagosomes lining individual hyphae and its sharp delineation of the intracellular and extracellular portions of the fungus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E,F,G,H</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). This actin cuff was observed for RAW-Dectin1 cells engulfing <italic>C. albicans</italic> hyphae up to 100 μm in size (data not shown), and occurred in 96.3% ± 1.9 of the partially internalized hyphae (674 events analyzed in 12 independent experiments). These data support published accounts of actin cuff-like structures seen during the phagocytosis of various filamentous targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">García-Rodas et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Gerisch et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Heinsbroek et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Prashar et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Strijbis et al., 2013</xref>). The occurrence of frustrated phagocytosis with formation of a pronounced actin cuff was not unique to the RAW-Dectin1 cell line; similar features were seen when murine or human primary macrophages were confronted with <italic>C. albicans</italic> hyphae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>, respectively). The actin cuff was remarkably stable, lasting for at least 90 min without contracting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>). Nevertheless, the actin composing these structures undergoes measurable turnover (treadmilling), since the cuffs underwent gradual disassembly when the cells were treated with latrunculin A, which scavenges actin monomers (last two panels, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>). These long-lasting yet dynamic cuffs identify the frustrated phagocytic cups generated by macrophages attempting to eliminate <italic>C. albicans</italic> hyphae.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34798.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Partial phagocytosis of <italic>C. albicans</italic> hyphae is associated with formation of an actin cuff.</title><p>Phagocytosis of <italic>C. albicans</italic> yeast (<bold>A</bold>) or hypha (<bold>B</bold>) by RAW-Dectin1 cells.

This process involved the recruitment of α- and β-catenins and activation of the Arp2/3 pathway for actin nucleation. In agreement with these reports, we observed E-cadherin and β-catenin accumulation at sites of where <italic>C. albicans</italic> hyphae were being internalized by epithelial A431 cells, with particular accumulation at sites where actin polymerized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). We considered whether a similar mechanism was responsible for the formation of actin cuffs by macrophages. However, neither E-cadherin nor β-catenin was detectable in RAW-Dectin1 cells or in primary human macrophages by immunoblotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) or by immunofluorescence (not illustrated). Under comparable conditions, robust signals were obtained when probing A431 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). When expressed heterologously in macrophages E-cadherin-GFP was found to line the surface membrane, but was absent from the phagocytic cup (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), while β-catenin-GFP was largely soluble and did not accumulate at the cuff (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Thus, E-cadherin and β-catenin are unlikely to mediate phagocytosis of <italic>C. albicans</italic> in macrophages. Nevertheless, low levels of expression of these proteins (below the level of detection of our assays) or other cadherins may have mediated the internalization. This possibility was assessed by treating the cells with EDTA, which chelates the Ca<sup>2+</sup> known to be required for ligand binding by cadherins (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brasch et al., 2012</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, omission of Ca<sup>2+</sup> had no effect on actin cuff formation in <italic>C. albicans</italic>-infected RAW-Dectin1 cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Integrin α<sub>M</sub> β<sub>2</sub> is involved in the formation of the actin cuff</title><p>Actin can also be tethered to the phagocytic cup via integrins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Freeman et al., 2016</xref>). Integrins can be directly or indirectly involved in the phagocytosis of opsonized particles, apoptotic cells and a variety of other targets (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Dupuy and Caron, 2008</xref>) and link with actin filaments via talin and vinculin (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Shattil et al., 2010</xref>). However, canonical integrin activation and ligand binding require divalent cations (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Leitinger et al., 2000</xref>), and would therefore be inhibited by their chelation with EDTA. Moreover, actin cuffs formed normally in CALDAG-GEF1<sup>−/−</sup> macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), consistent with the notion that cuff formation was independent of canonical activation of integrins, which involves Rap1 (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Hogg et al., 2011</xref>). There is, however, one atypical instance where integrin activation can occur in the absence of divalent cations. The α chain of the integrin complement receptor 3 (CR3, also referred to as Mac1), is unique in that it contains a lectin-like domain (LLD) that binds carbohydrates in a divalent cation-independent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Thornton et al., 1996</xref>). The LLD is separate from the I-domain –the conventional ligand-binding domain of integrins (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Ross, 2002</xref>)– and, interestingly, binds fungal β-glucan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Ross et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib126">Vetvicka et al., 1996</xref>). We therefore proceeded to test whether CR3, which consists of α<sub>M</sub> (CD11b) and β<sub>2</sub> (CD18) subunits, is present in the region of the actin cuff. As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, both CD11b and CD18 accumulated in the region of the actin cuff in RAW-Dectin1 cells that had partially internalized <italic>C. albicans</italic> hyphae (CD11b ratio cuff: cup 4.75 ± 0.29; n = 30, p&lt;0.0001; CD18 ratio cuff: cup 4.79 ± 0.28; n = 30, p&lt;0.0001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref> and insets).

We next assessed the role of β(1,3)-glucan through pharmacological inhibition of Fks1 with caspofungin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Douglas et al., 1997</xref>), as genetic depletion of Fks1 results in defects in hyphae formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ben-Ami et al., 2011</xref>). Remarkably, the ability to form actin cuffs was greatly reduced in <italic>C. albicans</italic> grown and allowed to form hyphae in the presence of caspofungin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E and F</xref>). The inhibitory effect of caspofungin on actin cuff formation was dose-dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>), reaching ≈ 80% at 5 ng mL<sup>−1</sup> caspofungin, a dose that reduced the β(1,3)-glucan content of the wall by 55.3%, as assessed by aniline blue staining. Actin cuff formation around caspofungin-treated hyphae could not be rescued by serum opsonization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>), suggesting that β(1,3)-glucan is the ligand that promotes actin cuff assembly via CR3.

SFK inhibition by PP2 following adherence of the hyphae to RAW-Dectin1 cells had no effect on actin cuff formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>).

Accordingly, Rac1 and/or Cdc42 were seemingly involved in the marked polymerization of actin at the cuff. This was indicated by the recruitment of PAK(PBD), a biosensor of the active (GTP-bound) form of these GTPases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Benard et al., 1999</xref>), that accumulated at the cuff to levels ≥4 fold higher than along the cup. F-actin accumulation at the cuff was sensitive to the formin inhibitor SMI-FH2, but not to the Arp2/3 inhibitor CK-666 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). Together, these data suggest that activation of Syk and Pyk2/Fak by CR3 leads to activation of Rho-family GTPases, culminating in formin-mediated actin assembly, a process akin to focal adhesion formation (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib127">Vicente-Manzanares et al., 2005</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Phospholipid segregation between the plasma membrane and the cuff-delimited phagosomal cup</title><p>Phospholipids undergo striking changes during the course of conventional phagocytosis.

The existence of a diffusion barrier was confirmed by expressing the N-terminal domain of Lyn (Lyn<sub>11</sub>) tagged with GFP. This region of the protein becomes myristoylated and palmitoylated, targeting it to the plasma membrane and, to a lesser extent, to early endosomes. Following frustrated phagocytosis of hyphae, Lyn<sub>11</sub>-GFP is found both at the membrane and in the phagosomal cup, where its density is lower, likely because of dilution caused by insertion of unlabeled endomembranes. We analyzed comparatively small phagosomes to enable photobleaching of Lyn<sub>11</sub>-GFP in the entire cup (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). Strikingly, the fluorescence of the cup failed to recover, despite the persistence of abundant Lyn<sub>11</sub>-GFP in the adjacent plasmalemma. In three independent experiments only 19% of the original fluorescence reappeared, possibly via fusion with Lyn<sub>11</sub>-GFP-containing early endosomes. Failure to recover was not attributable to immobility of Lyn<sub>11</sub>-GFP in the membrane, which displayed very fast and nearly complete recovery following photobleaching (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D,E</xref>). These data confirm that the region of the actin cuff acts as a lateral diffusion barrier, separating the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane from that of the open phagocytic cup.</p><p>It is noteworthy that while the barrier curtails the diffusion of lipids and proteins anchored to lipids on the inner leaflet of the membrane, exofacial lipids and lipid-associated proteins readily traverse the junction between the membrane and the tubular phagosome. This was demonstrated by incorporation of rhodamine-labeled PtdEth to the surface membrane following stabilization of the frustrated phagosome. The labeled lipid, which inserts into the outer leaflet of the plasmalemma, reached the entire membrane of the frustrated phagocytic cup within ≈5 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Similarly, fluorescent cholera toxin B subunit, which binds to exofacial ganglioside GM<sub>1</sub>, promptly entered the phagocytic cup (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Thus, the actin-dependent diffusion barrier selectively restricted the mobility of components of the inner leaflet, including transmembrane proteins, while exofacial lipids remained able to traverse the junction.</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>Examining the role of CR3 and actin in the maintenance of diffusional barriers</title><p>How is the diffusion barrier generated? We speculated that the molecular crowding resulting from tight clustering of integrins and their ancillary proteins could restrict the diffusion of membrane-associated components across the cuff. To test this possibility, we investigated whether sufficient molecular crowding could be generated to exclude other membrane components from regions of integrin clustering. To this end, we used antibody-induced cross-linking, a strategy shown earlier to induce the formation of CR3 patches on the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Fukushima et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Pavan et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib135">Zhou et al., 1993</xref>). Whether exclusion could be induced by molecular crowding was assessed analyzing the distribution of CD2-CD45-GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>), a transmembrane protein having a short, 7 nm ectodomain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cordoba et al., 2013</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>, prior to cross-linking both CD2-CD45-GFP and CR3 were distributed diffusely throughout the membrane, overlapping extensively at the resolution of the confocal microscope. The CD2-CD45-GFP fluorescence intensity in CR3-positive regions compared to the average CD2-CD45-GFP fluorescence intensity of the entire plasma membrane averaged 0.69 ± 0.01 (585 CR3-positive regions in 20 cells from three different experiments). After antibody treatment, CR3 clustered into large, dense patches. Strikingly, CD2-CD45-GFP was largely (81%) and significantly (p&gt;0.0001) excluded from such patches, where the fluorescence was only 0.13 ± 0.01 of the plasmalemmal average (measured in 472 CR3 patches in 15 cells from three experiments). Importantly, the exclusion was not alleviated by treatment with latrunculin A, the fluorescence of the patches averaging 0.12 ± 0.01 of the plasmalemmal average (measured in 445 patches in 18 cells from three experiments), implying that the actin cytoskeleton is not involved in the domain segregation. CD2-CD45-GFP exclusion did not differ between these two conditions (p=0.66). We concluded that integrins could be sufficiently clustered to exclude other membrane components. By forming a continuous and thick ring around the neck of the frustrated phagosome, the molecular crowding of clustered integrins could generate a diffusional barrier.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34798.029</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Clustering and patching of CR3 forms a diffusional barrier that excludes transmembrane proteins.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Raw-Dectin1 cells transiently expressing CD2-CD45-GFP (left panel, green) and stained for external CD18 (middle panel, red).

As such, an intact actin cuff is required to establish and maintain the barrier to phosphoinositides or transmembrane proteins. This was validated in cells that had formed a stable frustrated phagosome around <italic>C. albicans</italic> hyphae and were then treated with latrunculin A, which was shown earlier (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>) to cause gradual disassembly of the cuff. PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> –which in untreated cells is excluded from the phagocytic cup (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9A</xref>)– gained access to the entire cup when actin was disassembled by latrunculin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>). The PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> present in the cup, expressed relative to the plasmalemma, increased 4.88 times after latrunculin treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>). Conversely, LAMP1 –that is restricted to the cup in untreated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9D</xref>)– was able to reach the surface membrane following treatment with latrunculin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9E</xref>).

It was therefore conceivable that the cells established the diffusion barrier in an effort to generate a microbicidal compartment, despite their inability to form a sealed vacuole. Acidification of the lumen, secretion of antimicrobial enzymes and peptides and deployment of the NADPH oxidase are among the principal mechanisms used by leukocytes to eliminate pathogens. We first tested the ability of frustrated phagosomes to generate and maintain an acidic lumen, using the fluorescent acidotropic dye LysoBrite Red dye. As expected, the dye accumulated in lysosomes; however, it was never found to concentrate inside the frustrated phagosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A</xref>), suggesting that vacuolar ATPases are not functional on its membrane and/or that the junction separating the lumen from the extracellular milieu is permeable to H<sup>+</sup>. That the latter interpretation is correct was suggested by determinations of permeability of the junction using dextrans of varying size. For these experiments lysosomes were loaded with either 10 kDa or 70 kDa fluorescent dextran and then exposed to <italic>C. albicans</italic> hyphae. The dextrans were delivered into fully formed (sealed) phagosomes, where they were clearly retained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The smaller (10 kDa) dextran, however, was not detectable inside frustrated phagosomes; the reduced overall staining of the cells (<italic>cf.</italic> main panel and inset in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B</xref>) suggests that secretion of lysosomes did occur, but that the dextran must have escaped the confines of the frustrated phagosome. In contrast, the 70 kDa dextran was readily visible along the frustrated phagosome, implying that its diffusion into the external medium was limited. Thus, a size-selective filter determined the extent to which solutes were retained within the frustrated phagosome. The cut-off of this filter must be greater than ≈50 kDa, because cathepsin D, a globular protein of ≈28 kDa, managed to escape the frustrated phagosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10D</xref>), yet was routinely detected in sealed phagosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

Indeed, we were able to detect preferential deposition of formazan, a product of the reaction of superoxide with nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT), inside frustrated phagosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10E</xref>).

We reasoned that the antimicrobial effectors may not suffice to kill the fungus, yet their effects may manifest as an observable change in the rate of hyphal extension, which can average 0.31 µm min<sup>−1</sup> on serum agar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">GOW and Gooday, 1982</xref>). When measured in RPMI medium without serum (wthout macrophages present) <italic>C. albican</italic>s hyphae grew at a rate of 0.22 µm min<sup>−1</sup> ±0.03. Remarkably, the extension rate of partially internalized hyphae, which displayed an actin cuff, was significantly reduced (0.11 µm min<sup>−1</sup> ±0.01). This reduced growth rate was not different (p=0.742) to that of fully internalized hyphae (0.108 µm min<sup>−1</sup> ±0.011). In the same experiments, neighboring <italic>C. albicans</italic> hyphae not in contact with macrophages grew at a rate of 0.198 µm min<sup>−1</sup> ±0.014, indistinguishable from that measured in the absence of macrophages.

Indeed, the RAW-Dectin1 cell line used for some of our studies was created to allow efficient internalization of fungal zymosan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Esteban et al., 2011</xref>), and has been used to study <italic>C. albicans</italic>-macrophage interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Strijbis et al., 2013</xref>). Dectin1 signaling leads to robust production of reactive oxygen species by the NADPH oxidase in response to fungal ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Brown et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Goodridge et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Underhill et al., 2005</xref>), accounting for our observation that superoxide is detected within the frustrated phagocytic cup. Remarkably, however, Dectin1 did not concentrate in the region of the membrane adjacent to the actin cuff where the diffusion barrier was established. Instead, integrin α<sub>M</sub>β<sub>2</sub> (CR3, or CD11b/CD18) was found to accumulate in this region.</p><p>Engagement of CR3 at the cuff is required for the formation of the underlying actin cuff, a process likely mediated by talin and vinculin, which were also found accumulated at the site. The entire assembly appears central to the establishment of the diffusion barrier, which is lost when blocking CR3 binding with the M1/70 antibody and also when latrunculin is used to disassemble actin filaments. CR3 is unique amongst integrins in that its α domain contains a lectin-like domain (LLD) capable of binding fungal β-glucan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Ross et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib126">Vetvicka et al., 1996</xref>). This LLD, located at the membrane-proximal C terminus (between residues 943–1047; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Lu et al., 1998</xref>) is distinct from the traditional ligand-binding I domain. Importantly, the LLD can bind β-glucan in a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent manner while the integrin is in the inactive, bent conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Thornton et al., 1996</xref>). Binding of glucan has been shown to induce a semi-active conformation of the integrin that is predicted to facilitate outside-in signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">O'Brien et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib126">Vetvicka et al., 1996</xref>). We found that Dectin1 did not have a direct role in actin cuff formation, being instead required for adhesion and the initiation of phagocytosis. Interestingly, when Dectin1 expression is low, the deposition of opsonins contained in serum –including complement and possibly also anti-<italic>Candida</italic> antibodies– suffice to engage CR3 and promote actin cuff formation directly activating this process, as predicted from earlier observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Boxx et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Kozel et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib126">Vetvicka et al., 1996</xref>). Dectin1 signaling can initiate inside-out activation of CR3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Li et al., 2011</xref>). However, conventional Rap1-dependent inside-out signaling mediated by CalDAG-GEF1 was dispensable for actin cuff formation, as were divalent cations. Therefore, it is likely that CR3 binds fungal β-glucan in a manner that does not require inside-out activation by Dectin1.</p><p>We showed that mannan, a ligand for the mannose receptor, had no effect on actin cuff formation. The utilization of a curated set of <italic>C. albicans</italic> GRACE strains confirmed that mannan was dispensable and further excluded chitin and β(1,6)-glucan as ligands for cuff formation. Importantly, caspofungin inhibition of β(1,3)-glucan synthesis blocked formation of the cuff, in a dose dependent manner. These observations are in accord with involvement of the LLD of CR3, which was previously demonstrated to ligate β-glucan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Mueller et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Thornton et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib126">Vetvicka et al., 1996</xref>). Clearly, β-glucan is also a ligand for Dectin 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Brown and Gordon, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Brown et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Palma et al., 2006</xref>), and initial engagement of this receptor is required for formation of actin cuffs around unopsonized hyphae. However, β(1,3)-glucan appears to play a distinct role in CR3-mediated actin cuff formation, as the effects of caspofungin could not be rescued by serum opsonization, with the caveat that caspofungin treatment may have affected complement deposition on <italic>C. albicans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Boxx et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Kozel et al., 1987</xref>), although we regard this as unlikely because the fungal cell wall is rich in other polysaccharides and proteins that can serve to attach complement.</p><p>Our observations implicate clustered CR3 as an initiator of actin polymerization and a key constituent of the diffusion barrier. The signals mediating this effect include activation of Syk, which had been reported earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Strijbis et al., 2013</xref>), and also of Pyk2 and Fak. The latter related kinases were enriched at the cuff and dual inhibition by PF573228 blocked cuff formation. Along with activated Syk, Pyk2 and Fak have been shown to interact with β<sub>2</sub> integrins, including CR3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Duong and Rodan, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Fernandez and Suchard, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Han et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Hildebrand et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Kamen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Mócsai et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Raab et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Rubel et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib129">Wang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib132">Yan and Novak, 1999</xref>). Pyk2, in particular, is required for paxillin and Vav1 activation during integrin engagement and CR3-mediated phagocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Kamen et al., 2011</xref>). Paxillin was proposed to act as a scaffold, bridging integrin-initiated complexes with Rho-GTPases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Deakin and Turner, 2008</xref>), and Vav1, previously identified as important for the phagocytosis of <italic>C. albicans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Strijbis et al., 2013</xref>), also links β<sub>2</sub> integrins to the activation of Cdc42, Rac1 and RhoA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Gakidis et al., 2004</xref>). These signaling events appear conserved during the frustrated phagocytosis of <italic>C. albicans</italic> hyphae, as we detected paxillin and active Rac1/Cdc42 at the actin cuff, and Vav1 was found to be enriched in actin cuff-like structures around <italic>C. albicans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Strijbis et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>The activation of the Rho family GTPases is linked to both formin- and Arp2/3- mediated actin dynamics. The actin cuffs formed around <italic>C. albicans</italic> hyphae were singularly sensitive to SM1-FH2 –and therefore dependent on formin-mediated linear actin polymerization– and not to inhibitors of the Arp2/3 complex that promotes branched actin polymerization. Interestingly, Rac1 and Cdc42 interact with actin-nucleating formins of the mDia family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Lammers et al., 2008</xref>). Collectively, our findings support a model whereby CR3 initiates signaling through Syk and Pyk2/Fak, leading to activation of Vav1 and Rho GTPases, culminating in formin-dependent actin nucleation.</p><p>Our studies show that the integrin/actin cuff separates the open phagocytic cup from the plasma membrane, appearing to act as a boundary that segregates distinct and mobile membrane domains. There was a clear segregation of phosphoinositides between the plasma membrane (PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>) and the open cup (PtdIns(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> and PtdIns(3)P). In principle, such separation could stem from the differential and strategic localization of kinases and/or phosphatases in the two membranes and in the junctional complex. However, we also observed slowly convertible (LC3) or non-convertible lipid-anchored proteins (constitutively-active Rab7) and transmembrane proteins (LAMP1) to be retained in the phagocytic cup, unable to reach the surface membrane. FRAP studies confirmed that these molecules were freely mobile within the phagocytic cup, pointing to the integrin/actin cuff as the diffusion barrier.</p><p>While antibody-induced clustering of CR3 was sufficient to form an actin-independent diffusional barrier, actin was required to maintain the barrier function of the cuff during phagocytosis of hyphae. Actin can stabilize integrins in their active conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Kaizuka et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Lavi et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Lavi et al., 2012</xref>), and such stabilization is likely required to maintain the cuff during extended frustrated phagocytosis. Actin-dependent diffusional barriers have been invoked in other systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Golebiewska et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Nakada et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Prashar et al., 2013</xref>), although the pickets that anchor the cytoskeletal fence and restrict the diffusion of membrane components had not been previously identified.</p><p>We also analyzed the functional consequences of the establishment of the cuff and diffusion barrier. By segregating the two domains, the barrier enabled the open phagocytic cup to undergo an atypical maturation, despite the fact that scission from the surface membrane never occurred. This enabled targeting and activation within the frustrated phagosome of the NADPH oxidase, which generated toxic superoxide in the immediate vicinity of the portion of the hypha that had been engulfed. Thus, a crucial means for <italic>C. albicans</italic> control during infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Sasada and Johnston, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Brothers et al., 2013</xref>) remains operational in the frustrated phagosomes.</p><p>The observation that the tubular phagosomes were rich in LAMP1, a prototypic lysosomal marker, suggests that lysosomal hydrolases must have been secreted also into the phagosomal lumen. These were, however, not well retained by the phagosomes because, despite the tight seal that separated the inner leaflet of the membrane, the junction separating the aqueous compartments (i.e. the lumen from the extracellular space) was not perfectly tight. While 70 kDa dextran was retained within the phagosome, 10 kDa dextran was not, resembling the findings in frustrated <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> phagosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Prashar et al., 2013</xref>) and indicating the establishment of a sieve that excluded molecules with a hydrodynamic radius greater than ≈ 6–8 nm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Nicholson and Tao, 1993</xref>). Cathepsin family members (radius ≈ 2.4 nm; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Fazili and Qasim, 1986</xref>) and similarly-sized hydrolases would therefore eventually escape the lumen. Nevertheless, because a partial seal is formed, their rate of loss might be slowed, allowing hydrolases and other antimicrobial molecules to act on the partially internalized <italic>C. albicans</italic> hyphae before exiting the open cup. Fast-acting antimicrobial agents, like ROS, released in close proximity to the target would be expected to be at least partially effective. Consistent with this hypothesis, partially internalized <italic>C. albicans</italic> hyphae exhibited a reduced growth rate compared to external hyphae. Importantly, this growth restriction was abolished upon antibody blockade of CR3 and loss of actin cuff formation, presumably a result of increased leakage of phagosome contents. In this case, agents such as ROS, would not reach sufficient concentration to manifest the microbiostatic effect. However, leakage of phagosomal contents or ROS does not explain the failure of the frustrated phagosomes to kill the fungus, because <italic>C. albicans</italic> yeast and hyphae survive also within fully sealed phagosomes.</p><p>Based on the preceding considerations, we hypothesize that the integrin/actin cuff is generated and maintained by macrophages as a means to sustain antimicrobial functions in open tubular phagosomes formed around <italic>C. albicans</italic> hyphae and possibly other targets. It is tempting to speculate that the unique conditions established by the diffusion barrier might provide additional benefits to the phagocyte. In dendritic cells, decreased phagosomal proteolysis associated with reduced phagosome acidification protects antigens for enhanced presentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Mantegazza et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Rybicka et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Savina et al., 2006</xref>). In addition, the frustrated yet maturing phagosome may enable activation of endomembrane Toll-like receptors (TLRs). TLR3 and TLR9 both localize to intracellular compartments and recognize <italic>C. albicans</italic> nucleic acids and chitin, respectively, contributing to a protective cytokine response to the fungus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Nahum et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib128">Wagener et al., 2014</xref>). Interestingly, Dectin1 can collaborate with plasmalemmal TLRs (TLR2 or TRL4) to enhance signaling and augment cytokine production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ferwerda et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Netea et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib125">Underhill, 2007</xref>) and a similar synergy may apply to endomembrane TLRs. Indeed, Dectin1 recognition is required for TLR9 localization to the <italic>C. albicans</italic> phagosome and TLR9-dependent gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Khan et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, the unique structure described here may play an important role in the control of fungal infection and possibly also in the management of biofilms and other large targets by phagocytes.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Reagents</title><p>Mammalian expression vectors were obtained from the following sources: Emerald-Dectin1 (plasmid #56291; Addgene, Cambridge, MA), PAK-PBD-YFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Srinivasan et al., 2003</xref>), E-cadherin-GFP (plasmid <bold>#</bold>67937; Addgene), β-catenin-GFP(plasmid #16071; Addgene), Talin-GFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Franco et al., 2004</xref>), AKT-PH-GFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Marshall et al., 2001</xref>), PLCδ-PH-GFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Botelho et al., 2000</xref>), PX-GFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Kanai et al., 2001</xref>), LC3-GFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Kabeya et al., 2000</xref>), Rab7-GFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Bucci et al., 2000</xref>), Rab7(Q67L)-RFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">D’'Costa et al., 2015</xref>), Lamp1-GFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Martinez et al., 2000</xref>), Lyn<sub>11</sub>-GFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">Teruel et al., 1999</xref>), cathepsin D-RFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib133">Yuseff et al., 2011</xref>), LifeAct-RFP or -GFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Riedl et al., 2008</xref>), F-tractin-GFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Belin et al., 2014</xref>), CD2-CD45-GFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cordoba et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Primary antibodies were purchased from the following vendors: HA (catalogue #MMS-101P; Covance, Princeton, NJ), pTyrosine (catalogue #05–321; EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA), pFAK-Y397 (catalogue #3283S; Cell Signaling, Berverly, MA), pPYK2-Y402 (catalogue #3291S; Cell Signaling), pSFK-Y418 (catalogue #44660G; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), pSYK-Y525/526 (catalogue #2771S; Cell Signaling), Talin (catalogue #T3287; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), Vinculin (catalogue #MAB3574; EMD Millipore), HS1 (catalogue #4557S; Cell Signaling), LAMP1 (catalogue # 1D4B-s, Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, Iowa City, IA), actin (catalogue #A4700; Sigma-Aldrich), CD11b (catalogue #557394; BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ), CD18 (catalogue #557437; BD Biosciences), rat IgG<sub>2B</sub> isotype control (catalogue #MAB0061; R and D systems, Minneapolis, MN), paxillin (catalogue #P13520; Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY), GAPDH (catalogue #MAB374; EMD Millipore), E-cadherin (catalogue #610181; BD Biosciences), β-catenin (catalogue #610153; BD Biosciences).

Labeled cells were then incubated 30 min at 37°C in the presence of 30 μM DYNGO 4a, to patch crosslinked CR3 without its internalization. Following this treatment, cells were treated 10 min with or without 1 μM latrunculin A, in the presence of 1 μM N-ethylmaleimide to prevent internalization of crosslinked CR3 following actin depolymerization. Monolayers were fixed in 3% PFA, and extracellular CR3 was labeled using a fluorescent anti-goat antibody. Plasma membrane clusters of CR3 were analyzed in Volocity software for exclusion of CD2-CD45-GFP. Exclusion was calculated from confocal slices as the ratio of the GFP intensity per pixel in the CR3-positive patches to the average intensity in the plasma membrane.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Hyphal growth rate of <italic>C. albicans</italic> during infection</title><p>RAW-Dectin1 cells were incubated with <italic>Candida-</italic>BFP hyphae for 10 min to allow adherence, then fixed in 4% PFA after 0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 or 60 min. Following phagocytosis, the cells were fixed in 3% PFA as above, external <italic>Candida-</italic>BFP were labeled with fluorescent concanavalin A, and permeabilized and stained with fluorescent phalloidin, as described above.

For improved specimen preparation, samples were then subjected to a zymolyase digestion protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bauer et al., 2001</xref>) designed to weaken the fungal cell wall and allow for adequate structural preservation. Samples were then post-fixed in 1% osmium tetroxide in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 7.3, dehydrated in a graded ethanol series followed by propylene oxide, and embedded in Quetol-Spurr resin. Ninety nm sections were cut on a Leica Ultracut ultramicrotome and stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate.

The first decision letter after peer review is shown below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;An integrin-based diffusion barrier separates membrane domains enabling formation of microbicidal frustrated phagosomes&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Neil Gow (Reviewer #1).</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>As you will see from their individual comments below, the reviewers concur that this study reports some advances the field of host-fungus interactions and add supporting data on role for integrin in the establishment or maintenance of the actin cuff. The manuscript is clearly written, and the work is well executed and clearly illustrated with beautiful imaging data.</p><p>However, the originality of the manuscript is in part compromised because some of the concepts were preceded by a study from Dr. Terebiznik's lab. While the current work needs to be more cross-referral to this, there is still novelty in the current submission leaning on the identification of Mac-1-dependent diffusion barriers formed between the hyphae cell wall and the plasma membrane of the macrophage. The experimental data supporting this model requires important revisions in order for it to be convincing (more quantitative data). Furthermore, data in support of the microbicidal properties of these frustrated phagosomes is missing. The roles of Dectin-1 and Integrin receptors in the formation of actin cuffs and barriers should investigated in more detail whereas it is optional to expand the study into inflammatory response.</p><p>While we are rejecting the paper as a result of the need for a substantial revision (longer than 2 months), we are broadly supportive of this manuscript and would consider a newly submitted form of this paper that would be treated as a revised manuscript.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>This paper addresses a well appreciated but univestigated conundrum. How do immune phagocytes interact with target cells that are much larger than they can envelop? The authors show that macrophages that are challenged with elongated hyphal cells of the fungus <italic>Candida albicans</italic> wrap around the end of a hypha and form an actin cuff that partially seals the phagocytic cup at the mouth of the tubular phagosome. This structure retains some of the ability to establish an antimicrobial environment within the unsealed tubular phagosome – for example allowing NAPPH oxidase activation, but not phagosome acidification. The actin cuff is shown to represent a diffusion barrier that segregates phosphoinositides between the phagocytes cell membrane and the open cup. Some elegant experiments investigate how this is segregation is achieved and regulated. Overall this is an interesting, novel and well executed study that clearly advances the field of host-fungus interactions.</p><p>I have a number of questions, suggestions and presentational issues.</p><p>1) The fungus studied is <italic>Candida albicans</italic> but is most commonly referred to as Candida. It would not be simply pedantic to request that it be referred to as <italic>C. albicans</italic> throughout since most Candida species cannot form elongated hyphae.</p><p>2) It would be interesting to know if similar actin cuff seals are formed when phagocytes encounter hyphae of Aspergillus fumigatus (interesting because this fungus has quite marked differences in cell wall composition).</p><p>3) The hyphae used are not very long (1 h or 2 h hyphae were used) and the macrophages shown seem to be invaginating one end. Macrophages will also wrap around the trunk of a very large hypha. Are actin cuffs formed here- and what is their architecture? It would be useful to include some images of longer hyphae of 4-6 hours incubation in RPMI.</p><p>4) Various <italic>C. albicans</italic> mutants are available with alterations in the cell wall that would help determine what surface components of the fungus are important for inducing the cuffs.</p><p>5) In many of the figures it is not possible to clearly evaluate the shape and position of the phagocyte relative to the fungus. It would be very helpful to show a DIC or phase image of the same interacting cells in order to really see the orientation of the hypha and phagocyte. I have no doubt that the descriptions in the text are accurate, but I have to somewhat take it on trust since I cannot see the outline of the two interacting cells clearly in all cases. (For example see Figure 3B,C; Figure 4B,E,F; Figure 5B,C,F; Figure 6E; Figure 8A,D and others).</p><p>6) The authors show that the CTL Dectin-1 is not present at the actin cuff, but phosphotyrosine accumulated at this site suggesting that some other pattern recognition receptor may drive actin assembly. It would be useful to verify that glucan phosphate or laminarin did not block actin cuff formation.</p><p>7) Since the mannose receptor is likely to engage with hypha mannan, (which is located in the outer cell wall) it would be interesting to know if this is located at this site.</p><p>8) I'm not sure that the TEM shown in Figure 1C can be seen as evidence of showing the actin cuff unless the actin is perhaps stained using colloidal gold.</p><p>9) My88-/- cells would be useful in assessing the possible involvement of TLRs.</p><p>10) The actin cuffs appear to be elongated in some images and much shorter or almost like spots in others. Do they retain their shape over time or contract to a spot?</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>In this manuscript M Maxson and collaborators have characterized the phagocytosis of <italic>Candida albicans</italic> hyphae, which for long hyphae, cannot progress beyond the stage of phagocytic cup, leading to the formation of a frustrated phagosome. The manuscript is clearly written, and the findings illustrated with beautiful imaging data. The authors propose that actin cuffs in the frustrated phagosomes, which have been described in previous reports on the phagocytosis in <italic>Candida albicans</italic> (Bain et al., 2014 and Lewis et al., 2012), may act as diffusion barriers and contribute to membrane fences that allow the accumulation of ROS in the frustrated phagosomes. They also propose that these actin cuffs are the product of the atypical activation of MAC1receptors in the macrophages by ligands expressed on the cell wall of Candida and that MAC1 may restrict the free diffusion of lipids and membrane proteins along the membrane. The proposed model is sound, and it may explain possible microbicidal actions phagocytes may attempt when pathogens cannot be completely engulfed. However, there are many important points in the manuscript that require clarification and revision to better support the authors' model.</p><p>The authors claim that the frustrated phagosomes are microbicidal. Yet, there is no data on fungal survival to support this conclusion. Are the macrophage-trapped hyphae growing longer or dying as time passes?</p><p>The contribution of Candida hyphae to the formation of the frustrated phagosomes and actin cuffs must be assessed. Changes in Candida cell wall composition have been previously reported to affect macrophage actin dynamics (Bain et al., 2014). However, the authors are not considering or discarding a role for the yeast in the proposed model.</p><p>For the imaging data, even though the regions of interest are nicely indicated with brackets, since different markers don't always localize to same regions along the frustrated phagosome, having additional panels with channels merged would make it easier to visualize what the authors are illustrating.</p><p>In subsection “Signals driving actin cuff formation”, referring to Figure 2AB, the authors indicate, a lack of Dectin-1 at the actin cuffs. However Emerald-Dectin-1 can be seen in the cuff in Figure 2B, which is in good agreement with Strijbis et al., (2013) that also showed that Dectin-1 is enriched in the cuff region of the phagocytic cup, as well as in areas of enrichment outside the cuff region. To support their claim, the authors must present quantitative data on Dectin-1 distribution along the frustrated phagosome. Also, it is not indicated, but the imaging shown in Figure 2, and other figures, seems to be a single confocal z-plane. It may also be appropriate to include extended focus projections, considering the size of the hyphae, which could be included as supplementary files.</p><p>Clarifying the distribution of Dectin1 in the frustrated phagosomes, is critical because it affects the interpretation of data in Figure 2D and other results in the manuscript.</p><p>Figure 2D showing PAK-PBD and tyrosine phosphorylation in the actin cuffs are likely expected results since Strijbis et al., 2013, have shown that the GEF for CDC42 and RAC1, VAV1, as well as the tyrosine kinases Syk and BTK, are all recruited to cuffs. Quantitative data for the recruitment of these molecules to the frustrated phagosomes and data proving that their activities are involved in the formation or sustaining the cuffs will certainly help the proposed model.</p><p>Figure 3D shows that on average, for a given field, 6 hyphae are observed in frustrated phagosomes with actin cuffs and this is consistent throughout the manuscript. However, it is not clear how many individual events were analyzed. How frequently are these frustrated phagosomes observed? Do all hyphae engaged by macrophages have these structures associated with them?</p><p>Figure 4. For accumulation of receptors provide quantitative data. According to the authors, MAC1 activation signals for the formation of the actin cuffs. However, in Figure 4A, CD11b did not localize to the thicker section of the cuffs. Please clarify and indicate the frequency of this phenotype.</p><p>Figure 4G shows a shorter cup in the presence of CD11b blocking antibodies. The treatment could cause an inhibition of phagocytosis. Authors must demonstrate that phagocytosis is not affected by the treatment.</p><p>Figure 4G/H In cells treated with the M1/70 antibody, actin is still present in the frustrated phagosome. Is this a cuff? In fact, Concavalin A labeling is limited to the phalloidin boundary. This suggests the presence of a cuff/ barrier, even after CD11b treatment.</p><p>Is dectin1 distribution along the frustrated phagosome affected after CD11b is blocked? Blocking CD11b in dectin1 knockout cells will help address whether dectin1 contributes to this barrier.</p><p>Figure 5, subsection “Phospholipid segregation between the plasma membrane and the cuff-delimited phagosomal cup” states &quot;Astonishingly, while PtdIns(4,5)P2 was present as expected in the surface membrane facing the extracellular milieu, it was undetectable in the invaginated section that constituted the frustrated phagosome (Figure 5A)&quot;. This and other characteristics of the cuff and the frustrated phagosomes reported in Figure 5 and Figure 8 are similar to those reported by Prashar et al., (2013). This must be acknowledged in the manuscript. It must be acknowledged that PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 distribution in the frustrated phagosome has been previously described by Strijbis et al. In Figure 5D, how do the authors explain the presence of LC3 in the actin cuff?</p><p>Subsection “The actin cuff forms a diffusional barrier to the movement of proteins and lipids” &quot;The sharp boundary between the PtdIns(4,5)P2-rich surface membrane and the tubular membrane endowed with PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 and PtdIns(Bauer et al., 2001)P coincided with the location of the actin cuff, suggesting that the latter may function as a diffusion barrier&quot;.</p><p>Subsection “The actin cuff forms a diffusional barrier to the movement of proteins and lipids” Similarly, both wild-type Rab7 (Figure 5E) and constitutively-active Rab7 (not illustrated) are confined to the frustrated phagosomal tube, as was LAMP1 (Figure 5F)……..we considered it more likely that restricted diffusion accounted for the observations&quot;</p><p>Differently to what the authors describe in the paragraph from above, the phagosomal markers are penetrating the barrier as in the case of Figure 5B and E and surpassing the cuffs in Figure 5C, E and F. As indicated before for other results the authors must present quantitative data on the distribution of the markers and extended focus projections to support the proposed model.</p><p>Figure 7 strongly supports authors' claim However, if latranculin A treatment allowed Lamp-1 and PtdIns(4,5)P2 to migrate to previously excluded zones, why concanavalin A is not following and labels the full extension of the hyphae? That will be the expected if the diffusion barriers in the cuffs are dismantled. Quantitative data is missing, and full cell imaging would be preferable to better illustrate the authors' claim.</p><p>Figure 8 The characteristics of the frustrated phagosome are remarkably similar to long cups described by Prasher et al., 2013 and Strijbis et al., 2003. This must be cited in the text. The accumulation of NBT in Figure 8E is puzzling since small molecules can diffuse out across the actin cuff barrier. The authors must address the possibility that the NBT is accumulating inside the hyphae. NBT can accumulate in fungi Camile et al., 2008. Thus, authors must prove a link between ROS and microbicidal conditions in the long open phagosomes.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>The manuscript by Maxson et al., describes and analyzes partially sealed phagocytic cups in macrophages which form around <italic>Candida albicans</italic> hyphae. It demonstrates that an actin-rich cuff at the distal margin of the cup supports a lateral segregation between the components of the plasma membrane and the contiguous inner leaflet of the phagocytic cup. This lateral segregation excludes the PI(4,5)P2 from the cup and confines the PI(Bauer et al., 2001)P and PIP3 to the cup. The actin cuff contains the integrin CR3 and associated integrin signaling molecules. The barrier effectively limits the movement of inner leaflet probe molecules into or out of the cup, without significantly diminishing diffusion within the plasma membrane or the cup. The actin cuff can be disrupted by the actin depolymerizing drug latrunculin A. The barrier limits escape by diffusion of large macromolecules delivered into the lumen of the cup, but not the diffusive loss of smaller molecules, including dextrans and protons (pH). Nonetheless, reactive oxygen species can be delivered into the unclosed cups. The experimental work is carefully done and the morphological evidence in support of the claims is beautiful. However, much if not most of the conclusions reported here were first described in a large study by Prashar et al., (2013), using an analogous experimental model. Examining the interactions between macrophages and filamentous bacteria, that study demonstrated (Astarie-Dequeker et al., 1999) the actin cuff (called a &quot;jacket&quot;) that segregates two domains of contiguous membrane (plasma membrane and phagocytic cup), (Bain et al., 2014) the effect of actin depolymerization on the maintenance of that segregation, (Bauer et al., 2001) the nature of the diffusion barrier with respect to extracellular probes and (Belin et al., 2014) the retention of diffusible molecules in the cup lumen (different sizes of dextrans, pH, hydrolytic enzymes). Moreover, unlike the present manuscript which shows that ROS can be generated in the unclosed cups, the previous paper measured the effect of partial phagocytosis on microbicidal activities against filamentous bacteria (albeit somewhat incompletely). The present manuscript but does not measure microbicidal activity against <italic>C. albicans</italic>.</p><p>Assuming this manuscript can be rewritten to acknowledge appropriately the demonstrated precedents and concepts of that earlier work, the present study does add some interesting new data which supports a role for integrin in the establishment or maintenance of the actin cuff. The role of integrin in the maintenance of the barrier remains indirect, however. Perhaps the actin ring is the main ingredient of the barrier, and anything which organizes actin into a ring can support the formation of diffusion barriers such as described here, and elsewhere for analogous structures (Golebiewska et al., 2011; Welliver et al., 2011. To better define the nature of the diffusion barrier, the diffusion measurements (e.g. Figure 6) or probe localization studies (e.g. Figure 5) described in the manuscript should be extended to analyze the roles of actin (latrunculin A) and integrin (M1/70) to barrier maintenance. This could provide a mechanistic underpinning to the diffusion measurements.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what now follows is the decision letter after the authors submitted for further consideration.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Integrin-based diffusion barrier separates membrane domains enabling formation of microbiostatic frustrated phagosomes&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Ivan Dikic (Senior editor), a Reviewing editor, and three reviewers.</p><p>This revised manuscript contains extensive additional experimental work and text that address concerns noted in earlier reviews. The new work is thorough and adequately supportive of the conclusions. The manuscript now establishes a diffusion barrier in the inner leaflet of incompletely closed phagocytic cup membranes, comprised of CR3 integrins and maintained by an actin-rich cuff. Further, it identifies signaling molecules that contribute to cuff formation, and establishes the incompletely closed cups as microbiostatic. Related studies are adequately cited. The discussion provides a thoughtful analysis of the biology and its implications. Yet there are some minor remaining issues that need to be addressed in the text before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>The authors addressed all the critiques from the reviewers.</p><p>They reported additional results on the phagocytosis of <italic>C. albicans</italic> hyphae, improved the quality of the imaging, and provided numerical and statistical data to support their most relevant experiments.</p><p>However, below there are several points that we believe could be discussed in the manuscript:</p><p>1) In the abstract it is stated “[…]in response to non-canonical activation of integrins by fungal β(1,3)-glucans.&quot; We suggest using the singular &quot;glycan&quot;. There is more than one form of fungal β(1,3)- glucan, but this is not relevant to this article.</p><p>2) B-glucans are involved in the activation of complement and the deposition of C3b fragments on the surface of <italic>C. albicans</italic>. (Boxx et al., 2010., Kozel et al., 1987, Vetvicka et al., 1996). What could be the contribution of C3b opsonization on the formation of the actin cuffs and the properties of the membrane and luminal diffusion barriers?</p><p>3) Previous reports on the phagocytosis of <italic>C. albicans</italic> showed the formation of PIPs in phagosomes containing this yeast (Heinsbroek, 2009). This was attributed to pathogenic mechanisms. On the other hand, and coinciding with the authors' interpretation, Naufer et al., 2018 recently reported that PI(Bauer et al., 2001)P co-exists with phagolysosomal markers in the phagocytic cup of heat-killed filamentous bacteria. Maybe the authors could mention this in their Discussion section.</p><p>4) Please clarify: In Figure 4, human serum was used to complement opsonize hyphae. How did the authors account for the presence of antibodies against C. albincans in the serum? Antibodies could be expected as this yeast is part of the human microbiome</p><p>5) Caspofungin treatment could prevent the deposition of complement in hyphae, and its recognition by antibodies and Dectin-1. This could explain the results in Figure 4—figure supplement 1.</p><p>6) The authors showed that ROS production in the phagocytic cup retarded the elongation of the hyphae. This was alleviated by blocking CR3 with monoclonal antibodies to impede the formation of cuffs, a procedure that favours a ROS leaching. Since ROS are generally considered microbicidal, perhaps, ROS failing to reach lethal concentrations in the open cup could be the cause of the effect reported by the authors. Therefore, assuming a microbiostatic mechanism is probably incorrect.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34798.042</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the first round of peer review follow.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>I have a number of questions, suggestions and presentational issues.</p><p>1) The fungus studied is Candida albicans but is most commonly referred to as Candida.

The new data are shown in the revised Figure 4G and discussed in the Results section. Like others before, we observed that <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> is not effectively internalized by macrophages, due in part to the presence of cell wall glycosaminoglycans and also because it produces gliotoxin, an effective inhibitor of phagocytosis. We minimized the effects of gliotoxin (that reacts with sulfhydryl groups, forming mixed disulfides) by exposing the cells to <italic>Aspergillus fumigatus</italic> in the presence of L-cysteine (see Materials and methods section). Under these conditions, when the macrophages engage the hyphae near the end, we were able to observe the formation of distinct actin cuffs, resembling those formed around <italic>C. albicans</italic> hyphae, consistent with the fact that the cell wall of <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> contains β(1,3)-glucans.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The hyphae used are not very long (1 h or 2 h hyphae were used) and the macrophages shown seem to be invaginating one end.

A representative image is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref> (top row). In the case of the longer hyphae, as was also the case with the very long <italic>Aspergillus</italic> hyphae, the macrophages often interacted with intermediate regions of the hyphae. In these instances, the macrophages partially wrapped themselves around the hyphae, forming dense actin structures that did not seem to surround the hyphae in their entirety (we call them “tacos”; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>, bottom row, for representative image). Because these seemingly unsealed structures would not function as diffusion barriers –the main topic of the paper– we have opted not to illustrate or discuss them but would be happy to do so if the reviewer felt this is important.</p><fig id="respfig1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34798.039</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption/><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-34798-resp-fig1-v2"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Various C. albicans mutants are available with alterations in the cell wall that would help determine what surface components of the fungus are important for inducing the cuffs.</p></disp-quote><p>As recommended by the reviewer we have conducted an extensive series of experiments in collaboration with Drs. L. Cowen and T. O’Meara to define the <italic>C. albicans</italic> cell wall components required for actin cuff formation. To this end we utilized a curated set of <italic>C. albicans</italic> GRACE strain mutants generously made available by Merck and Genome Canada, which filament normally but have mutations affecting biosynthetic pathways for chitin, mannans or β(1,6)glucans (see O’Meara et al., 2015). The new results are now illustrated in Figure 4C and D and described in the Results section. To assess the role of β(1,3)-glucans, we pharmacologically inhibited β(1,3)-glucan synthesis using caspofungin. These results are presented in the new Figures 4E and F and discussed in the Results section. In a nutshell, we found that β(1,3)-glucan is required for actin cuff formation, while chitin, mannans and β(1,6)-glucans were dispensable. Please note that we also utilized caspofungin in Figure 4—Figure supplement 1, discussed in the Results section, to distinguish the role of β(1,3)-glucan in actin cuff formation from its role in Dectin1-mediated phagocytosis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) In many of the figures it is not possible to clearly evaluate the shape and position of the phagocyte relative to the fungus.

(For example see Figure 3B,C; Figure 4B,E,F; Figure 5B,C,F; Figure 6E; Figure 8A,D and others).</p></disp-quote><p>As requested by the reviewer, to enable the reader to locate the phagocytes with respect to the hyphae, we have outlined the macrophages using grey dotted lines (see Figure 1, Figure 1—figure supplement 1, Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 3—figure supplement 1, Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 5—figure supplement 1, Figure 6 and Figure 10), except in those cases where the cell outline is readily discernible as background fluorescence.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The authors show that the CTL Dectin-1 is not present at the actin cuff, but phosphotyrosine accumulated at this site suggesting that some other pattern recognition receptor may drive actin assembly.

As suggested, we used laminarin to block Dectin1 and the new results have been included in the revised Figure 4B. When added before the addition of <italic>C. albicans</italic>, laminarin impaired phagocytosis, consistent with the involvement of Dectin1 in the initial stages of the interaction, which was validated by comparing RAW cells (that express little Dectin1) with RAW-Dectin1 cells, which are stably transfected to express higher levels of Dectin1 (new Figure 4A). However, when added after <italic>C. albicans</italic> adherence, laminarin had no effect on actin cuff formation (Figure 4B). As discussed in the manuscript, we believe that at this later stage the integrins, specifically CR3, have been activated and become the main drivers of the association and of the formation of the actin cuff.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Since the mannose receptor is likely to engage with hypha mannan, (which is located in the outer cell wall) it would be interesting to know if this is located at this site.</p></disp-quote><p>The possible involvement of mannan receptors was tested in several ways. First, as mentioned above, we used mutant strains that are mannan-deficient. Secondly, we tested the effects soluble mannans on the internalization of <italic>C. albicans</italic> and the formation of actin cuffs and have included these data in the new Figure 4B. In accordance with the mutant data, we found soluble mannan to be without effect. Lastly, we immunostained for mannose receptors using antibody MR5D3 (Bio-Rad; catalogue # MCA2235GA) and found no evidence of accumulation at the cuff. These new results are described in subsection “Role of receptor cooperativity in actin cuff formation” of the revised text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) I'm not sure that the TEM shown in Figure 1C can be seen as evidence of showing the actin cuff unless the actin is perhaps stained using colloidal gold.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the electron micrographs do not provide direct evidence that actin is accumulated in the region of cuff, a case much better made by the phalloidin staining that is profusely illustrated throughout the paper. We clearly overstated the case in the original version and have toned down the interpretation of the images in the revised text. Instead, we refer to the similar exclusion area seen by Strijbis et al., (2013), who used tannic acid negative staining to better visualize actin (see subsection “Phagocytosis of <italic>C. albicans</italic> hyphae” of revised text).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) My88-/- cells would be useful in assessing the possible involvement of TLRs.</p></disp-quote><p>The involvement of TLRs/MyD88 in the recognition of and control of <italic>C. albicans</italic> by macrophages is well documented. Indeed, Marr et al., (2003) showed that MyD88<sup>−/−</sup> cells have a pronounced phagocytic defect. While reflecting the importance of the cooperation between MyD88/TLR and Dectin1, this phagocytic defect would complicate performing the suggested experiments using MyD88<sup>−/−</sup> cells, as well as their interpretation, since it would be difficult to separate the contribution of MyD88 to actin cuff formation from that to Dectin1-mediated phagocytosis. While we have included additional experiments to dissect the contributions of Dectin1 and CR3, we feel that additional studies of MyD88 and TLRs would be outside the scope of this manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) The actin cuffs appear to be elongated in some images and much shorter or almost like spots in others. Do they retain their shape over time or contract to a spot?</p></disp-quote><p>It is our observation that the actin cuffs can vary somewhat in length and continuity from cell to cell, sometimes fragmented into two or more smaller cuffs. However, once established in any single cell, the actin cuff does not change shape or contract significantly after formation for up to 90 min (the duration of our experiments), despite the fact that actin treadmilling is ongoing at the cuff.

To address this issue, we conducted new experiments to assess the antimicrobial effects of the actin cuff on <italic>C. albicans</italic> hyphae. We initially measured the viability of the hyphae that had been partially internalized using propidium iodide. As is now described in the Results section, we did not see any change in fungal viability in the partially internalized <italic>C. albicans</italic> hypha (nor in fully internalized hyphae, for that matter; data not shown) for at least 60 min, the normal duration of our experiments. We reasoned that the antimicrobial effectors may not suffice to kill the fungus yet may curtail hyphal growth. The remarkable extension rate of <italic>C. albicans</italic> hyphae, which has been well-documented (18.8 µm/hr = 0.31 µm/min, Gow, 1985), enables accurate quantitation during the course of our experiments. We therefore, compared the rate of growth of partially internalized hyphae with an actin cuff with that of hyphae that were fully internalized or that were not engaged by macrophages (i.e. remained extracellular) throughout. These results are now summarized in the new Figure 10F and described in subsection “Functional properties of the frustrated phagosome” of the revised text. Briefly, we found that sequestration of a part of the hyphae within the frustrated phagosomes delimited by the cuff reduced the rate of growth considerably, to the same extent as seen for hyphae fully internalized within a sealed phagosome. Importantly, blocking of CD11b with the M1/70 antibody abolished this microbiostatic effect (Figure 10—figure supplement 2). In light of this newly characterized effect on hyphal growth, we have changed the title from “microbicidal” to “microbiostatic”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The contribution of Candida hyphae to the formation of the frustrated phagosomes and actin cuffs must be assessed. Changes in Candida cell wall composition have been previously reported to affect macrophage actin dynamics (Bain et al., 2014). However, the authors are not considering or discarding a role for the yeast in the proposed model.</p></disp-quote><p>As described above when addressing comment #4 of reviewer 1, we performed a new series of experiments to define the cell wall components required for actin cuff formation, using a curated set of <italic>C. albicans</italic> GRACE strain mutants obtained from Merck and from Genome Canada, which have mutations affecting biosynthetic pathways for chitin, mannans or β(1,6)glucans (see O’Meara et al., 2015). We also conducted pharmacological experiments targeting the formation of the β(1,3)-glucan bond, using caspofungin. In a nutshell, we found that β(1,3)glucan is required for actin cuff formation, while chitin, mannans and β(1,6)-glucans were dispensable.

Moreover, we now provide insets to Figure 2A and B showing the localization of Dectin1 and merged images showing also the actin cuff. Strijbis et al., (2013) did assess Dectin1 localization and found that “Dectin1 was enriched in the cuff region of the phagocytic cuff….but also showed areas of enrichment outside the cuff region”. We believe that this is consistent with our observations that Dectin1 is present throughout the phagocytic cup but is not enriched in the area of the actin cuff, relative to the rest of the frustrated phagocytic cup.

To this end, we used immunostaining to assess the activation of several candidate tyrosine kinases. Specifically, we have detected activation (phosphorylation) of Syk and, interestingly, PYK2/FAK kinases at the actin cuff (see Figure 5, and subsection “Signals driving actin cuff formation” of the text for quantitation). To our knowledge, PYK2 and FAK were previously not known to participate in the host response to <italic>C. albicans</italic>. These observations prompted us to assess the functional requirement of these kinases for cuff formation and maintenance. As illustrated in the new Figure 5E, inhibition of PYK2/FAK obliterated the formation of actin cuffs, as did inhibition of Syk.

As shown in the new Figure 5G we found that formins are the primary driver of actin cuff formation.

Note that, in other integrin-induced structures such as stress fibres and podosomes, the regions of greatest actin accumulation are located at some distance from the active integrins themselves. It is also possible that access to the epitope (which is exofacial in both instances) may be restricted by the close apposition of the host and pathogen surfaces, particularly in those areas where the actin cuff may constrict the neck.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 4G shows a shorter cup in the presence of CD11b blocking antibodies.

As the new figure indicates, the number of fully internalized hyphae, a process largely mediated by Dectin1, was not significantly affected. The decrease in the number of actin cuffs seen upon inhibition of CD11b was accompanied by a reciprocal increase in the number of partially internalized hyphae that did not display actin cuffs, again implying that engagement of the hyphae and initiation of phagocytosis did not require CR3. To simplify the graph in Figure 3H, the number partially internalized without actin cuffs has not been included but is referred to in the text (see Results section).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 4G/H In cells treated with the M1/70 antibody, actin is still present in the frustrated phagosome. Is this a cuff? In fact, Concavalin A labeling is limited to the phalloidin boundary. This suggests the presence of a cuff/ barrier, even after CD11b treatment.</p></disp-quote><p>The original Figure 4G (now Figure 3G) is representative of the observed disruption of the actin cuff around partially internalized <italic>C. albicans</italic> hyphae. As should be apparent, the amount of actin is greatly reduced and, more importantly, the entire cup is lined by actin, unlike the discrete distribution at the cuff, which is now clearly illustrated in the 3-dimensional images shown in Figures 1E-H and Video 1. It is important to note that preferential labeling of the extracellular portions of the hyphae by Concanavalin A (ConcA) is not predicated on the barrier function of the integrin/actin cuff. Indeed, the Stokes radius of ConcA, reported as 3.0 nm (Sawyer et al., 1975; Ahmad et al., 2007) is similar that of 10 kDa dextran (2.3 nm), and considerably smaller than that of the 100 kDa dextran (&gt;6 nm), which was shown not to traverse the junction. It is the result of the comparatively brief (20 min) incubation at reduced (room) temperature with the lectin, which favors readily detectable binding to exposed carbohydrates, while minimally staining those inside the cup, where diffusion is limited by the narrow spacing between the membrane and hyphal wall. Moreover, ConcA staining is done after fixation with paraformaldehyde. Paraformaldehyde crosslinking likely restricts further the entry of Concanavalin A to the regions trapped in the cup. Nevertheless, to address the effectiveness of the block exerted by antibody M1/70, we took advantage of the observation that formation of the cuff impaired the growth of the hyphae. We performed new experiments where the rate of growth was compared in hyphae that were partially internalized by cells in the presence and absence of antibody M1/70. The new data, which are presented in Figure 10—figure supplement 2, show that blocking the engagement of CR3 eliminated the microbiostatic effect of the macrophages, i.e. the hyphae grew at normal rates in M1/70-treated cells. See response to comment #2 by reviewer 3 for further description of these data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Is dectin1 distribution along the frustrated phagosome affected after CD11b is blocked? Blocking CD11b in dectin1 knockout cells will help address whether dectin1 contributes to this barrier.</p></disp-quote><p>As requested by this reviewer, as well as by reviewer 1, we performed additional experiments to assess the role of Dectin1 in actin cuff formation. We took advantage of the earlier observation that Dectin1 is essential for <italic>C. albicans</italic> internalization(Taylor et al., 2007, Marakalala et al., 2013 –these references have now been cited in subsection “Role of receptor cooperativity in actin cuff formation”). Based on this knowledge we designed experiments comparing the Dectin1-deficient (parental) RAW 264.7 cell line with the RAW-Dectin1 stable transfectants. Importantly, while cuff formation was minimal in the Dectin1 deficient cells, we could bypass the need for the glucan receptor using complement opsonization (see new Figure 4A, discussed in subsection “Role of receptor cooperativity in actin cuff formation” of the revised text). We interpret these results to mean that Dectin1 is required for initial engagement and initiation of phagocytosis, a role that can be alternatively fulfilled by the traditional integrin-binding domain of CR3 yet is not essential for cuff formation. Because in the absence of complement phagocytosis will not occur in Dectin1 knockout cells, the blocking experiment suggested by the reviewer cannot be performed. Instead, we timed the inhibition of Dectin1 using laminarin, as recommended by reviewer 1. When added before phagocytosis, laminarin greatly inhibited cuff formation, as expected, but it was ineffective when added after the integrin was already engaged (Figure 4B). Note that size of the laminarin used (≈500 Da) was sufficiently small for it to penetrate the junction between the macrophage and the hyphae, based on the data of Figure 10.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 5, subsection “Phospholipid segregation between the plasma membrane and the cuff-delimited phagosomal cup” states &quot;Astonishingly, while PtdIns(4,5)P2 was present as expected in the surface membrane facing the extracellular milieu, it was undetectable in the invaginated section that constituted the frustrated phagosome (Figure 5A)&quot;. This and other characteristics of the cuff and the frustrated phagosomes reported in Figure 5 and Figure 8 are similar to those reported by Prashar et al., (2013). This must be acknowledged in the manuscript.

We chose to analyze its distribution because it is lipid-anchored yet can be covalently labeled by a fluorescent protein. The precise mechanism that directs LC3 to phagosomes is not known and, most importantly, we do not know whether these determinants are deployed in the area of the membrane where the integrins generate the cuff, which would readily explain its presence there. Most importantly, as discussed in more detail below, the diffusion barrier may slow down the movement of lipids, lipid-anchored proteins and proteins markedly, without necessarily preventing their entry into the cuff altogether. In this instance, the much faster diffusion of these molecules after they exit the cuff would make them undetectable outside the cup.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Subsection “The actin cuff forms a diffusional barrier to the movement of proteins and lipids” &quot;The sharp boundary between the PtdIns(4,5)P2-rich surface membrane and the tubular membrane endowed with PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 and PtdIns(Bauer et al., 2001)P coincided with the location of the actin cuff, suggesting that the latter may function as a diffusion barrier&quot;.</p><p>Subsection “The actin cuff forms a diffusional barrier to the movement of proteins and lipids” Similarly, both wild-type Rab7 (Figure 5E) and constitutively-active Rab7 (not illustrated) are confined to the frustrated phagosomal tube, as was LAMP1 (Figure 5F)[…]we considered it more likely that restricted diffusion accounted for the observations&quot;</p><p>Differently to what the authors describe in the paragraph from above, the phagosomal markers are penetrating the barrier as in the case of Figure 5B and E and surpassing the cuffs in Figure 5C, E and F.

First, to more clearly illustrate the relative disposition of the markers vis-a-vis the actin cuff, we have added ~ 2x merged insets of the cuff region where the colocalization of various markers with actin is indicated in yellow (see revised Figure 6). As we described in the original version, the boundary of the lipids coincided with the location of the actin band, although in the case of PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> the inositide is restricted to the plasmalemma, while PtdIns(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> is both in the cup and throughout the cuff. It is quite likely that PI3-kinase is active in the region where the integrins and active Syk and PYK2/FAK accumulate, so that PtdIns(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> could be generated within the cuff itself. As stated above, in the case of the lipids in particular, it is likely that the barrier reduces the diffusion rate of the lipids considerably, without necessarily preventing their entrance into the region of the cuff altogether. The limited amounts of PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> entering the cuff would be converted to PtdIns(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> and/or hydrolyzed by PLC. This, we believe, accounts for the differential appearance of the two inositides.</p><p>Also, as requested, we have now provided quantitation of marker enrichment/exclusion in the actin cuff, calculated as the ratio of fluorescence in the cuff vs. phagocytic cup (see Results section and Materials and methods section).

It demonstrates that an actin-rich cuff at the distal margin of the cup supports a lateral segregation between the components of the plasma membrane and the contiguous inner leaflet of the phagocytic cup. This lateral segregation excludes the PI(4,5)P2 from the cup and confines the PI(Bauer et al., 2001)P and PIP3 to the cup. The actin cuff contains the integrin CR3 and associated integrin signaling molecules. The barrier effectively limits the movement of inner leaflet probe molecules into or out of the cup, without significantly diminishing diffusion within the plasma membrane or the cup. The actin cuff can be disrupted by the actin depolymerizing drug latrunculin A. The barrier limits escape by diffusion of large macromolecules delivered into the lumen of the cup, but not the diffusive loss of smaller molecules, including dextrans and protons (pH). Nonetheless, reactive oxygen species can be delivered into the unclosed cups. The experimental work is carefully done and the morphological evidence in support of the claims is beautiful. However, much if not most of the conclusions reported here were first described in a large study by Prashar et al., (2013), using an analogous experimental model. Examining the interactions between macrophages and filamentous bacteria, that study demonstrated (Astarie-Dequeker et al., 1999) the actin cuff (called a &quot;jacket&quot;) that segregates two domains of contiguous membrane (plasma membrane and phagocytic cup), (Bain et al., 2014) the effect of actin depolymerization on the maintenance of that segregation, (Bauer et al., 2001) the nature of the diffusion barrier with respect to extracellular probes and (Belin et al., 2014) the retention of diffusible molecules in the cup lumen (different sizes of dextrans, pH, hydrolytic enzymes).</p></disp-quote><p>In accordance with the reviewer, we have cited this reference repeatedly throughout the text to more accurately lay the ground for our studies (see Results section and Discussion section). It is important to point out that our study extends and complements the Prashar et al., study in several ways: (Astarie-Dequeker et al., 1999) we identify the receptors involved in generating the actin cuff; (Bain et al., 2014) using a variety of mutants and pharmacological agents, we now identify the ligand recognized by the lectin domain of the integrin, namely the β(1,3)-glucan bond (see new Figure 4); (Bauer et al., 2001) we describe experiments indicating that molecular crowding is responsible for the diffusion barrier (see new Figure 8); (Belin et al., 2014) we describe the activation and functional role of PYK2/FAK in the phagocytosis of <italic>C. albicans</italic> hyphae (see new Figure 5); (Ben-Ami et al., 2011) we document actin turnover (treadmilling) at the cuff, despite the maintenance of the net amount of actin over extended periods; (Benard et al., 1999) we assign a primary role to formins, as opposed to Arp2/3 in the process (see new Figure 5G); (Bergmeier et al., 2007) we demonstrate that molecules trapped in the phagocytic cup remain mobile; (8) we demonstrate that generation of the cuff has a microbiostatic effect, limiting the growth of the hyphae and (9) we highlight the differential behaviour of lipid/lipid-anchored molecules located in the inner and outer leaflets of the membrane.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Moreover, unlike the present manuscript which shows that ROS can be generated in the unclosed cups, the previous paper measured the effect of partial phagocytosis on microbicidal activities against filamentous bacteria (albeit somewhat incompletely). The present manuscript but does not measure microbicidal activity against C. albicans.</p></disp-quote><p>This point was also raised, equally aptly, by reviewer 2. To address this issue, we conducted new experiments to assess the antimicrobial effects of the actin cuff on <italic>C. albicans</italic> hyphae. We initially measured the viability of the hyphae that had been partially internalized using propidium iodide. As is now described in the Results section, we did not see any change in fungal viability in the partially internalized <italic>C. albicans</italic> hypha (nor in fully internalized hyphae, for that matter; data not shown) for at least 60 min, the normal duration of our experiments. We reasoned that the antimicrobial effectors may not suffice to kill the fungus yet may curtail hyphal growth. The remarkable extension rate of <italic>C. albicans</italic> hyphae, which has been well-documented rate (18.8 µm/hr = 0.31 µm/min, Gow, 1985), enables accurate quantitation during the course of our experiments. We therefore, compared the rate of growth of partially internalized hyphae with an actin cuff with that of hyphae that were fully internalized or that were not engaged by macrophages (i.e. remained extracellular) throughout. These results are now summarized in the new Figure 10F and described in subsection “Functional properties of the frustrated phagosome” of the revised text. Briefly, we found that sequestration of a part of the hyphae within the frustrated phagosomes delimited by the cuff reduced the rate of growth considerably, to the same extent as seen for hyphae fully internalized within a sealed phagosome. Importantly, blocking of CD11b with the M1/70 antibody abolished this microbiostatic effect (Figure 10—figure supplement 2, and Results section). In light of this newly characterized effect on hyphal growth, we have changed the title from “microbicidal” to “microbiostatic”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Assuming this manuscript can be rewritten to acknowledge appropriately the demonstrated precedents and concepts of that earlier work, the present study does add some interesting new data which supports a role for integrin in the establishment or maintenance of the actin cuff.</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned above, we have rewritten the text to better assign credit to earlier reports, while highlighting our novel findings. The most salient novel contributions are itemized in the response to comment #1 by this reviewer. We feel that the new data and insights presented represent a significant advance to the study of phagocytosis and host-fungus interactions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The role of integrin in the maintenance of the barrier remains indirect, however. Perhaps the actin ring is the main ingredient of the barrier, and anything which organizes actin into a ring can support the formation of diffusion barriers such as described here, and elsewhere for analogous structures Golebiewska et al., 2011; Welliver et al., 2011. To better define the nature of the diffusion barrier, the diffusion measurements (e.g. Figure 6) or probe localization studies (e.g. Figure 5) described in the manuscript should be extended to analyze the roles of actin (latrunculin A) and integrin (M1/70) to barrier maintenance. This could provide a mechanistic underpinning to the diffusion measurements.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer raises an important and valid point, which we have tried to address by performing a series of new experiments. As intimated (but not demonstrated) in the original version, we hypothesized that the diffusional barrier is the consequence of molecular crowding, generated by clustering of CR3 and associated molecules to a high density. Dense clustering was envisaged to occur upon exposure to a profusion of β(1,3)-glucan bonds on the hyphae. To test this hypothesis, we induced crowding of CR3 by crosslinking the integrins with antibodies (in the absence of <italic>C. albicans</italic> hyphae), adapting the traditional technique used previously to patch/cap surface receptors (see new Figure 8B for diagrammatic illustration). Having successfully clustered CR3, we analyzed whether this sufficed to exclude other proteins.</p><p>To this end, we transfected the cells with a fluorescent transmembrane protein (CD2-CD45GFP) and quantified the relative distribution of the two proteins before and after cross-linking CR3. As shown in the new Figure 8, patches formed by clustering CR3 excluded CD2-CD45-GFP, implying that a diffusion barrier had been generated by increasing the local density (crowding) the integrin. Importantly, neither formation of the patches, nor the exclusion of CD2CD45-GFP required actin, since latrunculin was without effect. These observations imply that clustering of the transmembrane protein CR3, as opposed to its effects on actin recruitment, are the primary determinant of the diffusion barrier. This conclusion is in good agreement with the realization that transmembrane “pickets”, rather than the underlying actin “fence”, are the primary obstacles to the diffusion of membrane-associated proteins and lipids (Freeman, et al., 2018, in press).</p><p>It is important to bear in mind that, while actin itself may not be required to exclude mobile proteins and lipids form areas of CR3 crowding, it is nevertheless required to establish and maintain the clusters, ostensibly by stabilizing the active form of CR3 via talin and vinculin, as described for other integrins. This explains why the diffusional barrier generated by interaction with hyphae disassembles when the cells are treated with latrunculin A (Figure 9). The new experiments are now described in subsection “Examining the role of CR3 and actin in the maintenance of diffusional barriers” of the revised paper.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what now follows is the decision letter after the authors submitted for further consideration.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) In the abstract it is stated “[…]in response to non-canonical activation of integrins by fungal β(1,3)-glucans.&quot; We suggest using the singular &quot;glycan&quot;. There is more than one form of fungal β(1,3)- glucan, but this is not relevant to this article.</p></disp-quote><p>We have changed the text as requested; please see the Abstract of the revised version.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) B-glucans are involved in the activation of complement and the deposition of C3b fragments on the surface of C. albicans. (Boxx et al., 2010., Kozel et al., 1987, Vetvicka et al., 1996). What could be the contribution of C3b opsonization on the formation of the actin cuffs and the properties of the membrane and luminal diffusion barriers?</p></disp-quote><p>In the absence of serum opsonization, the observed phenomena are dependent on engagement of Dectin1, which secondarily enables the activation of integrins that bind to glucan. However, when Dectin1 expression is low, complement deposition suffices to engage the integrins and directly activate this process. We have observed that the actin cuffs created via C3b opsonization occur with similar frequency and appearance, therefore we assume that in our experiments and in the host, C3b deposition has a parallel role to Dectin1. We have included text in the Discussion section to elaborate on this point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Previous reports on the phagocytosis of C. albicans showed the formation of PIPs in phagosomes containing this yeast (Heinsbroek, 2009). This was attributed to pathogenic mechanisms. On the other hand, and coinciding with the authors' interpretation, Naufer et al., 2018 recently reported that PI(Bauer et al., 2001)P co-exists with phagolysosomal markers in the phagocytic cup of heat-killed filamentous bacteria. Maybe the authors could mention this in their Discussion section.</p></disp-quote><p>As reported by Heinsbroek et al., 2009, we have also seen secondary waves of actin polymerization as a result of reacquisition of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> and PI(3,4)P<sub>2</sub>/PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> on the phagosomes of serum opsonized sheep red blood cells (Bohdanowicz et al., 2010), internalized via CR3. We have added additional text and references to both papers in subsection “Phospholipid segregation between the plasma membrane and the cuff-delimited phagosomal cup” of the revised manuscript. We have also mentioned the work of Naufer et al., 2018 to indicate that live <italic>C. albicans</italic> is not required for actin cuff formation (as we see in Figure 10E). This new paper is also now referenced in subsection “Phospholipid segregation between the plasma membrane and the cuff-delimited phagosomal cup”. However, we feel that extensive discussion of the similarities/differences between these findings and our work is outside the scope of this manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Please clarify: In Figure 4, human serum was used to complement opsonize hyphae. How did the authors account for the presence of antibodies against C. albincans in the serum? Antibodies could be expected as this yeast is part of the human microbiome</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewers raise a valid point; in the text and figures we have purposefully used the general term “serum opsonization” and not complement opsonization, because additional opsonization by antibodies to <italic>C. albicans</italic> could indeed occur. This is now explicitly acknowledged in the Discussion sectionof the main text, and also in the Materials and methods section. Although not mentioned in the paper, we believe that immunoglobulins contribute comparatively little to the opsonization because Fc receptor-dependent phagocytosis is dependent on SFKs and Arp2/3, while we find the formation of actin cuffs to be insensitive to the respective inhibitors PP2 and CK666 (Figures 5E and 5G).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Caspofungin treatment could prevent the deposition of complement in hyphae, and its recognition by antibodies and Dectin-1. This could explain the results in Figure 4—figure supplement 1.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for their astute observation. We have included discussion of this caveat in the Discussion section. It is possible that complement binds less to the caspofungin-treated hyphae, as reports of Boxx et al., 2010 and Kozel et al., 1987 indicate that a portion of the complement binding occurs on fungal glucans. Nevertheless, we regard this as unlikely because the fungal cell wall is rich in other polysaccharides and proteins that can serve to attach complement. In this regard, it is noteworthy that caspofungin-treated <italic>C. albicans</italic> bind concanavalin A normally (Figure 4E), indicating that mannans are still present.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The authors showed that ROS production in the phagocytic cup retarded the elongation of the hyphae. This was alleviated by blocking CR3 with monoclonal antibodies to impede the formation of cuffs, a procedure that favours a ROS leaching. Since ROS are generally considered microbicidal, perhaps, ROS failing to reach lethal concentrations in the open cup could be the cause of the effect reported by the authors. Therefore, assuming a microbiostatic mechanism is probably incorrect.</p></disp-quote><p>As pointed out be the reviewers, when CR3 is blocked ROS may exit the open cup more readily, reducing their efficiency. However, leakage of phagosomal contents or ROS does not explain the failure of the frustrated phagosomes to kill the fungus, because <italic>C. albicans</italic> yeast and hyphae survive also within fully sealed phagosomes. Thus, in the case of <italic>C. albicans</italic>, ROS is not strictly microbicidal. This is now discussed in the Discussion section of the revised text.</p><p>Additionally, after reviewing the changes requested for submission of the revised manuscript, we now ensure that the requested file formats are provided, the title has been reconciled, the requested cell line information is now included in the Materials and methods section, and the source data for graphs in the main figures is provided. Please note, that in lieu of a Key Resources Table and RRIDs, we have comprehensively provided all essential information (suppliers and catalogue numbers for all cell lines, antibodies, and plasmids and reagents) in the Materials and methods section.</p></body></sub-article></article>
