Here we demonstrate that parieto-occipital regions in EB enhance their synchronization to acoustic fluctuations in human speech in the theta-range (corresponding to syllabic rate), irrespective of speech intelligibility. Crucially, enhanced synchronization to the intelligibility of speech was selectively observed in primary visual cortex in EB, suggesting that this region is at the interface between speech perception and comprehension. Moreover, EB showed overall enhanced functional connectivity between temporal and occipital cortices that are sensitive to speech intelligibility and altered directionality when compared to the sighted group. These findings suggest that the occipital cortex of the blind adopts an architecture that allows the tracking of speech material, and therefore does not fully abstract from the reorganized sensory inputs it receives.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>blindness</kwd><kwd>neuroplasticity</kwd><kwd>crossmodal</kwd><kwd>language</kwd><kwd>speech-tracking</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010663</institution-id><institution>H2020 European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>337573</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Van Ackeren</surname><given-names>Markus Johannes</given-names></name><name><surname>Mattioni</surname><given-names>Stefania</given-names></name><name><surname>Bottini</surname><given-names>Roberto</given-names></name><name><surname>Collignon</surname><given-names>Olivier</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Blind people re-purpose the brain's visual areas for tracking speech rhythm.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The human cortex comprises a number of specialized units, functionally tuned to specific types of information. How this functional architecture emerges, persists, and develops throughout a person’s life are among the most challenging and exciting questions in neuroscience research. Although there is little debate that both genetic and environmental influences affect brain development, it is currently not known how these two factors shape the functional architecture of the cortex. A key topic in this debate is the organization of the human language system. Language is commonly thought to engage a well-known network of regions around the lateral sulcus. The consistency of this functional mapping across individuals and its presence early in development are remarkable, and often used to argue that the neurobiological organization of the human language system is the result of innate constraints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Dehaene-Lambertz et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Berwick et al., 2013</xref>). Does the existence of a highly consistent set of regions for language acquisition and processing imply that this network is ‘hardwired’ and immutable to experience? Strong nativist theories for linguistic innateness leave little room for plasticity due to experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bates, 1999</xref>), suggesting that we should conceive ‘the growth of language as analogous to the development of a bodily organ’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Chomsky, 1976</xref>, p.11). However, studies in infants born with extensive damage to cortical regions that are typically involved in language processing may develop normal language abilities, thereby demonstrating that the language network is subject to reorganization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bates, 2005</xref>). Perhaps the most intriguing demonstrations to show that the neurobiology of language is susceptible to change due to experiencecome from studies showing functional selectivity to language in primary and secondary ‘visual’ areas in congenitally blind individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Röder et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Burton, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Amedi et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bedny et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Arnaud et al., 2013</xref>). Such reorganization of the language network is particularly fascinating because it arises in the absence of injury to the core language network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bates, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Atilgan et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>However, the level at which the occipital cortex is involved in speech representation in the early blind (EB), remains poorly understood. Speech comprehension requires that the brain extracts meaning from the acoustic features of sounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">de Heer et al., 2017</xref>). Although several neuroimaging studies have yielded valuable insights about the processing of speech in EB adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Arnaud et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bedny et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Büchel, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Lane et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Röder et al., 2002</xref>) and infants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bedny et al., 2015</xref>), these methods do not adequately capture the fast and continuous nature of speech processing. Because speech unfolds over time, understanding spoken language relies on the ability to track the incoming acoustic signal in near real-time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Peelle and Davis, 2012</xref>). Indeed, speech is a fluctuating acoustic signal that rhythmically excites neuronal populations in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Poeppel et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Gross et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Peelle et al., 2013</xref>). Several studies have demonstrated that neuronal populations in auditory areas entrain to the acoustic fluctuations that are present in human speech around the syllabic rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Luo and Poeppel, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Kayser et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Szymanski et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Zoefel and VanRullen, 2015</xref>). It has therefore been suggested that entrainment reflects a key mechanism underlying hearing by facilitating the parsing of individual syllables through adjusting the sensory gain relative to fluctuations in the acoustic energy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Giraud and Poeppel, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Peelle and Davis, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ding and Simon, 2014</xref>). Crucially, because some regions that track the specific acoustic rhythm of speech are sensitive to speech intelligibility, neural synchronization is not only driven by changes in the acoustic cue of the auditory stimuli, but also reflects cortical encoding and processing of the auditory signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Peelle et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ding and Simon, 2014</xref>). Speech tracking is therefore an invaluable tool to probe regions that interface speech perception and comprehension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Poeppel et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Gross et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Peelle et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Does the occipital cortex of EB people synchronize to speech rhythm? Is this putative synchronization of neural activity to speech influenced by comprehension? Addressing these questions would provide novel insights into the functional organization of speech processing rooted in the occipital cortex of EB people. In the current study, we investigated whether neuronal populations in blind occipital cortex synchronize to rhythmic dynamics of speech, by relating the amplitude fluctuations in speech to electromagnetic dynamics recorded from the participant’s brain. To this end, we quantified the local brain activity and directed connectivity in a group of early blind (EB; n = 17) and sighted individuals (SI; n = 16) using magnetoencephalography (MEG) while participants listened to short narrations from audiobooks. If the occipital cortex of the blind entrains to speech rhythms, this will support the idea that this region processes low-level acoustic features relevant for understanding language. We further tested whether the putative synchronization of occipital responses in EB people benefits from linguistic information or only relates to acoustic information. To separate linguistic and acoustic processes, we relied on a noise-vocoding manipulation. This method spectrally distorted the speech signal in order to impair intelligibility gradually, but systematically preserves the slow amplitude fluctuations responsible for speech rhythm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Shannon et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Peelle and Davis, 2012</xref>). Furthermore, to go beyond differences in the local encoding of speech rhythm in the occipital cortex, we also investigated whether the connectivity between occipital and temporal regions sensitive to speech comprehension is altered in early blindness.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Story comprehension</title><p>Participants listened to either natural speech segments (nat-condition) or to altered vocoded versions of these segments (see Materials and methods for details). In the 8-channel vocoded condition, the voice of the speaker is highly distorted but the intelligibility is unperturbed. By contrast, in the 1-channel vocoded condition, the speech is entirely unintelligible. After listening to each speech segment, participants were provided with a short statement about the segment, and asked to indicate whether the statement was true or false. Behavioural performance on these comprehension statements was analysed using linear mixed-effects models with maximum likelihood estimation. This method is a linear regression that takes into account dependencies in the data, as present in repeated measures designs. Blindness and intelligibility were included as fixed effects, while subject was modelled as a random effect. Intelligibility was nested in subjects. Intelligibility had a significant effect on story comprehension (<italic>χ</italic>(2)=110.7, p&lt;0.001). The effect of blindness and the interaction between intelligibility and blindness were non-significant (<italic>χ</italic>(1)=1.14, p=0.286 and <italic>χ</italic>(2)=0.24, p=0.889). Orthogonal contrasts demonstrated that speech comprehension was stronger in the nat and 8-channel condition versus the 1-channel condition (b = 0.78, <italic>t</italic>(62)=14.43, p&lt;0.001, r = 0.88). There was no difference between the nat and the 8-channel condition (b = 0.02, <italic>t</italic>(62)=1.39, p=0.17). Thus, speech intelligibility was reduced in the 1-channel, but not the 8-channel vocoded condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). The lack of effect for the factor blindness suggests that there is no evidence for a potential difference in comprehension, attention or motivation between groups.

This first analysis was performed on the combined dataset, and hence is not prone to bias or circularity for subsequent analyses, targeting group differences. The peak in the current study is slightly higher than those reported in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Gross et al., 2013</xref>). A likely explanation for this shift is the difference in syllabic rate between English (~6.2 Hz), used in previous studies, and Italian (~7 Hz) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Pellegrino et al., 2011</xref>). The syllabic rate is the main carrier of amplitude fluctuations in speech, and thus is most prone to reset oscillatory activity.</p><p>To capture the temporal scale of cerebro-acoustic coherence effects (6–7 Hz) optimally, and to achieve a robust source estimate, source reconstruction was performed on two separate frequency windows (6 ± 2, and 7 ± 2 Hz) for each subject and condition. The two source images were averaged for subsequent analysis, yielding a single image representing the frequency range 4–9 Hz. By combining the two frequency-bands, we acquire a source estimate that emphasizes the center of our frequency band of interest (6–7 Hz) and tapers off towards the edges. This source estimate optimally represents the coherence spectrum observed in sensor space. The choice of the center frequency was also restricted by the length of the time window used for the analysis. That is, with a 1 s time window and a resulting 1 Hz frequency resolution, a non-integer center frequency at, for example, 6.5 Hz was not feasible. The source-reconstructed coherence at the frequency-range of interest confirmed that cerebro-acoustic coherence was strongest across groups and conditions in bilateral temporal lobes, including primary auditory cortex. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>).</p><p>To test whether envelope tracking in the current study is modulated by intelligibility, we compared the coherence maps for the intelligible (nat) versus non-intelligible (1-channel) condition, in all groups combined (i.e., EB and SI), with dependent-samples permutation t-tests in SPM. The resulting statistical map (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>, p&lt;0.05, FWE-corrected) revealed a cluster in right superior and middle temporal cortex (STG, MTG), where synchronization to the envelope of speech was stronger when participants had access to the content of the story. In other words, the effect of intelligibility on the sensory response (coherence with the speech envelope) suggests an interface between acoustic speech processing and comprehension in STG that is present in both groups.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Speech tracking in blind parieto-occipital cortex</title><p>Whether EB individuals recruit additional neural substrate for tracking the envelope of speech was tested using independent-samples permutation t-tests in SPM, contrasting coherence maps between EB and SI for all three conditions combined.

As highlighted in the introduction, we were particularly interested in the role played by the Calcarine sulcus (V1) in processing semantic attributes of speech (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Burton et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Röder et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Amedi et al., 2003</xref>), and therefore we restricted the statistical analysis to the area around the primary visual cortex. The search volume was constructed from four 10 mm spheres around coordinates in bilateral Calcarine sulcus ([−7,–81, −3]; [−6,–85, 4]; [12, -87, 0; 10, –84, 6]). The coordinates were extracted from a previous study on speech comprehension in EB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Burton et al., 2002</xref>). The resulting mask also include regions highlighted in similar studies by other groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Röder et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bedny et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>A significant effect of the interaction between blindness and intelligibility [(nat<sub>EB</sub> – 1-channel<sub>EB</sub>) – (nat<sub>SI</sub> – 1-channel<sub>SI</sub>)] was observed in right calcarine sulcus. To explore the spatial specificity of the effect, we show the whole-brain statistical map for the interaction between intelligibility and blindness at a more liberal threshold (p&lt;0.005, uncorrected) in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>. This shows that intelligible speech selectively engages the area around the right calcarine sulcus in the blind versus the sighted. Specifically, the region corresponding to right ‘visual’ cortex showed enhanced sensitivity to intelligible speech in EB versus SI (p&lt;0.05, FWE-corrected). However, the analysis contrasting the two intelligible conditions (nat and 8-channel) did not yield a significant effect in the EB, suggesting that the low-level degrading of the stimulus alone does not drive the effect, but rather the intelligibility of the speech segment. Follow-up post-hoc comparisons between the two groups revealed that coherence was stronger during the intelligible condition for EB versus SI (t[30] = 3.09, p=0.004), but not during the unintelligible condition (t[30] = –1.08, p=0.29).</p><p>A group difference between EB and SI across conditions was not observed in the calcarine region (t[30] = 1.1, p=0.28). The lack of an overall group effect in calcarine sulcus suggests that there is not a simple enhanced sensory response to speech in the blind. This was different to the response we observed in parietal cortex, in which synchronization was stronger in the blind than in the sighted. Rather, the response in calcarine sulcus only differed between the two groups when speech was intelligible. While overall coherence with the speech envelope was equally high in EB and SI, the blind population showed significantly higher coherence in the intelligible speech condition than did the sighted, who showed higher cerebro-acoustic coherence in the unintelligible condition (1-Chan). The latter is reminiscent of the fact that the more adverse the listening condition (low signal-to-noise-ratio or audio-visual incongruence), the more the visual cortex is entrained to the visual speech signal of actual acoustic speech when presented together with varying levels of acoustic noise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Park et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Giordano et al., 2017</xref>). Moreover, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Giordano et al. (2017)</xref> showed an increase of directed connectivity between superior frontal regions and visual cortex under the most challenging (acoustic noise and uninformative visual cues) conditions, again suggesting a link between the reorganization observed in the occipital cortex of blind individuals and typical multisensory pathways involving the occipital cortex in audio-visual speech processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Kayser et al., 2008</xref>). Visual deprivation since birth, however, triggers a functional reorganization of the calcarine region that can then dynamically interact with the intelligibility of the speech signal.

Using source-localized MEG activity, we confirm and extend previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Scott et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Davis and Johnsrude, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Narain et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Rodd et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Okada et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Peelle et al., 2010</xref>) by showing that temporal brain regions entrain to the natural rhythm of speech signal in both blind and sighted groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Strikingly, we show that following early visual deprivation, occipito-parietal regions enhance their synchronization to the acoustic rhythm of speech (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>) independently of language content. That is, the region around the Precuneus/Cuneus area seems to be involved in low-level processing of acoustic information alone. Previous studies have demonstrated that this area enhances its response to auditory information after early, but not late, visual deprivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Collignon et al., 2013</xref>) and maintains this elevated response to sound even after sight-restoration early in life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Collignon et al., 2015</xref>). These studies did not find that this crossmodal response was related to a specific cognitive function, but rather pointed to a more general response to sounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Collignon et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">2015</xref>). Interestingly, the current data suggest that this area is capable of parsing complex temporal patterns in sounds but is insensitive to the intelligibility of speech, again suggesting a more general role in sound processing.</p><p>In order to isolate the brain regions that are modulated by speech comprehension, we identified regions showing a greater response to amplitude modulations that convey speech information as compared to amplitude modulations that do not. In addition to the right STG observed in both groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>), the blind showed enhanced cerebro-acoustic coherence during intelligible speech in the vicinity of calcarine sulcus (V1; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>). This pattern of local encoding was accompanied by enhanced occipito-temporal connectivity during speech comprehension in EB as compared to SI. SI show the expected feed-forward projections from occipital to temporal regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Lamme et al., 1998</xref>), whereas EB show a more balanced connectivity profile, trending towards the reverse temporal to occipital direction (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). These findings support the idea of a reverse hierarchical model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Büchel, 2003</xref>) of the occipital cortex in EB, where the regions typically coding for ‘low-level’ visual features in the sighted (e.g. visual contrast or orientation) participate in higher-level function (e.g. speech intelligibility). Indeed, previous studies have found increased activity in the primary ‘visual’ cortex of EB people during Braille reading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Sadato et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Burton et al., 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">2012</xref>), verbal memory and verb generation tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Amedi et al., 2003</xref>), and during auditory language-related processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bedny et al., 2011</xref>). In line with our results, activity in primary occipital regions in EB people is stronger in a semantic versus a phonologic task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Burton et al., 2003</xref>), and vary as a function of syntactic and semantic complexity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Röder et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bedny et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Lane et al., 2015</xref>). Moreover, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) over the occipital pole induces more semantic errors than phonologic errors in a verb-generation task in EB people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Amedi et al., 2003</xref>). As we show that occipital regions entrain to the envelope of speech and are enhanced by its intelligibility, our results clearly suggest that the involvement of the occipital pole for language is not fully abstracted from sensory inputs as previously suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bedny, 2017</xref>). The role of the occipital cortex in tracking the flow of speech in EB people may constitute an adaptive strategy to boost perceptual sensitivity at informational peaks in language.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Mechanistic origins of envelope tracking in occipital cortex</title><p>Although language is not the only cognitive process that selectively activates the occipital cortex of EB people, it is arguably one of the most puzzling. The reason is that reorganization of other processes, such as auditory motion perception and tactile object recognition, appears to follow the topography of the functionally equivalent visual processes in the sighted brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Ricciardi et al., 2007a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Amedi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Dormal et al., 2016</xref>). For example, the hMT+/V5 complex, which is typically involved in visual motion in the sighted, selectively processes auditory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Poirier et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Dormal et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Jiang et al., 2016</xref>) or tactile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Ricciardi et al., 2007b</xref>) motion in blind people. However, in the case of language, such recruitment is striking in light of the cognitive and evolutionary differences between vision and language (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bedny et al., 2011</xref>). This led to the proposal that, at birth, human cortical areas are cognitively pluripotent: capable of assuming a broad range of unrelated cognitive functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bedny, 2017</xref>). However, this argument resides on the presupposition that language has no computational relation with vision. But does this proposition tally with what we know about the relationship between the visual system and the classical language network? Rhythmic information in speech has a well-known language-related surrogate in the visual domain: lip movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Lewkowicz and Hansen-Tift, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Park et al., 2016</xref>). Indeed, both acoustic and visual speech signals exhibit rhythmic temporal patterns at prosodic and syllabic rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Chandrasekaran et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Schwartz and Savariaux, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Giordano et al., 2017</xref>). The perception of lip kinematics that are naturally linked to amplitude fluctuations in speech serves as an important vehicle for the everyday use of language (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Kuhl and Meltzoff, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Weikum et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Lewkowicz and Hansen-Tift, 2012</xref>) and helps language understanding, particularly in noisy conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Ross et al., 2007</xref>). Indeed, reading lips in the absence of any sound activates both primary and association auditory regions overlapping with regions that are active during the actual perception of spoken words (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Calvert et al., 1997</xref>). The synchronicity between auditory and visual speech entrains rhythmic activity in the observer’s primary auditory and visual regions, and facilitates perception by aligning neural excitability with acoustic or visual speech features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Schroeder et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Schroeder and Lakatos, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Giraud and Poeppel, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Mesgarani and Chang, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Peelle and Davis, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">van Wassenhove, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">Zion Golumbic et al., 2013b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Park et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Giordano et al., 2017</xref>). These results strongly suggest that both the auditory and the visual components of speech are processed together at the earliest level possible in neural circuitry, based on the shared slow temporal modulations (around 2–7 Hz range) present across modalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Chandrasekaran et al., 2009</xref>). Corroborating this idea, it has been demonstrated that neuronal populations in visual cortex follow the temporal dynamics of lip movements in sighted individuals, similar to the way in which temporal regions follow the acoustic and visual fluctuations of speech (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Luo et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Zion Golumbic et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Park et al., 2016</xref>). Similar to temporal cortex, occipital cortex in the sighted also shows enhanced lip tracking when attention is directed to speech content. This result highlights the fact that a basic oscillatory architecture for tracking the dynamic aspects of (visual-) speech in occipital cortex exists even in sighted individuals.</p><p>Importantly, audiovisual integration of the temporal dynamics of speech has been suggested to play a key role when learning speech early in life: young infants detect, match, and integrate the auditory and visual temporal coherence of speech (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Kuhl and Meltzoff, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Rosenblum et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Lewkowicz, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Brookes et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Patterson and Werker, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Lewkowicz and Ghazanfar, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Kushnerenko et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Bristow et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Pons et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Vouloumanos et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Lewkowicz et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Nath et al., 2011</xref>). For instance, young infants between 4 and 6 months of age can detect their native language from lip movements only (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Weikum et al., 2007</xref>). Around the same period, children detect synchrony between lip movements and speech sounds, and distribute more attention towards the mouth than towards the eyes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Lewkowicz and Hansen-Tift, 2012</xref>). Linking what they hear to the lip movements may provide young infants with a stepping-stone towards language production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Lewkowicz and Hansen-Tift, 2012</xref>). Moreover, infants aged 10 weeks already exhibit a McGurk effect, again highlighting the early multisensory nature of speech perception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Rosenblum et al., 1997</xref>). Taken together, these results suggest that an audio-visual link between observing lip movements and hearing speech sounds is present at very early developmental stages, potentially from birth, which helps infants acquire their first language.</p><p>In line with these prior studies, the current results may support the biased connectivity hypothesis of cross-modal reorganization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Reich et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Hannagan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Striem-Amit et al., 2015</xref>). Indeed, it has been argued that reorganization in blind occipital cortex may be constrained by functional pathways to other sensory and cognitive systems that are also present in sighted individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Elman et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Hannagan et al., 2015</xref>). This hypothesis may explain the overlap in functional specialization between blind and sighted individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Collignon et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Dormal et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">He et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Jiang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Peelen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Pietrini et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Weeks et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Poirier et al., 2006</xref>). In our experiment, sensitivity to acoustic dynamics of intelligible speech in blind occipital cortex could arise from pre-existing occipito-temporal pathways connecting the auditory and visual system that are particularly important for the early developmental stages of language acquisition. In fact, the reorganization of this potentially predisposed pathway to process language content would explain how language-selective response may appear in blind children as young as 3 years old (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bedny et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Previous studies have suggested that language processing in the occipital cortex arises through top-down projections from frontal regions typically associated with the classical language network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bedny et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Deen et al., 2015</xref>), and that the representational content is symbolic and abstract rather than sensory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bedny, 2017</xref>). Our results contrast with this view by showing that neuronal populations in (peri-)calcarine cortex align to the temporal dynamics of intelligible speech, and are functionally connected to areas sensitive to auditory information in temporal cortex. In sighted individuals, regions of the temporal lobe including STS are sensitive to acoustic features of speech, whereas higher-level regions such as anterior temporal cortex and left inferior frontal gyrus are relatively insensitive to these features and therefore do not entrain to the syllabic rate of speech (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Davis and Johnsrude, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Hickok and Poeppel, 2007</xref>; see confirmation in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F–G</xref>). This suggests that occipital areas respond, at least partially, to speech at a much lower (sensory) level than previously thought in EB brains, which may be caused by the reorganization of existing multisensory pathways connecting the ‘auditory’ and ‘visual’ centres in the brain.</p><p>Functional dependencies between sensory systems exist between the earliest stages of sensory processing in both human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ghazanfar and Schroeder, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Kayser et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Schroeder and Lakatos, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Murray et al., 2016</xref>) and nonhuman primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Falchier et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Lakatos et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Schroeder and Lakatos, 2009</xref>). Several neuroimaging studies have demonstrated enhanced functional connectivity in sighted individuals between auditory and visual cortices under multisensory conditions (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Murray et al., 2016</xref> for a recent review), including multisensory speech (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Giordano et al., 2017</xref>). Moreover, neuroimaging studies have shown that hearing people consistently activate left temporal regions during silent speech-reading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Calvert et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">MacSweeney et al., 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">2001</xref>). We therefore postulate that brain networks that are typically dedicated to the integration of audio-visual speech signal, might be reorganized in the absence of visual inputs and might lead to an extension of speech tracking in the occipital cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Collignon et al., 2009</xref>). Although an experience-dependent mechanism related to EB affects the strength and directionality of the connectivity between the occipital and temporal regions, the presence of intrinsic connectivity between these regions — which can also be observed in sighted individuals (e.g. for multisensory integration) — may constrain the expression of the plasticity observed in our task. Building on this connectivity bias, the occipital pole may extend its sensitivity to the intelligibility of speech, a computation this region is obviously not originally dedicated to.</p><p>A number of recent studies have suggested that visual deprivation reinforces the functional connections between the occipital cortex and auditory regions typically classified as the language network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Hasson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Schepers et al., 2012</xref>). Previous studies using dynamic causal modelling support the idea that auditory information reaches the reorganized occipital cortex of the blind through direct temporo-occipital connection, rather than using subcortical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Klinge et al., 2010</xref>) or top-down pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Collignon et al., 2013</xref>). In support of these studies, we observed that the overall magnitude of functional connectivity between occipital and temporal cortex is higher in blind people than in sighted people during natural speech comprehension. Moreover, directional connectivity analysis revealed that the interaction between the two cortices is also qualitatively different: sighted individuals show a strong feed-forward drive towards temporal cortex, whereas blind individuals show a more balanced information flow, and a trend in the reverse direction. These results highlight one possible pathway by which the speech signal is enhanced in the occipital cortex of EB individuals. However, this does not mean that the changes in connectivity between blind and sighted individuals are limited to this specific network (e.g. see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Kayser et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Park et al., 2015</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Speech comprehension in the right hemisphere</title><p>We observed that neuronal populations in right superior temporal cortex synchronize to the temporal dynamics of intelligible, but not non-intelligible, speech in both EB and SI groups.

The present study therefore replicates these results by showing enhanced phase coupling between the right hemisphere and the speech envelope at the syllabic rate (low-frequency phase of speech envelope), consistent with the AST model. An interesting observation in the current study is that right hemispheric sensitivity to intelligible speech in temporal areas coincides with the enhanced right hemispheric sensitivity to intelligible speech in the occipital cortex of blind individuals.</p><p>Having more cortical tissue devoted to sentence processing and understanding could potentially support enhanced sentence comprehension. Previous studies have indeed demonstrated that, as compared to sighted individuals, blind people have enhanced speech discrimination in noisy environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Niemeyer and Starlinger, 1981</xref>), as well as the capability to understand speech displayed at a much faster rate (sighted listeners at rates of 9–14 syllables/s andblind listeners at rates of 17–22 syllables/s; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Moos and Trouvain, 2007</xref>). Crucially, listening to intelligible ultra-fast speech (as compared to reverse speech) has been shown to cause enhanced activity in the right primary visual cortex in early and late blind individuals when compared to sighted controls, and activity in this region correlates with individual ultra-fast speech perception skills [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Dietrich et al., 2013</xref>]). These results raise the interesting possibility that the engagement of right V1 in the analysis of the speech envelope, as demonstrated in our study, may support the enhanced encoding of early supra-segmental aspects of the speech signal, supporting the ability to understand an ultra-fast speech signal. However, our behavioral task (speech comprehension) did not allow us to directly assess this link between the reorganized occipital cortex and speech comprehension, as by design performance was almost at ceiling in the nat and 8-chan condition but at chance in the 1-chan condition (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>However, it is important to note that linking brain activity and behavior is not a trivial issue. Many studies have not found a direct link between crossmodal reorganization and non-visual processing. More generally, as a behavioral outcome is the end product of a complex interactive process between several brain regions, linking the role of one region in isolation (e.g. the reorganized region in the occipital cortex of blind people) to behavior (e.g. performance) in a multifaced task is not straightforward. An absence of a direct relation between behavior (e.g. speech processing) and crossmodal plasticity could be explained by the fact that this complex process is supported by additional networks other than the reorganized ones. Interestingly, recent studies have shown that early visual deprivation triggers a game of ‘balance’ between the brain systems typically dedicated to a specific process and the reorganized occipital cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Dormal et al., 2016</xref>). It has indeed been proposed that early visual deprivation triggers a redeployment mechanism that would reallocate part of the processing typically implemented in the preserved networks (i.e. the temporal or frontal cortices for speech processing) to the occipital cortex deprived of its most salient input (vision). Two recent studies using multivoxel pattern analysis (MVPA) showed that the ability to decode the different auditory motion stimuli was enhanced in hMT+ (a region typically involved in visual motion in sighted individuals) of early blind individuals, whereas an enhanced decoding accuracy was observed in the planum temporale in the sighted group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Jiang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Dormal et al., 2016</xref>). Moreover, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bedny et al. (2015)</xref> reported an enhanced activation of occipital cortex and a simultaneous deactivation of prefrontal regions during a linguistic task in blind children. The authors suggested that the increased involvement of the occipital cortex might decrease the pressure on the prefrontal areas to specialize in language processing. Interestingly, a transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) study reported a reduced disruptive effect of TMS applied over the left inferior prefrontal cortex during linguistic tasks for both blind and sighted individuals, whereas TMS applied over the occipital cortex caused more disruption in early blind as compared to sighted people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Amedi et al., 2004</xref>). Such studies support the idea that brain regions that are typically recruited for specific tasks in sighted individuals may become less essential in EB people if they concomitantly recruit occipital regions for the same task. An important open question for future research therefore concerns the relative behavioral contribution of occipital and perisylvian cortex to speech understanding.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Conclusions</title><p>We demonstrate that the primary ‘visual’ cortex synchronizes to the temporal dynamics of intelligible speech at the rate of syllable transitions in language (~6–7 Hz). Our results demonstrate that this neural population is involved in processing the sensory signal of speech, and therefore contrasts with the proposition that occipital involvement in speech processing is abstracted from its sensory input and purely reflects higher-level operations similar to those observed in prefrontal regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bedny, 2017</xref>). Blindness, due to the absence of organizing visual input, leaves the door open for sensory and functional colonization of occipital regions. This colonization might however not be stochastic, but could be constrained by modes of information processing that are natively anchored in specific brain regions and networks. Even if the exact processing mode is still to be unveiled by future research, we hypothesise that the mapping of language onto occipital cortex builds upon pre-existing oscillatory architecture typically linking auditory and visual speech rhythm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Chandrasekaran et al., 2009</xref>). Our study therefore supports the view that the development of functional specialisation in the human cortex is the product of a dynamic interplay between genetic and environmental factors during development, rather than being predetermined at birth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Elman et al., 1996</xref>).</p><media id="video1" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-31640-video1.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31640.006</object-id><label>Video 1.</label><caption><title>Movie of the natural and two vocoding conditions used for one exemplar of auditory segment used in our experiment.</title></caption></media></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Participants</title><p>Seventeen early blind (11 female; mean ± SD, 32.9 ± 10.19 years; range, 20–67 years) and sixteen sighted individuals (10 female; mean ± SD, 32.2 ± 9.92 years; range, 20–53 years) participated in the current study. There was no age difference between the blind and the sighted group (<italic>t</italic>[30] = 0.19, p=0.85). All blind participants were either totally blind or severely visually impaired from birth; however, two participants reported residual visual perception before the age of 3 and one before the age of 4, as well as one participant who lost their sight completely at age 10. Causes of vision loss were damage or detached retina (10), damage to the optic nerve (3), infection of the eyes (1), microphtalmia (2), and hypoxia (1). Although some participants reported residual light perception, none were able to use vision functionally. All participants were proficient braille readers and native speakers of Italian. None of them suffered from a known neurological or peripheral auditory disease. The data from one sighted individual were not included because of the discovery of a brain structural abnormality that was unknown to the experimenters at the time of the experiment. The project was approved by the local ethical committee at the University of Trento. In agreement with the Declaration of Helsinki, all participants provided written informed consent before participating in the study.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Experimental design</title><p>Auditory stimuli were delivered into the magnetically shielded MEG room via stereo loudspeakers using a Panphonics Sound Shower two amplifier at a comfortable sound level, which was the same for all participants. Stimulus presentation was controlled via the Matlab (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_001622">SCR_001622</ext-link>) Psychophysics Toolbox 3 (http://psychtoolbox.org; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_002881">SCR_002881</ext-link>) running on a Dell Alienware Aurora PC under Windows 7 (64 bit). Both sighted and blind participants were blindfolded during the experiment, and the room was dimly lit to allow for visual monitoring of the participant via a video feed from the MEG room. Instructions were provided throughout the experiment using previous recordings from one of the experimenters (FB).</p><p>The stimuli consisted of 14 short segments (~1 min) from popular audiobooks (e.g., Pippi Longstocking and Candide) in Italian (nat). Furthermore, channel-vocoding in the Praat software was used to produce two additional control conditions. First, the original sound file was band-pass filtered into 1 (1-channel) or 8 (8-channel) logarithmically spaced frequency bands. The envelope for each of these bands was computed, filled with Gaussian white noise, and the different signals were recombined into a single sound file. The resulting signal has an amplitude envelope close to the original, while the fine spectral detail was gradually distorted. Perceptually, the voice of the speaker is highly distorted in the 8-channel condition, but intelligibility is unperturbed. By contrast, in the 1-channel condition, speech is entirely unintelligible. In total, 42 sound files were presented in a pseudo-randomized fashion, distributed among seven blocks. Each block contained two sound files from each condition, and the same story was never used twice in the same block. Examples of the stimuli are provided in supplementary media content ( see <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>).</p><p>To verify story comprehension, each speech segment was followed by a single-sentence statement about the story. Participants were instructed to listen to the story carefully, and to judge whether the statement at the end was true or false, using a nonmagnetic button box. Responses were provided with the index and middle finger of the right hand.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>MEG data acquisition and preprocessing</title><p>MEG was recorded continuously from a 306 triple sensor (204 planar gradiometers; 102 magnetometers) whole-head system (Elekta Neuromag, Helsinki, Finland) using a sampling rate of 1 kHz and an online band-bass filter between 0.1 and 300 Hz. The headshape of each individual participant was measured using a Polhemus FASTRAK 3D digitizer. Head position of the subject was recorded continuously using five localization coils (forehead, mastoids).</p><p>Data pre-processing was performed using the open-source Matlab toolbox Fieldtrip (www.fieldtriptoolbox.org; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_004849">SCR_004849</ext-link>). First the continuous data were filtered (high-pass Butterworth filter at 1 Hz, low-pass Butterworth filter at 170 Hz, and DFT filter at 50,100, and 150 Hz to remove line-noise artefacts in the signal), and downsampled to 256 Hz. Next, the data were epoched into segments of 1 s for subsequent analysis.</p><p>Rejection of trials containing artefacts and bad channels was performed using a semi-automatic procedure. First, outliers were rejected using a pre-screening based on the variance and range in each trial/channel. Then, algorithmically guided visual inspection of the raw data was performed to remove any remaining sources of noise.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Extraction of the speech amplitude envelope</title><p>Amplitude envelopes of the stories were computed using the Chimera toolbox (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Chandrasekaran et al., 2009</xref>) and custom code, following the procedure described by Gross and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Gross et al., 2013</xref>). First, the sound files were band-pass filtered between 100 and 1000 Hz into nine frequency-bands, using a fourth order Butterworth filter. The filter was applied in forward and backward direction to avoid any phase shifts with respect to the original signal, and frequency-bands were spaced with equal width along the human basilar membrane. Subsequently, the analytic amplitude for each filtered segment was computed as the absolute of the Hilbert transform. Finally, the amplitude envelopes of all nine bands were summed and scaled to a maximum value of 1. The resulting envelope was combined with the MEG data, and processed identically henceforth.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Analysis of cerebro-acoustic coherence</title><p>To determine where, and at what temporal scale, neuronal populations follow the temporal dynamics of speech, we computed spectral coherence between the speech envelope and the MEG signal. Coherence is a statistic that quantifies the phase relationship between two signals, and can be used to relate oscillatory activity in the brain with a peripheral measure such as a speech signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Peelle et al., 2013</xref>). The first analysis was conducted in sensor space, across conditions and participants, to determine the temporal scale at which coherence between the speech envelope and the MEG signal is strongest. To this end, a Hanning taper was applied to the 1 s data segments, and Fourier transformation was used to compute the cross-spectral density between 1 and 30 Hz, with a step size of 1 Hz. To render the coherence values more normally distributed, a Fisher z-transform was applied by computing the inverse hyperbolic tangent (atanh).</p><p>Source-space analysis was centred on the coherence frequency-band of interest (FOI) identified in the sensor space analysis. Source reconstruction was performed using a frequency domain beamformer called Dynamic Imaging of Coherent Sources (DICS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Gross et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Liljeström et al., 2005</xref>). DICS was used to localize spectral coherence, observed at the sensors, on a three-dimensional grid (8 × 8 × 8 mm). The forward model was based on a realistic single-shell headmodel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Nolte, 2003</xref>) for each individual. As structural scans could not be acquired for all participants, we approximated individual anatomy by warping a structural MNI template brain (MNI, Montreal, Quebec, Canada; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.bic.mni.mcgill.ca/brainweb">www.bic.mni.mcgill.ca/brainweb</ext-link>) into individual headspace using the information from each participant’s headshape.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Source connectivity analysis</title><p>Functional connectivity between occipital and temporal cortex was computed by extracting virtual sensor time-series at the locations of interest in CS and STG using time-domain beamforming. These virtual sensor time series were used to compute non-directional and directional connectivity metrics. The rationale behind focusing our analyses on STG and CS is to limit our hypothesis space by the results as they unfolded in our analytic steps. Indeed, we found that the right STG was the only region modulated by the intelligibility of speech in both groups, confirming previous results using similar methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Luo and Poeppel, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abrams et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Gross et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Giordano et al., 2017</xref>). In addition to STG, we found enhanced cerebro-acoustic coherence for intelligible speech in CS of EB individuals. We therefore decided to focus our connectivity analyses on these two ROIs since they were functionally defined from our first analytical step (modulation of cerebro-acoustic coherence by speech intelligibility). The advantage of following this procedure is that connectivity analyses are based on nodes that we can functionally interpret and for which we have clear predictions. We successfully used the same hierarchical analytic structure in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Collignon et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Benetti et al., 2017</xref>), following guidelines on how to investigate directional connectivity in brain networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Stephan et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Virtual sensor time-series at the two locations of interest were extracted using a time-domain vector-beamforming technique called linear constrained minimum variance (LCMV) beamforming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Van Veen et al., 1997</xref>). First, average covariance matrices were computed for each participant to estimate common spatial filter coefficients. These filter coefficients were multiplied with the single-trial cleaned MEG data. To reduce the resulting three-dimensional time-series to one singular value, decomposition (SVD) was applied, resulting in a single time-series for each trial and participant.</p><p>Functional connectivity between the two regions was computed at peak locations using the phase-locking value (PLV) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Lachaux et al., 1999</xref>). First, single-trial virtual sensor time courses were converted to the frequency domain (0–50 Hz) using Fourier transformation. The data were padded to 2 s and a Hanning taper was applied to reduce spectral leakage. Coherence was used as a proxy for functional connectivity. To disentangle phase consistency between regions from joint fluctuations in power, the spectra were normalized with respect to the amplitude, resulting in an estimate of the phase-locking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Lachaux et al., 1999</xref>) between regions. Connectivity estimates were normalized using a Fischer z-transform (atanh), as in the analysis of cerebro-acoustic coherence.</p><p>PLV is a symmetric proxy for connectivity and does not allow for inferences regarding the direction of information flow between two regions of interest. To test whether differences in functional connectivity between EB and SI are accompanied by changes in the directionality of the flow of information between the regions of interest, we computed the phase slope index (PSI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Nolte et al., 2008</xref>). The PSI deduces net directionality from the time delay between two time series (x1 and x2). Time series x1 is said to precede, and hence drive, time series x2 in a given frequency band if the phase difference between x1 and x2 increases with higher frequencies. Consequently, a negative phase slope reflects a net information flux in the reverse direction, that is, from x2 to x1. Here, we computed the PSI using a bandwidth of ±5 Hz around the frequencies of interest. Following the recommendation by Nolte and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Nolte et al., 2008</xref>), PSI estimates were normalized with the standard error, which was computed using the jackknife method.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical testing of the behavioural comprehension scores, as well as the connectivity estimates, was performed using linear mixed-effects models in R. Differences between conditions and groups in source space were evaluated using Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM12; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_007037">SCR_007037</ext-link>), and the Threshold-Free Cluster Enhancement (TFCE) toolboxes in Matlab. TFCE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Smith and Nichols, 2009</xref>) computes new values for each voxel in a statistical map as a function of the original voxel value and the values of the surrounding voxels. By enhancing the statistical values in voxels with a high T-value that are also part of a local cluster, TFCE optimally combines the benefits of voxel-wise and cluster-based methods. TFCE was applied to the whole-brain contrasts. Final correction for multiple comparisons was applied using a maximum statistic based on 1000 permutations of group membership (independent testing) or conditions (dependent testing). Here, we applied a variance smoothing of 15 mm FWHM to reduce the effects of high spatial frequency noise in the statistical maps. The smoothing kernel used in the current study is higher than that in comparable fMRI studies because of the inherent smoothness of the source-reconstructed MEG data.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The project was funded by the ERC grant MADVIS – Mapping the Deprived Visual System: Cracking function for Prediction (Project: 337573, ERC-20130StG) awarded to Olivier Collignon.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Andrew King as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Elana Zion Golumbic (Reviewer #2); Yanchao Bi (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This paper examines the role of the deprived visual cortex in the processing of language in blind individuals. Using magnetoencephalography, the authors report that, compared to individuals who could see, early-blind subjects show more synchronized brain responses within the calcarine sulcus to the temporal dynamics of speech.

It is a very complex question, however, since the underlying mechanisms governing the expression of crossmodal plasticity is the result of a complex interplay between intrinsic organizational principles and experience-dependent influences on these intrinsic neurophysiological constraints.</p><p>One possibility that has been proposed in the literature is that the reorganization observed in the occipital cortex of blind people would support enhanced perceptual abilities for the reorganized function (De Villers-Sidani et al., 2016). The rational is simple: since an extension in the cortical territories underlying a computation is observed in the blind, this extension may support enhanced compensatory behavior. For instance, it has been demonstrated that early blind individuals with the higher auditory localization abilities (Gougoux et al., 2005) or superior verbal memory (Amedi et al., 2003) also show higher occipital activity levels. Moreover, occipital cortical thickness predicts performance on pitch and musical tasks in blind individuals (Voss and Zatorre, 2012). Similarly, in early deaf humans the higher the recruitment of temporal regions for face processing the better they are at processing faces (Benetti et al., 2017) and temporarily deactivating the functioning of crossmodally reorganized regions of the temporal cortex of deaf cats also alleviates their superior performance in visuo-spatial processing (Lomber et al., 2010). All-together these studies suggest that the crossmodal recruitment of sensory deprived regions may induce enhanced abilities in the remaining senses.</p><p>In relation to the topic of the current study, having more cortical tissue devoted to sentence processing and understanding could potentially support enhanced sentence comprehension. Previous studies have indeed demonstrated that blind people have enhanced speech discrimination in noisy environments (Niemeyer and Starlinger, 1981) and the capability to understand speech displayed at a much faster rate than sighted persons (sighted listeners at rates between 9-14 syllables/s and to blind listeners between 17-22 syllables /s; (Moos and Trouvain, 2007) Crucially, listening to intelligible ultra-fast speech (compared to reverse speech) engage enhanced activity in the right primary visual cortex in early and late blind individuals when compared to sighted controls; and activity in this region correlated with individual ultra-fast speech perception skills (Dietrich et al., 2013). These results raise the interesting possibility that the engagement of right V1 in the analysis of the speech envelope as demonstrated in our study may support the enhanced encoding of early supra-segmental aspects of the speech signal, supporting the ability to understand ultra-fast speech signal. Our behavioral task (speech comprehension) did not however create enough between-subject variability to assess directly this link between the reorganized occipital cortex and speech comprehension (performance was almost at ceiling in the Nat and 8-chan condition but at chance in the 1-chan condition, as targeted- see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">table 1</xref>).</p><p>However, it is important to note that linking brain activity and behavior is not a trivial issue. Many studies did not find a direct link between crossmodal reorganization and non-visual processing. More generally, since a behavioral outcome is the end product of a complex interactive process between several brain regions, linking the role of one region in isolation (e.g. the reorganized region in the occipital cortex of blind people) to behavior (e.g. performance) in a multifaced task is not straightforward. The absence of a direct relation between behavior, e.g. speech processing, and crossmodal plasticity could be explained, for instance, by the fact that this complex process will be supported by additional networks than the reorganized ones. Interestingly, recent studies have shown that early visual deprivation triggers a game of “balance” between the brain systems typically dedicated to a specific process and the reorganized occipital cortex (Dormal et al., 2016). It has indeed been proposed that early visual deprivation triggers a redeployment mechanism that would reallocate part of the processing typically implemented in the preserved networks (i.e. the temporal or frontal cortices for speech processing) to the occipital cortex deprived of its most salient input (vision). Two recent studies using multivoxel pattern analysis (MVPA) showed that the ability to decode the different auditory motion stimuli was enhanced in hMT+ (a region typically involved in visual motion in sighted) of early blind while an enhanced decoding accuracy was observed in the sighted group in the planum temporale (Dormal et al., 2016; Jiang et al., 2016). Moreover, Bedny and collaborators (2015) reported enhanced activation of occipital cortex and a simultaneous deactivation of prefrontal regions during a linguistic task in blind children. The authors suggested that the increased involvement of the occipital cortex might decrease the pressure on the prefrontal areas to specialize for language. Interestingly, a Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) study reported a reduced disruptive effect of TMS applied over the left inferior prefrontal cortex during linguistic tasks, while TMS application over the occipital had more effects in early blind compared to sighted people (Amedi et al., 2004). This evidence supports the idea that brain regions normally recruited for specific tasks in sighted might become less essential in EB in the case they concomitantly recruit occipital regions for the same task. An important open question for future research therefore concerns the relative behavioral contribution of occipital and perisylvian cortex to speech understanding.</p><p>We now have summarized these arguments in the revised Discussion section of our manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The reviewers found your description of the data analysis confusing and inadequate.

We now have thoroughly modified our data analysis section in order to make it more streamlined. We clarify here, in brief, the specific points raised by the reviewers.</p><p>The marker for sensory processing of speech is the cerebro-acoustic coherence that is independent of the intelligibility of speech. Therefore, the regions that are solely sensitive to the acoustic information of our signal (e.g. variation of acoustic energy across time, at the syllabic rate) are tracking the signal envelope for the unaltered speech segments but also for the two vocoded conditions, including the 1-chanel vocoding condition during which speech is not intelligible. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref> therefore shows the regions that synchronize most strongly to the acoustic properties of speech independently of the group (sighted and blind) and independently of the condition of presentation (Natural speech, 8 channels vocoding and 1 channel vocoding). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref> however shows regions where the cerebro-acoustic coherence is higher in the blind than in the sighted, but still independently of condition presentation. This is the effect of group. These regions therefore reorganize in the blind to track acoustic stimulation but do not necessarily show an effect of intelligibility of the speech signal. It is certainly the case that phase-locked responses to sensory stimuli are not unique to human speech comprehension, as evidenced by oscillatory responses to simple auditory stimuli in non-human primates (Lakatos et al., 2007; Schroeder et al., 2008). Might there be additional information in the speech signal that affects the phase-locked cortical response to spoken language in the occipital cortex of the blind? This is exactly what we target with the group-level effect of blindness. The interaction effect we observed in calcarine sulcus (CS) highlights that synchronization to intelligible speech is different in the blind versus sighted. (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>). As such, the enhanced neural phase-locking observed in the calcarine sulcus of early blind individuals is not solely driven by changes in the acoustic cue of the auditory stimuli, but also reflects cortical encoding and processing of the speech signal.</p><p>As we now discuss at length in the manuscript, the calcarine sulcus in the blind might therefore locate at the interface between high-level speech comprehension and acoustic processing. This sheds important new lights on language processing in the occipital cortex of the blind by demonstrating that the involvement of this neural population relates to the sensory signal of speech and therefore contrasts with the dominant proposition that occipital involvement in speech processing is abstracted from its sensory input and purely reflect higher-level operations similar to those observed in prefrontal regions (Bedny, 2017)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) There are several conflicting sentences in the Results, which make it unclear whether synchronization is present in both sighted and early-blind individuals, with the two groups differing in the degree of tracking, or is present only in the early blind. From <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref> it seems that the sighted did in fact show both a general coherence effect (at least for the 8 and 1 channel conditions) and an intelligibility effect (negative correlation).

With the evidence presented in the current study we are describing differences in the degree of cerebro-acoustic tracking. A binary classification as to whether tracking does, or does not occur in one of the groups was not intended. We outline our reasons for this argument below.</p><p>First, from a practical point of view, coherence is a bivariate metric that ranges between 0 and 1. Thus, with no negative values, a simple one-sample t-test in this case is not possible. Indeed, the majority of studies use group or condition comparisons to identify regions where cerebro-acoustic tracking is modulated. Here we use the contrast between intelligible and vocoded speech to highlight areas sensitive to speech intelligibility, and the effect of blindness on target areas where sensitivity to the speech rhythm. Hence all our conclusions are limited to describing modulatory effects.</p><p>Second, while it is theoretically possible to compare the results with a surrogate distribution to mimic a one-sample t-test, we believe that this analysis would not add to our argument. The current study was designed to address questions regarding group and condition differences. Additional one-sample t-test would not affect these conclusions. For example, if we do find a significant difference from zero, the conclusions would still hold, while a lack of an effect could not be interpreted. That said, our main proposal is based on the idea that the blind recycle existing functional pathways, and therefore we would not be surprised to find weak forms of cerebro-acoustic coherence in the occipital cortex of the sighted as well. For example, following the reviewer’s suggestion, we now have also examined the group effect as a post-hoc comparison in CS. Here we do not find that coherence is overall (across the 3 conditions) higher in blind versus sighted individuals. However, we do find a qualitative difference where the blind show enhanced coherence during intelligible speech compared to sighted individuals, while in the unintelligible condition, we find no significant difference between groups. The fact that the occipital cortex of sighted individuals shows stronger entrainment for altered speech condition may relate to the previous demonstration that the more adverse the listening condition (low signal-to-noise-ratio or audio-visual incongruence), the more the visual cortex is entrained to the speech signal of actual acoustic speech presented together with varying levels of acoustic noise (Park et al., 2016; Giordano et al., 2017). Moreover, Giordano and colleagues (2017), showed an increase of directed connectivity between superior frontal regions and visual cortex under the most challenging (acoustic noise and uninformative visual cues) conditions. Kayser et al. (Kayser et al., 2015) also proposed top-down processes modulating acoustic entrainment. In case of absence of structuring visual inputs since birth, the occipital cortex that does not play a role in integrating visual and auditory speech signals, like in the sighted, would now start to show enhanced coherence during intelligible speech, like what is typically observed in temporal regions. This hypothesis again suggests a link between the reorganization observed in blind individuals and the typical multisensory structure involving the occipital cortex in audio-visual speech processing (Kayser et al., 2007).</p><p>We now have added the following paragraph to the Results section to highlight that idea.</p><p>“A group difference between blind and sighted individuals across conditions was not observed in the calcarine region (t(30)=1.1, p=.28). The lack of an overall group effect in calcarine sulcus suggests that there is not a simple enhanced sensory response to speech in the blind. In this respect, calcarine sulcus responds differently than the region wide identified in parietal cortex where synchronization was overall stronger in the blind. Rather, the two groups differ only when speech is intelligible. But, while overall coherence with the speech envelope is equally high in early blind and sighted individuals, the blind population show significantly higher coherence in the intelligible speech condition compared to the sighted, who show higher cerebro-acoustic coherence in the unintelligible condition (1-Chan). The latter is reminiscent to the fact that the more adverse the listening condition (low signal-to-noise-ratio or audio-visual incongruence), the more the visual cortex is entrained to visual speech signal of actual acoustic speech presented together with varying levels of acoustic noise (Park et al., 2016; Giordano et al., 2017). Moreover, Giordano and colleagues (2017), showed an increase of directed connectivity between superior frontal regions and visual cortex under the most challenging (acoustic noise and uninformative visual cues) conditions. This hypothesis again suggests a link between the reorganization observed in the occipital cortex of blind individuals and typical multisensory pathways involving the occipital cortex in audio-visual speech processing (Kayser et al., 2007). Visual deprivation since birth however triggers a functional reorganization of the calcarine region that may now dynamically interact with the intelligibility of speech signal.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The reviewers pointed out the analysis of source reconstructions on two separate frequency windows that were largely overlapping needs clearer explanation and justification.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for this lack of clarity. We have decided to combine the reconstructions with filters for two different frequency bands to optimally capture the shape of the coherence spectrum we saw in sensors space. We have decided to opt for this approach to cover the broad range of frequencies where syllables can occur. In addition, our choice was restricted by our decision to segment the trials into 1s segments, and hence compute a frequency spectrum with integer frequencies. A center-frequency at 6.5Hz was thus not feasible. We have now elaborated on this approach in the Materials and methods.</p><p>By combining the two frequency-bands we acquire a source estimate that emphasizes the center of our frequency band of interest (6-7Hz) and tapers off towards the edges, which optimally represents the coherence spectrum observed in sensor space. The choice of the center frequency was also restricted by the length of the time window used for the analysis. That is, with a 1s time window and a resulting 1Hz frequency resolution, a non-integer center frequency at e.g. 6.5Hz was not feasible.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Another issue concerns the presentation of the same story clip in 3 different versions to each participant. Again, this requires clearer explanation and justification.</p></disp-quote><p>Because the key analyses involved contrasting the different conditions, we wanted to make sure that the speech envelopes for the three different conditions were exactly the same and, so it was crucial to keep the sentences the same. However, to avoid contamination as much as possible, we ensured that during the randomization procedure of the trials two versions of the same story were never presented close to each other. Due to the length and complexity of the stories presented in the current study, it would be very difficult to reconstruct a story in the 1chan condition from a previously heard comprehensible version. We argue that this is a different situation than hearing short sentences in close succession during a vocoded and intelligible condition. In addition, if this effect existed, it would be balanced out due to the randomization procedure.</p></body></sub-article></article>
