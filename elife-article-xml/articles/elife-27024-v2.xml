non-coding RNA (ncRNA), and several studies have established that a subset of these ncRNAs form ribonucleoprotein complexes that bind and regulate chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Guttman and Rinn, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Meller et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cech and Steitz, 2014</xref>). Some of the most well studied ncRNAs are those involved in dosage compensation, which include <italic>roX1</italic> and <italic>roX2</italic> in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and <italic>Xist</italic> in mammals. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, <italic>roX1</italic> and <italic>roX2</italic> are part of the male-specific lethal (MSL) complex that coats the single male X chromosome to acetylate histone H4K16 and increase transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Conrad and Akhtar, 2012</xref>). In female mammals, <italic>Xist</italic> is expressed from a single X-chromosomal locus and coats the X chromosome from which it is expressed in order to silence transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Augui et al., 2011</xref>). Other ncRNAs, such as <italic>HOTAIR</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rinn et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chu et al., 2011</xref>), <italic>HOTTIP</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wang et al., 2011</xref>), and enhancer RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sigova et al., 2015</xref>), have been shown to regulate expression of specific genes by localizing to chromatin and recruiting activating or repressing proteins. Finally, repetitive ncRNA transcripts have roles at chromosomal loci essential in maintaining genomic integrity over many cell divisions, including TERRA at telomeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bunting et al., 2010</xref>) and alpha-satellites near centromeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hall et al., 2012</xref>). Despite these well-studied examples, the genomic targets of most chromatin-associated ncRNAs are unknown, and the mechanisms by which these ncRNAs regulate the epigenetic and spatial organization of chromatin remain largely unexplored.</p><p>Genomic methods for studying the localization of specific RNA transcripts include ChIRP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chu et al., 2011</xref>), CHART (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Engreitz et al., 2013</xref>), and RAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Simon et al., 2011</xref>). These techniques use hybridization of complementary oligonucleotides to pull down a single target RNA and then next generation sequencing or mass spectrometry to identify its DNA- or protein-binding partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Simon et al., 2011</xref>). However, de novo discovery of chromatin-associated RNAs remains limited to computational predictions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Guttman and Rinn, 2012</xref>) or association with previously known factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Khalil et al., 2009</xref>). Nuclear fractionation allows isolation of bulk chromatin and subsequent identification of chromatin bound RNAs via sequencing, but does not provide sequence-resolved maps of RNA binding locations along the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Werner and Ruthenburg, 2015</xref>). To overcome these limitations, we have developed ChAR-seq, a proximity ligation and sequencing method (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) that both identifies chromatin-associated RNAs and maps them to genomic loci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27024.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>ChAR-seq uses proximity ligation of chromatin-associated RNA and deep sequencing to map RNA-DNA contacts in situ.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Overview of the ChAR-seq method wherein RNA-DNA contacts are preserved by crosslinking, followed by in situ ligation of the 3’ end of RNAs to the adenylated 5’ end of the ssDNA tail of an oligonucleotide ‘bridge’ containing a biotin modification and a DpnII-complementary overhang on the opposite end. After extending the bridge by reverse transcription to generate a strand of cDNA complementary to the RNA, the genomic DNA is then digested with DpnII and then re-ligated, capturing proximally-associated bridge molecules and RNA. The chimeric molecules are reverse-transcribed, purified and sequenced. (<bold>B</bold>) Chimeric molecules are sequenced and the RNA and DNA ends are distinguished owing to the polarity of the bridge, which preferentially ligates to RNA via the 5'-adenylated tail and to DNA via the DpnII overhang. The RNA and DNA reads are then computationally recombined to produce contact maps for each annotated RNA in the genome.

Products were then analyzed using denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using a combination of NEB microRNA and low range ssRNA ladders and stained with SYBR-gold. Bands were quantified and the percent product was calculated using (shifted / (total * 0.66)) to account for the molar excess of DNA over RNA. No adjustment was made to account for preferential staining of ssDNA over ssRNA. Residual signal is expected in the lower band owing to the molar excess of DNA over RNA. A high molecular weight band is visible in the Therm 5’ Ligase lane, which most likely consists of high molecular weight concatemers of the AppDNA substrate caused by incomplete 3’ blocking of these oligos or removal of the 3’ block by the Therm 5’ Ligase.

ChAR-seq is a chromosome conformation capture method that maps genome-wide RNA-to-DNA contacts in crosslinked nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dekker et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rao et al., 2014</xref>). Briefly, cells are cross-linked with formaldehyde and permeabilized, then RNA is partially fragmented and soluble RNA is washed away. The chromatin-cross-linked RNA is then ligated to an oligonucleotide duplex 'bridge' molecule and reverse transcribed. Genomic DNA is then digested and ligated onto the other end of the oligonucleotide 'bridge', creating a link between chromatin-associated RNA and proximal DNA. The ligated RNA is fully converted to cDNA during second strand synthesis. Finally, the DNA is sonicated and the chimeric molecules are purified, processed, and sequenced.</p><p>To enable the capture and analysis of RNA-to-DNA contacts, the oligonucleotide bridge (<italic>see</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) was designed to have several key features: (1) the 5'-adenylated end (5'App) of the bridge ensures that it is the only 5’ end competent for ligation to the 3'-ends of ssRNA by truncated T4 Rnl2tr R55K K227Q mutant ligase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Viollet et al., 2011</xref>), which cannot adenylate 5' ends (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), (2) the sequence of the bridge does not exist in the yeast, fly, mouse or human genomes and encodes a defined polarity, (3) the end of the bridge contains a restriction site for specific ligation to digested genomic DNA, and (4) the bridge is biotinylated so that it can be captured and enriched. After the bridge is ligated to RNA in situ, the molecules are stabilized by reverse transcription using Bst3.0 polymerase, which can traverse the DNA-RNA junction. The genomic DNA is then digested using the restriction enzyme DpnII, which has a median spacing of ~200 bp between sites in the fly genome. The digested genomic DNA is then ligated to the bridge adaptor using T4 DNA ligase. Second strand synthesis is completed using limiting RNase H and DNA Polymerase I. Crosslinks are then reversed followed by DNA precipitation, sonication and purification using streptavidin beads. Libraries are constructed by repairing and dA-tailing the DNA fragments, ligating TruSeq adaptors to the ends and PCR amplifying (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><p>Upon conversion of RNA-DNA contacts to a covalent chimera, the chimeric molecules were sequenced using 152 bp single-end reads. Sequencing across the bridge junction ensures identification of the RNA and DNA portions of the chimeric molecule by reading the polarity of the bridge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The RNA/cDNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <italic>red</italic>) and the genomic DNA side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <italic>black</italic>) of each read were computationally split and aligned to the transcriptome and genome. After post-processing for unique alignments, repeat removal, and removal of blacklisted regions, each RNA molecule was mapped to the genomic location to which it was ligated (<italic>see</italic> Materials and methods and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>), resulting in 22.2 million high-confidence unique mapping events for ~16,800 RNA transcripts. All individual RNA-to-DNA contacts for a given transcript were then combined to produce a genome-wide association map for each individual transcript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). To ensure that ChAR-seq signal was not due to spurious bridge-to-DNA ligation, we performed a control experiment in which we added RNase A and RNase H to lysed cells before the RNA-to-bridge ligation. This RNase-treatment reduced the number of unique bridge molecules identified by six-fold, demonstrating that the vast majority of bridge ligation events are indeed RNA-dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). The ChAR-seq protocol is highly reproducible, with the number normalized RNA-to-DNA contacts observed for each RNA showing high concordance between replicates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>). To estimate the specificity of our observed RNA-to-DNA ligation events and to ensure that the contacts that we observed were not due to diffusion of RNA after fragmentation, we performed a spike-in experiment wherein we added increasing amounts of exogenous RNA to the cells after lysis but before bridge ligation. After lysis and RNA fragmentation, we recovered and quantified the total soluble RNA from the supernatant, then spiked-in purified in vitro transcribed RNA fragments (~200 nt) from commonly used protein expression vectors (MBP, HALO and GFP). The spike-in controls were added at 0.1%, 1% and 10% of the total, recoverable RNA by mass. Though we see a clear concentration-dependent increase in the number of false positives, even in the scenario where we spiked in RNA at 10% of the total soluble RNA we observed fewer than 0.5% false positive RNA-to-DNA contacts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6</xref>), which compares favorably to the false positive rates in related RNA-DNA mapping methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Li et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sridhar et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Only the 3'-hydroxyl of each RNA is available for ligation to the bridge, thus the polarity of each RNA molecule with respect to its transcriptional direction can be determined by its orientation with respect to the bridge. The majority (85% of total) of the RNAs captured in our assay were sense, with the largest single subtype represented by sense-stranded mRNA (32% of total), owing to the capture of nascent transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s7">Figure 1—figure supplement 7</xref>). Most of the chromatin-associated antisense transcripts that we identified arose from ncRNA or intronic regions. In fact, 96% of the antisense mRNAs were intronic in origin with 64% of these originating from a single 119 kb gene (<italic>CG42339</italic>), suggesting the presence of unannotated ncRNAs in this region. The remaining chromatin-associated RNA detected in our assay arose from non-protein coding transcripts (<italic>see</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s7">Figure 1—figure supplement 7</xref>), of which 18% were small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) and 19% were small nuclear RNA (snRNA).</p><p>ChAR-seq generated RNA-to-DNA contacts can be aggregated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, see e.g., Total RNA), grouped by RNA class (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, see e.g., mRNA) or viewed individually (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Individual RNAs mapped by ChAR-seq generally fell into one of three classes. In the first class, RNAs were found around the locus from which they are transcribed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, see, e.g., <italic>Hsromega</italic>, <italic>chinmo</italic>, <italic>ten-m</italic>). In the second class, RNAs were found bound to chromatin in trans, generally distributed across most or all of the genome, often in addition to a peak around the gene body from which the RNA is transcribed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, see e.g., <italic>snRNA:U2, snRNA:7SK</italic>). In a third class, RNAs that are part of the dosage compensation complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <italic>see roX1</italic> and <italic>roX2</italic>) were enriched on and coat the X chromosome. To investigate this first class of RNAs, we compared aggregated RNA-to-DNA contacts with data from nascent transcription sequencing using PRO-seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kwak et al., 2013</xref>), and observed qualitative agreement between PRO-seq and ChAR-seq data sets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <italic>see PRO-seq</italic> and <italic>mRNA</italic>). Nevertheless, many RNA-to-DNA contacts in our dataset are associated in trans to genomic regions outside of the gene body from which the RNA is transcribed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s8">Figure 1—figure supplement 8</xref>).</p><p>To determine if the ChAR-seq protocol disrupts genome organization, we omitted the bridge to produce a mock-treated sample. We next biotinylated the DpnII-digested ends in our mock-sample and ligated them, essentially preparing a Hi-C library (‘Hi-C/Mock-ChAR’) (<italic>see</italic> Materials and methods for details) from the mock-treated sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, <italic>bottom</italic>). Topologically associated domains (TADs) are preserved in the mock-treated sample and the DNA-DNA contacts show high correlation with previously published CME-W1-cl8+ cell Hi-C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ramírez et al., 2015</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s9">Figure 1—figure supplements 9</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s10">10</xref>). Thus, the three-dimensional genome organization is largely preserved in our protocol. Furthermore, the profile of RNA-to-DNA contacts detected by ChAR-seq was distinctly different from that of DNA-to-DNA contacts in our mock-treated Hi-C library (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s9">Figure 1—figure supplement 9</xref>), indicating that ChAR-seq signal is not simply a byproduct of DNA-DNA contacts.</p><p>ChAR-seq data can also be visualized in a two-dimensional contact plot, where the genomic locus from which the RNA is transcribed is represented on the y-axis in linear genome coordinates, and the x-axis defines the genomic location where each RNA was bound. These plots provide a useful overview visualization for of the entire dataset. When we generated these contact plots for ncRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) and snRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), we observed strong horizontal lines that represent RNA transcripts that are transcribed from a single locus but are found distributed throughout the genome (class II), or in the special case of <italic>roX1</italic> and <italic>roX2</italic>, specifically along the X chromosome (class III). Furthermore, RNAs found at sites from which they are transcribed clustered tightly along the diagonal, a feature most pronounced for mRNAs (class I) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Many of the RNAs we found distributed broadly across the genome are transcription associated small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). One of these, <italic>snRNA:7SK</italic>, is an abundant snRNA that functions as a scaffold for a transcriptional regulatory ribonucleoprotein complex that includes p-TEFb, Hexim and LARP7. Other broadly distributed snRNAs are components of the spliceosome (e.g., <italic>snRNA:U2</italic>) which largely functions co-transcriptionally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Perales and Bentley, 2009</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27024.013</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>ChAR-seq is an ‘all to all’ RNA-to-DNA proximity ligation method.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Genome-wide plot of RNA to DNA contacts for non-coding RNAs.

The remaining 1952 RNAs (12%) accounted for 83% (18.5 million) of all chromatin contacts in our data set.

We observed a correlation between RNA expression level and chromatin-RNA contacts; however, a cluster of RNAs clearly generated more chromatin interactions that would be expected from the overall expression levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Using both the length and read normalized contacts (CPKM) and the fold-enrichment over RNA expression as measured by RNA-seq, we identified 138 RNAs that had more than 100 CPKM and were enriched more than ten-fold, though many were enriched by 2–5 orders of magnitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, red symbols; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Comparing ChIRP-seq to ChAR-seq for both <italic>roX1</italic> and <italic>roX2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>), we found that DNA contact locations were in surprisingly good agreement despite the fact that ChAR-seq reads are spread across all RNAs while ChIRP-seq reads map the specific RNA target, resulting in a large disparity in the effective sequencing depth between the methods. In ChIRP-seq, virtually all of the signal is attributable to interactions between chromatin and the target RNA. In contrast, ChAR-seq captures <italic>all</italic> RNA and DNA contacts, so that any given target RNA will comprise a subset of the total RNA-chromatin contacts in the dataset. In the case of <italic>roX1</italic> and <italic>roX2</italic>, we observed 32,308 and 87,453 contacts, representing 0.1% and 0.36% of the ChAR-seq dataset. In contrast, the ChIRP-seq datasets plotted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref> represent ~24M and ~21M reads for <italic>roX1</italic> and <italic>roX2</italic>, respectively. This indicates that ChAR-seq can identify RNA peaks along chromatin with high sensitivity for a given RNA.</p><p>To more quantitatively compare ChAR-seq to ChIRP-seq, we compared the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for <italic>roX1</italic> and <italic>roX2</italic> binding to DNA in each assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). We defined signal as the most densely bound regions on chrX, whereas we defined noise as binding events distributed randomly on autosomes (see Materials and methods for details). We found that ChAR-seq <italic>roX1</italic> SNR was much higher than that of ChIRP-seq (49.8 vs 3.9), and ChAR-seq <italic>roX2</italic> SNR was about two-fold higher than that of ChIRP-seq (45.2 vs 22.0), despite having 2 orders of magnitude fewer reads in ChAR-seq. Altogether, these data suggest that ChAR-seq has excellent sensitivity and sufficient signal-to-noise to characterize accurate chromatin-binding events for individual RNAs.</p><p>The resolution with which we can measure the localization of an RNA to a given genomic site constrains our ability to assess its potential modes of action. To measure the accuracy of ChAR-seq measurements of RNA interaction with DNA, we compared ChAR-Seq data to ChIRP-seq data to estimate the base-pair resolution of ChAR-Seq. We expected this resolution to be bounded ––in part––by the local DpnII cut frequency and the number of contacts for any given RNA. We divided the X chromosome into evenly sized bins and calculated correlation coefficients between ChIRP-seq and ChAR-seq datasets at increasing bin sizes for both <italic>roX1</italic> and <italic>roX2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). Using this method, we noted a bi-phasic increase of the correlation coefficient, corresponding to a minor plateau around 200 bp and a major plateau at ~25 kbp. The minor plateau is likely due to the DpnII distribution bias in the ChAR-seq tracks, while the major plateau is an estimate of the resolution of our assay, which is on the order of other proximity-ligation sequencing assays like Hi-C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">van Berkum et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>To test if we could identify the functional roles for our most highly enriched RNAs, we clustered the snRNA class of RNAs based on their genomic contacts. These snRNAs collectively comprised 23% of all the RNA-to-DNA contacts in our dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) and are a substantial component of the spliceosome, a multi-megadalton ribonucleoprotein complex that catalyzes pre-mRNA splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zhou et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Will and Lührmann, 2011</xref>). The composition and conformation of the spliceosome is highly dynamic, though two dominant species exist in eukaryotes: the major spliceosome comprised of <italic>U1</italic>, <italic>U2</italic>, <italic>U4</italic>, <italic>U5</italic> and <italic>U6</italic> snRNAs, and the minor spliceosome comprised of <italic>U4:atac</italic>, <italic>U6:atac</italic>, <italic>U5</italic>, <italic>U11</italic>, and <italic>U12</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Will and Lührmann, 2011</xref>). Many members of this class of snRNAs have highly similar gene duplication variants in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> genome. We therefore first calculated the base sequence similarity of these variants to one another and aggregated signals that were tightly clustered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). When we then correlated genome-wide binding signal within this class, we found that the distribution patterns of the major spliceosome snRNAs <italic>U1</italic>, <italic>U2</italic>, <italic>U4</italic>, <italic>U5</italic>, <italic>U6</italic> clustered together along with <italic>snRNA:7SK</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), which is part of the p-TEFb complex that relieves pausing of RNA Polymerase II at promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kwak and Lis, 2013</xref>) and may participate in the release of paused polymerase during RNA splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barboric et al., 2009</xref>). The components of the minor spliceosome did not cluster together, likely due to their low abundance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Will and Lührmann, 2011</xref>) and consequently low representation in our dataset.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27024.019</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Correlation of chromatin-associated RNAs with genome features.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Relative abundance of snRNAs identified by ChAR-seq.

We therefore aggregated spliceosomal RNA signals over gene bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, <italic>red lines</italic>), putative enhancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kvon et al., 2014</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, <italic>blue dashed lines</italic>) and a random distribution of genomic bins of similar size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, <italic>black lines</italic>).

Because active transcription is also correlated with topological boundaries in flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hou et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ulianov et al., 2016</xref>), we examined the relationship between RNA contacts and genome organization. To test whether RNA-DNA contacts are enriched at topological boundaries, we measured the DNA contact frequency for <italic>snRNA:7SK</italic> and <italic>snRNA:U2</italic> in 20 kb windows spanning TAD boundaries and TAD centers. Both <italic>7SK</italic> and <italic>U2</italic> RNAs were modestly, but significantly (Wilcoxon rank-sum test) enriched at TAD boundaries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref> (top)). We also aggregated <italic>7SK</italic> and <italic>U2</italic> contact signals across all TAD boundaries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref> (bottom), <italic>red lines</italic>) and a random distribution of identically sized genomic bins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref> (bottom), <italic>black lines</italic>), and found that these RNAs were ~1.4 fold enriched over boundaries. We also noted that <italic>roX2</italic> was ~2.2 fold enriched over TAD boundaries on the X chromosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B</xref>), consistent with previous data showing that MSL2 dosage compensation complex High Affinity Sites (HAS) are preferentially found at TAD boundaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ramírez et al., 2015</xref>). Examination of chromatin accessibility (ATAC-seq) over TAD boundaries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B</xref>) showed that open chromatin is enriched at TAD boundaries, supporting the idea that TAD boundaries are transcriptionally active in flies.</p><p>In contrast to the small number of well-defined and well-characterized snRNAs involved in splicing, there are more than 200 snoRNAs in flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Huang et al., 2005</xref>) that are significantly divergent in sequence and, surprisingly, were highly represented in our dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s7">Figure 1—figure supplement 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">2</xref>). Most of these snoRNAs have either unknown function or are computationally identified and indirectly implicated in the maturation and modification of ribosomal rRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Huang et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>To determine if our enriched chromatin-associated RNAs, in particular snRNAs and snoRNAs, might localize to euchromatic or heterochromatic states or with specific transcription factors, we cross-correlated our ChAR-seq signal against modENCODE datasets available for the CME-W1-cl8+ cell line. To normalize the signals for comparison, we first calculated the expected contacts per 2 kb bin for each RNA under a uniform distribution, based on the total number of genome-wide contacts for each RNA and the number of DpnII sites per bin. This null model was then used to calculate the log2 ratio of the observed to the expected contacts per bin for each RNA, which was then transformed into a z-score ((x-μ)/σ) based on the whole-genome mean (μ) and standard deviation (σ). Similarly, we re-binned the modENCODE tracks, removed bins that did not contain a DpnII site, and transformed the log2 mean-shift values to a z-score. We then calculated the pair-wise Pearson correlation coefficients between each signal track, and then clustered the data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). We observed discrete clustering of <italic>roX1</italic> and <italic>roX2</italic> with known dosage compensation complex factors, MOF, the histone modifications H4K16ac and H3K36me3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bell et al., 2008</xref>), and JIL-1 kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bai et al., 2004</xref>), validating this analytical approach (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Beyond this sub-cluster of dosage compensation factors, the remainder of the chromatin-associated RNAs fell into two distinct and anti-correlated categories: those associated with active chromatin and transcription (e.g., RNAPII, H4K8ac, H3K18ac) or heterochromatin (e.g., HP2, H3K9me3, HP1a) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). In particular, we note that <italic>snRNA:U2</italic> and <italic>snRNA:7SK</italic> cluster tightly with the transcription-associated chromatin marks, while many of the snoRNAs and minor spliceosome snRNAs that we identified are associated with heterochromatin, likely due to co-localization of heterochromatin factors to the nucleolus. Interestingly, <italic>snRNA:U5</italic>, a component of both the major and minor spliceosome, has variants that clearly cluster with either transcriptionally active chromatin (63BC) or heterochromatin (23D, 38ABa, and 34A). Previous work has shown that the <italic>snRNA:U5:38Aba</italic> variant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, heterochromatin cluster) exhibits a unique tissue-specific expression profile with the greatest abundance in neural tissue, which led the authors to propose isoform-dependent functions in alternative splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2005</xref>). The differential clustering that we observe for <italic>snRNA:U5</italic>, and between major and minor spliceosome snRNAs, for euchromatin and heterochromatin might reflect such isoform-specific functions of the spliceosome in different chromatin states.</p></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>ChAR-seq maps the chromosomal binding sites of all chromatin-associated RNAs, independent of whether they are associated as nascent transcripts or bound as part of ribonucleoprotein complexes (RNPs). In this way, ChAR-seq can be thought of as a massively parallelized de novo RNA mapping assay capable of generating hundreds to thousands of RNA-binding maps. ChAR-seq also detects multiple classes of chromatin-associated RNAs. ChAR-seq preserves the three-dimensional structure of the genome and provides an RNA-DNA interaction matrix that complements DNA-DNA proximity measurements using Hi-C. We validated ChAR-seq using chromosome-specific ncRNAs <italic>roX1</italic> and <italic>roX2</italic> associated with dosage compensation. The comparison between ChAR-seq and ChIRP-seq, which vary dramatically in the sequencing depth needed to analyze a specific RNA, highlights the utility of ChAR-seq as a de novo chromatin-associated RNA discovery tool. ChAR-seq also maps nascent RNAs found at the loci from which they are transcribed.</p><p>ChAR-seq is similar to a recently published method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sridhar et al., 2017</xref>), but has two key distinctions. First, proximity ligations are performed in situ in intact nuclei, which reduces nonspecific interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rao et al., 2014</xref>). Second, ChAR-seq uses long single-end reads to sequence across the entire junction of the ‘bridge’, ensuring that RNA-to-DNA contacts are mapped with high confidence and reporting on the polarity of the bridge-ligated RNA.</p><p>While this work was in revision, a genome-wide RNA-DNA contact method—GRID-seq—was published that also uses proximity ligation of a directional bridge to RNA and DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Li et al., 2017</xref>). One key difference is that GRID-seq uses a restriction enzyme to cut cDNA and gDNA fragments 19–23 bp distal to the bridge, which allows size selection of molecules that contain both RNA and DNA. This likely reduces the number of uninformative molecules sequenced. A disadvantage, however, is that the resulting reads are 19–23 bp, which have a greater chance of falsely mapping during genome alignment than the 20–100 bp RNA and DNA fragments obtained with ChAR-seq. Although their details differ, ChAR-seq and GRID-seq appear to have similar ability to detect <italic>roX2</italic> binding to chrX in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<italic>see</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><p>We used ChAR-seq to discover and map several dozen ncRNAs that are pervasively bound across the genome. Many of these ncRNAs are components of ribonucleoprotein complexes associated with transcription elongation (<italic>snRNA:7SK</italic>), splicing (<italic>snRNA:U2</italic>, etc) and RNA processing (<italic>snRNAs, snoRNAs</italic> and <italic>scaRNAs</italic>). Interestingly, more than half of the chromatin-associated RNAs identified based on our enrichment criteria are snoRNAs, most of which––but not all––correlate with heterochromatin. Generally, snoRNA ribonucleoproteins (snoRNPs) use intermolecular base pairing to direct chemical modification of the 2'-hydroxyl groups or the isomerization of uridines to pseudouridine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cech and Steitz, 2014</xref>) and snoRNAs are known abundant components of chromatin in both flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Schubert et al., 2012</xref>) and in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Meng et al., 2016</xref>). Despite their abundance and the their known role in RNA modification, we do not yet understand the functions of these modifications, or the implication of snoRNAs and scaRNAs chromatin association in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cech and Steitz, 2014</xref>). We also demonstrate that ChAR-seq can be used with orthogonal genome-wide datasets to identify and classify RNAs that are associated with specific chromatin states (e.g., euchromatin vs heterochromatin). We expect this approach will be particularly useful in organisms that use lncRNAs such as <italic>HOTAIR</italic>, <italic>HOTTIP</italic> and <italic>BRAVEHEART</italic> as scaffolds for ribonucleoproteins that regulate facultative heterochromatin. Finally, we observed enrichment of transcription-associated RNAs with TAD boundaries, reflecting a potential role for active transcription in the topological organization of the genome. This observation is consistent with previous observations that active transcription is a stronger predictor for TAD partitioning in flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hou et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ulianov et al., 2016</xref>) than CTCF and cohesin, the prototypical TAD boundary markers in mice and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Merkenschlager and Nora, 2016</xref>).</p><p>We anticipate that ChAR-seq will be a powerful new high throughput discovery platform capable of simultaneously identifying new chromatin-associated RNAs and mapping their chromatin binding sites (and associated epigenetic chromatin states), all of which will be particularly useful in comparing ‘epigenomic’ changes that coincide with cellular differentiation or tumorigenesis.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Brief description of ChAR-Seq protocol</title><p><italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> CME-W1-cl8+ cells (Drosophila Genome Resource Center, Stock #151) were grown in T-75 flasks at 27°C in Shields and Sang M3 media supplemented with 5 µg/mL insulin, 2% FBS, 2% fly extract and 100 µg/mL Pen-Strep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cherbas et al., 2011</xref>). Approximately 100–400 million cells were harvested for each library by centrifugation at 2000 x g for 2–4 min, resuspended in fresh media plus 1% formaldehyde and fixed for 10 min at room temperature. Fixation was quenched by adding 0.2 M glycine and mixing for 5 min at room temperature. Cells were centrifuged at 2000 x g for 2–4 min, resuspended in 1 mL of PBS, and centrifuged again at 2000 x g for 2 min.

Both Kc167 and CME-W1-cl8+ cells were authenticated by the Drosophila Genome Resource Center and tested for mycoplasma contamination by cytoplasmic DNA staining.</p><p>Briefly, RNA was lightly and partially chemically fragmented by heating in the presence of magnesium. The pellet was isolated and washed, and RNA ends were ligated using truncated T4 Rnl2tr R55K K227Q ligase (hereafter referred to as trT4KQ RNA ligase) to an oligonucleotide 'bridge' molecule containing a 5'-adenylated ssDNA overhang. The RNA ligase was inactivated, the pellet was washed and the RNA strand was stabilized by first strand synthesis of the RNA through extension of the bridge by Bst 3.0 polymerase. The polymerase was inactivated and the pellet was washed. Genomic DNA was then digested with DpnII, followed by ligation of the DpnII digested genomic DNA to the opposite end of the oligonucleotide 'bridge'. Second strand synthesis was then performed using RNaseH and DNA Polymerase I to complete cDNA synthesis of the RNA-encoded side of the new, chimeric molecules. The sample was then deproteinized and crosslinks were reversed by heating overnight in SDS and proteinase K. DNA was then ethanol precipitated and sheared to ~200 bp fragments using a Covaris focused ultra-sonicator. DNA fragments containing the biotinylated bridge were then purified using magnetic streptavidin-coated beads. DNA ends were repaired using the NEBNext End Repair and dA tailing module, and ligated to NEBNext hairpin adaptors for Illumina sequencing. The adaptor hairpin was cleaved using USER, and DNA fragments were amplified by ~8–12 rounds of PCR with NEBNext Indexing Primers for Illumina (TruSeq compatible). The partially amplified library was then purified using AMPure XP beads to remove adaptor dimers, and the optimum number of additional PCR cycles was determined by qPCR to achieve approximately 30% saturation. Library amplification was then completed by the additional rounds of PCR, and the library was purified and size selected to a target range of 100–500 bps using AMPure XP beads. The size distribution of the library was checked by capillary electrophoresis using an Agilent Bioanalyzer, and quantified using qPCR against a phiX Illumina library standard curve. Libraries were sequenced using the Illumina MiSeq platform for quality control, and subsequently sequenced on the Illumina NextSeq platform (Stanford Functional Genomics Facility) using single-end 152 bp reads.

RNA was aligned separately to all dm3 transcriptomes from FlyBase (downloaded January 2016, versions r5.57): with the same bowtie2 parameters, but also first forcing sense strandedness as bridge orientation should preserve the RNA strand information, and then for reads that did not align in the sense direction, permitting antisense alignment. Reads that aligned with equal alignment score to more than one transcriptome were filtered based on a priority rank according to the following order: tRNA, miscRNA, ncRNA, transcript, three_prime_UTR, five_prime_UTR, exon, intron, miRNA, gene, gene_extended2000. For a given read, this rank preserves the annotation information from the top ranked transcripome. For example, a read aligning to the ‘ncRNA’, ‘transcript’, and ‘exon’ transcriptomes would receive ncRNA annotations, and be considered a ncRNA in further analysis. Reads aligning to tRNA and miscRNA groups were removed from further analysis. Reads lacking valid sense alignments to any transcriptome, but that aligned in the antisense orientation were ranked and filtered in the same manner. We note that for some mRNAs, some highly abundant reads emanating from the mRNA locus may potentially be expressed from small RNAs (e.g., unannotated snoRNA, tRNA, snRNA) overlapping the mRNA locus. Although the CME-W1-cl8+ cell line has the most normal karyotype of the commonly used Drosophila cell lines, the CME-W1-cl8+ reference genome has not been assembled and slight variation may exist in the positions of some reads due to potential genomic differences between CME-W1-cl8+ cells and the sequence fly strain used for the reference genome.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>ChAR-seq RNA-DNA contact identification</title><p>Previously linked RNA and DNA sequences with sense alignments had their information re-associated using the original read ID.

Coverage tracks for the metagene profile analysis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> were similarly normalized, but were extracted and normalized using a sliding window method with 200 bp bins and 20 bp steps. For the correlation clustering in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, we normalized the X chromosome signal to the autosomes by doubling the raw contacts on chrX and chrXHet before DpnII normalization to account for the presence of only a single X chromosome in the CME-W1-cl8+ cell line. Where indicated, coverage tracks were calculated for 2 kb bins, then converted to the log2 ratio of the contacts and DpnII frequency, which was subsequently used to calculate a z-score for each bin based on the whole genome mean and standard deviation for each RNA signal track.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Hi-C and TAD analysis</title><p>HiC libraries (‘Hi-C/Mock-ChAR’) were performed as indicated in the methods (blue text indicates branch points in the protocol). Hi-C libraries were sequenced using 2 × 75 paired end reads and were aligned to blacklisted and repeatmasked genome using the ‘local’ and ‘reorder’ flags. The subsequent bam files were used to build the contact matrices using HiCExplorer (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/deeptools/HiCExplorer/blob/master/docs/index.rst">https://github.com/deeptools/HiCExplorer/blob/master/docs/index.rst</ext-link>). Matrices were built at 10 kb resolution. Data from GEO:GSE58821 were downloaded, re-aligned and processed using HiCExplorer in parallel. Plotting, TAD calling, and matrix correlation were all performed in HiCExplorer. Plots showing RNA-DNA and DNA-DNA contacts were also generated using HiCExplorer, where RNA-DNA matrices were also built at 10 kb resolution.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>TAD boundary analysis</title><p>Boundary regions were chosen as the 10 kb on either side around TAD edges (i.e., 20 kb total). TAD midpoints were calculated and rounded down to the nearest multiple of 10 kb, and the midpoint region was set as 10 kb to either side of the midpoint. Both boundary and midpoint region edges therefore align with 10 kb bins used for TAD calling. Regions overlapping the modENCODE blacklist or our manually curated blacklist were removed from analysis. ChAR-seq contacts were filtered to remove cis contacts, defined here as the RNA parent gene locus ±2 kb. Counts of DpnII sites, ATAC-seq insertion sites (5’ end of sequenced fragments, shifted +4 bp on the +strand and −5 bp on the - strand of the reference genome) and ChAR-seq DNA contacts within regions were calculated using the coverage or map commands in bedtools (version 2.20.1). The number of base pairs in each region (midpoint or boundary) masked by our repeat masking blacklist was calculated using bedtools coverage and groupby commands. Subsequent analysis was done with R version 3.3.1. To match the distributions of masked base pairs per region between TAD midpoints and boundaries, 20 kb region masked lengths were divided into bins of 50 bp between 0 and 1000 bp, and 500 bp between 1000 bp and 20000 bp. The boundaries and midpoints were divided into these masked length bins; within each bin, boundaries and midpoints were subsampled to the minimum number of regions for the two region types (e.g., if in a masked length bin there three boundaries and five midpoints, the midpoints will be randomly subsampled to select three midpoints.) The bin matching was verified with a Wilcoxon rank sum test of the total length of repeat masked regions in each region, with an expected non-significant p-value of 0.76. ChAR-seq DNA contact counts for each RNA type within each region were normalized by dividing the number of counts in the region by the number of DpnII sites in the region. <italic>roX2</italic> analysis of trans-ChAR contacts at boundary and midpoint regions was only performed for TADs on the X chromosome.

Coverage was calculated using 100 kb bins unless indicated. The Pearson correlation coefficients were then clustered and plotted using the either the PlotCorrelation function in deepTools (snRNA clustering) or the heatplot function in R using the ward.D2 method and Euclidian distance function (modENCODE vs ChAR-seq correlation clustering). modENCODE datasets (M-values, wig-formated) for CME-W1-cl8+ were downloaded from data.modencode.org, and then re-binned into 2 kb windows, and filtered to remove modENCODE blacklist sites and repeat-regions, chrYHet, chrM, chrU and any bins lacking DpnII sites. modENCODE tracks were then transformed into z-scores by dividing the mean shifted (log2 M-values) by the genome-wide standard deviation of the bin depth. Metaplots were generated using the computeMatrix and plotProfile tools with a 2 kb window up and downstream of each region. Signal was then normalized to fold-change relative to mean of the random signal and re-ploted in GraphPad Prism.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title><italic>roX1</italic> and <italic>roX2</italic> chromosome X enrichment</title><p>The enrichment of <italic>roX</italic> RNAs bound to chrX was calculated by obtaining the number of ChAR-seq <italic>roX1</italic> or <italic>roX2</italic> RNA reads that contact chrX, and comparing this to the expected number on chrX if <italic>roX1</italic> or <italic>roX2</italic> reads were distributed randomly over total chromosomal sequence space.

Therefore, to calculate signal, we divided the genome into 2 kb bins and counted the number of <italic>roX1</italic> or <italic>roX2</italic> RNA-DNA contacts per bin for the 300 chrX bins containing the most contacts. ChAR-seq reads were normalized to DpnII cut sites within each bin. To define noise, we randomly selected 300 equal sized bins from autosomes. The mean RNA-DNA contact count per bin on chrX peaks (‘signal’) was divided by the mean RNA-DNA contact count per bin on autosomes (‘noise’) to produce the SNR value. To avoid complications due to extreme bin values or repetitive regions, we filtered for chr4, chrM, chrY, chr2Het, chr3Het, chrXHet, chrU, and modEncode blacklist regions (REF:modencode).

Indexed libraries were quantified by Bioanalyzer and qPCR, pooled, and sequenced on a NextSeq 500 (Illumina).</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>ATAC-seq library preparation</title><p>ATAC-seq using 250 K-500K CME-W1-cl8+ cells per reaction was performed with the Nextera DNA Library Prep Kit (Illumina, FC-121–1030). The reaction protocol was as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Buenrostro et al., 2013</xref>), but without detergent or lysis incubation steps. Transposition reactions were performed at 37°C for 30 min shaking at 400 r.p.m. Libraries were purified with the QIAGEN MinElute Reaction Cleanup Kit and PCR amplified with barcoded primers. Amplification cycle number for each sample was monitored by qPCR to minimize PCR bias. PCR amplified libraries were purified with the QIAquick PCR Purification kit and excess primers removed by AMPure XP bead selection (Beckman Coulter). Final library concentrations were determined by qPCR using custom primers and PhiX sequence (Illumina) as a standard.</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>ATAC-seq data processing</title><p>Six technical replicates were sequenced with 75 bp paired-end reads on the Illumina Next-seq. Illumina Nextera Adapters were removed using a custom Python script. Reads were aligned to the <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> genome (dm3) using bowtie2 (version 2.2.5) with the parameter -X 2000. Duplicates were removed with Picard; mitochondrial reads or reads with bowtie2 MAPQ score &lt;30 were removed using SAMtools. All replicates had high similarity so their alignment files were merged to increase library complexity before analysis with ChAR-seq data.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This project was funded by a Stanford Center for Systems Biology (NIH P50 GM107615) Seed Grant to JCB, DJ, VIR and WLJ.

The approach is utilized mainly to examine what RNAs are interacting with chromatin in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> CME-Wl-cl8+ (male) wing disc cells. Some work is also done using female Kc167 cells. Three patterns of RNAs linked to chromatin are identified: 1) those of nascent transcript next to their genes, 2) RNAs in trans across all genome, and 3) those on X chromosome for its inactivation. This last group, as expected, does not show up in the female cell line. The data obtained via ChAR-seq are in agreement with those obtained by Quinn et al., 2014 using ChIRP-seq. The ChAR-seq appears as a more sensitive method because it captures all RNA-DNA contacts. Authors also use their data to provide novel insights about the function of the various RNAs that they found to have abundant association with chromatin. The application of ChRA-seq in this study have revealed many snoRNA molecules interacting with chromatin in the heterochromatin form.</p><p>1) Overall, the authors show that ChRA-seq works well to identify both RNAs that are nascent and thus still connected with DNA in cis, and RNAs that do not directly interact with DNA, but rather with chromatin factors in trans. The ChRA-seq approach is validated with the RNAs that are known to be functioning in chr. X dosage compensation, in fact these RNAs (roX1 and roX2) are found to bind chr. X chromatin in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> male cells but not in the female cells. In addition to the similarity of the ChRA-seq approach to the ChIRP-seq by Quinn et al., Nat Biotech 2014, which although is limited to RNA-chromatin interactions, as pointed out by the Authors, ChRA-seq is almost identical to the method used in Sridhar et al., 2017in vivo. Thus, the novelty of the study by Bell et al. is in part reduced because of this recent publication, which exploits a very similar ligation method to capture sites of RNA interaction with chromatin and DNA.</p><p>Other points:</p><p>2) What is described in the first paragraph of Results does not match perfectly with Figure 1A, because the RT step in the figure is shown after the bridge is ligated to DNA, while in the text it is described before the bridge is ligated to DNA. The text should match the figure description.</p><p>3) It would be good to add the polarity of the RNA molecule in red in the Figure 1A. It would be good also to explain that the approach captures the 3' RNA ends of RNA molecules. Also Figure 1A should be bigger to clearly show which RNA end is ligated to the bridge, to clearly indicate the polarity of ends and the structure at the junction. If the App has a free 3' end, and this is ligated to 3' end RNA, is this a 3'-3' ligation? Or is the App removed in the ligation process? This should be explained well because it is not evident.</p><p>4) The statement &quot;the 5'-adenylated end (5'App) enables increased ligation specificity for 3'-terminated ssRNA&quot; is not clear: 'increased specificity' relative to what?</p><p>5) Is the sequence of RNA and DNA oligos presented in Figure 1—figure supplement 2 provided? It is not clear what the molar excess of DNA over RNA is, please clarify. Also the legend of this figure should explain what is shown in every lane. In lane 1 there is a high mw band, what is this, what is its size? The ladder sizes are provided only for the bottom part of the gel, they should be provided also for the top part, considering that there is a high mw band. How many times was this experiment repeated? Is there any statistical analysis of these data? This, possibly, should be explained in the legend.</p><p>6) The statement: &quot;This RNase-treatment dramatically reduced in the number of bridge molecules identified, demonstrating that bridge ligation is indeed RNA-dependent (Figure 1—figure supplement 5)&quot; is not strongly supported by the data shown in this figure. In addition to a typo in this statement, looking at the figure, there seems to be a factor of six reduction, which does not represent a 'dramatic' reduction. Importantly, there appears to be no repeats of this experiment and no statistical analysis of the data. Was this experiment reproducible, are there repeats that can be shown?</p><p>7) Legend to Figure 1E has a typo: &quot;Zoomed in region of shown&quot;.</p><p>8) Typo in Results: &quot;we performed RNA-seq to for&quot;.</p><p>9) The correlation between expression level of the RNA and FPKM contacts is not very clear, because in Figure 2—figure supplement 1 and 2 this does not seem to be the case.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>This manuscript presents a very important new technique (CHAR-seq) developed to identify chromatin-associated RNAs. The major benefit of this method in contrast to previously used techniques is the use of proximity dependent ligation to generate sequences from ssRNAs linked to nearby DNA, which allows relatively unbiased assessments of associations across much of the genome. The authors demonstrate very nicely that application of ChAR-seq to <italic>Drosophila</italic> cultured cells identifies a spectrum of chromatin-associated RNAs, including chromosome-specific, nascent mRNAs, and sn/sno RNAs. The utility and novelty of ChAR-seq makes it completely appropriate for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>; I am very enthusiastic about acceptance once some issues about the presentation and analyses are addressed / clarified.</p><p>1) Data completeness and transparency:</p><p>To provide a more complete resource for the community, all potentially interesting RNAs should be named/identified in a table, including those that were initially included but didn't match criteria for 'chromatin associated'.</p><p>a) There should be a table listing the 1797 RNAs (Figure 2D), and relevant information, such as% and numbers of <italic>cis</italic> and <italic>trans</italic> contacts, RNA expression level, RNA-DNA contacts, and a way to access information about their genomic distributions, etc. – essentially anything that may be of use to scientists interested in whether or not their favorite RNA is present, or in performing their own analyses of the data.</p><p>b) I assume Figure 2E shows all 1797 as 'included', but the 'chromatin associated' RNAs in Figure 2E should be listed in a table. My impression is that some (73) but not all are listed in Figure 2—figure supplement 1 – are these the red dots in 2E? Even if all red dots are listed in the supplement, readers should be able to access identity and other data for all 1797, and especially the grey dots that are RNA-DNA contact outliers with high expression (I suspect that normalization to expression levels eliminates interesting candidates, see statistics discussion below). Similarly, there appear to be RNAs with low expression that may be chromatin enriched, yet are not highlighted in red.</p><p>2) Genomics, Analysis and Statistics:a) Figure 1D, 2A and elsewhere. I could not find a description of what the black circles and darker grey areas on the chromosome graphics indicate. I assume black=centromere, but the rest is unclear.</p><p>b) Why was release 5 used, given that the more complete release 6 has been available for at least a year? In addition, genomes from the cell lines used have not been assembled, and are likely rearranged (plus other variation, including DNA copy number) relative to the reference sequence, so the positions shown in the figures are likely to be incorrect, though we don't know where. No, the authors do <italic>not</italic> need to assemble the clone8 or Kc genomes, but they should acknowledge this issue.</p><p>c) It is unclear what parts of the genome assembly were included, for example were heterochromatic regions included, and if so where is that data presented? This information would help with the interpretations, especially in Figure 4D.</p><p>d) A related point, for Figure 4D it would be helpful to report the genomic locations (middle of euchromatin? Pericentromeric? X vs. autosomes?) for RNAs whose chromatin contacts show strong correlation with specific chromatin marks. Also, please explain how the correlation signals were aggregated in Figure 4D – the methods described using 2kb bins while the figure showing 100kb bins.</p><p>e) Can the authors discuss how the use of PCR to amplify ligated RNA/DNA contacts, combined with normalization to expression levels, could exclude RNAs with lower transcription levels, even if they have many (potentially important) DNA contacts? I think they are being appropriately conservative, but as with all such screens, and to help others who will certainly try it themselves, it would be good to have a brief discussion about the tradeoffs.</p><p>f) Some of the statements need quantitative support, such as:</p><p>- Figure 2E – what is the threshold for identifying RNAs with more than expected chromatin interaction (how was the expectation calculated?</p><p>- How were p-values for rox1 and rox2 (7.6 fold and 8.1 fold enrichment) calculated?</p><p>- Figure 3E: correlation between the DNA contact locations from ChIRP and ChAR- seq –.is this simply the Pearson correlation coefficient?</p><p>- Figure 4—figure supplement 1: how was the base sequence similarity calculated and used to aggregate signals for different snRNAs?</p><p>g) Using the correlations between ChIRP and ChAR-seq to assess the resolution of ChAR-seq does not seem to be appropriate, since the preparation of sequencing libraries may be very different between these two datasets. (Also, the curve actually goes down as window size increases?!) The authors should provide more reasoning for this approach.</p><p>How were the replicates analyzed?.Were they merged? What are the correlations between replicates?</p><p>h) How was the z-score was calculated? It seems like it is calculated as comparing between the values in each bin vs. the rest of the genome. If this is the case, there may be no need to calculate a z-score as every window will have the same denominator, and it may be just as informative as using the read counts. Also, it may be informative to use the chromosome-specific mean (instead of whole genome mean) to further identify interesting local events (the current analysis may be mainly identifying between chromosome differences).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27024.037</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The authors need to address the following main points:</p><p>1) Compare CharSeq performance in more detail to previously published MARGI and ChIRP-Seq methods: what are the key difference, improvements? Can you quantify this?</p></disp-quote><p>We have now quantitatively compared our data to ChIRP-seq and MARGI with new analysis in the main text and figures. We have also included a comparison to another recently published method called GRID-seq (described below).</p><p>Comparison to ChIRP-seq:</p><p>ChAR-seq produces multiplexed RNA-chromatin contact data for every RNA in the cell without any requirement for the identity of the RNA, whereas ChIRP-seq requires production of oligos against a single target RNA of known sequence. They are complementary technologies, in that ChAR-seq is suited for discovery of interactions and interaction patterns in an unbiased assay, while ChIRP-seq provides targeted, higher-coverage data to explore the contact profiles of RNAs that have already been identified as interesting targets.</p><p>To address this point, we added a signal-to-noise calculation between ChIRP-seq and ChAR-seq for both roX1 and roX2 (Figure 3F). Briefly (see subsection “ChAR-seq and ChIRP-seq signal-to-noise comparison”), we used the same signal-to-noise (SNR) metric employed by Howard Chang’s Lab in a related ChIRP-seq paper (Quinn et al., 2014). This metric considers the chrX bins or peaks with the most roX RNA binding events to be ‘signal’ and treats roX RNA binding in randomly chosen autosomal bins to be ‘noise’. To quantitatively compare these two very different methods (genome-wide vs single-RNA), we were careful to re-analyze published ChIRP-seq signal from the original paper (Chu et al., 2011) with identical filtering and random bin selection. This resulted in higher SNR values for ChAR-seq than ChIRP-seq (roX1: 49.8 to 3.9, roX2: 45.2 to 22.0), despite having ~100-fold fewer roX reads per data set. We believe this quantitative analysis demonstrates the high sensitivity of our genome-wide method, in addition to validating it as identifying specifically bound RNAs.</p><p>In addition, we previously included several direct comparisons between ChIRP- and ChAR-seq, including genome-wide correlation plot for roX1 and roX2 across different bin sizes ranging over 5 orders of magnitude (Figure 3G) that revealed strong correlation over appropriate bin sizes (Spearman rho = 0.7-0.85). We also display roX1 and roX2 RNA binding signal across a 250kb region of chrX for both methods (Figure 3E).</p><p>Comparison to MARGI:</p><p>MARGI and ChAR-seq both ligate a 5-App oligonucleotide ‘bridge’ or ‘linker’ to the 3’-end of RNA. In MARGI, the linker molecule is then ligated to either restriction digested genomic DNA or sonicated DNA. Beyond this, the methods differ greatly. In MARGI, the proximal RNA and DNA are attached via circularization, and the linker molecule is cut with a restriction enzyme to form templates for sequencing primers at the end of the molecule. We list the two primary advantages of our method over MARGI in the main text discussion: first, ChAR-seq is performed in situ in intact nuclei, whereas the MARGI proximity ligations are performed on beads. As with Hi-C, it is expected that in vitro based proximity ligation will have more spurious ligation events than those from intact nuclei. Second, in ChAR-seq the final RNA-bridge-DNA molecule is sequenced with long single-end reads, which preserves the original ligation junctions and allows us to detect multiple bridges and other aberrant ligation events.</p><p>For many types of analyses, we cannot compare ChAR-seq directly to MARGI because MARGI analyzed mammalian cells, whereas we analyzed <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells. However, we did quantify signal-to-noise in MARGI by calculating the fold-enrichment of Xist on the X-chr as compared to autosomes:</p><p>We used MARGI data from HEK293 cells, which contain two stable Barr bodies (Gilbert et al., 2000) and thus avoid uncertainties about incomplete X inactivation associated with stem cells. Because pxMARGI (proximal) data had insufficient association reads (only counting distal and inter-chromosomal contacts), we analyzed distal RNA (diMARGI) contacts on chr X vs. autosomes. We assumed that autosomal bound Xist constitutes noise because FISH in HEK293 cells does not show widespread localization of Xist RNA (Chow et al., 2007). Because the data were also too sparse to call high-confidence X association peaks within the X chromosome, we divided the genome into 1 Mb bins, keeping only bins that (a) contained at least 1 diMARGI Xist read, (b) did not contain any ENCODE blacklisted regions, and (c) were the full 1 Mb length. The X chromosome and autosomes contain similar fractions of bins with zero Xist reads: 31% and 26%, respectively. To account for chromatin accessibility or HaeIII site bias, autosomal bins were chosen to have similar accessibility (measured by ENCODE H3K27ac ChIP) and similar HaeIII site density to the chosen bins on the X chromosome.</p><fig id="respfig1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27024.026</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Control bins on autosomes were chosen to match bins on the X chromosome in terms of HaeIII restriction sites and accessible chromatin, here measured using the proxy of H3K27ac data because direct measurements of accessibility such as ATAC-seq or DNase-seq data were not publicly available for HEK293 cells.</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-27024-resp-fig1-v2"/></fig><p>Xist diMARGI contact counts in these matched bins are remarkably similar across autosomes and the X chromosome, indicating a signal to noise ratio of ~1. The ratio of the medians is 1 (2 counts per 1 Mb bin). The ratio of the means is 3.4 (X:autosome) which is largely due to a single outlier bin on the X chromosome with a count of 555, as opposed to the maximum count of 13 counts in sampled autosomal bins. This X chromosome bin contains the Xist locus and although proximal diMARGI contacts are excluded, the area around the Xist gene nevertheless contains a high density of contacts. This is not surprising, but the dramatic drop in Xist contact density from the locus of transcription to other sites on the X chromosome is not in agreement with FISH data which show Xist coating the entire Barr bodies (Chow et al., 2007). We conclude that, by this metric, the signal-to-noise in MARGI is low, and ChAR-seq may have distinct advantages as an approach to determine genome-wide RNA-DNA contacts (see Discussion).</p><p>We have attached the MARGI signal-to-noise figures for reviewers, but decided not to put this analysis in the text because we did not directly analyze mammalian data.</p><fig id="respfig2"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27024.027</object-id><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>diMARGI signal to noise estimate via X vs. autosome comparison in HEK293 cells.</title><p>Plots of log2(diMARGI counts per megabase) for bins spanning the X chromosome and random, accessibility- and restriction site-matched bins on autosomes (left: box pot, right: scatter plot of same data).</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-27024-resp-fig2-v2"/></fig><p>Comparison to GRID-seq:</p><p>While this paper was in revision, another genome-wide RNA-DNA method was published (“GRID-seq”; Li et al., 2017) that uses a methodology similar to ChAR-seq. While many details differ, GRID-seq also involves proximity ligation of a directional bridge to RNA and DNA to construct an RNA-DNA contact map. One key difference is that GRID-seq uses the restriction enzyme MMeI to cut the cDNA and gDNA fragments distal to the linker/bridge, which produces identically sized fragments. This has the advantage over ChAR-seq of being able to size select and sequence only molecules with RNA and DNA information. A critical disadvantage, however, is that reads are 19-23bp, which have a greater chance of falsely mapping to the wrong place in the genome than the 20-100bp RNA and DNA fragments obtained via ChAR-seq. We now mention the above difference in the Discussion.</p><p>The available GRID-seq data (from NCBI GEO:GSE82312) is heavily processed and some contacts were removed via a background model subtraction. We attempted to perform a signal-to-noise analysis after aligning the raw reads from NCBI SRA and filtering repeats but were unable to determine an appropriate SNR metric as with ChIRP-seq. This is because GRID-seq has lower sequencing depth for roX2 reads, and therefore the vast majority of genomic bins on the autosomes have zero reads, precluding the proper calculation. However, we analyzed the correlation of signal density between GRID and ChAR, GRID and ChIRP, or ChAR and ChIRP for roX2 reads over 20kb chrX bins. GRID and ChAR-seq match well with ChIRP (GRID-ChIRP = 0.84, ChAR-ChIRP = 0.80) and with each other (GRID-ChAR = 0.79), suggesting that – at a coarse level – ChAR-seq and GRID-seq have similar ability to detect true RNA-DNA contacts. This analysis is now in Figure 3—figure supplement 1, along with signal tracks along a 2Mb region of the genome.</p><p>False RNA-DNA contact% calculation, and comparison to MARGI and GRID-seq:</p><p>In addition to the above comparisons, we spiked in exogenous RNA species (GFP, HALO tag, and MBP) at varying levels relative to total RNA and identified their DNA contacts. This provides us with a measure of false positive contacts, which was always equal to or less than 0.5% in the condition where we spike in a contaminant up to 10% of the total RNA by mass (Figure 1—figure supplement 6). This value compares favorably to the false positive values published by MARGI (~2.2%) and GRID-seq (human cells: 3.3%, fly S2 cells: 6.9%, mESCs: 4.7%), with the caveat that a cross-species analysis was used instead of exogenous RNAs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Can you add metrics describing sensitivity and specificity of the method?</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned above, we have performed a spike-in experiment to address this question about specificity where we added exogenous RNA to our lysed cells in order to mimic the RNA that might be released during our fragmentation step, and which could theoretically cross-ligate to distant sites owing to non-specific binding. In this experiment, we isolated the total soluble RNA after lysis and fragmentation, added back a percentage of spike in RNA by mass at 0.1, 1 and 10%, and then proceeded with our library prep and quantified the number of false positives by alignment to the reference sequences used to generate the in vitro transcribed RNAs. Even in the condition where 10% of the total RNA was a spiked in contaminant, our false positive rate was less than 0.5%, indicating that the subsequent washes and steps after fragmentation but before ligation are sufficient to efficiently remove the contaminating RNA.</p><p>We have added signal-to-noise metrics and false-positive estimates, as described above, to the text. These reveal that ChAR-seq can detect RNAs with both high sensitivity (e.g., roX1 and roX2) and high specificity (e.g., roX1 and roX2 enrichment on chrX, and low percentage of DNA contacts by exogenous spike-in RNAs). In addition, we showed that roX1 and roX2 bind near previously identified dosage compensation peaks from ChIRP-seq data.</p><p>Other evidence for high sensitivity and specificity are presented in the following figures:</p><p>- Figure 1—figure supplement 4: 80% of ligation reads are specific to RNA.</p><p>- Figure 2E: A large subset of RNAs, including roX1 and roX2, are found enriched on chromatin after controlling for expression levels (off-diagonal RNAs in red on plot).</p><p>- Figure 3—figure supplement 2, and Figure 4C, D: When comparing female Kc167 cells to male CME-W1-cl8+ cells, roX1 and roX2 are clearly found enriched in male cells, as expected.</p><p>- Figure 3—figure supplement 1: roX enrichment on chrX.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Please clarify concerns about how many times experiments were performed and add details on statistical analysis of reproducibility of data and analyses.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now explicitly stated the number of biological and technical replicates used. Critical information relevant to each ChAR-Seq library is now presented in Supplementary file 1. For the primary data set, 4 biological replicates were performed and sequenced, along with one technical replicate sequenced at much higher depth. Additional datasets generated during revision provide three new technical replicates.</p><p>We also have added several graphs that show reproducibility of independent replicates, including a comparison between ChAR-seq replicates with respect to number of RNA-DNA contacts (Figure 1—figure supplement 5), reproducibility of chromatin enriched RNAs across 3 different replicates, at 2 different expression levels (Figure 2—figure supplement 2), and reproducibility across different cell lines (Figure 3—figure supplement 2).</p><p>Finnaly, we have included all details for statistical analysis in the main text, figure legends, or Materials and methods.

We attempted to analyze which RNAs were bound to repetitive DNA sequences, but found that it was difficult to make any conclusions about data since: 1) much of the repetitive portion of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> genome is incomplete, including some centromeric sequence; 2) given 1, the sequence space covered by a given short repeat element is unknown, making it difficult to make any meaningful conclusion regarding DNA abundance after alignment to these RNAs; 3) repeats are not easily mapped, or mapped to, with current alignment tools. For example, we removed all non-uniquely mapping reads here, but would need to set different multi-mapping threshold parameters for different repeat classes. We also attempted to analyze where RNAs that emanate from DNA repeats (such as transposons) bind; specifically, do RNAs expressed by DNA repeats bind nearby, or to other repetitive DNA loci at a greater frequency? However, this analysis was also inconclusive, primarily due to the multi-mapping issue described above.</p><p>My laboratory has a strong interest in repeat regions of the genome from our studies of vertebrate centromeres Thus, we are particularly interested in pursuing this analysis in human cells where high quality models for centromere repeats have been generated by Karen Miga, Jim Kent, David Haussler and Hunt Willard and long-read sequence information has enabled the first complete assembly of the human Y centromere.

This should be explained well because it is not evident.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a polarity indicator arrow to the illustration in Figure 1B, showing how the first-strand cDNA sequence (representing the RNA) is always 5’ of the adaptor sequence top strand (which does not contain the biotin modification) and the DNA sequence is always 3’ of the adaptor sequence top strand.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The statement &quot;the 5'-adenylated end (5'App) enables increased ligation specificity for 3'-terminated ssRNA&quot; is not clear: 'increased specificity' relative to what?</p></disp-quote><p>We have clarified the language in the manuscript to indicate that the ligation is performed without free ATP, making 5’ adenylation a requirement for ligating the 5’ ends. This adenylation and ligation scheme ensures that only bridge 5’ ends are ligated to RNA, preventing non-specific ligation between non-adenylated RNA 5’ ends and RNA 3’ ends.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Is the sequence of RNA and DNA oligos presented in Figure 1—figure supplement 2 provided? It is not clear what the molar excess of DNA over RNA is, please clarify. Also the legend of this figure should explain what is shown in every lane. In lane 1 there is a high mw band, what is this, what is its size? The ladder sizes are provided only for the bottom part of the gel, they should be provided also for the top part, considering that there is a high mw band. How many times was this experiment repeated? Is there any statistical analysis of these data? This, possibly, should be explained in the legend.</p></disp-quote><p>We added the missing label to Lane 3 to indicate that it represents the reaction using R55K K227Q mutant T4 Rnl2tr ligase and added additional labels for the ladder used (a combination of NEB microRNA and low range ssRNA ladders). The high molecular weight band is most likely long concatemers of the ssDNA substrate created by the Thermostable 5’App DNA/RNA ligase. It is possible that this enzyme is able to remove the 3’ block from the ssDNA oligo used in this optimization experiment, or that the block was incomplete. This enzyme is known to have higher activity in ssDNA-ssDNA ligation than the other two. We have modified the figure legend to reflect this explanation and to provide more detailed information on the enzymes used. We only use these results to make a qualitative judgment about which enzyme performed best. Because the conclusion of the experiment would not be altered by further quantification, we proceeded with the approach based on this qualitative assessment. We have also updated the legend to state that the experiment was performed once.</p><p>The DNA sequence used in Figure 1—figure supplement 2 is the universal miRNA cloning linker: CTGTAGGCACCATCAAT and the RNA sequence was that of the CENP-B box: TTTCGTTGGAAGCGGGA. These details have been added to the Figure 1—figure supplement 2 legend.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The statement: &quot;This RNase-treatment dramatically reduced in the number of bridge molecules identified, demonstrating that bridge ligation is indeed RNA-dependent (Figure 1—figure supplement 5)&quot; is not strongly supported by the data shown in this figure. In addition to a typo in this statement, looking at the figure, there seems to be a factor of six reduction, which does not represent a 'dramatic' reduction. Importantly, there appears to be no repeats of this experiment and no statistical analysis of the data. Was this experiment reproducible, are there repeats that can be shown?</p></disp-quote><p>We have changed the manuscript text to be more specific, indicating the fold-reduction in bridge ligation events. The experiment was performed once for this control. In response to reviewer 1, question 3, we discuss why an RNase treatment could still result in the low presence of bridge-containing sequences.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Legend to Figure 1E has a typo: &quot;Zoomed in region of shown&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>The figure legend has been updated to fix this typo.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Typo in Results: &quot;we performed RNA-seq to for&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing it out. This typo has been corrected in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) The correlation between expression level of the RNA and FPKM contacts is not very clear, because in Figure 2—figure supplement 1 and 2 this does not seem to be the case.</p></disp-quote><p>The correlation the reviewer describes can be observed in Figure 2E, in which we plot the total RNA expression (measured by RNA-seq) vs. RNA-to-DNA contacts (measured by ChAR-seq). For most RNAs, there is a strong correlation between expression level and ChAR-seq contacts observed. The red dots represent RNAs that are enriched by at least 10-fold in the ChAR-seq dataset over the average level of contacts for a given expression level. This correlation is already normalized in the bar plot on the right side of Figure 2—figure supplement 1 and the quantity being displayed is fold-enrichment of ChAR-seq contacts over the expected contacts for a given expression level. The left bar plot is the raw expression level. What this figure illustrates is that the level of chromatin enrichment for a given RNA is not correlated with the total number of contacts we observe – enrichment is not merely a property of being above some limit of detection, it is a property of the RNA itself.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>[…] 1) Data completeness and transparency:</p><p>To provide a more complete resource for the community, all potentially interesting RNAs should be named/identified in a table, including those that were initially included but didn't match criteria for 'chromatin associated'.</p><p>a) There should be a table listing the 1797 RNAs (Figure 2D), and relevant information, such as% and numbers of cis and trans contacts, RNA expression level, RNA-DNA contacts, and a way to access information about their genomic distributions, etc. – essentially anything that may be of use to scientists interested in whether or not their favorite RNA is present, or in performing their own analyses of the data.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the 1797 (now 1952 after additional sequencing and analysis see revised Figure 2D) most abundant transcripts are of interest. We have now generated a 39 column ‘masterfile’ that contains all RNA-DNA contacts and related information, as described in our response to the editor’s Essential revisions. These data are publicly available on NCBI GEO (GSE97131), In addition, we provide Supplementary file 1 that includes the top 8822 unique RNAs, their RNA-DNA contact number (CPKM), RNA expression level, and chromatin enrichment values, which allows any scientist to search for a particular RNA of interest.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) I assume Figure 2E shows all 1797 as 'included', but the 'chromatin associated' RNAs in Figure 2E should be listed in a table. My impression is that some (73) but not all are listed in Figure 2—figure supplement 1 – are these the red dots in 2E? Even if all red dots are listed in the supplement, readers should be able to access identity and other data for all 1797, and especially the grey dots that are RNA-DNA contact outliers with high expression (I suspect that normalization to expression levels eliminates interesting candidates, see statistics discussion below). Similarly, there appear to be RNAs with low expression that may be chromatin enriched, yet are not highlighted in red.</p></disp-quote><p>The red dots in revised Figure 2E are the 138 RNAs with contacts enriched 10-fold over the expression levels, and that have more than 100 CPKM (DNA contacts). As stated above, the most abundant RNAs can be extracted from Table 1, along with all RNAs above any desired fold enrichment threshold.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Genomics, Analysis and Statistics:a) Figure 1D, 2A and elsewhere. I could not find a description of what the black circles and darker grey areas on the chromosome graphics indicate. I assume black=centromere, but the rest is unclear.</p></disp-quote><p>We have clarified these graphics in the figure legends. The cartoon chromosomes depicted in Figure 1D, 2A, 3C, and 3D are scaled visual representations of the chromosomes. The black circles are the centromeres, the light gray regions are the primary chromosome scaffolds, and the dark gray regions are the heterochromatic scaffolds.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) Why was release 5 used, given that the more complete release 6 has been available for at least a year?</p></disp-quote><p>Release 5 (dm3) was used for several reasons. First and foremost, the ChIRP-seq roX1 and roX2 datasets that we used to for validation and the modENCODE data that we used for deeper analysis were all generated with the dm3 build. Many available datasets in NCBI-GEO lack either the raw read files (e.g., fastq) or lack the necessary analysis pipelines to proceed from raw reads to the available processed genome coverage files. For the processed files that are not at single bp resolution, it would be difficult to convert genome coordinates from release 5 to release 6.</p><p>Second, while major improvements on dm6 over release 5 exist in the heterochromatic scaffolds, the rest of the genome has only minor changes in dm6 compared to dm5 (<underline>http://flybase.org/static_pages/feature/previous/articles/2014_07/FB2014_04.html)</underline>. Finally, coordinate conversion is generally easier going from an older build to a newer one, so for the small number of affected regions or genes, researchers for whom this is necessary can use readily available conversion tools to re-map the ChAR-seq dataset, provided in NCBI GEO.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition, genomes from the cell lines used have not been assembled, and are likely rearranged (plus other variation, including DNA copy number) relative to the reference sequence, so the positions shown in the figures are likely to be incorrect, though we don't know where. No, the authors do not need to assemble the clone8 or Kc genomes, but they should acknowledge this issue.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the genome assemblies are lacking for some of these cell lines and have added a sentence to the Materials and methods section to indicate that there may exist variation in the positions of some datasets due to genomic differences between cell lines. We took great care in selecting a suitable cell line for a genome wide RNA-DNA mapping method: The clone 8 cell line (CME-W1-cl8+) used for the majority of the data collection in this work has a normal and stable karyotype, and is male so we could analyze the roX genes for validation. In a recent study, 19 <italic>Drosophila</italic> cell lines had their DNA sequenced to determine ploidy across the genome (Lee et al., 2014). Of all 19 commonly used cell lines, the CME-W1-cl8+ line had, by far, the most optimum ploidy across the genome, which was very close to 1X throughout, whereas the commonly used S2 lines were largely 4X with variable regions up to 8X ploidy. The CME-W1-cl8+ line is also one of the modENCODE lines and maintained by the <italic>Drosophila</italic> Genomics Resource Center.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) It is unclear what parts of the genome assembly were included, for example were heterochromatic regions included, and if so where is that data presented? This information would help with the interpretations, especially in Figure 4D.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now included which regions of the genome are included in each figure legend or extended Materials and methods, including Figure 4D. For the majority of analyses, chr2Het, chr3Het, and chrXHet were included, with exceptions noted in the figure legends or Materials and methods.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>d) A related point, for Figure 4D it would be helpful to report the genomic locations (middle of euchromatin? Pericentromeric? X vs. autosomes?) for RNAs whose chromatin contacts show strong correlation with specific chromatin marks. Also, please explain how the correlation signals were aggregated in Figure 4D – the methods described using 2kb bins while the figure showing 100kb bins.</p></disp-quote><p>The whole reference genome was used, including the heterochromatin scaffolds; however, we filtered the regions of the build determined to have high frequency mapping artifacts (i.e., the so-called blacklisted regions) and repeats, which also produce mapping artifacts. The cluster analysis in Figure 4D is genome-wide, excluding only the chrU and chrUhet scaffolds, because those are of low quality and do not represent a real biological chromosome. The DpnII normalization (i.e., z-score calculation) of ChAR-seq tracks was performed using 2-kb windows, while the Pearson correlation coefficient was calculated pairwise between each ChAR-seq track (i.e., columns in the clustergram) and each modENCODE track (i.e., rows). The Pearson correlation coefficient was calculated using 100 kb bins because we sought to use a window size slightly larger than our estimated resolution.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>e) Can the authors discuss how the use of PCR to amplify ligated RNA/DNA contacts, combined with normalization to expression levels, could exclude RNAs with lower transcription levels, even if they have many (potentially important) DNA contacts? I think they are being appropriately conservative, but as with all such screens, and to help others who will certainly try it themselves, it would be good to have a brief discussion about the tradeoffs.</p></disp-quote><p>It is true that using PCR to amplify our molecules during the library prep could introduce biases. However, we minimized the number of PCR cycles performed by using a side PCR to estimate the minimum number of cycles required to reach a stable exponential phase. We note that by normalizing to expression levels, RNAs with lower transcription levels but many DNA contacts may actually be more likely to be called as “chromatin-bound” after our enrichment calculations. Although our current dataset may have missed some RNAs expressed at very low levels, sequencing at greater depth with sufficient library complexity can mitigate this issue, as it does with RNA-seq.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>f) Some of the statements need quantitative support, such as:</p><p>- Figure 2E: what is the threshold for identifying RNAs with more than expected chromatin interaction (how was the expectation calculated?</p></disp-quote><p>We used two cut-offs to call RNAs chromatin enriched. First, we excluded all RNAs with fewer than 10 DNA contacts based on the cumulative frequency distribution curve as well as the fact that 10 or fewer contacts is insufficient information to make biological conclusions about each RNA. Second, we required a 10-fold enrichment of ChAR-seq contacts over expression level (FPCM). We also required more than 100 ChAR-seq contacts, which we empirically found to be a rough minimum for which to explore various properties of the RNA-DNA contact (e.g., cis/trans% , broad chromosome distribution, etc.).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- How were p-values for rox1 and rox2 (7.6 fold and 8.1 fold enrichment) calculated?</p></disp-quote><p>This enrichment was calculated using a one-tailed cumulative binomial test. A full description of this calculation is included in the Materials and methods.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Figure 3E: correlation between the DNA contact locations from ChIRP and ChAR- seq – is this simply the Pearson correlation coefficient?</p></disp-quote><p>This is Spearman’s rank correlation, and this is now noted in the Materials and methods and new Figure 3 legend.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Figure 4—figure supplement 1: how was the base sequence similarity calculated and used to aggregate signals for different snRNAs?</p></disp-quote><p>This is described in the Figure 4—figure supplement 1 legend. In short, we used GeniousR7 to calculate a pairwise distance score, then clustered the data using R.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>g) Using the correlations between ChIRP and ChAR-seq to assess the resolution of ChAR-seq does not seem to be appropriate, since the preparation of sequencing libraries may be very different between these two datasets. (Also, the curve actually goes down as window size increases?!) The authors should provide more reasoning for this approach.</p></disp-quote><p>ChIRP, RAP, and CHART are all well established RNA hybridization and chromatin pull down methods designed to map individual chromatin associated RNAs. ChIRP, in particular, has been applied in the CME-W1-cl8+ cell line, which is why we used this specific dataset to estimate our resolution. ChIRP data have a resolution of ~1-5kb, which provides a useful lower bound, and ChIRP peaks match well with 0.5-1kb ChIP-seq peaks for the dosage compensation complex protein MSL3. The reviewer is correct that the library preparation is very different, but this is advantageous for benchmarking our method: ChIRP was established as a method for mapping chromatin interaction patterns of single RNAs, and therefore comparing the performance of the highly multiplexed ChAR-seq protocol against ChIRP-seq by selecting the same target RNA from both data sets is the most direct comparison we can make.</p><p>For both roX1 and roX2, the correlation curve increases, then plateaus. The small dip in correlation between a 250 kb bin size and a 1 Mb bin size after the plateau is likely due to the bin size being so large that differences in filtering, blacklisting, etc. between ChIRP and ChAR-seq data may cause different edge effects at ends of chromosomes or in large domains flanked by repetitive regions or heterochromatin.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>How were the replicates analyzed? Were they merged? What are the correlations between replicates?</p></disp-quote><p>The replicates show excellent reproducibility and are now presented in Figure 1—figure supplement 5. The replicates were merged for most of the analysis, as described in the Materials and methods and the statistics included in new Supplementary file 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>h) How was the z-score was calculated? It seems like it is calculated as comparing between the values in each bin vs. the rest of the genome. If this is the case, there may be no need to calculate a z-score as every window will have the same denominator, and it may be just as informative as using the read counts. Also, it may be informative to use the chromosome-specific mean (instead of whole genome mean) to further identify interesting local events (the current analysis may be mainly identifying between chromosome differences).</p></disp-quote><p>We clarified this calculation in the extended Materials and methods section. The z-score is calculated to normalize ChAR-seq mapping events relative to the DpnII frequency for a given bin size.</p><p>References:</p><p>Chow JC, Hall LL, Baldry SEL, Thorogood NP, Lawrence JB, Brown CJ.
