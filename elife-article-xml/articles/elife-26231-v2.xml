pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26231.001</object-id><p>Habit formation is a behavioral adaptation that automates routine actions. Habitual behavior correlates with broad reconfigurations of dorsolateral striatal (DLS) circuit properties that increase gain and shift pathway timing. The mechanism(s) for these circuit adaptations are unknown and could be responsible for habitual behavior. Here we find that a single class of interneuron, fast-spiking interneurons (FSIs), modulates all of these habit-predictive properties. Consistent with a role in habits, FSIs are more excitable in habitual mice compared to goal-directed and acute chemogenetic inhibition of FSIs in DLS prevents the expression of habitual lever pressing. <italic>In vivo</italic> recordings further reveal a previously unappreciated selective modulation of SPNs based on their firing patterns; FSIs inhibit most SPNs but paradoxically promote the activity of a subset displaying high fractions of gamma-frequency spiking. These results establish a microcircuit mechanism for habits and provide a new example of how interneurons mediate experience-dependent behavior.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26231.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>From biting fingernails to the daily commute, habits are sets of actions that can be completed almost without thinking and that are difficult to change or stop. Behavioral neuroscientists refer to habits as “stimulus-response” behaviors, and know that forming a new habit requires a region deep within the brain called the dorsolateral striatum. Indeed, in this region, the outgoing neurons – which make up 95% of the cells - respond differently to incoming signals in mice that have learned habits compared to non-habitual mice. However a question remained: what exactly was producing these differences?</p><p>O’Hare et al. have now found, unexpectedly, that the answer resides not in the 95% of outgoing neurons, but rather in a rare type of cell known as the fast-spiking interneuron. This cell is connected to many others and it appears to act like a conductor, orchestrating the previously identified changes in the output neurons. These findings were made using mice that had been trained to press a lever for a sugar pellet reward. Habit was measured by how long mice kept pressing even if they had just been allowed to eat their fill of pellets and the test lever was no longer dispensing pellets. Habitual mice continue to press the lever in this circumstance, while other mice do not.</p><p>O’Hare et al. found that inactivating the “conductor” cell made the output neurons respond in the opposite way to how they normally respond in habitual mice. Further experiments showed that fast-spiking interneurons were also more easily activated in habitual mice. To test whether this putative “conductor” cell was necessary for habitual behaviors, a technique known as chemogenetics was used to turn down its activity in habitual mice. Indeed, reducing activity in the conductor cell blocked the habitual behavior.</p><p>While some habits are a helpful and economical way to get through daily life, habits are also thought to be corrupted in a number of diseases such as neurodegenerative diseases, addictions and compulsions. Identifying this specific, yet rare, cell as a critical part of maintaining habits points out a new target to consider for therapies. Further work is needed before such treatments might become available to treat habit-related disorders; though O'Hare et al. are now taking steps in this direction by trying to work out how the fast-spiking interneuron changes its own activity when a habit is formed.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>habit</kwd><kwd>striatum</kwd><kwd>fast-spiking interneuron</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS064577</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Calakos</surname><given-names>Nicole</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ARRA supplement to NS064577</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Calakos</surname><given-names>Nicole</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000027</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AA021075</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yin</surname><given-names>Henry</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000026</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Drug Abuse</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DA040701</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yin</surname><given-names>Henry</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005270</institution-id><institution>McKnight Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yin</surname><given-names>Henry</given-names></name><name><surname>Calakos</surname><given-names>Nicole</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS051156</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ade</surname><given-names>Kristen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM008441</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>O'Hare</surname><given-names>Justin K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000874</institution-id><institution>Brain and Behavior Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ade</surname><given-names>Kristen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund9"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008771</institution-id><institution>Tourette Association of America</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ade</surname><given-names>Kristen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund10"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100002690</institution-id><institution>Ruth K.

Once established, habits allow routine actions to be triggered by external cues. This automation frees cognitive resources that would otherwise process action-outcome relationships underlying goal-directed behavior. The dorsolateral region of the striatum has been heavily implicated in the formation and expression of habits through lesion and inactivation studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yin et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yin et al., 2006</xref>), <italic>in vivo</italic> recordings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tang et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jog et al., 1999</xref>), and changes in synaptic strength (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Shan et al., 2015</xref>). More recently, properties of the dorsolateral striatum (DLS) input-output transformation of afferent activity to striatal projection neuron firing were found to predict the extent of habitual behavior in individual animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">O'Hare et al., 2016</xref>). Despite these observations, the cellular microcircuit mechanisms driving habitual behavior have not been identified.</p><p>DLS output arises from striatal projection neurons (SPNs), which comprise ~95% of striatal neurons and project to either the direct (dSPNs) or indirect (iSPNs) basal ganglia pathways. The properties of evoked SPN firing <italic>ex vivo</italic> linearly predict behavior across the goal-directed to habitual spectrum in an operant lever pressing task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">O'Hare et al., 2016</xref>). Specifically, habitual responding correlates with larger evoked responses in both the direct and indirect pathways as well as a shorter latency to fire of dSPNs relative to iSPNs. To identify a microcircuit mechanism for habitual behavior, we manipulated the striatal microcircuitry to identify local circuit elements that modulated these habit-predictive SPN firing properties (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26231.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Striatal output reconfiguration following pharmacological inhibition of FSIs directly opposes substrates for habitual behavior.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of calcium imaging approach.

Although such plasticity accompanies changes in behavior, including the formation of habits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Shan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nazzaro et al., 2012</xref>), it does not readily explain the finding that increased gain in the direct and indirect SPNs in habitual mice was balanced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">O'Hare et al., 2016</xref>) since synaptic strengthening would occur separately on the two SPN classes through dichotomous mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Shen et al., 2008</xref>). In addition, within the DLS, habit-predictive SPN firing properties were distributed uniformly rather than in discrete subpopulations of SPNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">O'Hare et al., 2016</xref>). Because interneurons are often anatomically suited to tune SPN activity in a similarly broad manner through extensive axonal arbors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kawaguchi et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tepper et al., 2010</xref>), we hypothesized that plasticity of striatal interneurons might underlie the habit-associated changes in striatal output.</p><p>Among the various interneuron types resident to the striatum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tepper et al., 2010</xref>), parvalbumin-positive, fast-spiking interneurons (FSIs) provide the strongest source of local modulation, exerting strong, feedforward inhibition of SPNs via perisomatic GABAergic contacts onto virtually all SPNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gittis et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Koós and Tepper, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Koos et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mallet, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Taverna et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Straub et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Szydlowski et al., 2013</xref>). Notably, FSIs are expressed in the dorsal striatum on a mediolateral gradient with the most residing in DLS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gerfen, 1985</xref>). FSIs also preferentially innervate dSPNs relative to iSPNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gittis et al., 2010</xref>), suggesting a potential mechanism by which FSI-mediated inhibition could allow iSPNs to fire before dSPNs in response to coincident excitatory input. Based on these considerations, we hypothesized that FSIs might drive the habit-predictive circuit features through a disinhibitory mechanism that would promote SPN firing and a preferentially earlier activation of the direct pathway. Striatal FSI plasticity has been demonstrated through experimenter-induced activity and genetic manipulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mathur et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Winters et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Orduz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gittis et al., 2011a</xref>), but it remains unknown whether dorsal striatal FSIs undergo plasticity normally in the context of experience-dependent adaptive behavior.</p><p>Using pharmacological and optogenetic manipulations, we found that striatal FSIs modulate the pathway-specific properties of DLS output that predict habitual behavior. Surprisingly though, silencing FSIs produced the opposite directionality for each habit-predictive circuit feature, suggesting that an increase, rather than decrease, in FSI activity might drive habitual behavior. Indeed, when FSI firing was evoked <italic>ex vivo</italic> by stimulation of cortical afferents, FSIs from habitual mice fired more readily than FSIs from goal-directed mice. To test the significance of this plasticity for the expression of habitual behavior, we acutely inhibited FSIs in DLS chemogenetically. Inhibiting FSIs in habit-trained mice blocked habit expression, but not lever-pressing per se, while identically-trained control subjects displayed robust habitual behavior. <italic>In vivo</italic> recordings revealed that the effects of FSI activity on striatal output appear to be more selective than previously appreciated. While FSIs exert the expected strongly inhibitory influence over DLS output, they also promote activity in a subset of SPNs that can be identified <italic>a priori</italic> based upon individual SPN firing patterns. Our results identify a mechanism for habit by which FSI strengthening reconfigures DLS output and promotes the expression of habitual behavior.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Inhibiting fast-spiking interneurons drives a striatal circuit endophenotype opposite that of habitual behavior</title><p>To manipulate FSI activity, the calcium-permeable AMPA receptor (CP-AMPAR) antagonist IEM-1460, which predominantly weakens excitatory synaptic inputs onto FSIs in striatum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gittis et al., 2011b</xref>), was used. Striatal FSIs express AMPARs lacking the GluA2 subunit, rendering them permeable to calcium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hollmann et al., 1991</xref>), whereas SPNs do not typically express CP-AMPARs. Consistent with this difference in AMPAR subunit expression, IEM-1460 does not affect excitatory synaptic currents in SPNs but strongly decreases excitatory transmission onto FSIs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gittis et al., 2011b</xref>). Cell-attached FSI recordings before and after exposure to IEM-1460 (50 μM) confirmed the drug’s efficacy to reduce synaptically-evoked AP firing in our acute parasagittal DLS preparation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). To first approximate how FSIs modulate the habit-predictive properties of evoked striatal output, the same <italic>ex vivo</italic> population calcium imaging approach that identified the behavior-predictive properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">O'Hare et al., 2016</xref>) was used on tissue prepared from untrained animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). Firing responses evoked by electrical activation of cortical afferents were measured in dozens of pathway-defined SPNs of both types simultaneously using the calcium indicator dye fura-2AM, the <italic>Drd1a</italic>-tdTomato (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ade et al., 2011</xref>) reporter, and vector-mode two-photon laser scanning microscopy (2PLSM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; see Materials and methods and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">O'Hare et al., 2016</xref>). Action potential responses were detected by cross-correlation analysis with a template waveform that was obtained from single-action potential responses during simultaneous cell-attached electrophysiological recordings for each SPN subtype (see Materials and methods). Contamination of dSPN and iSPN datasets by interneurons was minimized by selection criteria and monitoring datasets for outliers (See Materials and methods for further details).</p><p>Firing properties of SPNs were compared within-cell before and after wash-in of IEM-1460. IEM-1460 decreased the amplitude of evoked calcium transients in both dSPNs (t(86) = 3.42, p=0.001, n = 87) and iSPNs (t(51) = 2.11, p=0.040, n = 52). IEM-1460 also changed the relative latency to fire between direct and indirect pathway SPNs by increasing the pre-existing bias in relative pathway timing whereby iSPNs tend to respond to cortical excitation more quickly than dSPNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>) (mean absolute latency values for dSPNs: 144.03 ± 7.08 ms ACSF, 154.33 ± 7.92 ms IEM-1460, N = 87; iSPNs: 130.31 ± 7.87 ms ACSF, 134.43 ± 8.89 ms IEM-1460, N = 52).</p><p>Upon closer inspection, the decrease in calcium transient amplitude seen at the population level appeared to be dominated by the subset of SPNs with larger baseline responses (for example, see brightest red cells before wash-in in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). To determine whether there was selectivity for IEM-1460’s effects on SPNs with large basal responses, calcium transient amplitude was used as a feature to classify SPNs as having large or small evoked calcium transients prior to drug wash-in. Rather than specifying an arbitrary cutoff value for the transient amplitude, we used an unsupervised clustering algorithm known as a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) to separate SPNs into two clusters. Based on calibration data in this preparation demonstrating the relationship between calcium transient amplitude and number of action potentials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">O'Hare et al., 2016</xref>), the GMM separated SPNs into clusters corresponding to multi-action potential (larger transients; ‘high-firing’) and single-action potential (smaller transients; ‘low-firing’) responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Compared to the use of a physiologically-based 0.05 ΔF/F<sub>0</sub> cutoff value, the unbiased GMM classification was in 90.5% agreement. According to this pre-IEM-1460 categorization, low-firing SPNs were unaffected whereas calcium transient amplitudes of high-firing SPNs were significantly reduced by IEM-1460 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p><p>This selective relationship was also borne out by examining the relationship between basal calcium transient amplitude and the magnitude of IEM-1460 effect. Consistent with a selective inhibition of multi-action potential responses, basal calcium transient amplitudes linearly predicted the inhibitory effect of IEM-1460 in both SPN subtypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Moreover, IEM-1460 did not affect spike probability in either SPN subtype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). These pharmacological experiments in acute brain slices indicate that IEM-1460 promotes an indirect pathway timing advantage and selectively diminishes multi-action potential evoked SPN responses.</p><p>Because the within-cell experimental design of measuring effects before and after IEM-1460 application did not exclude the possibility that changes in calcium signals occurred during the 20 min wash-in period independently of IEM-1460, we performed a separate across-group study. Brain slices were incubated with either IEM-1460 or vehicle prior to and during imaging. Group mean calcium transient amplitudes were lower in IEM-1460 relative to vehicle in both dSPNs (vehicle: 0.043 ± 0.0011 ΔF/F<sub>0</sub>, N = 202 cells; IEM-1460: 0.037 ± 0.0021 ΔF/F<sub>0</sub>, N = 72 cells; t(272) = 2.62, p=0.0093) and iSPNs (vehicle: 0.040 ± 0.0014 ΔF/F<sub>0</sub>, N = 143 cells; IEM-1460: 0.033 ± 0.0011 ΔF/F<sub>0</sub>, N = 56 cells; t(197) = 2.93, p=0.0038) and IEM-1460-treated slices showed a preference for faster indirect pathway activation relative to vehicle-treated slices (t(197) = 3.83, p=1.41×10<sup>−7</sup>, N = 143 and 56 independent dSPN/iSPN pairs). These results are generally consistent with findings from within-cell pre-post measurements.</p><p>To further test whether IEM-1460 selectively inhibited multi-spike SPN responses using methodology that did not involve inferring action potentials through calcium imaging, we used conventional electrophysiological methods to record cortically-evoked SPN firing in cell-attached mode. Brief single-pulse electrical stimuli (300–600 μs) were calibrated to elicit a stable multi-action potential response in SPNs prior to taking a baseline measurement. Responses to the same stimulus were then recorded after wash-in of IEM-1460 or vehicle. Consistent with the calcium imaging results, IEM-1460 decreased evoked SPN firing (t(7) = 2.37, p=0.029, n = 8) while vehicle had no significant effect (p=0.76, n = 8). Moreover, the same selectivity for modulating multi-action potential responses was observed in that the magnitude of IEM-1460’s effect correlated with the size of baseline responses and there was no effect on single-action potential responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). This result confirms that IEM-1460, which inhibits FSI firing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), selectively reduces multi-action potential SPN responses to afferent stimulation as suggested by calcium imaging experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,E</xref>).</p><p>Altogether, this series of experiments identifies a pharmacological agent that potently inhibits FSI activity and modulates all of the habit-predictive SPN firing properties. These results were surprising for two reasons. First, rather than a blockade of FSI activity causing disinhibition of SPNs as we had hypothesized, we found that when FSI activity was reduced, SPN activity was also reduced. This result suggests that FSI activity is capable of promoting, rather than inhibiting, SPN activity at least in the acute brain slice preparation. Secondly, although IEM-1460 strikingly affected the same features of DLS output that predict the expression of habitual behavior (calcium transient amplitude in both pathways and relative pathway timing) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">O'Hare et al., 2016</xref>), the directionality of these effects was opposite in all measures. Therefore, these results revise the overall hypothesis to involve a <italic>gain</italic>, rather than loss, of FSI activity as a candidate mechanism for habitual behavior.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Parvalbumin-positive interneurons selectively promote multi-action potential SPN responses to cortical excitation <italic>ex vivo</italic> </title><p>While IEM-1460 has been shown to have selective effects on the firing of FSIs in striatum, its effect of inhibiting AMPAR-mediated excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) in cholinergic interneurons (CINs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gittis et al., 2011b</xref>) leaves open the possibility that CINs might contribute to our observed IEM-1460 effects.

In this configuration, PV-Arch effectively blocked evoked FSI firing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). We found that optical inhibition of PV+ interneurons reliably decreased evoked SPN firing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, left and middle panels).

We found that FSIs of habitual mice fired more readily than those from mice with goal-directed behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>).

Post-CNO SPN firing rates ranged from 32.5% to 2511.1% of baseline (CV = 147%) with 26% of SPNs displaying negative modulation. In acute slice experiments, FSIs had displayed an unexpected and selective effect of promoting multi-action potential responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1D,E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2C</xref>) but not otherwise affecting spike probability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). To assess whether FSIs also promoted activity in identifiable subsets of SPNs <italic>in vivo</italic>, we analyzed the baseline firing patterns in single SPNs prior to CNO injection. SPN spiking was categorized into discrete frequency bands by deriving instantaneous firing rate from interspike intervals (ISIs) and was then normalized to total number of ISIs for each single unit. This analysis defined the fraction of ISIs corresponding to each frequency band for each SPN and was independent of local field potentials.</p><p>We found that the baseline (pre-CNO) fraction of ISIs falling within the highest rate frequency band, gamma-frequency (30–100 Hz), linearly predicted how firing rates in individual SPNs changed when FSI activity was suppressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>, left; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref> for example units). That is, the higher the fraction of gamma-frequency spikes an SPN fired, the more likely it was to fire less when FSIs were chemogenetically inhibited. No such relationship was observed in response to vehicle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>, right).</p><p>Since neurons with higher firing rates would be expected to have shorter ISIs in general, we examined the possibility that the fraction of gamma ISIs in SPNs might simply relate to mean firing rate. However, we found that the proportion of gamma-frequency ISIs was unrelated to mean firing rate in baseline single unit SPN recordings before either CNO or vehicle administration (pre-CNO: p=0.25, n = 23; pre-vehicle: p=0.28, n = 20). Additionally, we found that SPNs fire significantly more gamma-frequency spikes than expected by Poisson processes matched to firing rate (pre-CNO: t(44) = 5.76, p=7.67×10<sup>−7</sup>, n = 23 SPNs and rate-matched simulations; pre-vehicle: t(38) = 8.24, p=5.59×10<sup>−10</sup>, n = 20 SPNs and rate-matched simulations). Whereas baseline firing rates non-specifically predict fold change in firing rate after both CNO and vehicle injection (CNO: r(22) = −0.61, p=0.0022, n = 23; vehicle: r(19) = −0.45, p=0.045, n = 20), the excess probability of gamma-frequency ISIs (observed – expected) specifically predicts rate modulation after CNO (r(22) = −0.52, p=0.011, n = 23) but not vehicle (r(19) = 0.045, p=0.85, n = 20). Directly comparing correlation coefficients using Fisher r-to-z transformations showed that baseline firing rates did not predict SPN rate modulation by CNO better than by vehicle (z = −0.68, p=0.25) whereas baseline excess gamma specifically predicted modulation by CNO (z = −1.88, p=0.030). Therefore, gamma-frequency spiking represents a feature of interest in SPNs that predicts whether these output neurons will fire more or less as a consequence of reducing FSI activity.</p><p>These results demonstrate that FSIs modulate SPN activity in a more complicated manner than previously appreciated. While FSIs can have an overall strongly inhibitory effect <italic>in vivo</italic> on SPN firing as traditionally assumed, we also found evidence that they potentiate activity in a select population of SPNs that displays higher fractions of gamma-frequency spiking. This selective potentiation may be akin to a winner-take-all ‘focusing’ mechanism that increases the signal-to-noise ratio in corticostriatal transmission. According to such a mechanism, the subset of recruited SPNs would be facilitated while the less-relevant SPNs with low fractions of gamma spiking would be suppressed.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>With the recent availability of tools to study specific, genetically-defined types of neurons, critical roles for interneurons in facilitating behavioral adaptations to experience are becoming increasingly apparent. In brain regions other than the striatum, interneuron activity appears to most commonly serve as a gate for the induction of long-lasting plasticity elsewhere in the local circuitry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kuhlman et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kvitsiani et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wolff et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yazaki-Sugiyama et al., 2009</xref>). Although the potential for FSIs themselves to exhibit long-lasting activity-dependent plasticity is well-documented in acute brain slice experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mathur et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Orduz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hainmüller et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sarihi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dehorter et al., 2015</xref>), we are aware of only one report in which these interneurons were found to undergo experience-dependent plasticity and contribute to the expression of an adaptive behavior or memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Donato et al., 2013</xref>). Here we provide the first such example for striatal interneurons. We find that FSIs are a site of adaptive plasticity that drives circuit and behavioral hallmarks of habit. The habit-associated changes in FSI excitability appear distinct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>) from previously reported plasticity processes which included activity-induced changes in FSI-SPN synapses selectively at direct pathway SPNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mathur et al., 2013</xref>) and changes in firing rate related to the modulation of afterhyperolarization currents by parvalbumin expression levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Orduz et al., 2013</xref>). Further characterizing the plasticity mechanisms we find in habit represents an important area for future research as it may reveal a useful target for pharmacological modulation of FSI activity.</p><p>The approach we took to reveal the microcircuit mechanisms for habit was to identify a potential source for the broad local DLS circuit reorganizations of SPN firing properties that strongly correlate with habit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). To do this, we first examined how FSIs influenced striatal output using a pharmacological approach that inhibits excitatory synapses on striatal FSIs (and also CINs). In brain slices from untrained mice, IEM-1460 treatment showed striking specificity in that it modulated all of the previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">O'Hare et al., 2016</xref>) habit-predictive properties of evoked SPN firing <italic>ex vivo</italic>: gain of dSPN and iSPN responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,E</xref>), and the relative timing of firing between dSPNs and iSPNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). IEM-1460 also showed specificity in that it did not affect properties such as spike probability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) that are not predictive of habit.</p><p>Unexpectedly, we found that the directionality by which FSIs modulated these properties was opposite to our original hypothesis: instead of the expected disinhibition of SPNs, silencing FSIs reduced SPN output (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–E</xref>). FSI inhibition also altered the timing of direct and indirect pathway neuron firing in a direction that opposed the habit circuit signature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,F</xref>) and closely resembled previous observations in lever-press trained, goal-directed mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">O'Hare et al., 2016</xref>). This suggests that, in DLS, relative pathway timing is altered with habit formation but not with requisite goal-directed learning. Thus, the modest nature of the timing shift after pharmacological FSI blockade in untrained mice is likely due to a floor effect. Altogether, the observed effects of FSIs on SPNs lead to the prediction that an increase in FSI activity with habit formation would generate the evoked SPN properties that correlate with habit behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">O'Hare et al., 2016</xref>). Accordingly, in habitual mice, we found that FSI firing was increased, and under the same cortical afferent stimulation conditions that evoke habit-predictive SPN firing properties (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). This series of observations leads to a model of the striatal circuit basis for habitual behavior whereby habit formation is accompanied by a long-lasting increase in FSI excitability. In this setting, incoming cortical activity would be predicted to recruit more FSI activity that would in turn drive more firing of SPNs and shift their latencies such that direct pathway SPNs would tend to fire relatively sooner.</p><p>While anatomical and electrophysiological studies have long supported that striatal FSIs are critical for striatal circuit function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gittis et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Koós and Tepper, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Koos et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mallet, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Taverna et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Straub et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Szydlowski et al., 2013</xref>), an understanding of their specific behavioral contributions is much less developed. Prior <italic>in vivo</italic> studies have identified correlations of FSI activity with behaviors involving choice and reward-related actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gage et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Schmitzer-Torbert and Redish, 2008</xref>), while more recent correlations of FSI activity with head movement velocity suggest another mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kim et al., 2014</xref>). In the present study, by chemogenetically inhibiting PV+ interneurons <italic>in vivo</italic>, we found that FSI activity in DLS is required for the expression of a learned habit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>); an automated, reward-insensitive behavior quite different from behaviors previously studied. Previous pharmacological inactivation studies have demonstrated a role for DLS in habit expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Packard and McGaugh, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zapata et al., 2010</xref>), indicating that general disruption of DLS activity also impairs established habitual behavior. Interestingly, in the present study, chemogenetic inhibition of FSI activity drove an overall increase in projection neuron activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>) which suggests that reducing FSI activity specifically may impair habit expression differently than a general inactivation of the circuitry.</p><p>While the disruption of habit by chemogenetically inhibiting FSIs supports a critical role for FSIs in this behavior, this experiment does not identify FSI plasticity as a mechanism for the expression of habit since artificially manipulating the activity of any cell that plays an otherwise critical role in the function of an implicated brain region might similarly disrupt behavior. Rather, in this study, a specific role for FSI plasticity as a mechanism for habit expression is indicated by the observations that these interneurons modulate those specific striatal output properties that correlate with habit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1 and 2</xref>) and show long-lasting changes in excitability after habit learning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D,F</xref>).</p><p>Using opto- and chemo-genetic manipulations, we further found that FSIs, which are GABAergic, enhance activity in subsets of SPNs both in the acute slice and <italic>in vivo</italic>. Although it is unclear what if any relationship exists between the SPN subpopulations identified <italic>ex vivo</italic> versus <italic>in vivo</italic>, there exist multiple intriguing parallels. In the acute slice, only activity of those SPNs which displayed burst-like, multi-action potential responses to single-pulse stimuli (‘high-firing’ SPNs) was suppressed when FSIs were silenced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1D,E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2C</xref>). <italic>In vivo</italic>, the activity of SPNs showing the highest fractions of gamma-frequency spiking was suppressed, instead of disinhibited, when FSI activity was chemogenetically reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). In both cases, the SPNs were distinguished by a higher propensity for burst-like firing patterns. It was further notable that the fraction of SPNs negatively modulated by reduced FSI activity was similar in both preparations (29% <italic>ex vivo</italic> compared to 26% <italic>in vivo</italic>). Conversely, we also found that less-active SPNs were not significantly modulated in the slice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1D,E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2C</xref>) and SPNs with less gamma-frequency spiking were disinhibited <italic>in vivo</italic> when FSI activity was reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). This finding is reminiscent of a previous <italic>in vivo</italic> report that SPNs with weaker responses to cortical microstimulation displayed the most marked disinhibition upon GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor blockade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mallet, 2005</xref>). An important future direction will be to determine whether there are unique biological properties that distinguish the subset of SPNs whose activity is promoted, as opposed to inhibited, by FSIs.</p><p>Although an activity-<italic>promoting</italic> effect of GABAergic FSIs may appear counterintuitive, previous computational (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Humphries et al., 2009</xref>) and biological (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bracci and Panzeri, 2006</xref>) studies describe such a phenomenon based in part on the ‘up’ and ‘down’ resting membrane potential states of SPNs that straddle the chloride reversal potential (E<sub>Cl-</sub>). While a voltage-dependent excitatory effect of GABA would not necessarily affect spike probability due to a concurrent decrease in membrane resistance and the disparity between E<sub>Cl-</sub> and spike threshold, such an effect could boost the glutamate-driven depolarization of an SPN in its down state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Humphries et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bracci and Panzeri, 2006</xref>). Although disynaptic interneuron microcircuitry is a more common mechanism for disinhibitory effects of interneurons in other brain regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wolff et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lovett-Barron et al., 2012</xref>), some of our observations such as the influence of FSIs on SPN initial latency to fire (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>) are not consistent with the time delay necessitated by a disynaptic microcircuitry. For this reason, we instead favor a monosynaptic mechanism whereby properties of SPN resting membrane potential and firing patterns interact to yield activity-promoting effects of FSIs on SPN subsets.</p><p>Based on the previous observation that habit-predictive striatal output properties are relatively uniformly distributed when elicited by strong bulk stimulation of cortical afferents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">O'Hare et al., 2016</xref>), it became apparent that habit-related adaptations of DLS broadly augment the propagation of cortical excitation into the basal ganglia. To confer specificity for certain actions, additional circuit dynamics would ostensibly be required. We hypothesized that such specificity could arise from the activation of subsets of task-specific cortical neuron projections that would in turn activate task-specific SPNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rothwell et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carelli and West, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gremel et al., 2016</xref>). Indeed, recent evidence suggests that spatially-clustered SPN activity encodes information relevant to locomotor behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barbera et al., 2016</xref>). In habits, one possible mechanism then is that task-specific cortical commands drive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Smith et al., 2012</xref>), or at least initiate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berke et al., 2004</xref>), high-frequency firing in a cluster/subset of SPNs that would then be preferentially excited by FSIs. Additionally, in such a mechanism, feed-forward inhibition of less-active SPNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mallet, 2005</xref>) by FSIs might then serve as a selective filter to further enhance signal-to-noise ratio in corticostriatal transmission. One testable prediction of this model is that different behaviors would reveal different subsets of gamma-rich SPNs whose activity is promoted by FSIs.</p><p>Lastly, it is notable that FSIs are also implicated in some pathological settings associated with compulsive behavior. For example, fewer striatal FSIs, as determined by parvalbumin-immunopositivity, have been observed in human brains from individuals with Tourette’s syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kalanithi et al., 2005</xref>) and mouse brains in a model of OCD-like behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burguière et al., 2013</xref>). OCD is highly comorbid in Tourette’s syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sheppard et al., 1999</xref>) and disrupted habit learning has been implicated in pathological compulsivity in a variety of settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Graybiel, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Everitt and Robbins, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gerdeman et al., 2003</xref>). Interestingly, since both of the above studies defined FSIs by parvalbumin immunoreactivity, an intriguing alternative view of those results is that parvalbumin levels are below detection threshold but cell number is not necessarily reduced. Lower parvalbumin levels are associated with a hyperexcitable FSI phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Orduz et al., 2013</xref>), which is akin to the direction of FSI plasticity we associate with habit in the present study. Thus, the finding of increased FSI excitability as a plasticity mechanism driving habitual responding also yields new insights to the potential mechanistic relatedness of habit and compulsion.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>All experiments were carried out under approved animal protocols in accordance with Duke University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee standards.

Due to the sharp FSI cell-attached waveform, electrical noise was matched to the FSI template peak in some recordings. To exclude these false calls, two additional exclusion criteria were added: action potentials were excluded (1) if their amplitudes were less than 10 standard deviations of the recording minus the stimulus artifact, i.e. electrical noise and (2) if their cross-correlation peak amplitudes were less than 25% of the maximum peak in a given sweep.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9-2"><title>Current-clamp experiments</title><p>Action potentials were detected by running a peak detection algorithm (Mathworks Inc.) on voltage velocity data with a peak threshold of 1 × 10<sup>4</sup> V/s and a minimum peak distance of 2 ms.

Action potential and after-hyperpolarization properties were measured up to the point when increasing current injection attenuated firing rate. Action potential half-width was defined as half the time between onset and peak voltage. Action potential amplitude was defined as the voltage difference between the sliding baseline and peak amplitude. AHP potential onset and offset were defined as the next two intersections with the sliding baseline after the action potential peak voltage. AHP amplitude was defined as the negative-most voltage between onset and offset and the AHP waveform was integrated over the sliding baseline for total voltage.

Maximum response duration was defined as the longest period of sustained firing observed during this series of current injections. Rheobase was determined by identifying the 200 pA interval in which the first action potential was fired and subsequently interrogating this interval with 500 ms current injections at 10 pA resolution.

This simulation was run 20 times per single unit. All 20 simulations were binned according to the described frequency band bounds and normalized counts were averaged across simulations. Since each simulated unit corresponded to a real recording with mean firing rate = 1/λ, observed and simulated data were compared via multiple paired t-tests and Bonferroni-Sidak correction for multiple comparisons. For behavioral analysis, 3D tracking data were transformed into Cartesian coordinates (x, y and z) by the Cortex software (MotionAnalysis Corp.) to allow distance calculations.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9-5"><title>2PLSM calcium imaging</title><p>Raw frames were corrected using a drift correction algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Li et al., 2008</xref>) to control for minor fluctuations in X and Y. Baseline fluorescence was measured over a 2 s sliding window to calculate change in fluorescence over baseline (ΔF/F<sub>0</sub>). Action potentials were detected using a cross-correlation approach as described for current clamp and cell-attached recordings above. The template peak was generated by simultaneous calcium imaging and cell-attached electrophysiological experiments and represented a single action potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">O'Hare et al., 2016</xref>). Detected peaks possessed dot-products at least 50% that of a perfect fit (cross-correlating template to itself). Although dSPN and iSPN calcium transients are similar in these experimental conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">O'Hare et al., 2016</xref>), separate template peaks corresponding to the SPN subtype classification of each ROI were used.</p><p>Additional inclusion criteria beyond the cross-correlation threshold were used at the level of event detection, ROI inclusion, and slice inclusion to maximize data quality and reliability. Detected events were included as evoked responses only if they occurred within 375 ms of stimulation- any other events were excluded from analysis. Additionally, a lockout window was set in the peak detection algorithm to ensure that no event could occur within 1 s of the previously detected event. For an ROI to be included, a noise threshold was empirically determined to avoid excessive false event detection: the standard deviation of the ΔF/F<sub>0</sub> signal could not equal or exceed 0.0575. Additionally, ROIs were excluded if fluorescence was saturating, if they had drifted from the scan path such that signal was no longer detected, if they did not respond at least once to a supra-threshold stimulus (1.5 mA) delivered 10 times at the end of the experiment, and if the ratio of non-evoked to evoked events detected at this suprathreshold stimulation intensity was greater than 4.5. These parameters were tested against multiple data sets from simultaneous calcium imaging and cell-attached recording experiments as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">O'Hare et al., 2016</xref>) and were found to create an optimal balance of minimizing false detections and maximizing correct detections. Finally, slices which displayed poor loading, likely due to poor slice health or experimenter error during bulk-loading, were excluded from analysis. Each slice was required to have at least 12 SPNs of each subtype that passed all other exclusion criteria. This criterion was determined by finding the <italic>N</italic> at which coefficient of variation (CV) became a linear function of sample size, i.e. decreased only due to the CV denominator and not undersampling.</p><p>To analyze a pre-post effect within cell, such as wash-in of IEM-1460, only ROIs which were present and passed exclusion criteria both in pre and post recordings were included in analysis (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> for matching ROIs before and after). Thus, drug effect was calculated for each individual cell using an internal baseline. Spike probability was calculated as the fraction of trials in which an evoked response was detected. Amplitude of an evoked calcium transient was calculated as the maximum ΔF/F<sub>0</sub> in the transient waveform. Latency was calculated as the time between stimulus delivery and the time at which the cross-correlation dot-product reached half that of the perfect fit, i.e. the time of peak detection. When calculating dSPN/iSPN ratios, SEM was derived as: <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf2"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>log</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo>⁡</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mover><mml:mrow><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mi>N</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo accent="false">¯</mml:mo></mml:mover><mml:mover><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mi>N</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo accent="false">¯</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:msqrt><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi>C</mml:mi><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>V</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mi>N</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msubsup><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi>C</mml:mi><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>V</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mi>N</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msubsup></mml:mrow><mml:mi>N</mml:mi></mml:mfrac></mml:msqrt></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> . All analysis functions were custom-made in MATLAB unless otherwise noted.</p><p>To classify SPNs as ‘high-firing’ or ‘low-firing’ prior to application of IEM-1460 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), baseline calcium transient amplitudes for each SPN subtype were separated into two clusters according to a Gaussian mixture model (GMM). The effect of IEM-1460 was then calculated separately for ‘high-firing’ and ‘low-firing’ SPNs of each subtype and significance was determined using paired t-tests. In fitting the GMMs for dSPNs and iSPNs, the only user-specified input was the number of clusters (k = 2).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Statistics</title><p>F statistics were calculated using repeated measures analysis of variance. For within-cell comparisons, t statistics were calculated by paired, two-sided t-tests. Otherwise, unpaired, two-sided t-tests were used. For non-normal data sets, Mann-Whitney U tests were used. All r values were obtained using Pearson correlation analyses. Normality was measured using the Kolmogorov-Smirnoff test of the data against a hypothetical normal cumulative distribution function.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor.</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. All involved expressed great interest in your work, but reviewers noted some serious limitations that would require new experiments and/or extensive reanalysis (which were amplified during the consultation session amongst reviewers). We believe would likely require more work than is typical for an invited resubmission to <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>This manuscript aims to uncover the role of striatal FSIs in habit formation. An extensive set of findings from different experimental approaches is presented, including (1) <italic>ex vivo</italic> slice work using cell-attached recordings and 2-photon imaging to examine the physiological changes in FSIs in habitual vs. non-habitual animals, (2) a behavioral study examining the effects of FSI manipulations on behavior, and (3) <italic>in vivo</italic> recordings examining the effects of FSI manipulation on striatal activity. Combining the results from these different experiments, the authors suggest that increased FSI activity accompanies habit formation, which in turn enables a specific set of SPNs to become active.</p><p>An obvious strength of the work is the combination of techniques to provide a truly multimodal perspective on FSI changes. This integrative approach to FSI function is novel and innovative: the in vitro and modeling literature has identified FSIs as powerfully shaping striatal activity, yet not much is known about their functional role <italic>in vivo</italic> and habitual behavior in general. Thus, this work has the potential to provide a major step forward in uncovering the neural substrates of habits, an issue of widespread interest.</p><p>Unfortunately, I found serious issues with most of the individual experiments in the manuscript, most obviously with the <italic>in vivo</italic> recordings and analysis (with which I am most familiar) but also in the other components. I am supportive of the authors' integrative approach in principle, and the conclusions advanced in the manuscript may well turn out to be correct; however, as things stand, there are too many missing controls, confounded analyses, and alternative interpretations for me to have confidence in the conclusions.</p><p>Specifically:</p><p>1) I am most qualified to comment on the <italic>in vivo</italic> recording studies. There are some major flaws in the experimental design (missing controls) and analysis, and as a result there are several possible alternative interpretations. In particular:</p><p>1a) It appears the <italic>in vivo</italic> recording comparison between vehicle and CNO was always run in the same order (vehicle followed by CNO). This introduces an obvious confound that time, or variables correlated with it, mediate some of the observed differences. The authors should control for this by counterbalancing the order across days, doing only one session per day and alternating between CNO and vehicle, or having a washout comparison following the CNO. A less convincing approach that would at least demonstrate awareness of this issue is to fit statistical models that include time as a regressor, using multiple regression (e.g. for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>) – do the drug effects still hold?</p><p>1b) There is no description of what the animals are doing during the recordings. Striatal firing patterns are known to be correlated with behaviors such as grooming, running, and sleep (Berke et al., Neuron 2004; Burguiere et al. Curr Op Neuro 2015). The authors need to make sure that their reported effects are not due to differences in the expression of these behaviors. Were video data collected to rule this out?</p><p>1c) The identification of rhythmic signatures in those SPNs that appear to be most affected by FSI changes is potentially exciting. However, the analysis used (proportion of ISIs) to identify rhythmic activity is flawed and should be replaced by something more appropriate (see below). What the authors are doing is confounded by firing rate: more active neurons are more likely to have ISIs in higher frequency ranges. Thus, the result reported that higher firing rate neurons have more gamma ISIs is expected based on statistical properties alone. To conclude that this reflects a physiological property of interest, the authors need to use either spike-field measures of phase locking (e.g. Bokil et al. J Neurosci 2010) or compare the observed ISI distribution in specific bands to that obtained from a firing rate matched Poisson process (see e.g. Kass et al. Analysis of Neural data book).</p><p>2a) The behavioral part of the paper, on which FSI inhibition with DREADDs results in less habitual behavior, is novel but invites a simpler explanation than that provided by the authors: any disruption of DLS activity would interfere with habitual behavior. This would be consistent with the substantial literature on this from lesion and local infusions (e.g. Packard &amp; McGaugh 1996; Yin et al. 2004).</p><p>2b) Comparing the RRshort and RI groups, it seems there is a difference in total number of lever presses, and potentially in the number of rewards earned (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). The authors should examine if differences in these behavioral measures are correlated with their physiological variables; if they do, that would call into question the interpretation that habit is the key factor here.</p><p>3) I am not an expert on the slice and 2P components of the paper, but here too I have some concerns about controls and interpretation:</p><p>3a) I found it notable that there was no control for time (through counterbalancing or washout). As a result, how can the authors be confident that results like <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> do not simply reflect nonspecific changes over time such as homeostasis?</p><p>3b) If I am understanding correctly how iSPNs were identified – through the absence of DrD1a-tdTomato – this means interneurons including FSIs are included in this category. If this is correct, I don't see how the shift in direct/indirect pathway latency, and other results that claim a difference between dSPN and iSPN groups, are supported by the data. I realize this method is commonplace when you want to make a statement about dSPNs vs iMSNs and have no reason to think anything is changing in FSIs, CINs etc. But in this study we are provided explicit evidence that there are systematic changes happening in FSIs, so there is going to be a clear bias in a measurement that has those in the pool.</p><p>3c) In the IEM-1460 part of the paper, the authors could better motivate their logic about selectivity to FSIs by documenting other work that AMPA receptors in striatal FSIs lack GLuA2 subunits, while SPNs AMPARs have GluA2, and that IEM-1460 does not affect glu signaling in MSNs (most clearly demonstrated by Gittis et al. 2011 JNsci).</p><p>Otherwise their conclusion would seem to require careful voltage-clamp experiments showing the effects of this agent on identified AMPA currents in FSIs and SPNs.</p><p>3d) In the PV-Arch experiments and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> in particular: given that there is an effect of laser on SPN firing, again, how can the authors claim that FSI changes are what underlies their results? I now understand that this is in fact consistent with the mechanism the authors are proposing, but was confused by their use of the term &quot;off-target&quot; which to me seemed to imply that they wanted to verify that their stim affected only FSIs and not SPNs directly – which would be useful to test under synaptic blockage conditions, but that isn't what they actually do. I would find an expanded description in the text helpful.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>The study by O'Hare et al. provides timely evidence for how PV+ FSI in the dorsal striatum influence the activity of direct and indirect SPNs. The authors nicely demonstrate that the key circuit modifications performed by FSI map onto previously described activity patters for habitual-vs-goal directed behaviors. They argue that FSIs undergo plastic changes during habit formation, and influence a subset of SPNs to promote the expression of habitual behavior. I am generally enthusiastic about this study. I thought the manuscript was presented with a logical flow, and easy to understand. The experimental methods and analyses used are OK, and I do not foresee the necessity of additional experimental work.</p><p>General comments:</p><p>The authors provide evidence for acute functional reorganization of the microcircuit upon application of IEM-1460. Specifically, a change in dSPN and iSPN response magnitude and latency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1D, F</xref>). It will be useful to report the actual (ms) change in latency (instead of a log-relative measure) because it will facilitate comparison with other work (including O'Hare et al. Neuron 2016), and to assess if these changes are a result of a delay in dSPN responding or speeding of iSPN response.</p><p>Secondly, it appears that most of the arguments the authors make are essentially boil down to FSIs affecting the activity of a subset of 'high firing' or very active d/ and iSPNs. Despite this recurring observation (in pharmacological, optogenetic, ex-vivo and <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments), the authors do not speculate about the significance of this particular aspect of their results. Concretely, naive slices contain SPN responses that have a distribution of amplitudes (1D) and slices from habitual animals have a large-amplitude, indirect-SPN-delay biased responses. How, exactly, do the authors envision FSI recruitment (or lack thereof) during habit formation or goal directed behaviors shape the naive SPN responses into what is cartoonishly depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>. In other words, I am asking what the authors' framework is for striatal ensamble activity that underlies habit beyond the clear cell-by-cell results they provide.</p><p>It is odd that the authors focus their physiology experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> onwards) to mice that behaved in stereotyped 'habit' or 'goal-directed' ways (shaded blocks in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). I did not notice a justification for this in the text. Is it the case that goal-directed mice in RI group (excluded dots at bottom) exhibited physiological characteristics that were similar to RR group, or alternatively naive mice? How are the cellular physiology results changed if those animals were included? In a previous publication from the group, they combined all mice, and formed a continuous distribution of goal-vs-habit mice.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what now follows is the decision letter after the authors submitted for further consideration.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Striatal fast-spiking interneurons drive habitual behavior&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor, a Reviewing editor, and two reviewers.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>1) In this revision the authors have made several essential clarifications and performed additional control experiments and additional analyses, which have strengthened the study in important respects. Despite these improvements, several experiments in my mind are still missing the correct analyses or controls; details follow below. As before, I am enthusiastic about the integrative approach taken by the authors in combining and synthesizing across multiple experimental approaches. However, I detect an overall tendency to constrain the interpretation of specific experiments by referring to an overall synthesis or working model derived from multiple experiments. As I elaborate on below, for me to have more confidence in the results, I expect the authors to first carefully interpret the results from specific individual experiments in the Results section, without reference to an overall favored working model. Then, they are encouraged (in the Discussion) to come up with a synthesis across experiments. What I think they should avoid is writing parts of the results as if this synthesis has already been shown to be correct. This overall issue is illustrated below, particularly in my response to points 3a and 3b.</p><p>1a) For the order of vehicle and CNO applications, I assumed the worst because there was no mention of session ordering in the original manuscript, and the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> experiments employed a fixed control followed by treatment order (see my comments on this below). The fact that vehicle/CNO treatments were given on separate days and counterbalanced for order is important information that should be included in the Materials and methods, ideally with the table shown in the rebuttal, so that readers can see that in some cases, there were 10+ weeks between the two experiment days.</p><p>1b) The new inclusion of locomotion data, which show similar distance traveled for both groups, is useful and increases confidence in the interpretation of the DREADD experiments.</p><p>1c) I apologize for any confusion that my original description may have caused. My point here is quite simple: what is the evidence that relative gamma ISI density, rather than firing rate, is the relevant variable here? In the rebuttal, the authors provide a figure showing a lack of significant correlation between firing rate and the fraction of gamma-band ISIs. But this does not exclude the possibility that if the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref> would test for a correlation between firing rate (fold change; the quantity plotted on the vertical axis) and baseline firing rate instead of gamma density, the reported correlation would persist. I agree with the points made by the authors that it's entirely possible that low overall firing rates are responsible for the lack of a significant correlation between firing rate and the fraction of gamma-band ISIs, and the Poisson analysis is interesting in its own right (my original suggestion would require a further step: asking if the excess gamma ISI probability predicts firing rate change following CNO). However, these are all indirect points. The most direct way of testing whether invoking gamma ISI density is necessary is to determine if using baseline firing rate yields the same overall result or not. If so, I don't see the need for a more complicated, gamma-ISI related explanation. In the rebuttal, the authors state, &quot;fold change correlated with gamma density, not the rate itself&quot; but I did not see evidence for the latter claim in the manuscript: this needs to be tested and stated explicitly.</p><p>2a) Acknowledging the interpretation that the FSI manipulations performed are in effect a disruption of DLS activity, as the authors do now in the Discussion, is appropriate. However, I believe the authors' suggestion that their work is the first to show an effect of DLS manipulation on the expression (rather than acquisition) of habits is overstated. Packard and McGaugh (1996) performed lidocaine injections in the caudate nucleus following acquisition of a response strategy on a plus maze. Post-training baclofen/muscimol infusions into the DLS reduce habitual lever-pressing for alcohol (2012 Biol Psychiatry, 2016 Frontiers Behav Neuro), and has similar effects on lever pressing for cocaine (Zapata et al. J Neurosci 2010). Thus, for different operationalizations of habit and reinforcer, post-training manipulations of DLS have been shown to affect habitual (but not goal-directed) behavior.</p><p>2b) Great, inclusion of the lever press and total rewards data strengthens the results.</p><p>3a) I appreciate the authors are combining multiple approaches and lines of evidence to converge on a proposed mechanism – this is a strength of the paper. But in this case it's hard to see beyond the most direct way to rule out nonspecific changes related to time, which is simply to counterbalance the order of the treatment and control groups, or to collect washout data. The authors second observation provided is the most relevant in that it does contain a treatment vs. control comparison without the potential time confound, but this is a separate experiment, but low n, where we are not told how its timescale maps on to the main experiment, while leaving open whether the effect shown here underlies the full <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> results. The other observations are more indirect still. Fixing this would require re-doing the experiment. However, if the authors feel strongly that they can argue against this confound, this flaw may be outweighed by intriguing results in other parts of the paper that collectively contribute to an emerging new view of FSI-SPN interactions.</p><p>3b) As with 3a, I note that the authors' style is to make inferences from multiple experiments to converge on an overall explanation. This is admirable and important. However, this does not absolve them of responsibility in accurately describing what can and cannot be concluded from each experiment separately. I do not think it is appropriate to take their proposed overall mechanism and use it as a source of top-down constraints on the initial interpretation of specific, individual experiments. What I want to see is careful descriptions and conclusions for each individual experiment in the Results that appropriately take the limitations of each into account. Then, the authors are encouraged to integrate the results into an overall proposed mechanism, and if they wish, use the resulting synthesis to inform interpretation of specific pieces of data – but not where those experiments and data are first described.</p><p>For this particular point, while it may be true that about 1% of striatal neurons are FSIs, they tend to be highly active, rendering them more likely to be included in recording studies (and, depending on how cells are identified in imaging studies, in those too; see e.g. Harris et al. Nat Nat Neurosci 2016). I agree with the authors that results such as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> are unlikely to result from inadvertent inclusion of a few FSIs because we are shown the full distribution of data points. However for others such as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref> which simply compare means, it seems possible that a few potential FSI outliers could shift the means significantly.</p><p>3c) This additional explanation is helpful.</p><p>3d) Great, this new figure fully addresses my concern.</p><p>4) The comments related to behavior-physiology studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) were circumnavigated. The authors DO report an exclusion criterion, namely; &quot;RRshort-trained mice with NDLPr &lt;0 were considered to be goal-directed…Mice not meeting inclusion criterion were not used…&quot;. But, as part of their conclusions they routinely refer to the task as &quot; habit promoting reinforcement protocol&quot;, and &quot;habit-trained subjects…&quot;. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref> indicates that 4 of 9 mice trained in this task do not engage in a habitual behavior, an insignificant 44% of mice.</p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, the authors exposed mice to the behavioral protocol that already produces ~44% of goal directed behavior, to argue that DREADD manipulation produces robust goal directed behavior.</p><p>So, without a devaluation test before CNO day to assess degree of habit induced, it is hard to accept the claim that CNO promoted less habitual behavior. If the physiological phenotype of the intermediate animals (trained on task, but did not exhibit habitual behavior) were known, I would be more convinced that CNO inactivation of FSI would (at least) shape an incomplete phenotype described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3. I</xref> really think <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> has compelling results, and hope the authors address this concern.</p><p>But as it stands now, I am not fully convinced that the hm4D manipulation produces less habitual behavior. The author could come up with a clever, but robust statistical approach to assess/argue more convincing statistical result. For example if they serially excluded 40% of subjects in both groups, and performed the test, what fraction of the comparisons are significant? Or another formulation of shuffle tests. As I pointed out, a within-subject experiment would have been most ideal; that is each animal (in both PV-hM4D and OV-GFP groups) getting two devaluation sessions with and without CNO. If the authors cannot address this weakness via reanalysis of existing data, I think they will have to demonstrate a more convincing behavioral result with a new cohort of mice.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Striatal fast-spiking interneurons drive habitual behavior&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor, a Reviewing editor (Michael Frank), and one reviewer.</p><p>We have sent the manuscript back to the one reviewer who had more reservations (the other reviewer was largely satisfied in the last round and we determined that you have addressed their remaining issues). The manuscript has been improved but there are now just a few remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined by the reviewer below:</p><p>This resubmission contains several additional control experiments and analyses, which collectively address three major issues identified as remaining after the last round of reviews, with mixed success.

However, pre-CNO firing rate is a numerically better predictor of such changes than excess gamma-band ISIs (r = -0.61 vs -0.45), casting doubt on the relevance of this feature given that a simpler and more predictive measure is available. The authors argue that firing rate &quot;non-specifically&quot; predicts such changes (i.e. for both vehicle and CNO) and that therefore excess gamma-band ISIs (which only predict post-CNO firing rates, but not post-vehicle rates) is an interesting quantity; however, these results could also be interpreted to mean that gamma-band ISIs is simply a worse predictor overall. I could imagine additional analyses, such as a multiple regression, that could help clarify this issue; however, regardless of the specific outcome, any remaining variance explained will likely be low and of unclear relevance. In addition, the authors should be aware that a comparison between two t-tests (one significant, one non-significant) does not constitute sufficient evidence for an interaction (see Nieuwenhuis et al. Nat Neurosci 2011) and report the correct test instead.</p><p>– In order to address the concern that FSIs included in the iSPN dataset (which is defined by the absence of D1R label) may contribute to the effects in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, the authors provide new data suggesting this is unlikely.

In this regard, our findings are stronger than several other high impact studies that only show in vivobehavioral perturbation as evidence for a specific role. Briefly, in addition to eliminating habit by reducing FSI activity, we find that: (1) Pharmacological and optogenetic reduction of FSI activity modulates ex vivostriatal SPN firing properties that correlate with habitual behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) (correlations originally reported in O’Hare et al., 2016). (2) Long‐lasting increases in FSI excitability are found as a consequence of habit learning in mice, in comparison to goal‐directed mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). In the revised Discussion section, we discuss the supporting nature of these data. We think the revised Discussion benefits from discussing this important point, and thank the reviewer for raising it.</p><p>3) An aspect of the novelty of our findings was overlooked.

(2010, Science) found that silencing cholinergic interneurons (CINs) of the nucleus accumbens (NAc) disrupts cocaine conditioning in mice. However, an alternative interpretation exists that a general disruption of NAc activity would yield a similar result. Indeed, in the second‐to‐last paragraph of the main text, the authors note that their result is more similar to that seen from general, less‐specific NAc manipulations relative to studies which chronically ablated CINs:</p><p>“Together, these data demonstrate that selectively inhibiting ChAT interneurons in the NAc with high temporal precision has the overall effect of increasing MSN activity and blocking cocaine conditioning in freely moving mammals. These behavioral results do not support conclusions arising from chronic ablation of the cholinergic interneurons (20); instead they are more consistent with interpretations arising from faster but less cellularly targeted pharmacological modulation in the NAc”.</p><p>In addition, as mentioned in point (3), unlike the above study’s context in cocaine conditioning, our result of a role of DLS in habit expression has not been reported in the literature using less‐specific manipulations, to our knowledge.</p><p>b) A recent study also examining the role of PV+ interneurons in dorsolateral striatum by Lee, et al.

However, we found this not to be the case. In fact, FSIs falling into both modes were found within single goal‐directed subjects.

Instead of a vehicle control to account for the variable of time, we chose to perform two additional ephys experiments because this choice offers the advantage of making the same observations multiple times using orthogonal techniques. When we found an effect of IEM drug, instead of repeating the experiment with vehicle, we opted to pursue more direct electrophysiological measures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) and more specific manipulations (photoinhibition, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) to prospectively test the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> result.</p><p>We believe that these three results combined remove doubt for the potential of the original observation to be an artifact – all three experiments show that FSIs increase evoked SPN responses, and specifically multi‐AP responses, but not unitary.</p><p>We also note that if the above Arch data comparing laser on vs off are presented in a manner analogous to the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> 2PLSM data (laser ON – OFF) shown earlier, the result is strikingly similar – analysis shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig4">Author response image 4</xref> for reviewer’s benefit:</p><fig id="respfig4"><label>Author response image 4.</label><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-26231-resp-fig4-v2"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3b) If I am understanding correctly how iSPNs were identified – through the absence of DrD1a-tdTomato – this means interneurons including FSIs are included in this category. If this is correct, I don't see how the shift in direct/indirect pathway latency, and other results that claim a difference between dSPN and iSPN groups, are supported by the data. I realize this method is commonplace when you want to make a statement about dSPNs vs iMSNs and have no reason to think anything is changing in FSIs, CINs etc. But in this study we are provided explicit evidence that there are systematic changes happening in FSIs, so there is going to be a clear bias in a measurement that has those in the pool.</p> </disp-quote><p>The reviewer again makes an astute point. We had considered this possibility and concluded that it was not a tenable explanation. We relay our thinking here. First, CINs and some FSIs get excluded <italic>a priori</italic> from analysis based on size exclusion criteria we set up in developing the imaging approach initially (O’Hare et al., 2016). In that development phase, we used reporter cell lines to define properties of non‐SPNs and developed exclusion criteria to limit their contamination of the data set. This size criterion is noted in the current manuscript’s Materials and methods section. Second, even without any exclusion criteria, FSIs comprise only 1% of the striatal neurons, therefore, even in the most optimistic setting, the data would have to derive from at most 2‐3 cells among the 52 imaged cells that generated the observation. Such a minor fraction of cells is insufficient to generate the correlations we find (see for example <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Moreover, if the affected cells were FSIs, they should partition unequally between SPN types, predominantly in the “nonDrd1a” iSPN group (see Ade et al., Frontiers Neurosci. 2011), and this is also not the case (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Third, subsequent electrophysiological experiments in SPNs confirmed by their electrophysiological signatures also show the finding, and in both SPN subgroups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3c) In the IEM-1460 part of the paper, the authors could better motivate their logic about selectivity to FSIs by documenting other work that AMPA receptors in striatal FSIs lack GLuA2 subunits, while SPNs AMPARs have GluA2, and that IEM-1460 does not affect glu signaling in MSNs (most clearly demonstrated by Gittis et al. 2011 JNsci).</p> <p>Otherwise their conclusion would seem to require careful voltage-clamp experiments showing the effects of this agent on identified AMPA currents in FSIs and SPNs.</p> </disp-quote><p>The paper that the reviewer alludes to (Gittis et al. 2011 JNsci) was referenced in the original manuscript. In the revision, we further expand this discussion to specifically mention GluA2 receptors.</p><p>Revised manuscript text: “To manipulate FSI activity, the calcium‐permeable AMPA receptor (CP‐AMPAR) antagonist IEM‐1460, which predominantly weakens excitatory synaptic inputs onto FSIs in striatum24, was used. Striatal FSIs express AMPARs lacking the GluA2 subunit, rendering them permeable to calcium 25, whereas SPNs do not typically express CP‐AMPARs. Consistent with this difference in AMPAR subunit expression, IEM‐1460 does not affect excitatory synaptic currents in SPNs but strongly decreases excitatory transmission onto FSIs24.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3d) In the PV-Arch experiments and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> in particular: given that there is an effect of laser on SPN firing, again, how can the authors claim that FSI changes are what underlies their results? I now understand that this is in fact consistent with the mechanism the authors are proposing, but was confused by their use of the term &quot;off-target&quot; which to me seemed to imply that they wanted to verify that their stim affected only FSIs and not SPNs directly – which would be useful to test under synaptic blockage conditions, but that isn't what they actually do. I would find an expanded description in the text helpful.</p> </disp-quote><p>The original manuscript did address this point (copied below).

Specifically, a change in dSPN and iSPN response magnitude and latency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1D, F</xref>). It will be useful to report the actual (ms) change in latency (instead of a log-relative measure) because it will facilitate comparison with other work (including O'Hare et al. Neuron 2016), and to assess if these changes are a result of a delay in dSPN responding or speeding of iSPN response.</p> </disp-quote><p>We thank reviewer #2 for this suggestion. We now include mention of the absolute latency values in the revised. They are primarily informative for showing that both cell types have a trend toward altered latencies in which the effect is slightly greater in the dSPNs. However, we would also like to provide further explanation as to why we find the relative difference in latency more valuable than absolute values. Firstly, absolute values are influenced by electrode position in the brain slice relative to the imaged area, whereas the difference between two populations distributed about the same electrode bypasses that concern. Secondly, the absolute latency values include the superimposition of not only distance from electrode to soma, but also kinetics of calcium dye transients, and time differences related to the location of the cell along the line scan vector. Since all of these factors are consistent between the test and control conditions, significant differences in relative latency can be observed, it is just that the absolute values are of a bit less importance. Nonetheless, we are happy to provide values closer to the primary data and thank you for your interest.</p><p>In the present study, we find that IEM‐1460 did not significantly affect the latency of calcium transients in either SPN subtype; only the relative latency between these two pathways. We observed a non‐significant trend for both pathways to exhibit slower latencies with dSPNs showing a more pronounced delay. These data are now reported in the text and copied below. The finding of a significant effect for relative differences in latency, but not absolute latencies is also consistent with the results from our prior analysis in habit versus goal mice (O’Hare et al., 2016).</p><p>“IEM-1460 also changed the relative latency to fire between direct and indirect pathway SPNs by increasing the pre-existing bias in relative pathway timing whereby iSPNs tend to respond to cortical excitation more quickly than dSPNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>) (mean absolute latency values for dSPNs: 144.03 ± 7.08 ms ACSF, 154.33 ± 7.92 ms IEM-1460, N = 87; iSPNs: 130.31 ± 7.87 ms ACSF, 134.43 ± 8.89 ms IEM- 1460, N = 52).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Secondly, it appears that most of the arguments the authors make are essentially boil down to FSIs affecting the activity of a subset of 'high firing' or very active d/ and iSPNs. Despite this recurring observation (in pharmacological, optogenetic, ex-vivo and in vivo experiments), the authors do not speculate about the significance of this particular aspect of their results. Concretely, naive slices contain SPN responses that have a distribution of amplitudes (1D) and slices from habitual animals have a large-amplitude, indirect-SPN-delay biased responses. How, exactly, do the authors envision FSI recruitment (or lack thereof) during habit formation or goal directed behaviors shape the naive SPN responses into what is cartoonishly depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>. In other words, I am asking what the authors' framework is for striatal ensamble activity that underlies habit beyond the clear cell-by-cell results they provide.</p> </disp-quote><p>We are pleased to learn of the interest in further speculation to address this important point and have added this to Discussion. We initially included speculative interpretation of a number of aspects of how the cellular findings would impact the broader circuitry. Those points are copied below as a reminder.</p><p>From the last paragraph of Results after describing our <italic>in vivo</italic> findings:</p><p>“While FSIs can have an overall strongly inhibitory effect <italic>in vivo</italic> on SPN firing as traditionally assumed, we also found evidence that they potentiate activity in a select population of high-gamma SPNs. This selective potentiation may be akin to a winner-take-all “focusing” mechanism that increases the signal-to-noise ratio in corticostriatal transmission. According to such a mechanism, the subset of recruited SPNs would be facilitated while the less-relevant, low-gamma SPNs would be suppressed.”</p><p>From Discussion paragraph 3:</p><p>“This <italic>in vivo</italic> finding is also consistent with a previous <italic>in vivo</italic> report that SPNs with weaker responses to cortical activity displayed the most marked disinhibition upon GABAA receptor blockade16. While directly comparing the subsets of excited SPNs identified in the slice and <italic>in vivo</italic> would not be technically straightforward, an important future direction will be to determine whether there are unique biological properties that set the excited subset of SPNs apart.”</p><p>From Discussion paragraph 5:</p><p>“Indeed, recent evidence suggests that spatially-clustered SPN activity encodes information relevant to locomotor behavior45. In habits, one possible mechanism then is that task-specific cortical commands drive46, or at least initiate47, high-frequency firing in a cluster/subset of SPNs that would then be preferentially excited by FSIs. Additionally, in such a mechanism, feed-forward inhibition of less-active SPNs16 by FSIs might then serve as a selective filter to further enhance signal-to-noise ratio in corticostriatal transmission. One testable prediction of this model is that different behaviors would reveal different subsets of high-gamma SPNs that are excited by FSIs.”</p><p>Additional discussion of model for how FSIs drive the phenomena depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>:</p><p>“Unexpectedly, we found that the directionality by which FSIs modulated these properties was opposite to our original hypothesis: instead of the expected disinhibition of SPNs, silencing FSIs reduced SPN output (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>‐E). […] In this setting, incoming cortical activity would be predicted to recruit more FSI activity that would in turn drive more firing of SPNs and shift their latencies such that direct pathway SPNs would tend to fire relatively sooner.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is odd that the authors focus their physiology experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> onwards) to mice that behaved in stereotyped 'habit' or 'goal-directed' ways (shaded blocks in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). I did not notice a justification for this in the text. Is it the case that goal-directed mice in RI group (excluded dots at bottom) exhibited physiological characteristics that were similar to RR group, or alternatively naive mice? How are the cellular physiology results changed if those animals were included? In a previous publication from the group, they combined all mice, and formed a continuous distribution of goal-vs-habit mice.</p> </disp-quote><p>The experiments to which the reviewer refers are single cell patch clamp experiments, and as such, the technical and biological variation from 1‐2 whole cell recordings/animal simply do not permit the individual subject correlations that the population 2PLSM imaging data enabled.

Despite these improvements, several experiments in my mind are still missing the correct analyses or controls; details follow below. As before, I am enthusiastic about the integrative approach taken by the authors in combining and synthesizing across multiple experimental approaches. However, I detect an overall tendency to constrain the interpretation of specific experiments by referring to an overall synthesis or working model derived from multiple experiments. As I elaborate on below, for me to have more confidence in the results, I expect the authors to first carefully interpret the results from specific individual experiments in the Results section, without reference to an overall favored working model. Then, they are encouraged (in the Discussion) to come up with a synthesis across experiments. What I think they should avoid is writing parts of the results as if this synthesis has already been shown to be correct. This overall issue is illustrated below, particularly in my response to points 3a and 3b.</p> </disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for bringing this stylistic concern to our attention. We have further modified the manuscript to minimize this. To facilitate a quick re-review, below we extracted the main introductory and conclusion sentences throughout the results, and indicated our edits.</p><p>Conclusion unmodified:</p><p>“These pharmacological experiments in acute brain slices indicate that IEM-1460 promotes an indirect pathway timing advantage and selectively diminishes multi-action potential evoked SPN responses.”</p><p>Conclusion added:</p><p>“This result confirms that IEM-1460, which inhibits FSI firing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), selectively reduces multi-action potential SPN responses to afferent stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>) as suggested by calcium imaging experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>).”</p><p>Unmodified. In our view, this is an important point to discuss at this point in the paper because the results suggest that the sign of the hypothesis is inverted. In this case, we believe that some reference to the overall working hypothesis is necessary to communicate rationale behind subsequent experiments.</p><p>“Altogether, this series of experiments identifies a pharmacological agent that potently inhibits FSI activity and modulates all of the habit-predictive SPN firing properties. These results were surprising for two reasons. First, rather than a blockade of FSI activity causing disinhibition of SPNs as we had hypothesized, we found that when FSI activity was reduced, SPN activity was also reduced. This result suggests that FSI activity is capable of promoting, rather than inhibiting, SPN activity at least in the acute brain slice preparation. Secondly, although IEM-1460 strikingly affected the same features of DLS output that predict the expression of habitual behavior (calcium transient amplitude in both pathways and relative pathway timing) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), the directionality of these effects was opposite in all measures.

My point here is quite simple: what is the evidence that relative gamma ISI density, rather than firing rate, is the relevant variable here? In the rebuttal, the authors provide a figure showing a lack of significant correlation between firing rate and the fraction of gamma-band ISIs. But this does not exclude the possibility that if the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref> would test for a correlation between firing rate (fold change; the quantity plotted on the vertical axis) and baseline firing rate instead of gamma density, the reported correlation would persist. I agree with the points made by the authors that it's entirely possible that low overall firing rates are responsible for the lack of a significant correlation between firing rate and the fraction of gamma-band ISIs, and the Poisson analysis is interesting in its own right (my original suggestion would require a further step: asking if the excess gamma ISI probability predicts firing rate change following CNO). However, these are all indirect points. The most direct way of testing whether invoking gamma ISI density is necessary is to determine if using baseline firing rate yields the same overall result or not. If so, I don't see the need for a more complicated, gamma-ISI related explanation. In the rebuttal, the authors state, &quot;fold change correlated with gamma density, not the rate itself&quot; but I did not see evidence for the latter claim in the manuscript: this needs to be tested and stated explicitly.</p> </disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this point of clarification, and believe we now address it. As the reviewer suspects, in the analyses below, we do find that it is specifically the “excess gamma probability” that differentiates CNO response from vehicle and not a phenomenon related solely to firing rate.

Additionally, we found that SPNs fire significantly more gamma-frequency spikes than expected by Poisson processes matched to firing rate (pre-CNO: t(44) = 5.76, p = 7.67 x 10<sup>-7</sup>, n = 23 SPNs &amp; rate-matched simulations; pre-vehicle: t(38) = 8.24, p = 5.59 x 10<sup>-10</sup>, n = 20 SPNs &amp; rate-matched simulations). Whereas baseline firing rates non-specifically predict fold change in firing rate after both CNO and vehicle injection (CNO: r(22) = -0.61, p = 0.0022, n = 23; vehicle: r(19) = -0.45, p = 0.045, n = 20), the excess probability of gamma-frequency ISIs (observed – expected) specifically predicts rate modulation after CNO (r(22) = -0.52, p = 0.011, n = 23) but not vehicle (r(19) = 0.045, p = 0.85, n = 20). Therefore, gamma-frequency spiking represents a feature of interest in SPNs that predicts whether these output neurons will fire more or less as a consequence of reducing FSI activity.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2a) Acknowledging the interpretation that the FSI manipulations performed are in effect a disruption of DLS activity, as the authors do now in the Discussion, is appropriate. However, I believe the authors' suggestion that their work is the first to show an effect of DLS manipulation on the expression (rather than acquisition) of habits is overstated. Packard and McGaugh (1996) performed lidocaine injections in the caudate nucleus following acquisition of a response strategy on a plus maze. Post-training baclofen/muscimol infusions into the DLS reduce habitual lever-pressing for alcohol (2012 Biol Psychiatry, 2016 Frontiers Behav Neuro), and has similar effects on lever pressing for cocaine (Zapata et al. J Neurosci 2010). Thus, for different operationalizations of habit and reinforcer, post-training manipulations of DLS have been shown to affect habitual (but not goal-directed) behavior.</p> </disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing these studies out. We very much wish to frame our findings accurately within the field and have modified our conclusions by deleting this point in the manuscript and including the earliest of the above-mentioned citations, copied below:</p><p>“…In the present study, by chemogenetically inhibiting PV+ interneurons <italic>in vivo</italic>, we found that FSI activity in DLS is required for the expression of a learned habit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>); an automated, reward-insensitive behavior quite different from behaviors previously studied. Previous pharmacological inactivation studies have demonstrated a role for DLS in habit expression42, 43, indicating that general disruption of DLS activity also impairs established habitual behavior. Interestingly, in the present study, chemogenetic inhibition of FSI activity drove an overall increase in projection neuron activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>) which suggests that reducing FSI activity specifically may impair habit expression differently than a general inactivation of the circuitry.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2b) Great, inclusion of the lever press and total rewards data strengthens the results.</p> <p>3a) I appreciate the authors are combining multiple approaches and lines of evidence to converge on a proposed mechanism – this is a strength of the paper. But in this case it's hard to see beyond the most direct way to rule out nonspecific changes related to time, which is simply to counterbalance the order of the treatment and control groups, or to collect washout data. The authors second observation provided is the most relevant in that it does contain a treatment vs. control comparison without the potential time confound, but this is a separate experiment, but low n, where we are not told how its timescale maps on to the main experiment, while leaving open whether the effect shown here underlies the full <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> results. The other observations are more indirect still. Fixing this would require re-doing the experiment. However, if the authors feel strongly that they can argue against this confound, this flaw may be outweighed by intriguing results in other parts of the paper that collectively contribute to an emerging new view of FSI-SPN interactions.</p> </disp-quote><p>For technical reasons, a counter balance or washout design is not possible due to kinetics of drug action in the brain slice (approx. 20 minutes to take effect) and loss of Fura-2 signal with time. We have piloted a second approach to address this reasonable point, in which we perform group-wise comparisons to complement the original within-cell design. Slices are pre-incubated in vehicle or IEM drug prior to recording evoked calcium transients on the 2PLSM.</p><p>These new and confirmatory results are now described in the manuscript:</p><p>“Because the within-cell experimental design of measuring effects before and after IEM-1460 application did not exclude the possibility that changes in calcium signals occurred during the 20-minute wash-in period independently of IEM-1460, we performed a separate across-group study. Brain slices were incubated with either IEM-1460 or vehicle prior to and during imaging. Group mean calcium transient amplitudes were lower in IEM-1460 relative to vehicle in both dSPNs (vehicle: 0.043 ± 0.0011 ΔF/F0, N = 202 cells; IEM-1460: 0.037 ± 0.0021 ΔF/F0, N = 72 cells; t(272) = 2.62, p = 0.0093) and iSPNs (vehicle: 0.040 ± 0.0014 ΔF/F0, N = 143 cells; IEM-1460: 0.033 ± 0.0011 ΔF/F0, N = 56 cells; t(197) = 2.93, p = 0.0038) and IEM-1460-treated slices showed a preference for faster indirect pathway activation relative to vehicle-treated slices (t(197) = 3.83, p = 1.41 x 10<sup>-7</sup>, N = 143 &amp; 56 independent dSPN/iSPN pairs).

This is admirable and important. However, this does not absolve them of responsibility in accurately describing what can and cannot be concluded from each experiment separately. I do not think it is appropriate to take their proposed overall mechanism and use it as a source of top-down constraints on the initial interpretation of specific, individual experiments. What I want to see is careful descriptions and conclusions for each individual experiment in the Results that appropriately take the limitations of each into account. Then, the authors are encouraged to integrate the results into an overall proposed mechanism, and if they wish, use the resulting synthesis to inform interpretation of specific pieces of data – but not where those experiments and data are first described.</p> </disp-quote><p>As above, we reviewed the manuscript for this stylistic concern and believe we have achieved this goal.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>For this particular point, while it may be true that about 1% of striatal neurons are FSIs, they tend to be highly active, rendering them more likely to be included in recording studies (and, depending on how cells are identified in imaging studies, in those too; see e.g. Harris et al. Nat Nat Neurosci 2016). I agree with the authors that results such as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> are unlikely to result from inadvertent inclusion of a few FSIs because we are shown the full distribution of data points. However for others such as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref> which simply compare means, it seems possible that a few potential FSI outliers could shift the means significantly.</p></disp-quote><p>We understand the reviewer’s continued concern and include new data explicitly testing the degree to which FSI activity is captured by our activity imaging approach.

We found that, using our Fura cell loading and data analysis conditions, evoked firing activity was detected in 50% of the total transgenically reported FSIs. We further found that while increasing stimulation intensity can increase FSI spike probability, we did not see a significant increase of the calcium transient amplitude. This observation is consistent with our unpublished observations that FSIs rarely burst fire under our electrical afferent stimulation and recording conditions. Both of these empiric observations indicate that FSI contamination is not a source of our present study’s main findings (i.e. we find modulation of amplitude but not spike probability).

The authors DO report an exclusion criterion, namely; &quot;RRshort-trained mice with NDLPr &lt;0 were considered to be goal-directed…Mice not meeting inclusion criterion were not used…&quot;. But, as part of their conclusions they routinely refer to the task as &quot; habit promoting reinforcement protocol&quot;, and &quot;habit-trained subjects…&quot;. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref> indicates that 4 of 9 mice trained in this task do not engage in a habitual behavior, an insignificant 44% of mice.</p> </disp-quote><p>We have re-read our original reviewer response and do not understand what aspect we “circumnavigated”.

We clarified by stating that we never recorded from these mice and excluded them <italic>a priori</italic>. We could not evaluate the relationship of physiology across a behavioral continuum in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> because single cell recording variation is underpowered relative to our population-based calcium transient data presented in O’Hare et al., 2016. Secondly, we did not exclude any mice in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, the chemogenetic behavior experiment except for those with no detectable viral expression.</p><p>We fully agree and believe that we acknowledge in the manuscript that RI training does not produce total insensitivity to outcome devaluation in 100% of subjects.

If the physiological phenotype of the intermediate animals (trained on task, but did not exhibit habitual behavior) were known, I would be more convinced that CNO inactivation of FSI would (at least) shape an incomplete phenotype described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3.

The 9 mice cohort in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> is not appropriate to generalize about the effectiveness of RI reinforcement in driving habitual behavior. To better determine the effects of RI reinforcement, we have now analyzed the data from every mouse that we have trained on this reinforcement schedule (N = 59) and found that RI-trained mice display a mean NDLP<sub>r</sub> of 0.052 ± 0.13.</p><p>More importantly, behavioral results vary between cohorts for a number of reasons having to do with animal housing conditions and subtle differences in training conditions and trainer (see Sorge, et al. 2014 Nature Methods for a recent example).</p><fig id="respfig9"><label>Author response image 9.</label><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-26231-resp-fig9-v2"/></fig><p>The variance of the data, from 59 RI-trained mice across 8 different experiments, is 1.06. However, when variance is measured within-group, variance is significantly lower (0.86), consistent with our observations that within training cohort are the best comparators. In addition, the aforementioned concern of the poor rate of instantiating habitual behavior refers to one of our weakest habit-inducing cohorts. For these reasons, we remain convinced that it is most appropriate to compare an experimental group to a contemporaneous control group rather than one produced separately in time, as we have done in this study.</p><p>Nevertheless, for the reviewer’s benefit, even when we compare the PV-hM4D mice to all 59 historical data points, we see a nearly significant difference whereas control PV-eYFP mice are more similar to unmodified RI-trained mice:</p><fig id="respfig10"><label>Author response image 10.</label><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-26231-resp-fig10-v2"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>But as it stands now, I am not fully convinced that the hm4D manipulation produces less habitual behavior. The author could come up with a clever, but robust statistical approach to assess/argue more convincing statistical result. For example if they serially excluded 40% of subjects in both groups, and performed the test, what fraction of the comparisons are significant? Or another formulation of shuffle tests. As I pointed out, a within-subject experiment would have been most ideal; that is each animal (in both PV-hM4D and OV-GFP groups) getting two devaluation sessions with and without CNO.

However, pre-CNO firing rate is a numerically better predictor of such changes than excess gamma-band ISIs (r = -0.61 vs -0.45), casting doubt on the relevance of this feature given that a simpler and more predictive measure is available. The authors argue that firing rate &quot;non-specifically&quot; predicts such changes (i.e. for both vehicle and CNO) and that therefore excess gamma-band ISIs (which only predict post-CNO firing rates, but not post-vehicle rates) is an interesting quantity; however, these results could also be interpreted to mean that gamma-band ISIs is simply a worse predictor overall. I could imagine additional analyses, such as a multiple regression, that could help clarify this issue; however, regardless of the specific outcome, any remaining variance explained will likely be low and of unclear relevance. In addition, the authors should be aware that a comparison between two t-tests (one significant, one non-significant) does not constitute sufficient evidence for an interaction (see Nieuwenhuis et al. Nat Neurosci 2011) and report the correct test instead.</p> </disp-quote><p>Per Nieuwenhuis et al. “When making a comparison between two correlations, researchers should directly contrast the two correlations using an appropriate statistical method”.

Secondly, we found that SPN modulation by CNO was not predicted better by baseline firing rates than baseline gamma density. And thirdly, we found that baseline firing rates also do not predict SPN modulation by CNO specifically, but rather baseline firing rate correlates with rate modulation equally well for both CNO and VEH.</p><p>(N.B.

At a minimum the authors need to discuss this possible confound in the manuscript, and ideally include the data shown in a supplementary Figure.</p> </disp-quote><p>As requested, we now include discussion on interneuron contamination of datasets in the manuscript and the 2PLSM FSI data as a new supplementary figure.</p><p>“Contamination of dSPN and iSPN datasets by interneurons was minimized by selection criteria and monitoring datasets for outliers (See Materials and methods for further details).”</p><p>“Classifying regions of interest: Regions of interest (ROIs) showing red and green were classified as dSPNs whereas green-only ROIs were classified as iSPNs.

FSIs comprise approximately 1% of all striatal neurons and are not present in the Drd1a-TdTomato labelled population. However, FSIs might be included in the “putative iSPN” population.
