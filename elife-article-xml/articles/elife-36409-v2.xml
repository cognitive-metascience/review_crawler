secretion, and body heat control. TRPM2 is activated by cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup>, phosphatidyl-inositol-4,5-bisphosphate and ADP ribose. Here, we present the ~3 Å resolution electron cryo-microscopic structure of TRPM2 from <italic>Nematostella vectensis</italic>, 63% similar in sequence to human TRPM2, in the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-bound closed state. Compared to other TRPM channels, TRPM2 exhibits unique structural features that correlate with its function. The pore is larger and more negatively charged, consistent with its high Ca<sup>2+</sup> selectivity and larger conductance. The intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding sites are connected to the pore and cytosol, explaining the unusual dependence of TRPM2 activity on intra- and extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>. In addition, the absence of a post-filter motif is likely the cause of the rapid inactivation of human TRPM2. Together, our cryo-EM and electrophysiology studies provide a molecular understanding of the unique gating mechanism of TRPM2.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cryo-EM</kwd><kwd>patch-clamp</kwd><kwd>ion channel</kwd><kwd>structure-function</kwd><kwd>gating</kwd><kwd>permeation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>Xenopus</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>International Early Career Scientist grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Csanády</surname><given-names>László</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003825</institution-id><institution>Magyar Tudományos Akadémia</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Lendület grant LP2017-14/2017</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Csanády</surname><given-names>László</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001312</institution-id><institution>Charles H.

Despite a high degree of sequence conservation within the subfamily, its eight members are involved in a multitude of biological processes, and are regulated by diverse stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kraft and Harteneck, 2005</xref>). TRPM2 plays key roles in migration and chemokine production of immune cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yamamoto et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Knowles et al., 2011</xref>), insulin secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Uchida et al., 2011</xref>), and body heat control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Song et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tan and McNaughton, 2016</xref>). Under pathological conditions such as stroke and myocardial infarction TRPM2 activity leads to apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nilius et al., 2007</xref>), and genetic linkage studies strongly suggest its involvement in the development of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Parkinsonism Dementia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hermosura et al., 2008</xref>), and bipolar disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">McQuillin et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Xu et al., 2006</xref>). TRPM2 is therefore an emerging therapeutic target for chronic inflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases, diabetes, and hyperinsulinism.</p><p>TRPM2 is a Ca<sup>2+</sup> permeable non-selective cation channel opened by simultaneous binding of three obligate co-activators, cytosolic ADP-ribose (ADPR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Perraud et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sano et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hara et al., 2002</xref>), Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Csanády and Töröcsik, 2009</xref>), and membrane phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP<sub>2</sub>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tóth and Csanády, 2012</xref>). The location of the binding sites for activating Ca<sup>2+</sup> are debated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">McHugh et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Starkus et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Csanády and Töröcsik, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kühn et al., 2015</xref>), and regulation by Ca<sup>2+</sup> and PIP<sub>2</sub> are interrelated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tóth and Csanády, 2012</xref>) through a mechanism which is not understood.</p><p>Similarly to other TRPM subfamily channels, homotetrameric TRPM2 channels contain an ~800 residue N-terminal region, a transmembrane domain (TMD), a TRP domain, and a coiled-coil. In TRPM2 a C-terminal ~270 residue NUDT9-homology (NUDT9H) domain serves to bind ADPR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Perraud et al., 2001</xref>). So far, high-resolution structures are available only for TRPM4 and TRPM8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Guo et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Autzen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Winkler et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yin et al., 2018</xref>). TRPM2 and TRPM4 are both activated by cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup>. However, as TRPM4 is monovalent selective, its activation requires a nearby Ca<sup>2+</sup> source, such as a co-localized Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Launay et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kraft and Harteneck, 2005</xref>). In contrast, TRPM2 is itself Ca<sup>2+</sup> permeable, which provides a unique mechanism for positive feedback (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Perraud et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Csanády and Töröcsik, 2009</xref>). Furthermore, low micromolar ATP, ADP, and AMP inhibit TRPM4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nilius et al., 2004</xref>), but do not affect TRPM2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sano et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tóth and Csanády, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Moreau et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Here, we determined the structure of the TRPM2 channel from the cnidarian <italic>Nematostella vectensis</italic> (nvTRPM2) in complex with Ca<sup>2+</sup> by electron cryo-microscopy (cryo-EM), at a resolution of 3.1 Å, and correlated the structure with detailed biophysical characterization of channel permeation and gating properties. Although the global architecture of nvTRPM2 is similar to that of TRPM4, distinct local structural features provide explanations for permeation and gating properties that are unique to TRPM2, in particular to its regulation by intra- and extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> as well as by PIP<sub>2</sub>.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Basic functional properties of nvTRPM2</title><p>The nvTRPM2 protein shows ~63% sequence similarity (34% sequence identity) with human TRPM2 (hTRPM2), and when expressed in mammalian cells, it forms functional channels opened by cytosolic ADPR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kühn et al., 2015</xref>). Because of the limitations associated with controlling and altering cytosolic ligand concentrations in whole-cell recordings, we expressed nvTRPM2 channels in <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> oocytes, and studied their biophysical properties in inside-out cell-free patches, under rapid continuous superfusion of the cytosolic membrane surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <italic>colored bars</italic>). In the absence of extracellular (pipette) Ca<sup>2+</sup> ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> buffered to ~1 nM), large macroscopic nvTRPM2 currents could be activated by superfusion of the cytosolic patch surface with ADPR (<italic>black bars</italic>, 100 μM) and Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<italic>gray bars</italic>, 40 μM). ADPR and intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> acted as obligate co-activators, as addition of both ligands was required to open, whereas removal of either ligand was sufficient to close the channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Although nvTRPM2 current elicited by saturating ADPR + Ca<sup>2+</sup>was only modestly (by 10–20%) enhanced upon exposure to exogenous PIP<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <italic>left blue bar</italic>), it was almost completely abolished when membrane PIP<sub>2</sub> headgroups were masked with polylysine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <italic>red bar</italic>), but could then be fully recovered by addition of exogenous PIP<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <italic>right blue bar</italic>). Thus, PIP<sub>2</sub> is also essential for nvTRPM2 activity, but is tightly bound, so that the channels remain close-to-saturated even at the low PIP<sub>2</sub> concentration of an inside-out patch. All in all, gating regulation by ADPR, Ca<sup>2+</sup>, and PIP<sub>2</sub> of nvTRPM2 is very similar to that of hTRPM2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tóth and Csanády, 2012</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36409.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Basic functional properties of the <italic>Nematostella vectensis</italic> (nv) TRPM2 channel.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Macroscopic inward Na<sup>+</sup> currents in an inside-out patch excised from a <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> oocyte overexpressing nvTRPM2, evoked by superfusion of the cytoplasmic patch surface with 100 μM ADPR (<italic>black bar</italic>) plus 40 μM free Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<italic>gray bars</italic>); extracellular (pipette) [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] was ~1 nM, membrane potential was −20 mV.

The bottom tier contains the NTDs, the ARDs, and the CCs. Through extensive interactions of the NTDs with the ARD of both the same (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4A</xref>) and of the adjacent subunit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4B</xref>), these domains assemble into a square ring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, <italic>Bottom tier</italic>) which accommodates the CC helix at its center (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Apart from a salt bridge between R154 in the NTD and D1207 in the CC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4A</xref>) there is little contact between the latter two domains. The middle tier contains the LHDs, the TRP loops, and the stretcher helices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E–F</xref>). Relative to the TRPM4 structures two extra helices (LH13 and LH14, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>) are clearly resolved in the LHDs of nvTRPM2. Intersubunit interactions of LH13 with the LHD and N-terminal loop of the adjacent subunit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4B</xref>) assemble the four LHDs into a second square ring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, <italic>Middle tier;</italic> Figure 5A, bottom). Descending from the top layer, the TRP loop embraces the LHD ring from the periphery, and continues into the stretcher helix. Below the LHD ring, intimately connected to the latter, the four stretcher helices converge into the central CC, like the stretchers of an umbrella into its shaft (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2E</xref> and 5A, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref> <italic>pink</italic> and <italic>purple</italic>). Extensive intrasubunit interactions of the LHDs with TRP helix 1 and the pre-S1 helix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4A</xref>) connect the middle tier to the top tier, whereas the tight turn between the stretcher and CC helices provides a direct link between the middle and bottom tiers. The top tier is formed by the Pre-S1 helices, the transmembrane domain, and TRP helices 1 and 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E–F</xref>). The structure of the transmembrane VSLD (S1-S4, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E–F</xref>, <italic>yellow</italic>) and PD (S5-S6, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E–F</xref>, <italic>green</italic>) resembles that of other voltage-gated cation channels, and the VSLD is domain-swapped relative to the PD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). However, the S4 segment contains only two conserved arginines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>, <italic>blue boxes</italic>), and extensive hydrophobic interactions between the S4 and S5 helices of adjacent subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4B</xref>), similar to those observed in TRPM4, make large translational movements within the VSLD unlikely. TRP helix 1, which contains the conserved TRP box motif, is a cytosolic extension of helix S6. Due to a sharp bend at the end of S6, TRP helix 1 runs parallel to the membrane, packed against the cytosolic surface of transmembrane helices S1, S2, and S5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4A</xref>), from the center of the protein towards its periphery, where the hydrophobic TRP helix 2 reenters the membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, <italic>red</italic>). At the periphery of the top layer a tight interaction hub is formed between the short Pre-S1 helix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, <italic>orange</italic>) and helices 12 and 13 of the LHD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4A</xref>).</p><p>Consistent with the high sequence conservation within the TRPM subfamily (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>), the overall architecture of nvTRPM2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D–E</xref>) resembles that of TRPM4 and TRPM8. However, there are important structural differences that correlate with the different regulatory mechanisms of these channels. For example, in TRPM4, a high-affinity nucleotide binding site for inhibitory ATP, ADP, and AMP is located at the interface between the NTD and the ARD of the neighboring subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Guo et al., 2017</xref>). In nvTRPM2 the five long intertwined loops that build this surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref>, <italic>NTD, right surface</italic> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4B</xref>, <italic>inset 3</italic>) are differently arranged, contain an extra β strand (β7b, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4B</xref>, <italic>inset 3</italic>), and lack residues important for nucleotide binding, explaining insensitivity of TRPM2 to these nucleotides. Relative domain positioning is also significantly different in nvTRPM2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref>). When viewed from the extracellular side, the ring formed by the four NTDs is rotated counterclockwise in nvTRPM2 relative to TRPM4 but clockwise relative to TRPM8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref>, <italic>Tetramer</italic>): when the pore domains of the three channels are superimposed, the displacement is 13–18 Å at the level of the NTDs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref>, <italic>Subunit</italic>). Within the limitations of its lower resolution, the TRPM8 structure seems the least similar to TRPM4 and nvTRPM2, with a substantially different arrangement of its C-terminal helices relative to the transmembrane domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref>, <italic>TM-Stretcher-CC</italic>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Ion channel pore</title><p>The PD is formed by helix S5, the turret loop, the pore helix, the filter, a short post-filter helix, a post-filter loop (‘outer pore loop’), and helix S6.

The selectivity filter is short and wide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), the diameter at its narrowest point is ~5.2 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), larger than that of TRPM4 (~4.2 Å). Such a large diameter is consistent with functional properties of the hTRPM2 pore which permeates tetramethyl-ammonium (~5.8 Å) but not N-methyl-D-glucosamine (~6.8 Å) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tóth and Csanády, 2012</xref>), and suggests that the TRPM2 filter allows hydrated ions to pass. The nvTRPM2 filter is lined by the backbone atoms of Y1035 and G1036, and the side chain of E1037 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). A sausage-like density is observable in the filter, which probably represents two possible positions of a cation, coordinated by the 1035–1036 peptide carbonyl groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). These two ions, and a third cation in the central cavity, were modeled as Na<sup>+</sup>, the predominant cation in the buffer. E1037 in nvTRPM2 is replaced by a glutamine in hTRPM2, hTRPM4, and hTRPM5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>, <italic>green box</italic>). This sequence difference might underlie the much larger Ca<sup>2+</sup> preference of the nvTRPM2 pore. Indeed, the relative permeability for Ca<sup>2+</sup> versus Na<sup>+</sup> (p<sub>Ca</sub>/p<sub>Na</sub>), estimated from the reversal potential of unitary currents under biionic conditions, is ~35 for nvTRPM2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>, <italic>black</italic>), as opposed to ~0.45 for hTRPM2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>, <italic>blue</italic>, replotted from [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tóth and Csanády, 2012</xref>]), and ~0 for hTRPM4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Launay et al., 2002</xref>) and hTRPM5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Liu and Liman, 2003</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36409.009</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Pore of the nvTRPM2 channel.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Ribbon representation of the ion pore, front and rear subunits are removed for clarity.

It is also substantially narrower (diameter 10.0 Å) than that of TRPM4 (16.6 Å, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B–C</xref>), because the shorter outer pore loop of nvTRPM2 (residues 1045–1055) flips towards the pore (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>), stabilized by a salt bridge between K1047 and E1042 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, <italic>blue side chains</italic>). Crowding of four times four acidic residues in the tight external vestibule results in a larger negative surface charge density in nvTRPM2 compared to TRPM4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). The shape and surface electrostatics of the internal vestibule of TRPM family channels is also diverse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B,D</xref>): the nvTRPM2 internal vestibule is tighter (diameter 4.7 Å) than that of TRPM4 (8.5–13 Å), and also much more negative, due to the presence of N1086 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>), E1090 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>), and E1094 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Two of these residues are conserved in hTRPM2, but only one in TRPM8, and none of the three in TRPM4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>, <italic>pink boxes</italic>).</p><p>The larger pore diameter and the larger negative surface charge density in both vestibules of nvTRPM2 likely account for its larger throughput rate for cations: in symmetrical 144 mM Na<sup>+</sup>, at negative voltages, unitary conductance approaches ~ 150 pS for nvTRPM2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>, <italic>black</italic>; note block of outward currents by internal 125 μM Ca<sup>2+</sup>), as compared to ~25 pS for TRPM4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Launay et al., 2002</xref>). Human TRPM2 also has a large pore diameter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tóth and Csanády, 2012</xref>), but lacks the two acidic residues in the post-filter helix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>, inset, <italic>red box</italic>), and one acidic residue in the internal vestibule. These differences likely account for its intermediate conductance (~50 pS in symmetrical 144 mM Na<sup>+</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>, <italic>blue</italic>) between TRPM4 and nvTRPM2. Indeed, inserting one or two negative charges into the external vestibule of hTRPM2 increased its conductance to ~72 pS, without much effecting relative Ca<sup>2+</sup> permeability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tóth and Csanády, 2012</xref>). Of note, inward unitary current of nvTRPM2 in the presence of 12 mM external Ca<sup>2+</sup> as the only permeating cation approached −10 pA at negative voltages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>, <italic>black symbols</italic>), which exceeds the throughput rate expected for a diffusion-limited channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hille, 1992</xref>). This is a clear indication that, due to its negative surface, the local concentration of Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions in the outer vestibule is far higher than that in the bulk solution. Interestingly, an outermost filter binding site formed by a ring of four carboxylates, and additional negative ‘recruitment sites’ in the outer vestibule, are also present in the highly Ca<sup>2+</sup>-selective TRPV6 channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Saotome et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Loss of the LDE motif was suggested to be responsible for the fast inactivation of hTRPM2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>, <italic>top</italic>, <italic>left</italic>), because its reintroduction abolished rundown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>, <italic>bottom left</italic>, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tóth and Csanády, 2012</xref>]). Consistent with that interpretation, nvTRPM2, which contains this motif, does not inactivate over the time course of an hour (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>, <italic>top</italic>, <italic>right</italic>), but replacing the native LDE triplet with a ‘human-like’ GY doublet results in clear rundown (time constant 2–3 min; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>, <italic>bottom</italic>, <italic>right</italic>). Thus, the presence and proper positioning of D1041 and E1042 seems important for stabilization of the nvTRPM2 pore, but the E1042-K1047 salt bridge is not essential, because its disruption by mutations K1047A or K1047E does not result in rundown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). Possibly, inactivation is prevented by charge repulsion between the LDE motifs, as suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tóth and Csanády, 2012</xref>). Because inactivation is not an intrinsic property of nvTRPM2, its transient activation in intact cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kühn et al., 2015</xref>) must reflect some secondary effect caused by cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> accumulation, such as PIP<sub>2</sub> hydrolysis by phospholipase C and/or pore block (cf., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, below).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36409.013</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>The nvTRPM2 Ca<sup>2+</sup>binding site.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding site is located close to the inner leaflet of the membrane.

Because that diameter is too small to allow passage of a water molecule, the observed nvTRPM2 conformation must correspond to a closed gate, as expected in the absence of ADPR. Additionally, S6 shows an α- to π-helix transition in the middle (residues 1073–1077). In TRPV6, for which both open- and closed-state structures have been solved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">McGoldrick et al., 2018</xref>), S6 is α-helical in the closed state, but in the open state the short π helical break induces a kink and a rotation of the S6 inner segment around a ‘gating hinge’ alanine (A566), which opens the inner gate. Interestingly, the π-helical break in S6 is a common feature seen in most reported TRP channel structures, except for TRPV2 and TRPV6 in the closed state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>), and even the gating-hinge alanine is conserved in some TRPM family members such as TRPM1, TRPM3, and TRPM4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Guo et al., 2017</xref>). However, although the solved structures of TRPM4 are closed, the corresponding region of S6 is π-helical (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). Thus, unlike for TRPV6, gate opening in TRPM channels is probably not triggered by the α- to π-helix transition of S6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">McGoldrick et al., 2018</xref>), but likely resembles opening of TRPV1, in which the S6 bundle crossing opens via direct expansion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cao et al., 2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding site</title><p>Although the nvTRPM2 structure was obtained in the presence of trace amounts of Ca<sup>2+</sup> (free Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration in an unbuffered saline with no added Ca<sup>2+</sup> is in the micromolar range, for example, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Csanády and Adam-Vizi, 2003</xref>]), clear density for a bound Ca<sup>2+</sup> ion is seen, occluded into each subunit. The Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding site, formed by the cytosolic ends of transmembrane helices S2 and S3, and the S2-S3 linker helix, is located at the membrane-cytosol interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–C</xref>), and is accessible from the protein surface through a narrow opening (‘<italic>peripheral tunnel</italic>’; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, <italic>arrow</italic>). The bound Ca<sup>2+</sup> ion is coordinated by the side chains of residues E893 and Q896 of S2 and N918 and D921 of S3 in a pentacovalent geometry, E893 provides two coordinate bonds to the ion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).

It also forms a hydrogen bond with the side chain of Q896, keeping the latter properly oriented for Ca<sup>2+</sup> coordination. These five residues are conserved between TRPM2, 4, 5 and 8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>, <italic>orange boxes</italic>), and the geometry of Ca<sup>2+</sup> coordination in nvTRPM2 resembles that seen in the Ca<sup>2+</sup> bound structure of hTRPM4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Autzen et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Compared to hTRPM2, macroscopic nvTRPM2 channel currents show a somewhat higher apparent affinity for activation by cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, <italic>left</italic>); a reduction of inward macroscopic current by millimolar cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, <italic>right</italic>) reflects a reduction in unitary current amplitude due to pore block (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>).

Truncating any of the five conserved side chains involved in Ca<sup>2+</sup> coordination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>) profoundly affected channel activity. The Q896A, N918A, and D921A nvTRPM2 mutants generated functional channels, but in each case current activation required larger free cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G–I</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4K</xref>, <italic>left</italic>), reporting a dramatic loss of Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity. Correcting for the dose-dependent reduction in unitary current amplitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>) allowed calculation of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependence of open probabilities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4K</xref>, <italic>right</italic>). Estimated K<sub>1/2</sub> for channel activation was ~40 μM for Q896A, whereas for N918A and D921A open probability failed to saturate even at 1250 μM (K<sub>1/2</sub> &gt;1 mM). The E1110A mutant displayed a more modest reduction in apparent Ca<sup>2+</sup> affinity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4K</xref>, <italic>green bars</italic>; K<sub>1/2</sub> ~12 μM), consistent with the less direct involvement of the E1110 side chain in Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). In contrast, E893A channels failed to open even in the presence of millimolar cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup>, underscoring the exquisite importance of this residue in Ca<sup>2+</sup> coordination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, the Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding site mutants were all robustly stimulated by PIP<sub>2</sub>: in contrast to wild-type (WT) channel currents that were stimulated only by 10–20% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), the currents for the mutants were enhanced by up to 20-fold upon PIP<sub>2</sub> addition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G–J</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4K</xref>, <italic>rightmost bars</italic>). Conversely, suppression of hTRPM2 activity upon PIP<sub>2</sub> depletion was shown to be counteracted by raising cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tóth and Csanády, 2012</xref>). Clearly, when the side chains involved in its coordination are intact, Ca<sup>2+</sup> binds so tightly that the binding sites are saturated at 125 μM free Ca<sup>2+</sup>: under such conditions channel open probability is close-to-maximal even when the PIP<sub>2</sub> sites are not fully occupied, and adding exogenous PIP<sub>2</sub> causes little further current enhancement. However, when a Ca<sup>2+</sup> coordinating side chain is truncated, the affinity for the ion declines such that its binding sites are scarcely occupied even at 125 μM free Ca<sup>2+</sup>: under such conditions open probability is very low and filling up the PIP<sub>2</sub> sites can cause severalfold current stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4K</xref>, right). (The large current noise for N918A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>) and D921A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>) suggests that for these two mutants open probability is far lower than unity even in the presence of PIP<sub>2</sub>.) One possible explanation for these findings is that Ca<sup>2+</sup> and PIP<sub>2</sub> stabilize the open state independently of each other. Alternatively, the PIP<sub>2</sub> headgroup itself might be directly involved in Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding. Indeed, density for a phospholipid molecule is seen near the bound Ca<sup>2+</sup> ion, in the immediate vicinity of the TRP box region of TRP helix 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>). The phospholipid headgroup was not clearly resolved, and the phosphate moiety of the modeled phosphatidic acid is too far (~9 Å) from the cation to be involved in its coordination. However, the terminal phosphates of a PIP<sub>2</sub> molecule bound in the same position could potentially contact the bound Ca<sup>2+</sup> ion.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Cytoplasmic cavities and tunnels and access to the Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding site</title><p>The cytosolic domains form a porous structure which houses a complex system of cavities crucial for channel function. The two ring-like structures formed in the bottom tier by the NTDs and ARDs and in the middle tier by the LHDs surround a common cytoplasmic cavity that extends in a direction perpendicular to the membrane surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). The four stretcher helices form a cross which acts as a joist to subdivide this cavity into two chambers. The lower chamber, contained in the bottom tier, is open at the bottom towards the cytosol, and is mostly occupied by the vertical CC, which fills it like a piston (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, <italic>top</italic>). The upper chamber, contained in the middle tier, is bounded from the top by the four TRP helices which act as ceiling joists that run parallel to the stretcher helices and converge into the cytoplasmic mouth of the pore (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, <italic>top</italic> and <italic>bottom</italic>). The empty upper chamber represents a relatively secluded volume of ~50000 A<sup>3</sup>, buried inside the protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). At its sides, the upper chamber communicates with the cytosol through eight large lateral windows, four between the bottom and middle tier (NTD and LHD) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>), and four between the middle and the top tier (LHD and PD) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F–G</xref>). In addition, the upper chamber is directly connected to the Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding sites through four tunnels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, ‘<italic>central tunnels</italic>’). Indeed, the Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding site can be viewed as a recess in a bent tunnel with a diameters &gt; 4 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, <italic>inset</italic>) that connects the upper chamber with the cytosol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>).

The location of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding sites in nvTRPM2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B–C</xref>) is consistent with that prediction. Indeed, in the absence of extracellular (pipette) Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>), addition and removal of cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<italic>gray bars</italic>) in the continuous presence of ADPR (<italic>black bar</italic>) caused nvTRPM2 currents to activate and deactivate, respectively, regardless of the applied membrane potential (<italic>colored bar</italic> and <italic>shading</italic>); the time constants of current decay in response to cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> removal (<italic>colored fit lines</italic> and <italic>numbers</italic> (in ms)) attested to a modest intrinsic voltage dependence of gating (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>, <italic>green symbols</italic>). However, when extracellular [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] was 1 mM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>), currents evoked by addition of ADPR+Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<italic>black and gray bars</italic>) could be completely abolished by cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> removal only when the membrane potential was positive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>, <italic>gray shading</italic>), i.e., when the driving force for Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through the pore was small. Even at moderately positive voltages (+20 to+40 mV) the decay time constants upon cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> removal (<italic>red fit lines</italic> and <italic>numbers</italic> (in ms)) were greatly prolonged by the presence of external Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>, <italic>purple symbols</italic>), approaching those measured in its absence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>, <italic>green symbols</italic>) only at extremely positive voltages (+60 to +80 mV) at which the driving force for Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx is negligible. Such slowing of channel closure by external Ca<sup>2+</sup> has been described for hTRPM2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Csanády and Töröcsik, 2009</xref>), and suggests that, as long as the gate is open, Ca<sup>2+</sup> entering through the nvTRPM2 pore can directly reach the Ca<sup>2+</sup> sites through the central tunnels, and keep them saturated even while the protein surface is continuously rinsed with a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free solution. However, at positive voltages, and with the cytosolic face exposed to continuous Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free wash, the Ca<sup>2+</sup> sites and the cytoplasmic cavity are depleted of Ca<sup>2+</sup> as soon as the gate closes, too rapidly to allow it to reopen.</p><p>By contrast, at negative membrane potentials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>, <italic>white shading</italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>) that provide a large driving force for the influx of millimolar extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>, a substantial fraction of nvTRPM2 current survived cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> removal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>, <italic>yellow arrows</italic>), and subsided only when ADPR was also removed. One possible explanation is that at negative transmembrane voltages the number of Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions accumulated in the cytoplasmic cavity during an open-pore event is too large to be completely dissipated during a subsequent closed event: the pore reopens before all Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions would have left the cavity. This results in a low but substantial steady-state channel activity (open probability ~0.15–0.3; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>, <italic>white shading</italic> and <italic>yellow arrows</italic>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–B</xref>, <italic>section (d)</italic>) during which [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] in the upper chamber of each channel fluctuates between a very high (during open events) and a low but non-zero value (during closed events). Thus, whereas all four Ca<sup>2+</sup> sites of a channel likely become saturated during each open event, some will lose Ca<sup>2+</sup> during the subsequent closed event. Because channel opening rate is a property of the closed channel, the surviving current (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>, <italic>yellow arrows</italic>) reflects channel opening rate under sub-saturating conditions, explaining the reduction in open probability upon removal of bulk cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup>.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36409.017</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Activation by ADPR of nvTRPM2 current in the presence of external but absence of cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup>.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Cartoon interpretation of the molecular events that occur during consecutive time intervals (<italic>sections a-g</italic>, also identified by intermittent gray shading in (<bold>A</bold>)-(<bold>B</bold>)) of the current recording in (<bold>B</bold>).

Indeed, low millimolar concentrations of calcium buffer (especially of slow buffers like EGTA) were predicted to be inefficient for buffering cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> around a channel pore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Stern, 1992</xref>). Although we cannot strictly exclude the possibility that some of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> entering through open nvTRPM2 pores does accumulate at the internal surface of our patches, several arguments suggest that this is unlikely to happen. First, based on the unitary conductances measured with Na<sup>+</sup> or Ca<sup>2+</sup> as the charge carrier (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F–G</xref>), when the extracellular solution contains 140 mM Na<sup>+</sup> and 1 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), the majority (~74%) of inward nvTRPM2 currents are carried by Na<sup>+</sup> ions (which account for ~85% of entering cations). Second, in addition to EGTA, our cytosolic solution contains 140 mM gluconate. Although gluconate is a low-affinity buffer, at 140 mM it binds ~88% of total cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Csanády and Töröcsik, 2009</xref>), and its high concentration precludes its saturation. Third, Stern's calculation applies to a static environment (like the cytosol of an intact cell during whole-cell recording) in which buffering around the pore is limited partly by the kinetics of Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding to the buffer, and partly by the rate of diffusion of the buffer ligand, because the buffer molecules in the vicinity of the pore become rapidly saturated and must be replaced by unbound buffer molecules via diffusion. Here the cytosolic face of the patch is immersed into a rapidly flowing solution. Considering the flow rate of ~1 cm/s of our bath solution and the ~10 nm diameter of a channel protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), the entire solution volume in contact with the surface of a channel is displaced by fresh Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free solution every ~1 μs, during which time ~2 Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions enter through its pore (assuming a Ca<sup>2+</sup> current of 0.6 pA per open channel). Thus, the vectorial flushing effect is likely more important here than diffusion or the kinetics of Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding to buffers – unless the shape of our patches is concave towards the bulk solution to an extent that severely limits access of the flowing bath solution to the patch surface. Fourth, the perhaps most compelling argument against Ca<sup>2+</sup> accumulation at the patch surface being responsible for the residual currents in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>, (<italic>yellow arrows</italic>) is our finding that at negative voltages, in the presence of external Ca<sup>2+</sup>, nvTRPM2 currents activate, albeit with a delay, upon addition of cytosolic ADPR even in the absence of cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, <italic>right</italic>): the magnitude of that ‘spontaneous’ current is identical to that which survives removal of pre-applied cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, <italic>left</italic>). Because the spontaneous current activates from a state in which all pores in the patch have been closed for several seconds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–B</xref>, <italic>section (e)</italic>), a duration more than sufficient to completely wash off even very high concentrations of pre-applied cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> (cf., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), it cannot be explained by bulk Ca<sup>2+</sup> accumulation. Rather, its delayed activation must reflect a very low ‘spontaneous’ channel opening rate of ADPR-bound channels in the absence of bound Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, <italic>section (f)</italic>): upon the first such spontaneous opening of a channel its upper chamber is immediately flooded by Ca<sup>2+</sup> which henceforth maintains that channel in an active state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, <italic>section (g)</italic>).</p><p>In conclusion, we have presented here the cryo-EM structure of TRPM2 from <italic>Nematostella vectensis</italic>, which is functionally similar to human TRPM2, in complex with bound Ca<sup>2+</sup>. The overall structure of nvTRPM2 resembles that of other TRPM family channels, but important differences in local geometry and surface polarity explain many of its unique functional features. In particular, the larger pore diameter and larger negative surface charge of both pore vestibules in nvTRPM2 explains its higher Ca<sup>2+</sup> permeability and larger conductance compared to TRPM4. The external vestibule of nvTRPM2 is stabilized by a negatively charged short helix. Loss of the corresponding sequence segment explains inactivation of human TRPM2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tóth and Csanády, 2012</xref>). Changes in Ca<sup>2+</sup>- and PIP<sub>2</sub>-sensitivity upon truncation of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-coordinating amino acid side chains suggest a mechanism for gating regulation by these two channel cofactors. The secluded location of the activating Ca<sup>2+</sup> sites in the protein interior in a recess of a narrow tunnel that connects the upper chamber of the cytoplasmic cavity to the cytosol, and the negative surface charge of this tunnel in TRPM2, explain the unique dependence of TRPM2 activity on intra- and extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Thus, although the Ca<sup>2+</sup> sites are intracellular in both TRPM4 and TRPM2, their regulation through Ca<sup>2+</sup> is fundamentally different. TRPM4 activity requires a continuous supply of cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> that enters through its peripheral tunnel. In contrast, ADPR-bound TRPM2 requires only an initiator Ca<sup>2+</sup> spark from the cytosol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, <italic>section (b)</italic>), to then remain activated by Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions that enter through its pore and access the binding site through the central tunnel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, <italic>section (c)</italic>). Indeed, extremely Ca<sup>2+</sup> permeable nvTRPM2 does not even require an initiator spark: infrequent spontaneous openings of ADPR-bound channels allow for self-activation using exclusively extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, <italic>sections (f-g)</italic>) – that mechanism might be relevant even for moderately Ca<sup>2+</sup> permeable hTRPM2 under the static conditions of a living cell. Because the ADPR-binding NUDT9H domain was not resolved here, further studies will be required to address the structural underpinnings of TRPM2 regulation by ADPR.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"

Subsequent application of a tighter mask just around the protein density for the final local searches of 3D auto-refine increased the resolution to 3.11 Å. After post-processing, the final resolution was further improved to 3.07 Å using the 0.143 cutoff criterion.

All other regions of the protein were built de novo in Coot, since the densities for most of the side chains were quite distinct. The N-Acetylglucosamine modifications of residue N1017 were very clear, and further confirmed the validity of model building around this region. Some obvious phospholipid-like densities were seen around the TMD. As these accounted only for parts of phospholipids, and the densities for the head groups were particularly poorly resolved, they were filled with various truncated versions of 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC) to maximally fit the densities. In addition, a few flatter densities that could not be fitted with phospholipids were filled with cholesterol. The final structure model (tetramer) contained 4244 protein residues (6–23, 41–51, 86–546, 573–755, 812–1136, and 1148–1210), 4 Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions, 3 Na<sup>+</sup> ions, 60 lipid molecules, and 8 N-Acetylglucosamine molecules. The EM density for the C-terminal NUDT9H domain (residues 1271–1551) was not observed.

The Fourier shell correlation (FSC) curves were calculated between the refined model and different maps (full map, half map1, and half map2), respectively.

Open probabilities (P<sub>o</sub>) normalized to that in 125 μM Ca<sup>2+</sup> (P<sub>o;125</sub>), were calculated as P<sub>o</sub>/P<sub>o;125</sub>=(<italic>I</italic>/<italic>I</italic><sub>125</sub>)/(<italic>i</italic>/<italic>i</italic><sub>125</sub>) (<italic>i</italic>, unitary current; <italic>i</italic><sub>125</sub>, unitary current in 125 μM cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup>[see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>]). To emphasize several orders-of-magnitude reductions in maximal open probability for the Ca<sup>2+</sup> site mutants, normalized currents and open probabilities hence obtained are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4K</xref> rescaled by their values measured in 125 μM Ca<sup>2+</sup> + 25 μM PIP<sub>2</sub>, i.e., <italic>I</italic>/I<sub>125+PIP2</sub>=(<italic>I</italic>/I<sub>125</sub>)/(<italic>I</italic><sub>125+PIP2</sub>/I<sub>125</sub>) and P<sub>o</sub>/P<sub>o;125+PIP2</sub>=(P<sub>o</sub>/P<sub>o;125</sub>)/(P<sub>o;125+PIP2</sub>/P<sub>o;125</sub>). For D921A nvTRPM2 channel currents in the absence of PIP<sub>2</sub> were too small for reliable cursor measurement. Thus, for this mutant <italic>i</italic> and <italic>N</italic>⋅P<sub>o</sub> in 13, 125, or 1250 μM cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> was estimated using dwell-time analysis, and fractional P<sub>o</sub> under such conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4K</xref>, <italic>right</italic>, <italic>purple bars</italic>) calculated as P<sub>o</sub>/P<sub>o;125+PIP2</sub>=(<italic>i</italic>⋅<italic>N</italic>⋅P<sub>o</sub>)/(I<sub>125+PIP2</sub>).</p><p>Macroscopic current relaxations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D–E</xref>) were fitted by single-exponential functions using least-squares. At negative membrane potentials, in the presence of external Ca<sup>2+</sup>, current decay time courses upon cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> removal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>) do not reflect channel closing rate, as opening rate remains non-zero under such conditions: thus, these current segments were not fitted.</p></sec><sec id="s3-9"><title>Statistics</title><p>The quantification and statistical analyses for the structural parts are integral outputs of the software and algorithms used.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom, Kenton J Swartz is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors and the evaluation has been overseen by Kenton Swartz as the Reviewing Editor and Richard Aldrich as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Leon D. Islas (Reviewer #2); Alexander Sobolevsky (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This is a wonderful manuscript reporting the first near-atomic resolution structure of the TRPM2 channel and a detailed mechanistic study to investigate several of the most intriguing new structural features. The TRPM2 channel is activated by intracellular calcium, ADP-ribose and PIP<sub>2</sub>. Although PIP<sub>2</sub> is not resolved definitively and the structure was solved in the absence of calcium and ADP-ribose, a calcium binding site near the internal ends of S2 and S3 appears to be identified that is similar to that recently reported for the TRPM4 channel. The external vestibule appears wide enough to pass ions and contains many acidic residues that are important for ion permeation, and the internal pore appears to be closed. One of the more fascinating aspects of the structure is the presence of upper and lower chambers within the cytosolic domain, as well as the tunnels connecting the upper chamber to the putative calcium binding sites and the lower chamber to the bulk solution. The authors show us why the nvTRPM2 channel does not inactivate (unlike the human channel), they show that residues coordinating calcium have either altered calcium affinity or are non-functional, and they present an intriguing phenomenon whereby calcium permeation from outside to inside can reach the calcium binding sites even when the internal surface of the protein is being perfused by calcium buffers. Overall, we think this is one of the nicest TRP channel structures to be reported recently and the work is highly appropriate for <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) We are not sure how definitive the authors can be about identification of calcium bound to its putative site. The extensive mutagenesis and comparison with TRPM4 makes us believe that identification of the site is correct, but not whether a calcium ion is actually bound. In subsection “Structure determination” the authors state that the structure was solved in the presence of calcium, but in subsection “Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding site” they use the word trace. Also, the composition of the solution used to prepare grids is not given. Is it buffer A? We couldn't find the composition of that solution anywhere? It would be nice to see larger density maps in this region with stronger justification. Do you see density for calcium in the half maps? Do you see stronger density for the acidic residues you think are binding calcium compared to other regions of the protein where acidic residues are not involved in hydrogen bonds or ion binding (and are therefore more damaged by the electron beam)? In TRPM4, the authors compared maps with and without calcium to make a stronger case. We are not requesting any new experiments, just expand the presentation/justification and perhaps tone down the conclusion about a calcium ion being present in the maps and models.</p><p>2) One of the reviewers thinks that it is almost certain that you have calcium ion accumulation on the internal face of you patches for the experiments shown in Figure 5 and Figure 6. Many of the currents are several nA and these are inside out patches where the membrane will adopt a concave shape towards the bulk solution. This doesn't negate the conclusion that calcium is coming from the outside, but it’s not surprising that calcium can't be washed away at negative voltages when one considers the geometry of the patch and the kinetics of calcium binding to buffers. Please see Stern, 1992, a paper that describes a model that predicts your results for any calcium permeable channel being studied in inside-out patches. According to that model, it might be possible to rule out calcium accumulation using high concentration of a fast buffer such as BAPTA, but you would probably also have to reduce your expression level considerably. You should deal with this point as you see fit, but it would be a shame to misinterpret your results if they have nothing to do with the really beautiful chambers and tunnels.</p><p>3) Another reviewer asked why the reactivating current is not as high as that obtained with intracellularly applied Ca<sup>2+</sup>, since one would expect that the entering Ca<sup>2+</sup> would saturate the binding sites if accessing it through the tunnels. Perhaps intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> induces a separate conformation that allows more efficient coupling to the activation gate?</p><p>4) nvTRPM2 represents a highly calcium-permeable TRP channel (PCa/PNa~35). Zhang et al. focus on nvTRPM2 structural features that distinguish its calcium permeability from other TRPMs. However, a brief discussion of how specific these structural features compared to other calcium-permeable channels would broaden the scope of this manuscript and make it more interesting to the general reader. For example, how similar to or different from are the structural mechanisms of high calcium permeability in TRPM2 versus most highly calcium-selective TRP channels TRPV5/6?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36409.025</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) We are not sure how definitive the authors can be about identification of calcium bound to its putative site.

We now explicitly state that the EM sample was concentrated from the &quot;gel filtration peak fractions in Buffer A&quot; (subsection “EM sample preparation, data collection, and processing”). The buffer was not supplemented with Ca<sup>2+</sup>, so we now state &quot;trace amounts of Ca<sup>2+</sup>&quot; in subsection “Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding site”. Free Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration in a typical saline without added Ca<sup>2+</sup> or Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffers is in the μM range (e.g., in an earlier study (Csanády and Adam-Vizi,</p><p>2003) we have measured 13 µM), and the standard Vitrobot filter paper we used for freezing grids also contains a certain amount of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, as people have measured (unpublished). Therefore, given the apparent K<sub>1/2</sub> of ~2 µM for nvTRPM2 (Figure 4E), it is not surprising that bound Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions are present in our EM map.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It would be nice to see larger density maps in this region with stronger justification.

In the full map and both half maps, the Ca<sup>2+</sup> densities are all very clear, and the densities for the acidic amino acids which participate in Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding (D921 and E893) are indeed much stronger than those of adjacent residues that are not involved in hydrogen bonding or Ca<sup>2+</sup> coordination (E892, D915, and D1106).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) One of the reviewers thinks that it is almost certain that you have calcium ion accumulation on the internal face of you patches for the experiments shown in Figure 5 and Figure 6.

We did observe the phenomenon depicted in Figure 5E and Figure 6 even in patches with much smaller currents (residual currents of some tens of pA). Unfortunately, high concentrations of BAPTA, as suggested in the Stern paper, cannot be tested here, because the inevitable introduction of four cations (e.g., Na<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>, NMDG<sup>+</sup>) per BAPTA molecule (at pH=7.1) into the bath solution would drastically alter unitary conductance by causing either reversal potential shift or pore block. Thus, we acknowledge that we cannot fully exclude the possibility of some Ca<sup>2+</sup> accumulation at the cytosolic patch surface, but we also provide four arguments which make this unlikely (subsection “Cytoplasmic cavities and tunnels and access to the Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding site”):</p><p>First, based on the unitary conductances measured with Na<sup>+</sup> or Ca<sup>2+</sup> as the charge carrier (Figure 3F-G), when the extracellular solution contains 140 mM Na<sup>+</sup> and 1 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> (Figure 5E, Figure 6), the majority (~74%) of inward nvTRPM2 currents are carried by Na<sup>+</sup> ions (which account for ~85% of entering cations).</p><p>Second, in addition to EGTA, our cytosolic solution contains 140 mM gluconate. Although gluconate is a low-affinity buffer, at 140 mM it binds ~88% of total cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> (Csanády and Torocsik, 2009), and its high concentration precludes its saturation.</p><p>Third, Stern's calculation applies to a static environment (like the cytosol of an intact cell during whole-cell recording) in which buffering around the pore is limited partly by the kinetics of Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding to the buffer, and partly by the rate of diffusion of the buffer ligand, because the buffer molecules in the vicinity of the pore become rapidly saturated and must be replaced by unbound buffer molecules via diffusion. Here the cytosolic face of the patch is immersed into a rapidly flowing solution. Considering the flow rate of ~1 cm/s of our bath solution and the ~10 nm diameter of a channel protein (Figure 2C), the entire solution volume in contact with the surface of a channel is displaced by fresh Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free solution every ~1 μs, during which time ~2 Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions enter through its pore (assuming a Ca<sup>2+</sup> current of 0.6 pA per open channel). Thus, the vectorial flushing effect is likely more important here than diffusion or the kinetics of Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding to buffers – unless the shape of our patches is concave towards the bulk solution to an extent that severely limits access of the flowing bath solution to the patch surface.</p><p>Fourth, the perhaps most compelling argument against Ca<sup>2+</sup> accumulation at the patch surface being responsible for the residual currents in Figure 5E, (yellow arrows) is our finding that at negative voltages, in the presence of external Ca<sup>2+</sup>, nvTRPM2 currents activate, albeit with a delay, upon addition of cytosolic ADPR even in the absence of cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> (Figure 6B, right): the magnitude of that &quot;spontaneous&quot; current is identical to that which survives removal of pre-applied cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> (Figure 6B, left). Because the spontaneous current activates from a state in which all pores in the patch have been closed for several seconds (Figure 6A-B, section (e)), a duration more than sufficient to completely wash off even very high concentrations of pre-applied cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> (cf., Figure 1A), it cannot be explained by bulk Ca<sup>2+</sup> accumulation. Rather, its delayed activation must reflect a very low &quot;spontaneous&quot; channel opening rate of ADPR-bound channels in the absence of bound Ca<sup>2+</sup> (Figure 6A, section (f)): upon the first such spontaneous opening of a channel its upper chamber is immediately flooded by Ca<sup>2+</sup> which henceforth maintains that channel in an active state (Figure 6A, section (g)).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Another reviewer asked why the reactivating current is not as high as that obtained with intracellularly applied Ca<sup>2+</sup>, since one would expect that the entering Ca<sup>2+</sup> would saturate the binding sites if accessing it through the tunnels. Perhaps intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> induces a separate conformation that allows more efficient coupling to the activation gate?</p></disp-quote><p>During &quot;spontaneous&quot; channel activity, with Ca<sup>2+</sup> entering only through the pore but cytosolic bulk Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration kept close to zero, Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration in the upper chamber of each channel fluctuates between a very high (during open events) and a low but non-zero value (during closed events). This is because once the gate has closed, Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions start to dissipate from the chamber through the various windows and tunnels. Thus, whereas all four Ca<sup>2+</sup> sites of a channel likely become saturated during each open event, some will lose Ca<sup>2+</sup> during the subsequent closed event. Because channel opening rate is a property of the closed channel, the current that survives cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> removal (Figure 5E, yellow arrows), or the spontaneous reactivating current (Figure 6, right), reflects channel opening rate under sub-saturating conditions. This explains the lower open probability compared to that seen in the presence of saturating cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup>. We have added this explanation to the text (subsection “Cytoplasmic cavities and tunnels and access to the Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding site”)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) nvTRPM2 represents a highly calcium-permeable TRP channel (PCa/PNa~35).

Although sequence conservation between nvTRPM2 and TRPV6 in the filter and outer vestibule region is low, for both channels the outermost filter position is formed by a ring of four carboxylates (aspartates in TRPV6, glutamates in nvTRPM2), and additional 3-4 negatively charged side chains per subunit are present in the external vestibule. In TRPV6 the latter were termed &quot;recruitment sites&quot; (Saotome et al., 2016). Indeed, closer inspection of nvTRPM2 unitary current sizes (Figure 3G) indicates that the Ca<sup>2+</sup> throughput rate of the nvTRPM2 pore exceeds that expected for a diffusion-limited channel (Hille et al., 1992). This is a clear indication that local Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration in the nvTRPM2 outer vestibule is far higher than that in the bulk solution, suggesting that the negative charges in the nvTRPM2 outer vestibule also act as &quot;recruitment sites&quot;.</p></body></sub-article></article>
