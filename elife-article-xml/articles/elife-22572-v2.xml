In eukaryotic cells this process generally occurs by a scanning mechanism, wherein the small (40S) ribosomal subunit first recruits Met-tRNA<sub>i</sub> in a ternary complex (TC) with eIF2-GTP in a reaction stimulated by eIFs 1, 1A, and 3. The resulting 43S pre-initiation complex (PIC) attaches to the mRNA 5’ end and scans the 5’UTR for an AUG with favorable surrounding sequence, particularly at the −3 and +4 positions, to identify the correct start codon and assemble a 48S PIC. In the scanning PIC, Met-tRNA<sub>i</sub> is not tightly bound to the peptidyl (P) site of the 40S subunit, and this relatively unstable ‘P<sub>OUT</sub>’ state is thought to facilitate sampling of successive triplets entering the P site for complementarity to the anticodon of Met-tRNA<sub>i</sub>. The GTP bound to eIF2 in the TC can be hydrolyzed, dependent on GTPase activating protein eIF5, but P<sub>i</sub> release is blocked by eIF1, which also impedes full accommodation of Met-tRNA<sub>i</sub> in the P site. Start codon recognition triggers dissociation of eIF1 from the 40S subunit, which gates P<sub>i</sub> release from eIF2-GDP·P<sub>i</sub> and permits highly stable binding of Met-tRNA<sub>i</sub> in the ‘P<sub>IN</sub>’ state. Interaction of the eIF1A NTT with the codon:anticodon duplex helps to stabilize the closed, P<sub>IN</sub> state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Subsequent dissociation of eIF2-GDP and other eIFs from the 48S PIC enables eIF5B-catalyzed subunit joining and formation of an 80S initiation complex with Met-tRNA<sub>i</sub> base-paired to AUG in the P site (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hinnebusch (2014)</xref>).<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22572.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Model describing conformational rearrangements of the PIC during scanning and start codon recognition.</title><p>(<bold>i</bold>) eIF1 and the scanning enhancers (SEs) in the CTT of eIF1A stabilize an open conformation of the 40S subunit to which TC rapidly binds. uS7 is located in the mRNA exit channel of the 40S; (<bold>ii</bold>) The 43S PIC in the open conformation scans the mRNA for the start codon with Met-tRNA<sub>i</sub> bound in the P<sub>OUT</sub> state and uS7 interacting with eIF2α-D1. eIF2 can hydrolyze GTP to GDP•P<sub>i</sub>, but release of P<sub>i</sub> is blocked. (<bold>iii</bold>) On AUG recognition, Met-tRNA<sub>i</sub> moves from the P<sub>OUT</sub> to P<sub>IN</sub> state, clashing with eIF1 and the CTT of eIF1A, provoking displacement of the eIF1A CTT from the P site, dissociation of eIF1 from the 40S subunit, and P<sub>i</sub> release from eIF2. The NTT of eIF1A, harboring scanning inhibitor (SI) elements, adopts a defined conformation and interacts with the codon:anticodon helix. The eIF2α-D1/uS7 interface is remodeled. (Above) Arrows summarize that eIF1 and the eIF1A SE elements promote P<sub>OUT</sub> and impede transition to P<sub>IN</sub> state, whereas the scanning inhibitor (SI) element in the NTT of eIF1A stabilizes the P<sub>IN</sub> state. Results presented below indicate that uS7/Rps5 residue D215 promotes the closed conformation, whereas R219 and S223 enhance the open state (Adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hinnebusch, 2014</xref>).</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.22572.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.22572.002</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-22572-fig1-v2"/></fig></p><p>A recent cryo-EM structure of a reconstituted partial yeast 48S PIC (py48S) with Met-tRNA<sub>i</sub> bound in the P<sub>IN</sub> state revealed extensive interactions between Met-tRNA<sub>i</sub> and all three domains of the α-subunit of eIF2 within the TC.

Previously, we showed that substitutions of several residues in the β-hairpin of uS7 suppress the elevated UUG initiation conferred by Sui<sup>-</sup> variants of eIF2β (<italic>SUI3–2</italic>) or eIF5 (<italic>SUI5</italic>), displaying the Ssu<sup>-</sup> (<underline>S</underline>uppressor of <underline>Su</underline>i<sup>-</sup>) phenotype. Consistent with this, one such Ssu<sup>-</sup> substitution in the hairpin loop (R148E, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) was found to destabilize TC binding to reconstituted 48S PICs containing a UUG start codon in the mRNA. Substitutions of Glu-144 in β-strand 1 of the hairpin, or the nearby residue Arg-225 at the C-terminus of uS7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), also reduced recognition of the AUG codon of eIF1 (<italic>SUI1</italic>) mRNA, present in poor context, and increased the probability that scanning PICs bypass, or ‘leaky scan’ past, the AUG codon of upstream open reading frame 1 (uORF1) in <italic>GCN4</italic> mRNA. The Glu-144 substitution (E144R) also dramatically destabilized TC binding to PICs reconstituted with an AUG or UUG start codon in mRNA, with a stronger effect for UUG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Visweswaraiah et al., 2015</xref>). Together, these findings implicated Arg-225 and amino acids in the uS7 β-hairpin, particularly Glu-144, in stabilizing the P<sub>IN</sub> conformation of the PIC, and revealed a requirement for these residues in preventing selection of near-cognate (UUG) or AUG start codons in poor context in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Visweswaraiah et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>The uS7 substitutions with the greatest effects on start codon recognition are located in the upper portion of the β-hairpin (E144R) or at the very C-terminus (R225K), distant from the context nucleotides in mRNA; whereas substitutions of residues in the loop of the β-hairpin, including R148E, which contacts the mRNA directly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), had relatively weaker phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Visweswaraiah et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, it was unclear what molecular interactions in the PIC are perturbed by the E144R and R225K substitutions. Interestingly, both E144 and R225 interact with other uS7 residues located in the C-terminal helix, which in turn interacts extensively with eIF2α-D1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hussain et al., 2014</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). As eIF2α-D1 also interacts with the anticodon stem-loop of tRNA<sub>i</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), we considered that the strong defects in start codon recognition conferred by E144R and R225K might result from an altered orientation of the uS7 C-terminal helix that perturbs its interaction with eIF2α-D1 in a way that indirectly destabilizes TC binding in the P<sub>IN</sub> state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Visweswaraiah et al., 2015</xref>). Because it was unknown whether the interface between eIF2α-D1 and the uS7 C-terminal helix is important for start codon recognition, we set out here to determine whether uS7 substitutions predicted to perturb this interface would alter the accuracy of start codon recognition in vivo.</p><p>Recent cryo-EM analysis has revealed a partial yeast PIC exhibiting a more open configuration of the mRNA binding cleft and P site (py48S-open) compared to both the previous py48S structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hussain et al., 2014</xref>) and a similar complex also containing eIF3 (py48S-closed) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Llácer et al., 2015</xref>). The py48S-open complex exhibits an upward movement of the 40S head from the body that both widens the mRNA binding cleft and opens the entry channel latch, and evokes a widened P site lacking interactions between Met-tRNA<sub>i</sub> and the 40S body found in py48S-closed. These features of py48S-open seem well-suited to the scanning of successive triplets entering the P site for complementarity to Met-tRNA<sub>i</sub> with TC anchored in a relatively unstable conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Llácer et al., 2015</xref>). During the transition from py48S-open to py48S-closed, eIF2α-D1 rotates slightly to avoid a clash with the 40S body, which alters the interface between eIF2α-D1 and the C-terminal helix of uS7. Certain contacts appear to be enhanced in the open conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>; D77-R219 and D84-S223) and thus might be expected to promote continued scanning through UUG or ‘poor-context’ AUG codons and thereby increase initiation accuracy. A third contact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>; Y82-D215) is favored in the closed conformation and might have the opposite function of enabling recognition of suboptimal initiation sites by promoting the highly stable P<sub>IN</sub> conformation of TC binding to the closed complex. Thus, to examine the importance of the eIF2α-D1/uS7 interface in start codon recognition, we chose to perturb these predicted contacts that appear to be favored in one PIC conformation or the other and determine their effects on initiation at poor initiation codons in vivo and the stability of TC binding to reconstituted PICs in vitro. Our results support the physiological importance of the differential contacts between uS7 and eIF2α-D1 in the py48S-open and py48S-closed structures in modulating the transition to the P<sub>IN</sub> conformation by the scanning PIC and, hence, the accuracy of start codon selection.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Substitutions of uS7 Asp-215 increase discrimination against suboptimal initiation codons in vivo</title><p>The cryo-EM structure of the py48S complex reveals two sites of interaction between eIF2α-D1 and uS7: (i) loops in eIF2α-D1 and the uS7 β-hairpin, both in proximity to the −3 nucleotide in mRNA; and (ii) the C-terminal helix of uS7 and residues in the β-barrel structure of eIF2α-D1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–B</xref>). Comparison of the py48S-open and –closed structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Llácer et al., 2015</xref>) suggests that interactions of uS7 residues R219 and S223 with eIF2α D77 and D84, respectively, are more favored in the open conformation, whereas uS7 D215 interaction with eIF2α Y82 is more favored in the closed state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Thus, disrupting these interactions might alter the fidelity of start codon selection in different ways. In particular, disrupting the uS7-D215/eIF2α-Y82 contact favored in the closed state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) might increase discrimination against near-cognate UUG or poor-context AUG codons by shifting the system to the open/P<sub>OUT</sub> conformation conducive to scanning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).

Consistent with its WT growth, the <italic>D215L</italic> mutant showed no reduction in the ratio of polysomes to 80S monosomes (P/M ratio) versus WT, suggesting a nearly WT rate of bulk protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). <italic>D215L</italic> cells also display a nearly WT ratio of total 40S to 60S subunits, measured under conditions that dissociate 80S ribosomes into free subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>), indicating little or no effect of D215L on 40S biogenesis or stability. Thus, the enhanced initiation accuracy conferred by <italic>D215L</italic> appears to reflect an increased propensity of the mutant 43S PIC to bypass a near-cognate start codon during scanning rather than a reduction in 40S abundance.</p><p>In addition to reducing initiation from near-cognate UUG codons, certain Ssu<sup>-</sup> mutations in eIF1 and eIF1A reduce initiation from AUG codons in poor context. As such, they exacerbate the effects of the native, suboptimal context of the AUG codon of <italic>SUI1</italic> mRNA and decrease expression of the encoded eIF1 protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Martin-Marcos et al., 2011</xref>). All three D215 Ssu<sup>-</sup> substitutions similarly reduced eIF1 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) and, consistently, reduced expression of a <italic>SUI1-lacZ</italic> reporter bearing the native, suboptimal context at the nucleotides preceding the AUG codon (<sup>−3</sup>CGU<sup>−1</sup>), while modestly increasing expression of a modified <italic>SUI1<sub>opt</sub>-lacZ</italic> reporter with optimized context (<sup>−3</sup>AAA<sup>−1</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). As expected, expression of the <italic>SUI1<sub>opt</sub>-lacZ</italic> reporter is 2-fold higher than that of <italic>SUI1-lacZ</italic> in <italic>RPS5<sup>+</sup></italic>cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Martin-Marcos et al., 2011</xref>), whereas the <italic>SUI1<sub>opt</sub>-lacZ</italic>/<italic>SUI-lacZ</italic> expression ratio is elevated to between 3- and 4-fold in the D215 mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Thus, the D215 substitutions exacerbate the effect of suboptimal context and decrease AUG recognition on native <italic>SUI1</italic> mRNA. The reduction in eIF1 abundance implies that the D215 substitutions overcome the autoregulation of eIF1 expression, wherein low eIF1 levels suppress poor context at the <italic>SUI1</italic> AUG codon to restore eIF1 abundance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ivanov et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Martin-Marcos et al., 2011</xref>).

With the native, optimum context of the uORF1 AUG (<sup>−3</sup>AAA<sup>−1</sup>), virtually all scanning ribosomes translate el.uORF1 and subsequent reinitiation at the <italic>GCN4-lacZ</italic> ORF is nearly non-existent, such that <italic>GCN4-lacZ</italic> translation of this reporter is very low (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Grant et al., 1994</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, col. 1, row 1). In agreement with previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Visweswaraiah et al., 2015</xref>), replacing optimum context with the weaker context <sup>−3</sup>UAA<sup>−1</sup> at uAUG-1 increases leaky scanning of el.uORF1 and elevates <italic>GCN4-lacZ</italic> expression ~8 fold; an even greater ~30 fold increase in <italic>GCN4-lacZ</italic> expression is conferred by the extremely poor context <sup>−3</sup>UUU<sup>−1</sup>; and elimination of uAUG-1 increases <italic>GCN4-lacZ</italic> expression by ~100 fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, col. 1, rows 1–4). Based on these results, the percentages of scanning ribosomes that either translate el.uORF1 or leaky-scan uAUG-1 and translate <italic>GCN4-lacZ</italic> instead can be calculated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, cols. 3 and 5), revealing that about 99%, 93%, and 71% of scanning ribosomes recognize uAUG-1 in optimum, weak, or poor context, respectively, in WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> col. 5, rows 1–3). Note that while leaky-scanning to <italic>GCN4-lacZ</italic> increases by ~30 fold on replacing optimum with poor context, this entails only a ~30% reduction in el.uORF1 translation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, col. 5), as virtually no leaky-scanning (1%) occurs at uAUG-1 in optimum context (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, col. 3).</p><p>The uS7 D215L substitution increases leaky scanning of el.uORF1 and elevates <italic>GCN4-lacZ</italic> expression between ~2.5 and 4-fold for the different reporters containing uAUG-1, while having relatively little effect on the uORF-less reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, col. 1 vs 2 and col. 3 vs. 4, rows 1–4). Comparing the percentages of scanning ribosomes that initiate at uAUG-1 in <italic>D215L</italic> and WT cells, as calculated above, reveals that <italic>D215L</italic> reduces initiation at uAUG-1 by ~17% and~41% for weak and poor contexts, respectively, but only by ~1% for optimum context (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, cf. cols. 5 and 6).

To determine whether E144R/R225K preferentially discriminate against uAUG-1 in poor context, we calculated their effects on the fraction of scanning ribosomes that initiate at el.uORF1 for each context of uAUG-1 in the manner shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> for D215L. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref> , R225K and E144R both resemble D215L in preferentially decreasing el.uORF1 translation for weak and poor context versus optimum context.

We tested this hypothesis by analyzing the effects of the uS7 D215L substitution on TC binding to the 40S subunit in the yeast reconstituted translation system. We began by measuring the affinity of WT TC, assembled with [<sup>35</sup>S]-Met-tRNA<sub>i</sub>, for 40S subunits harboring mutant or WT uS7 in the presence of saturating eIF1, eIF1A and a model unstructured mRNA containing an AUG start codon (mRNA(AUG)), using native gel electrophoresis to separate 40S-bound and unbound fractions of labeled TC.

The reconstituted 40S∙eIF1∙eIF1A∙mRNA∙TC complexes will be referred to as partial 43S∙mRNA complexes owing to the absence of eIF3 and eIF5, which are dispensable for PIC assembly using these model mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Algire et al., 2002</xref>).

While this assay is not sensitive enough to detect decreases in TC affinity unless they exceed two-orders of magnitude (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kolitz et al., 2009</xref>), the results indicate that stable partial 43S∙mRNA(AUG) complexes can be assembled with D215L mutant 40S subunits.

Thus, it appears that eliminating the basic side-chain of Arg-219 (R219A) or substituting it with an acidic side-chain (R219D) confers moderate or severe disruptions, respectively, of the uS7/eIF2α-D1 interface to facilitate inappropriate transition to the closed/P<sub>IN</sub> state at both UUG codons and AUGs in poor-context.

We also measured rates of TC binding to these complexes (k<sub>on</sub>) by mixing labeled TC [<sup>35</sup>S]-Met-tRNA<sub>i</sub> with different concentrations of 40S subunits and saturating eIF1, eIF1A and mRNA(AUG) or mRNA(UUG), removing aliquots at different time points and terminating reactions with excess unlabeled TC. The amount of labeled TC incorporated into PICs as a function of time yields the pseudo-first-order rate constant (k<sub>obs</sub>) for each 40S concentration, and the slope of the plot of k<sub>obs</sub> versus 40S concentration yields the second-order rate constant (k<sub>on</sub>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kolitz et al., 2009</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E–F</xref>, S223D increased the k<sub>on</sub> values for AUG and UUG PICs by ~2 fold and 4-fold, respectively. As the rate constant measured in these experiments is thought to be a composite of the rate of initial binding of TC to the PIC in the P<sub>OUT</sub> state followed by transition from P<sub>OUT</sub> to P<sub>IN</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kolitz et al., 2009</xref>), the increase in k<sub>on</sub> conferred by S223D could indicate acceleration of one or both steps. However, considering that <italic>S223D</italic> confers a Gcd<sup>-</sup> phenotype in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>), signifying a reduced rate of TC loading to 40S subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hinnebusch, 2011</xref>), and also appears to destabilize the P<sub>OUT</sub> state of TC binding to 43S complexes lacking mRNA (end-point defect in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A–B</xref>), it seems probable that the increased k<sub>on</sub> results from accelerating the transition from the P<sub>OUT</sub> to P<sub>IN</sub> states of TC binding to the PIC. This interpretation is supported by our finding that k<sub>on</sub> is increased more substantially for UUG versus AUG complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref>), whereas the initial loading of TC on the PIC should be independent of the start codon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kolitz et al., 2009</xref>). In fact, the actual acceleration of P<sub>OUT</sub> to P<sub>IN</sub> conversion conferred by <italic>S223D</italic> is likely to be substantially greater than the 2–to 4-fold increases in measured k<sub>on</sub> values, as this effect would be offset by the decreased rates of TC binding in the P<sub>OUT</sub> state predicted by the Gcd<sup>-</sup> phenotype of <italic>S223D</italic> in vivo. Thus, taken together, the results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> provide biochemical evidence that <italic>S223D</italic> enhances conversion from the P<sub>OUT</sub> state to the highly stable P<sub>IN</sub> conformation at both AUG and UUG start codons, in accordance with the effects of this mutation in vivo of increasing recognition of the poor-context <italic>SUI1</italic> AUG codon and elevating near-cognate UUG initiation on <italic>his4–301</italic> mRNA during ribosomal scanning.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We previously implicated the β-hairpin of uS7 in achieving efficient and accurate start codon recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Visweswaraiah et al., 2015</xref>), but the molecular interactions involved in these functions were unclear. Here, using a combination of genetics and biochemistry, we obtained strong evidence that uS7 influences start codon recognition through direct interactions with domain 1 of eIF2α. Structural analyses of reconstituted yeast PICs revealed that eIF2α-D1 interacts with both the anticodon stem of tRNA<sub>i</sub>, mRNA residues immediately upstream of the AUG codon, and the C-terminal helix of uS7, and suggested that the uS7/eIF2α-D1 interface is remodeled during the transition from the open conformation, thought to be conducive to scanning, to the closed state required for start codon recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Llácer et al., 2015</xref>). We made targeted substitutions of uS7 residues whose contacts with specific amino acids in eIF2α-D1 appear to be favored in the open or closed conformation and thus might contribute differentially to the stabilities of these two states. As such, altering these contacts should have opposing effects on the probability of switching from the open, scanning conformation to the closed state at suboptimal start codons, including near-cognate UUG triplets and AUGs in poor surrounding context. Fulfilling these predictions would not only implicate the uS7/eIF2α-D1 interface in modulating start codon recognition, but also provide evidence that the different PIC conformations revealed by the structural studies represent physiological intermediates of the initiation pathway.</p><p>In accordance with the predictions based on the PIC structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Llácer et al., 2015</xref>), we found that substitutions perturbing the uS7-D215/eIF2α-Y82 interaction favored in the closed state reduce initiation at UUG codons in cells harboring Sui<sup>-</sup> mutations in eIF2β or eIF5 (that aberrantly elevate UUG initiation), and also decrease recognition of AUGs in poor context in otherwise WT cells, including the native, suboptimal start codon of the eIF1 gene (<italic>SUI1)</italic>, and uAUG-1 of <italic>GCN4</italic> uORF1 when it resides in weak or poor context. The potent uS7 substitution D215L was shown to destabilize the P<sub>IN</sub> state of TC binding to the PIC in vitro, using the <italic>SUI3–2</italic> variant of eIF2β to assemble TC, increasing the dissociation rate of TC (k<sub>off</sub>) with a relatively stronger effect at UUG versus AUG start codons. These findings suggest that the uS7-D215/eIF2α-Y82 contact preferentially stabilizes the P<sub>IN</sub> state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), and that perturbing this interaction disproportionately discriminates against suboptimal initiation sites whose P<sub>IN</sub> conformations are inherently less stable and thus hyperdependent on the uS7/eIF2α interface present in the closed conformation for their efficient utilization in cells. The D215L substitution resembles the E144R substitution in the uS7 β-hairpin loop in increasing discrimination against poor initiation codons and preferentially destabilizing the P<sub>IN</sub> state at UUG codons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Visweswaraiah et al., 2015</xref>), supporting the notion that altering the β-hairpin loop confers hyperaccurate initiation by indirectly perturbing the uS7/eIF2α-I interface in the closed PIC.</p><p>Remarkably, uS7 substitutions altering two other contacts that seem to be favored in the open conformation, uS7-R219/eIF2α-D77 and uS7-S223/eIF2α-D84, had the opposite effects on the system, compared to uS7-D215L, of enhancing utilization of a UUG start codon, the suboptimal <italic>SUI1</italic> AUG codon, and (at least for R219A/D substitutions) <italic>GCN4</italic> uAUG-1 in weak or poor context. Moreover, the potent uS7 substitution S223D also had the opposite effect in vitro of stabilizing the P<sub>IN</sub> state of TC binding to the 48S PIC, decreasing k<sub>off</sub> at UUG codons. Interestingly, uS7-S223D also accelerates formation of the closed/P<sub>IN</sub> complex, thus increasing k<sub>on</sub>; and the relatively stronger increase in k<sub>on</sub> observed for the UUG versus AUG complex suggests that the P<sub>OUT</sub> to P<sub>IN</sub> transition, rather than initial loading of TC to PIC, is accelerated by S223D. In fact, based on the Gcd<sup>-</sup> phenotype conferred by <italic>S223D</italic> in vivo, the initial loading of TC in the P<sub>OUT</sub> configuration appears to be impaired by S223D. Together, these results suggest that uS7-S223D enhances the transition from the relatively less stable P<sub>OUT</sub> conformation to the more stable P<sub>IN</sub> state of TC binding by destabilizing the P<sub>OUT</sub> conformation, which decreases the rate of TC recruitment during reinitiation events on <italic>GCN4</italic> mRNA (to evoke the Gcd<sup>-</sup> phenotype) and also enhances selection of suboptimal initiation codons during scanning, including the native eIF1 start codon, <italic>GCN4</italic> uAUG-1 in poor context, and UUG start codons (the Sui<sup>-</sup> phenotype).</p><p>The dual Sui<sup>-</sup>/Gcd<sup>-</sup> phenotypes of <italic>rps5-S223D</italic> have been observed for numerous mutations affecting various eIFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hinnebusch, 2011</xref>), including substitutions in eIF1 that weaken its binding to the 40S subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Martin-Marcos et al., 2013</xref>).

In the case of <italic>rps5-S223D</italic>, both the Gcd<sup>-</sup> and Sui<sup>-</sup> phenotypes likely result from weakening direct interaction of uS7 with eIF2α-D1 in the TC specifically in the P<sub>OUT</sub> state, which both delays TC loading and increases the probability of P<sub>OUT</sub> to P<sub>IN</sub> transition. Unlike <italic>S223D,</italic> we found that the strong Sui<sup>-</sup> allele <italic>rps5-R219D</italic> does not confer a Gcd<sup>-</sup> phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>), which might indicate that the uS7-R219/eIF2α-D77 interaction in the open conformation is relatively more important for impeding the P<sub>OUT</sub> to P<sub>IN</sub> transition than for accelerating TC loading in the P<sub>OUT</sub> state.</p><p>In summary, our results provide strong evidence that the interface between the C-terminal helix of uS7 and eIF2α-D1 participates in recruitment of TC in the P<sub>OUT</sub> conformation and modulates the transition between the open and closed conformations of the PIC during the scanning process to establish the wild-type level of discrimination against near-cognate UUG triplets and AUG codons in poor context as initiation sites. The opposing consequences on initiation accuracy in vivo and the rates of TC dissociation from reconstituted partial PICs in vitro conferred by the uS7 substitutions D215L and S223D provides evidence that the distinct conformations of the uS7/eIF2α-D1 interface seen in the py48S-open and py48S-closed structures described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Llácer et al. (2015)</xref>, which are differentially perturbed by these two uS7 substitutions, are physiologically relevant to the mechanism of scanning and accurate start codon selection.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plasmids and yeast strains</title><p>Yeast strains used in this study are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>.

Similarly, we were requested to look for suppression of the Rps5-S223D substitution with an eIF2α-D84S substitution. This an interesting suggestion; however, testing it would require the construction of a new strain in which mutant alleles of both RPS5 and the gene encoding eIF2α (SUI2) can be combined in a double mutant, which is not a trivial matter. We began the construction of this strain, but have not been able to complete it yet. In addition, there are several reasons to think that the outcome of the proposed eIF2α substitutions could be more complicated than imagined. Considering the proposed eIF2α-D77R substitution, we note first that eIF2α-D84 is within 8Å of eIF2α-D77 (refer to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), and given the longer length of the Arg vs. Asp side-chain, a new salt bridge could be formed between the proposed eIF2α-D77R substitution and wild-type eIF2α-D84 rather than the intended salt bridge between eIF2α-D77R and Rps5-R219D. This in turn could prevent eIF2α-D84 from interacting with Rps5-S223 in the open complex and thus produce a Sui- phenotype indirectly. Second, eIF2α-D77 is within 4Å of eIF2α-Y82, and the proposed D77R substitution could impair the interaction of eIF2α-Y82 with Rps5-D215 in the closed complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), and thus confer an Ssu<sup>-</sup> phenotype indirectly. Third, although not highlighted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, Rps5-R219 is within 4Å of eIF2α-Y82 exclusively in the open complex, and interaction between these residues might contribute to the stability of the open complex. If so, then our Rps5-R219D substitution might perturb interaction with eIF2α-Y82 as well as with eIF2α-D77, contributing to the strong Sui- phenotype of Rps5-R219D, in a way that could not be suppressed by the proposed eIF2α-D77R substitution.</p><p>The outcome of the proposed eIF2α-D84S substitution is also uncertain because, in addition to eIF2α-D84’s interaction with Rps5-S223 in the open complex (shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), D84 might interact with Rps5-R219 in the closed complex (as only 5Å separates their side-chains). As such, the proposed eIF2α-D84S substitution could destabilize both the open and closed states with offsetting effects. It is also relevant that these eIF2α residues are probably located in or near the binding pocket for eIF2B and their substitutions could reduce eIF2 recycling and ternary complex formation, which could complicate their effects on accuracy. These uncertainties in the outcome make us reluctant to invest the considerable time and effort required to generate the appropriate SUI2 mutations, construct the double yeast mutants, and carry out the phenotypic tests to compare the double mutant to each single mutant. Instead, we think it would be more profitable to carry out a random mutagenesis of the SUI2 gene and select for mutations that suppress the Sui- phenotype of the Rps5-R219D mutation. This interesting project would be possible once the aforementioned yeast strain can be constructed, but is beyond the scope of the present work.</p><p>Although we cannot dismiss the reviewer’s concern that the Rps5 substitutions cause “partial misfolding or an altered domain orientation in a way that perturbs interaction with eIF2α and not disruption of [specific] uS7: eIF2α interactions”, our finding that the substitutions predicted to preferentially destabilize the open or closed PIC conformation confer the predicted, opposing effects on initiation accuracy in vivo and stability of TC binding to the PIC in vitro argues that the mutations produce quite specific effects on Rps5:eIF2α interaction. It is particularly notable that the Rps5-S223D substitution confers greater than WT stability of TC binding (reduced k<sub>OFF</sub>) (Figure 9C-D), and a greater than WT rate of TC binding in the P<sub>IN</sub> state exclusively at UUG codons (Figure 9E-F); and it seems difficult to imagine that the non-specific effects of this mutation on Rps5 structure envisioned by the referee would produce mutant 40S subunits that perform better than WT subunits in accessing and maintaining a stable P<sub>IN</sub> complex.</p><p>Nevertheless, given that we have not identified the exact contacts between residues in eIF2α and the three Rps5 residues substituted in our study that regulate initiation accuracy, we altered the title of the paper to read “Interface between 40S exit channel protein uS7/Rps5 and eIF2α modulates start codon recognition in vivo”.</p><p><italic>2) The authors place mutants of uS7 D215 by mutagenesis of an RPS5 allele under its own promoter on a low-copy plasmid, and examined the phenotypes in a yeast strain harboring wild-type (WT) chromosomal RPS5 under a galactose-inducible promoter (PGAL1-RPS5+). How much mutant protein (D215 and others) vs. wild-type protein is present in the 40S ribosomes following the shift to glucose medium at the time when these experiments are performed?</italic></p><p>To answer this question, we have conducted Western analysis of Rps5 abundance on strains containing the chromosomal pGAL-RPS5 allele and either the WT RPS5 LEU2 plasmid or empty LEU2 vector. We cultured these strains under the exact conditions of our various experiments, including cell spotting assays, polysome profiling and assays of lacZ reporters.<fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22572.020</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.22572.020">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.22572.020</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-22572-resp-fig1-v2"/></fig></p><p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Author response image 1</xref>, the level of Rps5 in the vector-only strains is reduced to very low levels following growth in Glucose media for the specified incubation used in polysome profiling and reporter assays. While not depleted to the same extent in the inoculum for spotting assays, cells will grow for 10-20 additional generations in glucose when forming colonies from single cells in this assay, which will deplete endogenous Rps5 to a much greater degree. Thus, we are confident that the overwhelming majority of Rps5 present in our glucose-grown cultures is plasmid-encoded. It is not surprising that a small fraction of Rps5 expressed from the pGAL-RPS5 allele remains detectable after prolonged growth on glucose medium. This explains why we did not use this depletion system when purifying the mutant ribosomes needed for biochemical analysis, but rather constructed strains in which chromosomal RPS5 was deleted and the mutant allele was the only source of Rps5 in the cells.</p></body></sub-article></article>
