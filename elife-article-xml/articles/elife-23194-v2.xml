Up to now, AT macrophages (ATM) accumulation was considered to be due to blood infiltration or local proliferation, although the presence of resident hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (Lin-/Sca+/c-Kit+; LSK phenotype) in the AT (AT-LSK) has been reported. By using transplantation of sorted AT-LSK and gain and loss of function studies we show that some of the inflammatory ATM inducing metabolic disease, originate from resident AT-LSK. Transplantation of AT-LSK sorted from high fat diet-fed (HFD) mice is sufficient to induce ATM accumulation, and to transfer metabolic disease in control mice. Conversely, the transplantation of control AT-LSK improves both AT-inflammation and glucose homeostasis in HFD mice. Our results clearly demonstrate that resident AT-LSK are one of the key point of metabolic disease, and could thus constitute a new promising therapeutic target to fight against metabolic disease.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.23194.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.23194.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>adipose tissue</kwd><kwd>diabetes</kwd><kwd>macrophages</kwd><kwd>hematopoiesis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Aviesan/AstraZeneca</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Casteilla</surname><given-names>Louis</given-names></name><name><surname>Cousin</surname><given-names>Beatrice</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Société Francophone du Diabète</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cousin</surname><given-names>Beatrice</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR 16-CE14-0006-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cousin</surname><given-names>Beatrice</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Adipose tissue derived hematopoietic stem cells from diabetic mice transplanted into healthy animals on a normal diet increase inflammation in adipose tissue and trigger the development of a diabetic state in the recipient animals.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>eLife Digest</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Over the last two decades a critical role of adipose tissue macrophages (ATM) in the initiation of the metabolic inflammation, commonly found in highly prevalent chronic diseases such as obesity, has been largely documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chawla et al., 2011</xref>). At the onset of high-fat diet (HFD)-induced metabolic disease, accumulating ATM exhibit an inflammatory phenotype characterized by CD11c expression and this contributes to adipocyte dysfunction and insulin resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lumeng et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lumeng et al., 2008</xref>). In addition, an increased number of ATM worsens features of metabolic disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hirasaka et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kamei et al., 2006</xref>), whereas a reduced number of ATM is associated with a reduced metabolic inflammation and an improved metabolic status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kanda et al., 2006</xref>). Although most of the literature supports the idea that ATM cause disease, accumulating evidences recently show that these ATM also have beneficial effects in obesity. Different molecular tools such as lipid storage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aouadi et al., 2014</xref>), autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fitzgibbons and Czech, 2016</xref>), or program of lysosomal metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Xu et al., 2013</xref>) are used by the ATM to buffer and process excessive amounts of lipids and maintain adipose tissue (AT) homeostasis, in the context of metabolic disease. In addition, an acute inflammatory response in the AT would be essential for adipose remodeling and adipocyte differentiation, and thus for a healthy AT expansion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cinti et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Wernstedt Asterholm et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ye and McGuinness, 2013</xref>).</p><p>It is of common knowledge that macrophages invading the AT originate from the bone marrow (BM) via blood circulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Weisberg et al., 2003</xref>) notably in response to AT inflammation which has been shown to trigger the proliferation of BM hematopoietic progenitors and myelopoiesis, that in turn perpetuate local maladaptive inflammatory response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Nagareddy et al., 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Singer et al., 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">2015</xref>). In addition to monocyte recruitment, recent studies suggest a local regulation and proliferation of ATM, independently of BM precursors. Reduced apoptosis, local proliferation, as well as reduced migration capacity of resident ATM may also lead to their accumulation in obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amano et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hill et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ramkhelawon et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>In physiological state, we and others recently demonstrated the presence of a peculiar functional resident hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (LSK) population in the AT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Han et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Poglio et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">2010</xref>) that can renew innate immune cells and especially macrophages in the AT, via in situ differentiation. We thus hypothesized that accumulating ATM in metabolic disease could partly originate from AT-endogenous hematopoietic activity. To study the role of AT-LSK in the initiation of metabolic inflammation, we transplanted the corresponding cells from diabetic or control mice to their counterpart recipient mice, exploring therefore their capacity to transfer the metabolic phenotype and demonstrate their causal role. We show here that some of the inflammatory ATM that induce metabolic disease development, originate from resident AT-LSK, demonstrating that AT-LSK are one of the key point of metabolic disease. Altogether our results provide a new mechanism for the increase in pro-inflammatory ATM in metabolic diseases and point out AT-LSK as novel regulator of these pathologies.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Inflammatory ATM derived from subcutaneous (sc) AT-LSK differentiation accumulate in HFD mice</title><p>To investigate whether some of the inflammatory macrophages in the AT could originate from AT-LSK during metabolic disease, chimeric mice were generated by using standard repopulation assays as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Poglio et al., 2012</xref>) by injecting 2.10<sup>3</sup> sorted scAT-LSK mixed with 2.10<sup>5</sup> congenic BM cells isolated from congenic CD45 variants.

As expected, after 12 weeks on HFD, body weight (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>) and scAT weight (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>) were slightly increased. Chimeric mice became glucose intolerant as revealed by intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test (ipGTT) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>), their fasting glucose and insulin levels were significantly higher from that of normal chow fed mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d and e</xref>), and their scAT exhibited insulin resistance as shown by reduced glucose utilization in response to insulin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>). In HFD chimeric mice, the ATM number (identified as F4/80<sup>+</sup>/MHCII<sup>+</sup>) significantly increased in the scAT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g</xref>), and was associated with a higher expression of inflammatory cytokines (Il-1b, PAI1 and CCL2) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1h</xref>), confirming that HFD induces a metabolic inflammation in the scAT of chimeric mice.</p><p>To assess the reconstitution efficiency, the chimerism (percentage of CD45.1<sup>+</sup> donor cells among total CD45<sup>+</sup> cells) was determined by flow cytometry in the scAT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1i</xref>) and the BM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1j</xref>), as well as in other metabolic tissues such as visceral AT (pgAT), liver and muscles. The chimerism was similar in the scAT in both control and HFD chimeric mice, whereas in the pgAT it was slightly decreased in HFD group compared to NC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1k</xref>). In the liver and muscles, the chimerism was very low (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1k</xref>), suggesting no significant impact of CD45.1<sup>+</sup> cells in these organs. As expected and previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Poglio et al., 2012</xref>), no CD45.1<sup>+</sup> cells were identified in the BM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1k</xref>). To validate however the animal model of hematopoietic reconstitution, chimerism was also quantified in chimeric mice obtained after transplantation of 2.10<sup>3</sup> sorted BM-LSK mixed with 2.10<sup>5</sup> congenic BM cells isolated from congenic CD45 variants. In these mice, CD45.1<sup>+</sup> cells were observed in both the scAT and the BM as expected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Poglio et al., 2012</xref>), and the chimerism was not significantly modified by the diet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>The origin and the nature of ATM were then determined by analysis of F4/80, MHCII, CD11c and CD206 expression in CD45.1 population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1l</xref>). After 12 weeks of HFD, the population of ATM deriving from scAT-LSK (CD45.1<sup>+</sup>) significantly increased in the scAT, accounting for 56 ± 6% of total scAT-ATM. This accumulation of ATM in the scAT was mainly and specifically due to an increase in inflammatory CD45.1<sup>+</sup>/CD11c<sup>+</sup> macrophage number without any change in anti-inflammatory CD45.1<sup>+</sup>/CD206<sup>+</sup> ATM content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1m</xref>). In addition, no change in pro- and anti-inflammatory ATM originating from the BM, was observed in the scAT of HFD fed chimeric mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1n</xref>). In the pgAT, both CD11c<sup>+</sup> and CD206<sup>+</sup> ATM numbers originating from donor mice were similar in NC and HFD mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2a</xref>). Accordingly, the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in pgAT was not significantly modified by the HFD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2b</xref>).

Here we show the crucial role of AT-LSK in the development of metabolic disease.

The induction of AT inflammation and glucose intolerance has already been described after transfer of activated antigen-presenting cells into normal mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Moraes-Vieira et al., 2014</xref>). However we underline here the specific role of scAT-LSK derived-ATM, since their specific depletion in diabetic mice ameliorates metabolic features. In chimeric mice transplanted with CD11c-DTR scAT-LSK and treated with DT, the improvement of glucose tolerance was not associated with a decrease in fasting blood glucose and insulin concentrations. This set of data is in line regarding the etiology and kinetic of insulin resistance since both features are the consequences of a highly integrated set of mechanisms. Indeed, over the time course of HFD-induced hyperglycemia and insulin resistance, absorptive hyperglycemia develops first after one week then followed by fasting hyperglycemia 4 weeks later (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Garidou et al., 2015</xref>). Fasting hyperinsulinemia follows the same kinetic. Therefore, the improvement of glucose tolerance after only one week of DT treatment was expected, while the improvement of fasting glycemia and insulinemia should require a longer period of treatment.</p><p>Our results demonstrate that the accumulation of ATM in HFD mice, which is a largely described hallmark of obesity and diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lumeng et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Weisberg et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cani et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fujisaka et al., 2009</xref>) originates at least in part from resident AT-LSK and occurs very early in the disease development and is mainly due to enhanced progenitor proliferation. Although our data point out an important role for these ATM derived from endogenous AT-hematopoieis, they do not rule out a possible role for other cell/macrophages subsets originating from the medullar hematopoiesis, or other cell processes. Indeed, in HFD chimeric mice, ATM derived from AT-LSK account for approximately 50% of total ATM, showing that in the AT, macrophages arise from different sources. This is in line with the recent literature showing that beside the contribution of circulating myeloid progenitors originating from the BM, in situ ATM proliferation can be responsible at least in part, for accumulating ATM in obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amano et al., 2014</xref>). Other evidences suggest the possible involvement of preadipocytes that exhibit characteristics of macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Charrière et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cousin et al., 1999</xref>) and that upon appropriate signals may efficiently and rapidly adapt to function as macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Boutens and Stienstra, 2016</xref>).

Euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamps were performed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Burcelin et al., 2004</xref>). Briefly, the mice were fasted for 6 hr and were infused at a rate of 18 or 4 mU.kg-1.min-1 of insulin for 3 hr. Simultaneously, a 20% glucose solution was infused to maintain a steady glycemia. To determine an index for the individual glucose use rate, a flash injection through the femoral vein of 30 µCi per mouse of D-2- [3 hr]deoxyglucose was performed 60 min before the end of the infusions. Individual tissue glucose uptake measurement in scAT and pgAT was determined as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kamohara et al., 1997</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>RNA extraction and Real-Time PCR</title><p>Total RNA from mouse tissues was isolated by Qiazol extraction and purification was done using RNeasy minicolumns. For quantitative real-time PCR analysis, RNA was reverse transcribed using a cDNA Reverse Transcription kit, SYBR Green PCR Master Mix, and 300 nmol/L primers on an Applied Biosystem StepOne instrument. Relative gene expression was calculated by the ∆∆CT method, normalized to 36B4, and expressed in percent of control values.

The number of animals used in each study is indicated in the figure legends. Studies were not randomized, and analyses were blinded to investigators. Chimeric mice exhibiting a chimerism &lt;1% were excluded from the analysis. All results are given as means +/− sem. Normality was checked using the D’Agostino and Pearson omnibus normality test. Variance between groups was compared. Statistical differences were measured using an unpaired two-sided Student's t-test, or a nonparametric test (Mann–Whitney) when data did not pass the normality test, or when variances between groups were different. All statiscical analyses were performed in GraphPad Prism 5.0 software and a two-tailed <italic>P</italic> value with 95% confidence interval was acquired. p&lt;0.05 was considered as significant.

As suggested by the reviewers, flow cytometry was used to quantify LSK cells, and myeloid progenitors expressing CD45.1, based on previously described phenotypes (van Galen et al., Nature, 2014), as well as Ki67+ ATM. Data are shown on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> in the revised version of the manuscript, and detailed in the first paragraph of the subsection “ATM derived from scAT-LSK accumulate in AT of HFD mice due to early proliferation of progenitor cells”. Briefly, after 3 months of HFD, the number of total CD45.1+ LSK and myeloid progenitor cells were similar to NC values. The rate of proliferating ATM is similar in both groups of mice. This result suggests that the dynamic phase of the increase in CD45.1+ATM number observed after 3 months of HFD occurs earlier in the pathogenesis. Indeed, after a few days of HFD, CD45.1+ LSK and myeloid progenitor cell numbers were increased due to an enhanced proliferation, whereas the number and the proliferation of CD45.1 ATM were not yet changed. These results have been included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and in the aforementioned paragraph, and in the fourth paragraph of the Discussion. We were however unable to identify the signal triggering the proliferation of LSK cells and myeloid progenitors.</p><p><italic>Secondly, in order to conclude that the accumulation of ATM in the scAT is mainly due to increased CD45.1+/CD11c+ (donor), the author should also look at the changes in CD45.2+/CD11c+ (recipient) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</italic> </p><p>To conclude that the accumulation of ATM in the scAT is mainly due to increased donor cells (CD45.1+), we have quantified as requested by the reviewers, the number of CD45.2+ ATM. This has been added on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1N</xref>, and in the fourth paragraph of the subsection “Inflammatory ATM derived from subcutaneous (sc) AT-LSK differentiation accumulate in HFD mice”. The graph shows that the number of CD45.2+ cells is similar in the scAT of HFD and NC chimeric mice.</p><p><italic>Also, there is no chimerism in bone marrow following transplantation of AT-LSK, but the effect seen on metabolism could also be due to chimerism in other metabolic tissues. What is the chimerism in liver and visceral adipose tissue? (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>)?</italic> </p><p>As mentioned by the reviewers, the HFD-induced metabolic effect in chimeric mice may also be due to chimerism in other metabolic tissues. We therefore determined CD45.1 chimerism in perigonadal AT (pgAT), liver and muscle. As shown on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref>, chimerism in liver and muscles is very low, suggesting no significant impact of CD45.1+ cells in these organs. In contrast, chimerism in pgAT reaches 15% in NC chimeric mice and is slightly decreased in HFD group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref>). We thus analyzed CD45.1+ pgATM number and the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in this fat pad. Both CD11c+ and CD206+ ATM numbers originating from donor mice were similar in NC and HFD mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Accordingly, the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the pgAT was not significantly modified by the HFD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). These results have been included in the third and fourth paragraphs of the subsection “Inflammatory ATM derived from subcutaneous (sc) AT-LSK differentiation accumulate in HFD mice”, and demonstrate that perturbation of endogenous myelopoiesis in the scAT may be the main cause of the HFD-induced metabolic change.</p><p><italic>Finally, CD11c is also highly expressed in dendritic cells, so using the CD11c promoter driven DTR mouse model may be problematic. At least the dendritic cell profile in WAT should be presented in the transplantation study with or without DT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Also in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2(G</xref>), only quantification of F4/80+MHCII+CD11c+CD45.2+ scATM is provided.</italic> </p><p>As mentioned by the reviewers, CD11c is also highly expressed in dendritic cells (DC). The number of donor- and recipient-DC was therefore evaluated in the scAT of chimeric mice, based on the phenotype F4/80-/CD11c+/MHCII+, and included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J and 3K</xref>. The CD45.2+ DC number (donor origin) was slightly decreased in treated mice, whereas the CD45.1+DC number remained unchanged. However, since the HFD did not increase the CD45.1+ DC number in the scAT of chimeric mice, we think that this decrease may not play a key role in the pathogenesis. These results have been included in the second paragraph of the Results subsection “Specific depletion of ATM derived from scAT-LSK improves glucose metabolism”.</p><p><italic>However, the F4/80+MHCII+CD11c+CD45.1+ scATM profile should also be included to allow readers to evaluate if there is any change in BM-originated cells in the WAT with or without DT treatment.</italic> </p><p>To evaluate whether the DT treatment induces changes in the BM originating ATM in the scAT, the number of CD45.1+/CD11c+ ATM has been included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref> and in the second paragraph of the subsection “Specific depletion of ATM derived from scAT-LSK improves glucose metabolism”. As expected, DT treatment induces no modification of BM-originated ATM and DC.</p></body></sub-article></article>
