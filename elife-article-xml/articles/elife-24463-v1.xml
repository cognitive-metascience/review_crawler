protein import and export, and other specialized processes. Discovery of these proteins by traditional biochemical fractionation can be plagued with contaminants and loss of key components. Using peroxidase-mediated proximity biotinylation, we captured and identified endogenous proteins on the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) and endoplasmic reticulum membrane (ERM) of living human fibroblasts. The proteomes of 137 and 634 proteins, respectively, are highly specific and highlight 94 potentially novel mitochondrial or ER proteins. Dataset intersection identified protein candidates potentially localized to mitochondria-ER contact sites. We found that one candidate, the tail-anchored, PDZ-domain-containing OMM protein SYNJ2BP, dramatically increases mitochondrial contacts with rough ER when overexpressed. Immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry identified ribosome-binding protein 1 (RRBP1) as SYNJ2BP’s ERM binding partner. Our results highlight the power of proximity biotinylation to yield insights into the molecular composition and function of intracellular membranes.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.24463.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.24463.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>microscopy</kwd><kwd>promiscuous enzymatic labeling</kwd><kwd>subcellular regions</kwd><kwd>APEX2</kwd><kwd>mitochondria-ER junctions</kwd><kwd>mitochondria-associated membrane</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 CA186568</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hung</surname><given-names>Victoria</given-names></name><name><surname>Lam</surname><given-names>Stephanie S</given-names></name><name><surname>Ting</surname><given-names>Alice Y</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HHMI Collaborative Innovation Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hung</surname><given-names>Victoria</given-names></name><name><surname>Lam</surname><given-names>Stephanie S</given-names></name><name><surname>Udeshi</surname><given-names>Namrata D</given-names></name><name><surname>Svinkina</surname><given-names>Tanya</given-names></name><name><surname>Guzman</surname><given-names>Gaelen</given-names></name><name><surname>Carr</surname><given-names>Steven A</given-names></name><name><surname>Ting</surname><given-names>Alice Y</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 GM077465</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mootha</surname><given-names>Vamsi Krishna</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Graduate Research Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hung</surname><given-names>Victoria</given-names></name><name><surname>Lam</surname><given-names>Stephanie S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000005</institution-id><institution>U.S. Department of Defense</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate (NDSEG) Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lam</surname><given-names>Stephanie S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Investigator</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mootha</surname><given-names>Vamsi Krishna</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>One minute biotinylation with APEX2 peroxidase in living cells identifies established and new components of mitochondrial and ER membranes;

High quality proteomic maps of each of these membranes—the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) and the ER membrane (ERM)—would be extremely valuable for clarifying the sub-organellar location of known mitochondrial and ER-resident proteins, and likely identify novel proteins not previously associated with either organelle. Yet such maps remain elusive. Each organelle has been mapped in its entirety via mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics multiple times (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Calvo and Mootha, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2010</xref>). However, even proteomes such as MitoCarta 2.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Calvo et al., 2016</xref>), which appear close to complete with respect to mitochondrial matrix, inner membrane, and intermembrane space (IMS) proteins, under-represent OMM proteins, likely because the outer membrane is depleted during purification of the organelle. OMM material can be specifically enriched for MS analysis through osmotic shock lysis of the outer membrane of purified mitochondria followed by sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Niemann et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Schmitt et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Zahedi et al., 2006</xref>), but this fractionation protocol is highly disruptive and imperfect, which compromises the quality of the resulting datasets. Furthermore, mammalian OMMs have never previously been mapped. For whole-ER datasets, the propensity of ER-derived microsomes to co-centrifuge with virtually all other cellular compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Sadowski et al., 2008</xref>) has rendered these proteomes, which include both ERM and ER lumen contents, similarly unclean with poor overlap between independent datasets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2010</xref>). Rapoport and coworkers were able to obtain a highly specific list of 25 abundant ERM proteins via microsome enrichment from dog pancreas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Shibata et al., 2010</xref>), but these represent only a miniscule fraction of the proteins thought to reside at mammalian ER membranes.</p><p>Because OMM and ER membranes are so difficult to purify to homogeneity, and existing enrichment protocols also lose large fractions of resident proteins, these membranes are ideal candidates for an alternative proteomic approach known as proximity biotinylation. In this approach (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), which bypasses biochemical fractionation and organelle purification altogether, a 27 kDa engineered monomeric peroxidase called APEX2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lam et al., 2015</xref>) is genetically targeted to the cellular region of interest. Addition of hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) and a membrane-permeant substrate for APEX2, biotin-phenol (BP), results in the covalent biotinylation of endogenous proteins within a few nanometers of APEX2. Because labeling is performed over a one-minute time window while cells and organelles are intact, spatial relationships between proteins are preserved, resulting in their specific tagging by the biotin probe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hung et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Loh et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Rhee et al., 2013</xref>). After labeling, cells are lysed, and biotinylated proteomes are enriched with streptavidin beads and analyzed by MS.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.24463.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>APEX2 proteomic labeling scheme and characterization of APEX2 fusion constructs on the ER and outer mitochondrial membranes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Scheme of APEX2-catalyzed biotinylation at the endoplasmic reticulum membrane (ERM, top) and outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM, bottom). APEX2 (green) was targeted to the ERM facing the cytosol, via fusion to the N-terminal 27 amino acids of the ER-resident protein P450 oxidase 2C1 and to the OMM via fusion to the C-terminal 31 amino acids of mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein MAVS. Live cells were pre-incubated with biotin-phenol (red B = biotin) for 30 min, and hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) was added to initiate the biotinylation reaction for 1 min. Cells were quenched and then lysed, and the biotinylated proteins were enriched with streptavidin beads and analyzed by mass spectrometry. IMS, intermembrane space. IMM, inner mitochondrial membrane.

Therefore, in this study, the proteomic mapping should be specific for proteins on the outer leaflet of the ER membrane and not tag proteins inside the ER lumen. The OMM contains porins that allow free passage of molecules &lt;5 kDa, including the BP radical. Hence, we expect some biotinylation of IMS-resident proteins and some IMM (inner mitochondrial membrane) proteins with IMS exposure. However, no BP radical should enter the mitochondrial matrix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><p>Here, we describe our efforts to map the proteomes of the OMM and ERM in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells via stable expression of APEX2 fusion constructs and BP labeling for one minute. We used a ratiometric strategy employing Stable Isotope Labeling by Amino acids in Cell culture (SILAC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hung et al., 2014</xref>) to quantify the relative proximity of each MS-detected protein to the OMM or ERM versus cytosol. Together, the two proteomes identified 94 potentially novel mitochondrially- or ER-localized proteins, one of which we validated by fluorescence microscopy.</p><p>Additionally, we intersected our OMM and ERM lists in an attempt to identify candidate proteins that reside at mitochondria-ER contact sites. Mitochondria-ER contacts have long been observed by electron microscopy (EM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Copeland and Dalton, 1959</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Csordás et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Meier et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Shore and Tata, 1977</xref>), and patches of ER membrane co-purify with mitochondria (the mitochondria-associated membrane, or MAM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Vance, 1990</xref>). More recent work has shown that mitochondria-ER contact sites are functionally important for calcium homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Rizzuto et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Szabadkai et al., 2006</xref>), lipid biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kornmann et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lewin et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Rusiñol et al., 1994</xref>), cellular apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Iwasawa et al., 2011</xref>), and regulation of mitochondrial fission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Friedman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Murley et al., 2013</xref>). Kornmann et al. used a genetic screen in yeast to discover the ERMES (ER-Mitochondria Encounter Structure) complex, an ER-mitochondrial tether in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kornmann et al., 2009</xref>). However, mammalian cells do not have homologs to the ERMES complex. More generally, only a handful of proteins localized to mitochondria-ER contact sites have been identified with confidence in any cell type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Paillusson et al., 2016</xref>). A high-quality inventory of the protein components within this important subcellular region would advance the field of mammalian mitochondria-ER contact biology.</p><p>By mining our OMM and ERM proteomic data, we discovered that the tail-anchored OMM protein synaptojanin-2 binding protein SYNJ2BP (also known as OMP25 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Nemoto and De Camilli, 1999</xref>)) was highly enriched by <italic>both</italic> OMM- and ERM-targeted APEX2. Follow-up experiments showed that overexpression of SYNJ2BP in HEK 293T cells leads to a dramatic increase in mitochondrial contacts specifically with rough ER membrane, mediated by SYNJ2BP’s binding partner on the ER membrane, RRBP1.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Targeting APEX2 to the OMM and ERM and characterization of biotin labeling</title><p>To target APEX2, we fused the gene to 31- and 27-amino acid targeting domains of the native OMM and ERM proteins MAVS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Seth et al., 2005</xref>) and cytochrome P450 2C1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ahn et al., 1993</xref>), respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Correct localization was confirmed by fluorescence microscopy in conjunction with mitochondrial and ER markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).

After cell fixation, targeted APEX2 catalyzed the oxidative polymerization and local deposition of 3,3’-diaminobenzidine (DAB) in the presence of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. The DAB polymer recruits electron-dense osmium, which provides contrast for EM. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> shows that APEX2-OMM stains the outer membrane of mitochondria, while ERM-APEX2 darkly stains the ERM. The DAB/osmium density of ERM-APEX2 spreads into the cytosol but is excluded from the ER lumen, confirming that APEX2 faces the cytosol rather than the ER lumen, as designed.</p><p>Because APEX2 has a weak dimerization tendency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lam et al., 2015</xref>), high expression levels on organellar membranes can give rise to undesired aggregation or morphological perturbation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lam et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Snapp et al., 2003</xref>). To avoid these, we generated HEK 293T cells stably expressing APEX2-OMM or ERM-APEX2 at low levels following lentiviral infection. To check for adequate biotinylation activity under these low expression conditions, we pre-incubated APEX2 cells with biotin-phenol for 30 min and added H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> for 1 min, then fixed and stained with neutrAvidin-fluorophore conjugate to visualize biotinylated proteins. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> shows that each sample displayed robust biotinylation, as visualized by neutrAvidin staining, compared to a negative control with APEX2 omitted. Next, we repeated the live cell biotinylation, lysed the cells, and analyzed the whole cell lysates by streptavidin blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Each APEX2 fusion biotinylates a wide range of endogenous proteins, and encouragingly, the banding patterns are distinguishable from one another and from that of APEX2-NES, a soluble whole-cytosol APEX2 control (NES is a nuclear export sequence).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Proteomic mapping of the OMM and ERM</title><p>Because the OMM and ERM are ‘open’ subcellular domains continuous with the cytosol and lacking membrane enclosures to trap the biotin-phenoxyl radical, we employed our previously described ‘ratiometric SILAC’ approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hung et al., 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">2014</xref>) to ensure high spatial specificity in proteomic mapping. In this approach, each protein is quantified not only by its extent of biotinylation by targeted APEX2 (APEX2-OMM or ERM-APEX2), but also by its extent of biotinylation by a reference APEX2 construct, in this case cytosolic APEX2-NES. Thus, a cytosolic, non-OMM protein such as kinesin may be weakly biotinylated by APEX2-OMM, but if it is biotinylated to a greater extent by the more proximal APEX2-NES, it will be filtered out of the final OMM proteome.</p><p>Before generating proteomic samples, we tested our streptavidin enrichment conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).

After boiling in SDS to elute from beads, the biotinylated proteomes were run on SDS-PAGE and visualized by silver stain. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> shows that our protocol enriches much more protein from experimental samples than from negative controls with APEX2, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, or BP omitted.

We used SILAC ratios, which normalize for variations in absolute protein abundance across replicates, to quantify parameters of interest: log<sub>2</sub>(H/L) for the extent of protein biotinylation by APEX2-OMM or ERM-APEX2; log<sub>2</sub>(M/L) for the extent of protein biotinylation by APEX2-NES; and most importantly, log<sub>2</sub>(H/M) for the <italic>relative</italic> biotinylation of any given protein by OMM- or ERM-targeted APEX2 versus cytosolic APEX2-NES, which is a measure of protein proximity to the OMM or ERM versus the open cytosol.</p><p>The log<sub>2</sub>(H/L) and log<sub>2</sub>(H/M) values were well-correlated across independent replicates (R<sup>2</sup> ≥ 0.74) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Histograms of log<sub>2</sub>(H/L) values showed broad, right-shifted distributions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B and C</xref>). To check for enrichment of known mitochondrial and ER proteins, we plotted in green the subset of detected proteins known to be ER- or mitochondrially-localized, and we plotted in red the subset of detected proteins expected to be false positives. The green (true positive) populations were clearly right-shifted compared to the red (false positive) populations, indicating appropriate enrichments in both log<sub>2</sub>(H/L) and log<sub>2</sub>(H/M) for both OMM and ERM replicates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D and E</xref>).</p><p>To define OMM and ERM proteomes, we calculated SILAC ratio cut-offs, above which we retained proteins (because they are likely true positives) and below which we removed proteins (because they are likely false positives).

First, we analyzed the mitochondrial specificity of the OMM proteome. In the entire human proteome, 8% of proteins have mitochondrial annotation according to MitoCarta (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Pagliarini et al., 2008</xref>), the Gene Ontology Cell Component (GOCC) database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ashburner et al., 2000</xref>), our APEX-mapped mitochondrial matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Rhee et al., 2013</xref>) or IMS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hung et al., 2014</xref>) proteomes, or literature. In our OMM proteome, 84% have prior mitochondrial annotation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). The remaining 16% of proteins could be either false positives or ‘mitochondrial orphans’ (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 1c</xref>)—true positives not previously known to be mitochondrial but identified as such by our study. Several of these 22 proteins have ER annotation and thus could be ER proteins that interact with mitochondria. For example, CANX and TMX1 have both been enriched in MAM preparations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lynes et al., 2012</xref>). We obtained an antibody against one of the mitochondrial orphans, C2CD3, and confirmed by immunofluorescence staining that it is indeed localized to mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). This result has interesting implications, as C2CD3 is associated with the centriole during interphase and mitosis and is required for recruitment of distal appendage proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Ye et al., 2014</xref>); our result hints at a possible link between mitochondria and cilium formation.</p><p>We next characterized the sub-mitochondrial specificity of the OMM proteome. Of the known human mitochondrial proteins with OMM, IMS, IMM, or matrix sub-mitochondrial annotation according to GOCC (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Supplementary file 2c</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ashburner et al., 2000</xref>), 18% have OMM annotation. By the same method of analysis, 58% of our OMM proteome has prior OMM annotation, indicating that we have enriched OMM proteins. As expected, our dataset also includes some well-known IMS and IMM proteins (e.g. OXPHOS-related subunits NDUFA8, NDUFB1, NDUFB6, NDUFB7, NDUFB10, NDUFB11, CYC1, COX6C, COX4l1, SCO1/2, CYCS) because biotin-phenoxyl radicals generated by APEX2-OMM can pass through porins in the OMM and enter the IMS. Consistent with the impermeability of the IMM to biotin-phenoxyl radicals, we did not enrich any mitochondrial matrix-resident proteins.</p><p>To characterize the specificity of our ERM proteome, we calculated the fraction of proteins with prior secretory pathway annotation, according to GOCC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ashburner et al., 2000</xref>), Phobius (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Käll et al., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">2007</xref>), and literature. This value is 89%, compared to only 51% for the entire human proteome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). We then characterized the sub-secretory specificity of the ERM proteome. Of known human secretory proteins with ER, Golgi apparatus, or plasma membrane annotation according to GOCC (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Supplementary file 2d</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ashburner et al., 2000</xref>), 13% have ER annotation; by the same metric, 46% of our ERM proteome has ER annotation, which indicates that we have enriched for ER-resident proteins over Golgi apparatus and plasma membrane proteins. Complete exclusion of these latter proteins is not expected, as many are translated on or near the ER membrane before trafficking to their final destination.</p><p>Finally, we inspected our ERM list for soluble proteins known to reside in the ER lumen and detected only 13 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Supplementary file 2e</xref>). Previous studies showed that two of these proteins, ERO1L (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cabibbo et al., 2000</xref>) and HSP90B1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Reddy et al., 1999</xref>), have protease-accessible regions on the outer surface of ER-derived microsomes. This suggests that they actually possess regions topologically facing the cytosol, consistent with our data, and inconsistent with their current GOCC annotations. The other 11 ER lumen proteins we enriched may have previously-unrecognized cytosolic exposure, or perhaps they are biotinylated by ERM-APEX2 during retro-translocation to the cytosol upon ERAD (ER-associated protein degradation) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Tsai et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>The coverage of our OMM proteome was estimated by first generating a true positive list of 79 well-established OMM proteins by literature curation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Supplementary file 2a</xref>). We found that over half (53%) of these proteins were present in our OMM proteome. Analogously, the coverage of the ERM proteome was calculated using a curated list of 90 established ERM proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Supplementary file 2b</xref>), resulting in 44% coverage. As discussed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hung et al., 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">2016</xref>), factors known to limit coverage may also be at play here, including failure to biotinylate proteins that are sterically shielded in the live cell context, and removal of proteins that are dual-labeled (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary files 1f and 1g</xref>), i.e. strongly biotinylated by <italic>both</italic> targeted APEX2 and cytosolic APEX2, resulting in log<sub>2</sub>(H/M) values that do not pass the log<sub>2</sub>(H/M) cut-offs shown in the bottom right quadrants of the scatter plots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>.</p><p>In summary, like previous proteomes mapped with APEX, the OMM and ERM proteomes obtained in this study feature high specificity paired with moderate coverage and should be valuable resources for biologists studying signaling processes on mitochondrial and ER membranes.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Overlap between OMM and ERM proteomes</title><p>Our focus on ER and mitochondrial membranes provides a unique opportunity to mine for insights into contact regions between these organelles.

Several MAM proteomic studies have generated lists up to 1212 proteins long (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Poston et al., 2013</xref>).

Encouragingly, our intersected list includes MFN2, PTPIP51 (also known as FAM82A2), MFF, TMX1, and ATAD3A—proteins linked to mammalian mitochondria-ER contact sites by previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">de Brito and Scorrano, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Friedman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Issop et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Krols et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Stoica et al., 2014</xref>).

Proteins with a role in tethering might increase the extent of mitochondria-ER overlap upon overexpression. Hence, we obtained V5 epitope-tagged plasmids for 40 proteins in our list, and for the 38 genes with correct sequences, we overexpressed them via Lipofectamine 2000 transfection in COS-7 cells. We used fluorescence microscopy to check for increased overlap between mitochondria and ER markers in these cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 1e</xref>). Only a single protein in our screen produced such a phenotype, synaptojanin-2 binding protein, or SYNJ2BP. Interestingly, SYNJ2BP also had the highest combined enrichment across both OMM and ERM proteomes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 1e</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, low expression of SYNJ2BP-V5 produces cells with distinct and well-separated ER and mitochondrial morphologies, whereas high expression causes mitochondria and ER to re-organize and strongly co-localize. We obtained the same results using a SYNJ2BP overexpression plasmid lacking any epitope tag, showing that the observed phenotype is tag-independent (data not shown). To examine this effect at higher spatial resolution, we repeated the assay using EM, which more clearly visualizes the spatial relationships between ER and mitochondrial membranes. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref> show that SYNJ2BP-V5 overexpression causes ER membranes to dramatically ‘zip up’ and form extended contacts along mitochondrial surfaces. Quantitation across ≥7 fields of view per condition showed that the median percentage of mitochondrial surface in contact with ER increased from 6% to 25% per mitochondrion upon SYNJ2BP-V5 overexpression. We were also very intrigued to find that the induced mitochondria-ER contacts were highly uniform in width (~45 nm spacing between mitochondria and ER membranes), and nearly all were filled with ribosomes.<fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.24463.006</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Identification of SYNJ2BP and RRBP1 as a potential mitochondria-ER tethering complex.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) SYNJ2BP overexpression assay in COS-7 cells.

Previously, we used APEX to map the proteomes of the human mitochondrial matrix (&gt;94% mitochondrial specificity, 85% coverage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Rhee et al., 2013</xref>)) and IMS (&gt;94% mitochondrial specificity, 65% coverage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hung et al., 2014</xref>)). The OMM is the most open/unbounded of these mitochondrial sub-compartments and therefore is the most challenging in terms of spatial specificity. However, we again achieved high specificity (&gt;84% specificity for mitochondrial proteins over cytosolic proteins, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), attesting to the small labeling radius of APEX2-catalyzed biotinylation. As with previous studies using ratiometric SILAC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hung et al., 2014</xref>) or iTRAQ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Loh et al., 2016</xref>) for quantitation, our coverage of known OMM proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Supplementary file 2a</xref>) was modest (53%), primarily because our workflow filters out potentially dual-localized proteins that are comparably biotinylated by APEX2-OMM and cytosolic APEX2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 1f</xref>). This demonstrates a significant limitation of our method, as many cytosolic factors known to play key roles in dynamic processes at the OMM or the ERM will be missed. Conversely, the spatial stringency of this methodology may enable the study of changes in protein localization to or away from the membrane in response to stimuli such as the induction of cell stress.</p><p>To demonstrate the utility of our OMM and ERM proteomic datasets to further biological discovery, we focused on mitochondria-ER contact sites, a cellular sub-domain of intense study that has been functionally linked to diverse processes. Amongst the 68 proteins that appeared in both OMM and ERM proteomes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 1e</xref>), SYNJ2BP was the most highly enriched, and displayed an intriguing phenotype in an overexpression screen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>). Further investigation revealed that the new mitochondria-ER contacts induced by SYNJ2BP overexpression were highly uniform in width (~45 nm) and filled with ribosomes. These contacts were dependent on the presence of RRBP1 (likely to be SYNJ2BP’s binding partner on the ERM) and sensitive to puromycin. While our results collectively suggest that SYNJ2BP-RRBP1 may be a novel tether that joins rough ER and mitochondrial membranes and links these contact sites to protein translation, our data are not conclusive for a number of reasons. First, all our observations were obtained under non-physiological conditions of SYNJ2BP-V5 overexpression. Second, we do not observe either protein enriched at mitochondria-ER contact sites, which is expected for a true tethering complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Eisenberg-Bord et al., 2016</xref>). As suggested above, it is possible that specific isoforms or post-translationally modified variants of each protein do concentrate at contact sites, but we currently lack the tools to examine this. Third, we attempted several loss-of-function assays, using CRISPR to knock out SYNJ2BP or RRBP1, but failed to observe changes in cell growth rate, protein synthesis rate, or the extent of mitochondria-ER contacts by fluorescence microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). Perhaps such experiments would be more meaningful if performed in cell types with a greater quantity of native mitochondria-rough ER contacts than HEK 293T cells display (only 1.3% of the total mitochondrial perimeter is in contact with rough ER, according to quantitation in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). For instance, Wang et al. used HT-1080 fibrosarcoma cancer cells with abundant mitochondria-rough ER contacts by EM to observe a decrease in these contacts upon AMFR (GP78) knockdown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Wang et al., 2015</xref>). Interestingly, HT-1080 cells have particularly high levels of SYNJ2BP mRNA compared to other cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Wu et al., 2013</xref>). Another possible explanation for our negative results is that redundant mitochondria-ER tethers or signaling proteins may obscure the effect of SYNJ2BP/RRBP1 knockout. The concept of ‘auxiliary tethers’ has been proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Eisenberg-Bord et al., 2016</xref>)—proteins that are not required for the formation of a contact site, but do still form tethers and have function.</p><p>Nevertheless, our preliminary data stemming from our ERM and OMM proteomic studies raise an intriguing hypothesis and direct focus to mitochondria-rough ER contacts specifically, which have so far received less attention than mitochondria-smooth ER contacts. Previously characterized mammalian tethers, such as IP3R-GRP75-VDAC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Szabadkai et al., 2006</xref>), PTPIP51-VAPB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Stoica et al., 2014</xref>), BAP31-FIS1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Iwasawa et al., 2011</xref>), and MFN2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">de Brito and Scorrano, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Filadi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Naon et al., 2016</xref>) appear to be specific for ribosome-excluded mitochondria-smooth ER contacts. However, mitochondria-rough ER contacts have long been observed by EM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Csordás et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Meier et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Montisano et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Shore and Tata, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Giacomello and Pellegrini, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Wang et al., 2015</xref>). It is worth noting that historically, the term ‘mitochondria-associated membranes’ (MAMs) referred simply to the sub-fraction of ER microsomes that co-purify with mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Vance, 1990</xref>). Intriguingly, in that initial study, comparisons of SDS-PAGE profiles between MAMs and rough or smooth ER samples found a qualitatively closer resemblance between MAMs and smooth ER. Subsequent work in the field has often equated MAMs to the diverse mitochondria-ER contact sites observed by EM, but there is no direct evidence in the literature that purified MAMs encompass all mitochondria-ER contact sites including both rough and smooth ER.</p><p>It seems likely that mitochondrial contacts with rough or smooth ER create distinct subdomains with unique specialized functions, only a subset of which are captured via traditional biochemical purification. In support of this, SYNJ2BP, which we identified in our study, has not previously been enriched in any MS-based MAM proteomic study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Horner et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Liu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Poston et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Zhang et al., 2011</xref>). Indeed, the majority of functions thus far attributed to mitochondria-ER contact sites—e.g. lipid shuttling and calcium signaling—would be expected at smooth ER contacts due to the closer membrane proximity and the specialized role of smooth ER in cholesterol metabolism and calcium storage. To date, no specific function has been assigned to mitochondria-rough ER contacts.</p><p>If SYNJ2BP-RRBP1 is a true tether that binds to ribosomes at mitochondria-rough ER contacts, can we speculate about its possible function? Perhaps these contacts are sites for translation of dual-targeted proteins destined for both mitochondria and ER, such as BCL2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Krajewski et al., 1993</xref>). Alternatively, they could host the translation of mitochondrially-destined proteins, such as integral OMM or IMM proteins, that would benefit from machinery on or near the ERM. Translation activity increases the extent of SYNJ2BP-RRBP1 interaction, bringing the mitochondria closer to the rough ER, which could facilitate targeting of protein products to the mitochondria.</p><p>In conclusion, our study extends APEX2 proximity biotinylation to unbounded intracellular compartments with high spatial specificity, produces two high-quality proteomic maps of the human OMM and ERM, and demonstrates that these proteomic datasets can be mined for novel mitochondria-ER junction protein candidates.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plasmids and cloning</title><p>Standard restriction enzyme digest and ligation with T4 DNA ligase or Gibson cloning was used to generate all constructs.

After 1.5 days, fresh HEK 293T or HeLa cells stably expressing Cas9 were plated in 24-well plates at ~30% confluency. The next day, the supernatant of each lentiviral culture was collected and centrifuged at 10,000xg for 10 min. The supernatant, which contained the lentivirus, was transferred to a new tube. Cells stably expressing Cas9 were grown in 250 µl of the lentivirus supplemented with 250 µl of full cell culture media for 2 days, after which they were split and expanded into media containing 8 µg/ml blasticidin S HCl and either 0.5 µg/ml puromycin for HeLa cells or 1 µg/ml puromycin for HEK 293T cells. Media was changed to fresh drug-containing media each day for five days. Knockdown efficiency was assessed by western blotting with an anti-SYNJ2BP antibody (Sigma Aldrich, catalog no.

A magnetic rack was used to isolate the beads. The beads were then washed twice with 1x PBS, pH 7.4. After the second wash was removed, 1 mg of whole cell lysate was added to the beads for each of the four samples. Co-IP lysis buffer containing 1 mM PMSF and 1x protease inhibitor cocktail was added so that the final volumes for all of the samples were equal. The tubes were rotated at room temperature for 1 hr. The magnetic rack was used to pellet the beads and collect the flowthrough samples, and then the beads were washed three times with co-IP lysis buffer.

Briefly, nearby MS scans with similar precursor m/z values were merged if they were within ±60 s retention time and ±1.4 m/z tolerance. If MS/MS spectra were not within 750–4000 Da precursor MH+ range or had sequence tag lengths &gt;0, they were excluded from the search parameters. MS/MS spectra were searched against UniProt Human complete isoform database appended with 150 common laboratory contaminants. Carbamidomethylation and iTRAQ labeling of N-terminal and internal lysines were set as fixed modifications. N-terminal acetylation and methionine oxidation were set as variable modifications. Minimum matched peak intensity was set to 30%, with a pre-cursor mass tolerance of ±20 ppm. Individual spectra were automatically assigned a confidence score using the Spectrum Mill autovalidation module. The score at the peptide mode was based on a target-decoy false discovery rate (FDR) of 1%.</p><p>For data analysis, contaminants and proteins identified as reverse hits were removed. iTRAQ ratios representing SYNJ2BP-V5 vs non-targeted gRNA (116/114) and SYNJ2BP-V5 vs SYNJ2BP knockout (117/115) were median normalized and compared. For each experiment, only proteins with two or more unique quantified peptides and two or more of both the 116/114 and the 117/115 iTRAQ ratios were considered ‘detected’ and retained for further analysis.

In cells depicting clear nuclear contrast as a result of the co-transfection APEX2-NLS marker, the mitochondrial perimeter for each clearly defined mitochondrion was outlined by drawing a freehand line and measured. Any segment of an ER tubule less than 80 nm from a mitochondrion was considered to be in contact with it. Rough ER was defined as an ER tubule with ribosomes along the visible segment of that tubule, regardless of which side of the tubule they were on. Smooth ER lacked ribosomes for the visible segment of that tubule. To measure the distance in between mitochondria and the ER, several evenly spaced measurements about 10–20 nm apart were taken along the length of the contact, with the first and last measurements marking the beginning and end of the contact. All of the measurements taken along this length were averaged to give the average distance in between the two organelles. These values were then averaged to find the average distance between the two organelles for a given sample. The mitochondrial perimeter demarcated by the first and last measurements was retraced with a freehand line to determine the length of the mitochondrion-ER contact.</p><p>For each sample, the fraction of mitochondrial surface in contact with ER was measured in two ways.

This analysis was repeated with mitochondria specifically for mitochondria-rough ER contacts and mitochondria-smooth ER contacts.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Anna Akhmanova (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, David Pagliarini (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission. Although we recognize that you have submitted this manuscript as a Tools and Resources paper, the consensus view is that your conclusions require some functional validation as detailed below.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript by Hung et al. describes the use of a previously developed technique, proximity biotinylation, to discover novel proteins localized to cellular compartments with relative inaccessibility to standard experimental techniques including the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) and the endoplasmic reticulum membrane (ERM). Through purification of mitochondria from various tissues followed by mass spectrometry-based proteomics and computational approaches, and via previous APEX2-based studies by these authors, much of the mitochondrial proteome has been established and recorded in databases such as MitoCarta2.0. However, probing cytosol-facing proteins of the OMM and ERM presents a challenge due to the loss or depletion of outer membrane proteins during the purification process. Another issue lies in the poor overlap observed between proteomic MS datasets for ER extracts. Proximity biotinylation relies on probing cells using an engineered APEX2 peroxidase genetically modified to target a specific cellular region, a biotin-phenol (BP) substrate, and hydrogen peroxidase (H2O2). Upon the addition of H2O2 for 1 minute, APEX2 converts BP to BP radicals which can then covalently tag proteins in their immediate vicinity. Cells are lysed and the biotinylated proteins are enriched using streptavidin beads followed by MS analysis.</p><p>In the present manuscript, the authors construct modified APEX2 peroxidases with targeting signals for native OMM and ERM proteins, as well as a cytosolic control APEX2 containing only a nuclear export sequence. Localization of the constructs was verified via fluorescence microscopy. The authors used Stable Isotope Labelling with Amino acids in Cell culture (SILAC) to radiometrically quantify the relative proximity of each detected protein to their targeted location versus the cytosol. The experiments resulted in the detection of 137 potential OMM proteins, and 634 potential ERM proteins for a total of 94 potentially novel proteins between both locations. The authors chose to focus on closer inspection of the proteins involved in mitochondria-ER contact sites and found SYNJ2BP, a protein of unknown function, was enriched in both the OMM and ER proteomes. Overexpression of SYNJ2BP in HEK 293T cells resulted in increased mitochondrial contacts with the rough endoplasmic reticulum. To uncover the binding partner of SYNBP1, the authors utilized the CRISPR/Cas9 system to remove endogenous SYNBP1 and expressed V5-tagged SYNBP1 in Hela cells followed by immunoprecipitation with anti-V5 beads. The interacting proteins were analyzed through LC-MS/MS. Of the 56 discovered proteins, the authors reasoned that only RRBP1 contained the characteristics necessary to act as the ER binding partner for SYNBP1, presenting a potentially novel mammalian tethering complex between the mitochondria and ER.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers were all in agreement that this was elegant, technically sound investigation into a timely and important area of organellar communication. The reviewers commented on the particularly impressive specificity of the authors' approach, and the use of relevant controls for contact site enriched proteins. The narrative style, including extensive open discussion of the experimental limitations of the work, was also well received.

This has been a difficult problem that we have worked on for the past two years (trying to obtain a phenotype upon KO). We already have a tremendous amount of negative data: we compared cell growth rates for SYNJ2BP and RRBP1 KO cell lines to wild-type cells and found no difference. To compare protein synthesis levels, we looked at labeling of the amino acid analog azidohomoalanine (AHA) using the Click-iT assay in SYNJ2BP or RRBP1 KOs. To assay mitochondrial OXPHOS activity, we evaluated comparative growth of KO cells in media supplemented with glucose (conditions favoring glycolysis) or galactose (favoring OXPHOS). We have now included these negative data in new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>. From these efforts, we have a growing understanding of what biological processes are likely <italic>not</italic> related to the SYNJ2BP-RRBP1 interaction, which should be useful information for scientists who wish to follow up on our study.</p><p>We also would like to point out that it is unclear what known mitochondria-ER functions would be affected by the specific subtype of mitochondria-rough ER contacts we observe. Current understanding of the functions of mitochondria-associated membranes (MAMs) has not included any functions specific to mitochondria-rough ER contacts. Lipid shuttling, calcium signaling, and the control of OXPHOS associated with calcium signaling are all functions traditionally associated with mitochondria-smooth ER contact sites. Conventional wisdom has even delineated MAM distances to &lt;30 nm, which is far smaller than the large distances we observe in our induced mitochondria-rough ER contacts. It is unclear that disruption of these mitochondria-rough ER contacts would even result in a detectable known phenotype. In light of these limitations, we believe that elucidation of function of such a heretofore uncharacterized organellar interaction will be far from straightforward, and indeed will require such a high level of resources and time as to warrant a separate project and publication. We have expanded our discussion of mitochondria-rough ER versus mitochondria-smooth ER contacts in the revised text.</p><p><italic>2) In their IP-MS experiments, the authors identified 56 interactors for SYNJ2BP.

We have already attempted these experiments but were stymied by technical difficulties. SYNJ2BP is a small, 145 amino acid protein, of which 88 residues form the cytosol-facing PDZ domain. Our previous attempts to truncate this protein with full or partial deletions resulted in severely impaired expression or targeting of this protein to mitochondria. Given that the PDZ domain of SYNJ2BP forms almost the entire cytosolic domain, we believe it is reasonable to infer that the interaction involves this domain. Likewise, RRBP1 is a protein that possesses up to 54 copies of a decapeptide repeat, which has rendered cloning and amplification of this gene product utterly intractable in our hands despite numerous attempts. This has prevented us from mutating the PDZ-binding domain and overexpressing RRBP1 to do the converse mapping experiment.</p></body></sub-article></article>
