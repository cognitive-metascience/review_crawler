Heme-regulated eIF2α kinase (HRI) controls translation by phosphorylating eIF2α. Here, we investigate the global impact of iron, heme, and HRI on protein translation in vivo in murine primary erythroblasts using ribosome profiling. We validate the known role of HRI-mediated translational stimulation of integratedstressresponse mRNAs during iron deficiency in vivo. Moreover, we find that the translation of mRNAs encoding cytosolic and mitochondrial ribosomal proteins is substantially repressed by HRI during iron deficiency, causing a decrease in cytosolic and mitochondrial protein synthesis. The absence of HRI during iron deficiency elicits a prominent cytoplasmic unfolded protein response and impairs mitochondrial respiration. Importantly, ATF4 target genes are activated during iron deficiency to maintain mitochondrial function and to enable erythroid differentiation. We further identify GRB10 as a previously unappreciated regulator of terminal erythropoiesis.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46976.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Red blood cells use a molecule called hemoglobin to transport oxygen around the body. To make hemoglobin, cells require iron to build a component called heme. If an individual does not get enough iron in their diet, the body cannot produce enough red blood cells, or the cells lack hemoglobin. This condition is known as iron deficiency anemia, and it affects around one-third of the world’s population.</p><p>Researchers did not know exactly how iron levels control red blood cell production, though several proteins had been identified to play important roles. Heme forms in the cell's mitochondria: the compartments in the cell that supply it with energy. When heme levels in a developing red blood cell are low, a protein called HRI reduces the production of many proteins, most importantly the proteins that make up hemoglobin. HRI also boosts the production of a protein called ATF4, which switches on a set of genes that help both the cell and its mitochondria to adapt to the lack of heme. In turn, HRI and ATF4 reduce the activity of a signaling pathway called mTORC1, which controls the production of proteins that help cells to grow and divide.</p><p>To understand in more detail how iron and heme regulate the production of new red blood cells, Zhang et al. looked at immature red blood cells from the livers of developing mice. Some of the mice lacked the gene that produces HRI, and some experienced iron deficiency. Comparing gene activity in the different mice revealed that in the developing blood cells of iron-deficient mice, HRI largely reduces the rate of protein production in both the mitochondria and the wider cell. At the same time, the increased activity of ATF4 allows the mitochondria to carry on releasing energy and the cells to continue developing. Zhang et al. also found that a protein that inhibits the mTORC1 signaling pathway needs to be active for the new red blood cells to mature.</p><p>Overall, the results suggest that drugs that activate HRI or block the activity of the mTORC1 pathway could help to treat anemia. The next step is to test the effects that such drugs have in anemic mice and cells from anemic people.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>heme-regulated eIF2a kinase</kwd><kwd>erythropoiesis</kwd><kwd>cytosolic and mitochondrial translation</kwd><kwd>integrated stress response</kwd><kwd>ATF4</kwd><kwd>mitochondrial respiration</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000062</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RO1 DK087984</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Jane-Jane</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000062</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 DK103794</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sankaran</surname><given-names>Vijay G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R33 HL120791</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sankaran</surname><given-names>Vijay G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The heme and HRI-mediated eIF2aP–ATF4 integrated stress response in erythropoiesis has a major global impact, especially under the stress condition of iron deficiency.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Iron-deficiency anemia is estimated to affect one-third of the global population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Camaschella, 2019</xref>). Iron and heme are key components of hemoglobin, the primary oxygen transport molecule, and their cellular levels impact globin synthesis and red blood cell production. Specifically, globin is transcriptionally regulated by BACH1 (BTB Domain and CNC homolog 1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Igarashi and Sun, 2006</xref>) and is regulated at the level of protein translation by HRI (heme-regulated eIF2α kinase) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen, 2007</xref>), both of which are heme-sensing proteins.</p><p>During heme deficiency that is induced by dietary iron deficiency (ID) in mice, HRI is activated and phosphorylates the α subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor eIF2 (eIF2α) to inhibit translation of α- and β-globin mRNAs, thereby preventing proteotoxicity resulting from heme-free globin chains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Han et al., 2001</xref>). Meanwhile, phosphorylated eIF2α (eIF2αP) selectively enhances the translation of activating transcription factor 4 (<italic>Atf4</italic>) mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Suragani et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen, 2014</xref>). This coordinated translational repression of general protein synthesis with the specific translational enhancement of <italic>Atf4</italic> mRNA by eIF2αP is termed the integrated stress response (ISR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Harding et al., 2003</xref>). The ISR is a universal response to several types of cellular stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pakos-Zebrucka et al., 2016</xref>) and it is initiated by members of the eIF2α kinase family. Besides HRI, mammalian cells have three additional eIF2α kinases, which are expressed in distinct tissues and which combat specific physiological stress. PKR responds to viral infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kaufman, 2000</xref>), GCN2 senses nutrient starvations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hinnebusch, 1996</xref>), and PERK is activated by endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ron and Harding, 2000</xref>). All four eIF2α kinases respond to oxidative and environmental stresses.</p><p>In the erythroid lineage, HRI expression increases during differentiation, with higher expression occurring in hemoglobinized erythroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liu et al., 2008a</xref>). Starting at the basophilic erythroblast stage, HRI is the predominant eIF2α kinase and is expressed at levels that are two orders of magnitude greater than those of the other three eIF2α kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kingsley et al., 2013</xref>). At these stages, HRI is responsible for over 90% of eIF2α phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Liu et al., 2008b</xref>). HRI-ISR is necessary for effective erythropoiesis during ID and acts by reducing oxidative stress and promoting erythroid differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Suragani et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>). Furthermore, HRI-ISR represses the mTORC1 signaling that is activated by the elevated erythropoietin (Epo) levels occurring during ID specifically in the erythroid lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, HRI coordinates two key translation-regulation pathways, eIF2αP and mTORC1, during ID. However, the exact molecular mechanisms through which iron and heme regulate erythropoiesis are incompletely understood.</p><p>Mitochondria not only are the energy powerhouses of the cell, but also are necessary for amino acid metabolism, nucleotide production, and the biosynthesis of heme and iron-sulfur clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Shpilka and Haynes, 2018</xref>). Translational regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis by mTORC1 is particularly important for erythropoiesis because of the high demand of heme for hemoglobin production and oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liu et al., 2017</xref>). However, the roles of HRI and eIF2αP in mitochondrial biogenesis and function are still unknown.</p><p>Transcriptional regulation during erythropoiesis has been studied extensively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kerenyi and Orkin, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">An et al., 2014</xref>), but much less is known about the translational control of this process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mills et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Khajuria et al., 2018</xref>). Ribosome profiling (Ribo-seq) has emerged as a powerful tool that can be used to interrogate translation genome-wide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ingolia et al., 2009</xref>). Here, we performed Ribo-seq and mRNA-seq in primary basophilic erythroblasts to investigate how in vivo translation is regulated by iron, heme, and HRI in order to gain a global understanding of the molecular mechanisms that govern erythropoiesis. We hypothesized that by globally surveying the landscape of translational and concomitant transcriptional changes that occur in the context of HRI deficiency (comparing the changes seen in iron replete (+Fe) or iron deficiency (–Fe) conditions), we could gain important insights into the mechanisms through which iron and heme regulate the process of erythropoiesis. Our results demonstrate that heme and HRI mediate the translation of both cytosolic and mitochondrial ribosomal protein mRNAs. Furthermore, HRI–ATF4 mediated gene expression is essential during ID to prevent the accumulation of unfolded proteins in the cytoplasm, to maintain mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, and to enable erythroid differentiation in developing basophilic erythroblasts.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Overview of Ribo-seq and mRNA-seq data</title><p>Beginning at the basophilic erythroblast stage, erythropoiesis is finely regulated by iron and heme levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chiabrando et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Muckenthaler et al., 2017</xref>).

We took advantage of the fact that cycloheximide (CHX) inhibits only cytoplasmic and not mitochondrial protein synthesis. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, the rate of total protein synthesis in Hri<sup>–/–</sup> –Fe erythroid cells at 15–60 mins was greater than that in Wt –Fe cells. Interestingly, the rate of protein synthesis in cells under CHX treatment was also greater in Hri<sup>–/–</sup> –Fe erythroid cells than in Wt-Fe cells. Furthermore, protein synthesis under CHX treatment was inhibited by chloramphenicol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>), a selective inhibitor of mitochondrial translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Richter et al., 2013</xref>).

As iron and heme are cofactors for several enzymes in the respiratory electron transport chain, the oxygen consumption rates of primary erythroid cells from bone marrows of +Fe and –Fe mice were measured using the Seahorse assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Wt erythroid cells were able to maintain their oxygen consumption rate in ID (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). There were no significant differences between Wt –Fe and Wt +Fe cells in either the basal or maximal respiration rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). By contrast, Hri<sup>–/–</sup> erythroid cells displayed decreased basal and maximal respiration under both +Fe and –Fe conditions, as compared to Wt erythroid cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–B</xref>). The similar extent to which respiration was reduced in Hri<sup>–/–</sup> +Fe cells and Hri<sup>–/–</sup> –Fe cells was somewhat unexpected because the phenotype of Hri<sup>–/–</sup>+Fe in vivo is milder than that of Hri<sup>–/–</sup> –Fe cells. This may be due in part to the stress experienced by Hri<sup>–/–</sup> +Fe cells during the Seahorse assays. Nonetheless, the significant difference between Wt -–Fe and Hri<sup>–/–</sup> –Fe cells demonstrates that HRI is necessary to maintain mitochondrial respiration under –Fe conditions. This impaired mitochondrial respiration in Hri<sup>–/–</sup> erythroid cells was not due to the reduced mitochondrial mass in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>).

The ATF4 protein induces the expression of three genetic pathways to activate mitochondrial UPR (UPR<sup>mt</sup>), reprogram mitochondrial metabolism and reduce oxidative stress, all of which enables adaptation to ID and erythroid differentiation. Strikingly, the expression of ATF4 target genes is most highly activated in ID and requires HRI. Thus, assessment of the global genome-wide gene expression of primary EBs in vivo reveals that HRI-ISR contributes most significantly to adaptation to ID.

Here, we report a global, unbiased assessment of iron, heme, and HRI-mediated translational and transcriptional alterations in primary EBs in vivo. We show that <italic>Eif2ak1</italic> and <italic>Atf4</italic> mRNAs are abundantly expressed in EBs and are poised to respond to ID during terminal erythroid differentiation. HRI is a major regulator of gene expression in erythropoiesis: only limited changes of mRNA expression are observed in Hri<sup>–/–</sup> EBs during ID. Our global analysis supports a distinct model of heme and HRI-regulated translational control involving several separate and interacting pathways that allow EBs to adapt to systemic ID (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Activation of HRI in ID elicits three distinct pathways of translation. First and foremost, inhibition of protein synthesis prevents the accumulation of unfolded proteins and maintains protein homeostasis. Second, induction of <italic>Atf4</italic> mRNA translation increases the expression of genes encoding mitochondrial UPR, redox homeostasis and metabolic reprogramming in order to maintain mitochondrial respiration and erythroid differentiation. Third, repression of Epo-mTORC1 signaling inhibits protein synthesis and enables erythroid differentiation.</p><p>The present study identifies a previously unappreciated role of HRI in the translational regulation of cytosolic and mitochondrial ribosomal proteins during erythropoiesis. We observed, at a global level, additional evidence of mTORC1's involvement in translational regulation in Hri<sup>–/–</sup> –Fe EBs, further supporting the role of HRI-ISR in repressing Epo–mTORC1 signaling to mitigate ineffective erythropoiesis during ID (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>). Importantly, we find that HRI–eIF2αP also controls the translation of 18 cytosolic RP mRNAs, which are not known targets of mTORC1. Consistent with our results, mTORC1-independent translation of RP mRNAs requiring GCN2-eIF2αP has been reported recently in several cancer cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Li et al., 2018</xref>). Interestingly, the translation of many mitochondrial RPs and oxidative phosphorylation complexes is also increased in Hri<sup>–/–</sup> –Fe EBs. Furthermore, HRI directly inhibits mitochondrial protein synthesis in addition to repressing mTORC1 activity. Thus, both the HRI–eIF2αP and the mTORC1 pathways contribute to the increased mitochondrial protein synthesis in Hri<sup>–/– </sup>–Fe EBs.</p><p>Increased protein synthesis in Hri<sup>–/–</sup> –Fe EBs requires additional protein folding capacity for heme-free globins and increased import into mitochondria of mitochondrial protein precursors synthesized in the cytoplasm. Indeed, Hri<sup>–/–</sup> –Fe EBs develop a prominent cytoplasmic UPR, as suggested here by the increased expression of cytoplasmic chaperones in these cells. These results are consistent with and help to identify the mechanisms underlying our previous reports of insoluble inclusions and protein precipitates accompanied by increased levels of Hsp70 and Hsp90 in erythroid cells of Hri<sup>–/–</sup> and <italic>eAA</italic> mice in ID (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Han et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>). Nevertheless, activation of cytoplasmic UPR alone is not sufficient to compensate for the loss of HRI.</p><p>Translational regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis by mTORC1 is particularly important for erythropoiesis because of the high demand for heme for hemoglobin production and the prevention of oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liu et al., 2017</xref>). Most mitochondrial proteins are encoded by nuclear genes and synthesized by cytosolic ribosomes as precursors that are imported into mitochondria. Mitochondrial DNA encodes only 13 proteins, which are all components of the respiratory chain and oxidative phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Calvo and Mootha, 2010</xref>). Therefore, the nuclear and mitochondrial synthesis of proteins that are involved in respiratory complexes needs to be coordinated to avoid excessive uncomplexed subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Priesnitz and Becker, 2018</xref>). In mitochondrial disorders, mitochondrial UPR (UPR<sup>mt</sup>) is activated to coordinate with nuclear transcription in order to enable restoration of mitochondrial function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Shpilka and Haynes, 2018</xref>). Interestingly, ISR is also activated in mitochondrial dysfunction and mediates UPR<sup>mt</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fiorese et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Quirós et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dogan et al., 2014</xref>). However, the eIF2α kinase responsible for UPR<sup>mt</sup> remains unknown. Our observations that Hri<sup>–/–</sup> erythroid cells have impaired mitochondrial function and no significant increase in the expression of mitochondrial chaperones suggest that HRI may be the eIF2α kinase responsible for the activation of UPR<sup>mt</sup> and might thereby contribute to the proper maintenance of the mitochondrial function of erythroid cells under ID.</p><p>While inhibition of protein synthesis by the activation of HRI is the first line of defense in reducing proteotoxicity in ID, the second arm of the HRI-ISR, inducing ATF4 target gene expression as a consequence of enhanced translation of <italic>Atf4</italic> mRNA, is the most highly activated transcriptome pathway in ID. These ATF4 target genes are largely unstudied factors with yet unknown functions in erythropoiesis. They are involved in redox and amino acid metabolism, particularly one-carbon metabolism. Interestingly, these ATF4-ISR genes are also upregulated under mitochondrial stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Quirós et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bao et al., 2016</xref>) in order to maintain mitochondrial redox homeostasis.

By unbiased and comparative analysis of ribosome profiling and mRNA-seq datasets in mouse fetal liver basophilic erythroblasts (EBs) with or without ID, they validated the known regulator ATF4 as the most differentially translated mRNA in HRI and iron deficiencies. They also identified additional new pathways such as ribosomal protein mRNA translation. The authors then focused on HRI-ATF4 and described ATF4 as the major transcription factor under HRI translational control likely through uORF regulation. They also showed that heme-HRI-ATF4 pathway, but not iron-regulated pathways such as IRE-containing mRNAs, mediate the major translational and transcriptional changes in response to iron deficiency. Finally, they identified <italic>Grb10</italic> as one of the ATF4 target genes that may function to inhibit Epo-mTORC1 in ID.</p><p>Overall, this study presents a set of interesting findings related to the role of heme-HRI-ATF4 pathway in erythropoiesis and iron deficiency anemia. These results not only validated ATF4 as a major factor in coordinating protein translation and gene expression during ID, but also identified regulators such as <italic>Grb10</italic> in regulating erythropoiesis for the adaptation to iron deficiency anemia. In this regard, this manuscript expanded our understanding of the underlying basis for iron deficiency or ineffective erythropoiesis. The ribosome and mRNA profiling studies were appropriately designed and carefully analyzed. There are several important questions remained to be addressed related to the mechanistic details how ATF4 regulates <italic>Grb10</italic> and how <italic>Grb10</italic> regulates Epo-mTORC1 in the context of erythropoiesis. Moreover, the functional roles of these pathways in more physiologically relevant conditions need to be established. If the remaining questions can be adequately addressed, this study may provide important insights into heme-HRI-mediated pathways in iron deficiency and ineffective erythropoiesis, and be potentially impactful.</p><p>1) It is difficult to follow and somewhat confusing on the various comparisons of the ribosome profiling and mRNA-seq in WT+Fe, HRI<sup>-/-</sup>+Fe, WT-Fe and HRI<sup>-/-</sup>-Fe (Figures 2-4, Figure 2—figure supplement 1). It would be helpful if the authors could summarize the findings in a diagram to list the most differentially regulated pathways and/or genes in the pairwise comparison. This diagram can be combined in Figure 7 or as a separate figure.</p><p>2) When comparing differentially expressed mRNAs in HRI and iron deficiencies, the authors identified <italic>Grb10</italic> as one of the most upregulated ATF4 target genes in WT relative to HRI<sup>-/-</sup> basophilic erythroblasts. To establish the functional role of <italic>Grb10</italic> in erythropoiesis, a single shRNA (G3) was used to knockdown <italic>Grb10</italic> expression in ex vivo cultured erythroid cells. The authors measured phosphorylated AKTS473, which is slightly increased, as the evidence for the role of <italic>Grb10</italic> as the negative regulator of mTORC1 signaling. It is important to characterize in greater details how <italic>Grb10</italic> regulate mTORC1 or other pathways in erythropoiesis. The authors cited previous studies (Plasschaet and Bartolomer, 2015, and Yan et al., 2016) as evidence that <italic>Grb10</italic> is part of a feedback mechanism to inhibit mTORC1, however it is important to determine whether similar or different mechanism may be utilized in the context of erythropoiesis. How does ATF4 regulate <italic>Grb10</italic> transcription (or translation) in erythroid cells? Moreover, additional shRNAs should be screened to validate the original findings. Since this part of the study could provide potentially new insights compared to the already established HRI-ATF4 pathway in erythropoiesis, more in-depth mechanistic studies are required.</p><p>3) Since all the functional studies were performed using ex vivo cultured erythroid cells with defined medium and cytokines, the functional importance of the identified pathway (HRI-ATF4-<italic>Grb10</italic>) should be assessed in more physiologically relevant settings in vivo, such as in the already established <italic>Grb10</italic> knockout mouse models or in the transplant setting.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The manuscript by Zhang et al. describes an analysis of global mechanisms regulating protein translation by iron, heme and HRI in primary erythroblasts. HRI has been studied for many years by Dr. Chen, and it represents a component of cellular machinery that senses alterations in heme. Other cellular mechanisms of high importance also exist, including the IRE-IRP system, as well as transcriptional mechanisms involving the heme-regulated repressor BACH1. A major conclusion of the RNA-seq and Ribo-seq analyses is that iron deficiency most highly activates the integrated stress response and ATF4-mediated gene expression. While the studies appear to have been rigorously conducted, and the overall problem is significant, this major conclusion is not surprising based on prior published work. The global analyses did not transform or extend existing knowledge in a major way, which represents a significant limitation. Recommendations are presented below to build upon the work to elevate novelty and broad interest.</p><p>1) Subsection “Upregulation of in vivo translation of ISR mRNAs in <italic>Wt</italic> EBs compared to <italic>Hri</italic><sup>-/-</sup> EBs”, last paragraph – The authors conclude that diet-induced iron deficiency does not significantly affect gene expression through IREs/IPRs in primary erythroblasts. I do not see how the global measurements and correlations support this rather strong conclusion. At the very least, this needs to be fleshed out more effectively.</p><p>2) &quot;ATF4 target gene GRB10&quot;. GRB10 has been published by Mehta et al., 2017, to be a direct GATA2 target gene in primary mouse erythroid precursor cells. This may influence thinking regarding the role of GRB10 in mechanisms of interest to the authors.</p><p>3) Figure 6 – as noted above, the finding that Integrated Stress Response and ATF4 are important players does not transform existing knowledge. A limited loss of function analysis was performed with retrovirally-expressed shRNAs to evaluate GRB10 function. Only one shRNA was effective in reducing GRB10 levels in the differentiation culture. It will be important not to rely on results obtained with a single shRNA, especially given the recent findings by Traxler et al. (2017) Blood 131, 2733-2736 that shRNAs can often &quot;non-specifically&quot; inhibit erythroid terminal differentiation independent of their specific target – and the GRB10 knockdown phenotype with the single shRNA is inhibition of terminal differentiation.</p><p>4) Given the datasets generated, and the fact that GRB10 has been published as a GATA2 target gene in erythroid precursor cells and as a regulator of cKit signaling in HSCs (Yan et al., 2016), can additional loss of function studies be conducted to yield discoveries that considerably extend the existing work – for example to implicate proteins and/or pathways that have not been described as being important in the erythroid (or hematopoietic) system?</p><p>5) The Discussion was quite extensive, but does not seem to effectively integrate existing knowledge of translational and transcriptional mechanisms mediating iron- and heme-dependent cell regulation. Integration is important, since we know about various components, but very little is known about integration.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The authors present extensive data concerning the differential translational of mRNA during erythtroid differentiation of mouse fetal liver cells in vitro. Although the results are interesting, they add little to the current knowledge vis-à-vis the main proteins involved in erythroid differentiation. The text of the manuscript is flooded with an overwhelming amount of data that is difficult to read, analyze and summarize. In other words, in the middle of so much data, it is hard pinpoint the main take-home message of the current article.</p><p>The authors claim that they have noticed only small changes in the translation of IRE-containing mRNAs when comparing normal and iron deficient conditions. The authors specifically mentioned that there are no differences in the translation of ALAS2 and TfR1 mRNA when compared normal and iron deficient conditions. The authors should extend the discussion regarding these findings, since they are in conflict with what has been shown in the literature in the past 30 years.</p><p>Moreover, it is necessary to better explain how the iron deficient condition was attained. According to the Materials and methods section, mice were kept on an iron deficient diet for an unspecified period, following which it was observed that the embryos obtained from these mice were &quot;pale&quot;. The visual appearance of the embryos, although not unimportant, cannot be used as measure of the iron status of the embryos. A simple measurement of hemoglobin levels in the fetal livers would have directly answered that the cells were lacking iron.</p><p>Furthermore, the authors mentioned several papers published in 2015 and 2016 claiming that the protein NCOA4 is important for erythroid differentiation, since it is required for iron mobilization from ferritin. It is important to stress that these are questionable findings since the NCO4A knockout mice show hypochromic microcytic anemia only when exposed to an iron deficient diet; this is not at all surprising. In this context, unfortunately, the authors disregard extensive literature supporting the view that ferritin does not supply iron for heme and hemoglobin synthesis. These references are neglected by the authors when discussing the rate of translation of ferritin in their in vitro system.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what now follows is the decision letter after the authors submitted for further consideration.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;HRI coordinates translation necessary for protein homeostasis and mitochondrial function in erythropoiesis&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.

They also re-organized the presentation of the Ribo-seq and RNA-seq comparison in the first part of the manuscript. These efforts significantly improved both the strength of new conclusions and the clarity of the main messages. In particular, the new results support an important role of the heme-induced kinase HRI in coordinating integrated stress response (ISR), translation of cytosolic and mitochondrial proteins, and Epo-mTORC1 signaling during normal and iron-deficiency-induced ineffective erythropoiesis. These new findings significantly extend previous results, and provide new insights into the coordinated regulation of protein translation, mitochondria function, and ISR during normal and ineffective erythropoiesis. They also provide additional evidence for the role of GRB10 as a negative feedback regulator of Epo-mTORC1 and an ATF4 target gene during ID, and discuss other mechanisms (e.g. transcriptional regulation by ATF4 and/or GATA2) that may contribute to GRB10 regulation during erythropoiesis.</p><p>Overall, the authors provide a nice resource of transcriptional (mRNA-seq) and translational (Ribo-seq) changes in response to HRI loss during normal and ID-induced ineffective erythropoiesis, which will be of great interest to the erythropoiesis and a broader community. The new findings related to HRI-coordinated control of protein translation, ISR and mitochondrial function advance our current understanding of mechanisms that regulate normal and ineffective erythropoiesis.</p><p>There are several remaining questions and suggestions for area of improvement, which if addressed, will further enhance the strength of the conclusions and the potential impact of this study.</p><p>1) Is mTORC1 activity increased in <italic>Hri</italic><sup>-/-</sup> -Fe erythroid cells compared to <italic>Hri</italic><sup>-/-</sup> +Fe? From GSEA analysis of differentially translated mRNAs between <italic>Hri</italic><sup>-/-</sup> -Fe and <italic>Wt</italic> -Fe (Figure 3C), it seems that mTORC1 signaling is significantly elevated, consistent with the role of HRI in negative regulation of mTORC1. However, it is unclear from the current analysis whether any changes in mTORC1 activity between <italic>Hri</italic><sup>-/-</sup> -Fe and <italic>Hri</italic><sup>-/-</sup> +Fe erythroid cells, or between <italic>Wt</italic> -Fe and <italic>Wt</italic> +Fe cells. Furthermore, the authors should consider measuring mTORC1 activity directly by the level of phosphorylated 4EBP1 and/or other downstream targets as in Figure 2E.</p><p>2) In the Discussion section (second paragraph), the authors discussed that the mitochondrial genes regulated by HRI are different from the targets of mTORC1, and suggested that HRI may regulate translation of mitochondrial genes independent of mTORC1. This statement is a bit confusing. The evidence supporting this statement is based on the lack of overlapped targets for mitochondria related proteins in <italic>Hri</italic><sup>-/-</sup> -Fe vs mTORC1 (Figure 3D). Since HRI may negatively regulate mTORC1 through GRB10, one would expect to see some overlapped targets if HRI-GRB10-mTORC1 mechanism plays a significant role in erythropoiesis. Furthermore, HRI loss may also impact transcriptional programs and/or indirectly affect mitochondrial proteins independent of protein translation. The authors should revise the statement and/or provide additional clarification.</p><p>3) To determine the effect of <italic>Hri</italic> loss on mitochondria, the authors used mitotracker to estimate mitochondrial mass. It is important to note that mitotracker signal may also be affected by mitochondrial activity. In Figure 4—figure supplement 1, it seems that the mtDNA content is modestly increased in <italic>Hri</italic><sup>-/-</sup> -Fe cells. Is the difference statistically significant? If the difference is significant, the results would suggest that <italic>Hri</italic> loss affect both mitochondrial biogenesis (mtDNA) and mitochondrial mass (or activity).</p><p>4) Some parts of the manuscript are still difficult to follow and confusing with various comparisons. The authors are advised to further improve the clarity and presentation of the manuscript by removing and/or simplifying non-essential texts, and focus more on main messages. The Discussion is extensive and could be further compressed.</p><p>5) Several typos and grammar errors are noted: Figure 3D legend &quot;Venn&quot; diagram, subsection “Increased cytoplasmic and mitochondrial protein synthesis but reduced mitochondrial respiratory activity in <italic>Hri</italic><sup>-/-</sup>-Fe EBs”, first paragraph etc.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The manuscript is improved and represents a significant extension of prior work on HRI function in the context of erythropoiesis. Dr. Chen has conducted foundational work on HRI for many years, and this new work provides a new dimension that largely could not have been predicted from known mechanistic or biological concepts. As HRI was implicated recently by Gerd Blobel as a regulator of fetal hemoglobin production, there is renewed interest in the function of this important protein.</p><p>One minor, but significant, comment remains, which was not addressed in the revision.</p><p>The authors indicate in the cover letter and have related text in the manuscript that their study demonstrates: &quot;These additional results strengthened our finding GRB10 as a previously unappreciated regulator of fetal liver erythropoiesis&quot;.</p><p>However, GRB10 was already published in Mehta et al., 2017, to be a direct GATA2 target gene in primary fetal liver erythroid precursor cells. Based on this work and known GRB10 biochemical activities, GRB10 is not a &quot;previously unappreciated regulator of fetal liver erythropoiesis&quot;. This work should be cited in the context of what was already known about GRB10 in erythropoiesis.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46976.029</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the first round of peer review follow.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>While the reviewers found that many aspects of your work were well done, they raise concerns about the degree to which it advances prior studies of similar mechanisms.

Our global study supports an integrated model of heme and HRI regulated translation in developing erythroblasts for the adaptation to systemic ID (Figure 8). Activation of HRI in ID coordinates three distinct pathways of translation. First and foremost, inhibition of protein synthesis to avoid accumulation of unfolded proteins and maintain protein homeostasis. Second, induction of ATF4 mRNA translation to increase gene expression for mitochondrial unfolded protein response, redox homeostasis and metabolic reprogramming in order to maintain mitochondrial respiration and erythroid differentiation. Third, repression of Epo- mTORC1 signaling to inhibit protein synthesis and cell proliferation.</p><p>We provide new data on the novel findings of heme and HRI mediated translation of mRNAs of both cytosolic and mitochondrial ribosomal proteins in ID concomitant with inhibition of protein synthesis in both cellular compartments (Figure 3). The absence of HRI in ID elicits a prominent cytoplasmic unfolded protein response (UPR) in attempt to reduce proteotoxicity of excessive unfolded proteins produced as evidenced by the comprehensive induction of several families of cytoplasmic chaperones (Figure 5A-B).</p><p>Importantly, neither endoplasmic reticulum (ER) nor mitochondrial chaperones were induced. The lack of ER UPR is consistent with our earlier observation that erythroblasts do not display significant ER stress and that HRI is activated by cytoplasmic, but not ER stress (Lu L, Han AP, Chen JJ. Mol Cell Biol. 2001;21(23):7971-7980).</p><p>Integrated stress response (ISR) of eIF2a kinase has been shown to be activated in mitochondrial stress and mediates mitochondrial UPR. To date, the eIF2a kinase responsible for mitochondrial UPR remains unknown. The lack of mitochondrial UPR in HRI deficiency shown in our present study supports the notion that HRI is necessary for the induction of mitochondrial UPR in ID.</p><p>We also discover that Hri -/- primary erythroid cells have impairment of mitochondrial respiration (Figure 4). Importantly, ATF4 target genes are most highly activated during ID including serine-glycine biosynthesis, one carbon metabolism and redox homeostasis, for the maintenance of mitochondrial function and enable erythroid differentiation. We now have two shRNAs for Grb10 knockdown study, and showed that the additional shRNA_G7 worked similarly to shRNA_G3 in increasing cell proliferation and inhibiting erythroid</p><p>differentiation (Figure 7). These additional results strengthened our finding of GRB10 as a previously unappreciated regulator of fetal liver erythropoiesis connecting between HRI and erythropoietin signaling during ID.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>[…] 1) It is difficult to follow and somewhat confusing on the various comparisons of the ribosome profiling and mRNA-seq in WT+Fe, HRI<sup>-/-</sup>+Fe, WT-Fe and HRI<sup>-/-</sup>-Fe (Figures 2-4, Figure 2—figure supplement 1).

Similar results were obtained by G7 and G3 shRNA in increasing cell proliferation and inhibition of erythroid differentiation (Figure 7).

These references are neglected by the authors when discussing the rate of translation of ferritin in their in vitro system.</p></disp-quote><p>We have removed the discussion about IRE/IRP and NCOA4 in the updated manuscript and focus on HRI pathway.</p><p>[Editors' note: the author responses to the re-review follow.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>[…] 1) Is mTORC1 activity increased in Hri<sup>-/-</sup> -Fe erythroid cells compared to Hri<sup>-/-</sup> +Fe? From GSEA analysis of differentially translated mRNAs between Hri<sup>-/-</sup> -Fe and Wt -Fe (Figure 3C), it seems that mTORC1 signaling is significantly elevated, consistent with the role of HRI in negative regulation of mTORC1. However, it is unclear from the current analysis whether any changes in mTORC1 activity between Hri<sup>-/-</sup> -Fe and Hri<sup>-/-</sup> +Fe erythroid cells, or between Wt -Fe and Wt +Fe cells. Furthermore, the authors should consider measuring mTORC1 activity directly by the level of phosphorylated 4EBP1 and/or other downstream targets as in Figure 2E.</p></disp-quote><p>mTORC1 activity in <italic>Hri</italic><sup>+/+</sup> and <italic>Hri</italic><sup>-/-</sup> erythroid precursors in +Fe and -Fe conditions were published last year in Zhang et al., 2018 (https://doi.org/10.1182/blood-2017-08-799908, Supplementary Figure 3A). mTORC1 activities as measured by pS6 and p4EBP1 were increased in primary <italic>Hri</italic><sup>-/-</sup>-Fe erythroid cells from blood, bone marrow and spleen as compared to <italic>Hri</italic><sup>-/-</sup>+Fe cells. This is consistent with the mild erythroid phenotypes of <italic>Hri</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice in +Fe as compared to -Fe conditions.</p><p>TE analysis of ribosome profiling data in the present manuscript also showed increased TE for mRNAs of mTORC1 targets such as cytosolic ribosomal proteins, <italic>Eef1a1, Eef2</italic>, and <italic>Pabpc1</italic> in <italic>Hri</italic><sup>-/-</sup>-Fe cells as compared to <italic>Hri</italic><sup>-/-</sup>+Fe (Supplementary file 1B). These results support the increased mTORC1 activity in <italic>Hri</italic><sup>-/-</sup>-Fe cells as compared to <italic>Hri</italic><sup>-/-</sup>+Fe cells. In contrast, TE for mTORC1 target mRNAs was not increased in <italic>Wt</italic>-Fe cells as compared to <italic>Wt</italic>+Fe cells (Supplementary file 1B).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In the Discussion section (second paragraph), the authors discussed that the mitochondrial genes regulated by HRI are different from the targets of mTORC1, and suggested that HRI may regulate translation of mitochondrial genes independent of mTORC1. This statement is a bit confusing. The evidence supporting this statement is based on the lack of overlapped targets for mitochondria related proteins in Hri<sup>-/-</sup> -Fe vs mTORC1 (Figure 3D). Since HRI may negatively regulate mTORC1 through GRB10, one would expect to see some overlapped targets if HRI-GRB10-mTORC1 mechanism plays a significant role in erythropoiesis. Furthermore, HRI loss may also impact transcriptional programs and/or indirectly affect mitochondrial proteins independent of protein translation. The authors should revise the statement and/or provide additional clarification.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank reviewer for pointing this out. We have employed INK128, a mTORC1 inhibitor to discern the contribution of HRI directly in the regulation of mitochondrial protein synthesis. As compared to <italic>Wt</italic>-Fe cells, <italic>Hri</italic><sup>-/-</sup>-Fe cells has increased mitochondrial protein synthesis, which was inhibited by INK128 to about 50% of the control (Figure 3—figure supplement 3A). However, mTORC1 activities as measured by pS6 and p4EBP1, were completely inhibited by INK128 treatment (Figure 3—figure supplement 3B). These results demonstrate that HRI also inhibits directly mitochondrial protein synthesis in addition to repress mTORC1 activity during iron deficiency. Thus, both HRI-eIF2αP and mTORC1 contribute to regulation of mitochondrial protein synthesis in erythroid cells during iron deficiency (subsection “Increased cytoplasmic and mitochondrial protein synthesis but reduced mitochondrial respiratory activity in <italic>Hri</italic><sup>-/-</sup> -Fe EBs”, first paragraph and Discussion).</p><p>We have now modified the statement in Discussion to “both HRI-eIF2αP and mTORC1 pathways contribute to increased mitochondrial protein synthesis in <italic>Hri</italic><sup>-/-</sup>-Fe EBs”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) To determine the effect of Hri loss on mitochondria, the authors used mitotracker to estimate mitochondrial mass. It is important to note that mitotracker signal may also be affected by mitochondrial activity. In Figure 4—figure supplement 1, it seems that the mtDNA content is modestly increased in Hri<sup>-/-</sup> -Fe cells. Is the difference statistically significant? If the difference is significant, the results would suggest that Hri loss affect both mitochondrial biogenesis (mtDNA) and mitochondrial mass (or activity).</p></disp-quote><p>The difference in mtDNA content was not statistically significant as stated in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Some parts of the manuscript are still difficult to follow and confusing with various comparisons.
