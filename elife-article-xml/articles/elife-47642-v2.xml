Despite a long-established concept, we show here that gene inactivation of activating paired immunoglobulin-like receptor (PILR)-β1 nearly halved the efficiency of neutrophil arrest in venules of the mouse cremaster muscle. We found that this receptor binds to CD99, an interaction which relies on flow-induced shear forces and boosts chemokine-induced β<sub>2</sub>-integrin-activation, leading to neutrophil attachment to endothelium. Upon arrest, binding of PILR-β1 to CD99 ceases, shifting the signaling balance towards inhibitory PILR-α. This enables integrin deactivation and supports cell migration. Thus, flow-driven shear forces guide sequential signaling of first activating PILR-β1 followed by inhibitory PILR-α to prompt neutrophil arrest and then transmigration. This doubles the efficiency of selectin-chemokine driven neutrophil arrest by PILR-β1 and then supports transition to migration by PILR-α.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>leukocyte extravasation</kwd><kwd>neutrophils</kwd><kwd>inflammation</kwd><kwd>endothelium</kwd><kwd>integrins</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFB1009</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Goswami</surname><given-names>Debashree</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFB1009, A1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Goswami</surname><given-names>Debashree</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Blood flow-driven shear forces guide the sequential signaling of two antagonistic paired receptors, a critical bi-facet step that first supports leukocyte docking, then initiates transmigration through endothelium.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Host defense against pathogens depends on the recruitment of leukocytes to sites of infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ley et al., 2007</xref>). Selectins capture leukocytes to the endothelial cell surface by binding to glycoconjugates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">McEver, 2015</xref>). This process is supported by shear forces caused by the blood stream, since selectin interactions with their ligands, different to most other protein-protein interactions, are improved, not impaired, by low tension forces. These interactions trigger, in combination with chemokines, signals that activate leukocyte integrins, such as LFA-1 and Mac-1 on neutrophils. Integrins then mediate leukocyte arrest, followed by crawling to appropriate exit sites and diapedesis (transmigration) through the vessel wall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Nourshargh and Alon, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Vestweber, 2015</xref>).</p><p>CD99 is an O-glycosylated cell surface protein expressed on most leukocytes and endothelial cells, which participates in the diapedesis process. Antibodies against CD99 blocked the transmigration of monocytes in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Schenkel et al., 2002</xref>) and lymphocyte and neutrophil extravasation in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bixel et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bixel et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dufour et al., 2008</xref>). More detailed analysis revealed that neutrophils accumulated between the endothelium and the basement membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bixel et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bixel et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Watson et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Recently, we confirmed these results by analyzing CD99 gene inactivated mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Goswami et al., 2017</xref>). Unexpectedly, we also found that neutrophil arrest was strongly reduced in postcapillary venules of these mice. Furthermore, it turned out that leukocyte extravasation required CD99 only on endothelial cells but not on neutrophils, suggesting the relevance for a heterophilic ligand on neutrophils. In vitro, purified CD99 enhanced chemokine induced integrin activation on neutrophils. Potential candidates for relevant neutrophil receptors for this effect are the paired immunoglobulin-like receptors α and β (PILR-α and PILR-β) which have been described as binding partners for CD99 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Goswami et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Like many other paired receptors of the immune system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Yamada and McVicar, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barrow and Trowsdale, 2008</xref>), PILR-α and PILR-β are structurally related membrane receptors that share similar extracellular regions but differ dramatically in the rest of their structure, which enables them to bind similar ligands, but to transmit either inhibitory or activating signals. The inhibitory receptor PILR-α bears two immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIMs) in its cytoplasmic part. In contrast, activating PILR-β contains no cytoplasmic domain and associates through its transmembrane domain with the signaling adaptor DAP12 that contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM).</p><p>Initially, CD99 on lymphocytes was discovered as ligand for PILR-α and PILR-β on dendritic cells (DC) and natural killer (NK) cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Shiratori et al., 2004</xref>). PILRs bind to sialylated O-glycans on CD99 in conjunction with proteinaceous structural elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Wang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Sun et al., 2012</xref>). Importantly, inhibitory PILR-α binds to CD99 with 40 times higher affinity than PILR-β (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Tabata et al., 2008</xref>). The low binding affinity of PILR-β is one of the weakest among all known paired receptors, which raises the question whether it has a chance to bind CD99 if PILR-α is co-expressed on the same cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kuroki et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Neutrophils express both forms. Gene inactivation of the inhibitory PILR-α was reported to enhance neutrophil recruitment to inflamed peritoneum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Wang et al., 2013</xref>). However, involvement of endothelial CD99 is unclear. Furthermore, the extremely low affinity of PILR-β for CD99 also raised doubts about its relevance as receptor for CD99 during the extravasation process.</p><p>Here we have analyzed whether PILRs, and if so which ones, are indeed relevant in vivo for the contribution of CD99 to the process of leukocyte extravasation. To this end we have generated gene-inactivated mice for PILR-α and PILR-β. We present evidence that PILR-β is responsible for the CD99 induced enhancement of chemokine driven integrin activation. In addition, we found that the interaction of PILR-β on neutrophils with CD99 (on endothelial cells) is driven by flow-induced shear forces. We propose a mechanism by which flow enables endothelial CD99 to interact with PILR-β, which stimulates doubling of chemokine induced leukocyte arrest in inflamed venules. Subsequently, PILR-α is needed as negative modulator of integrin activity to support the transition to leukocyte diapedesis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Generation and characterization of mice gene-inactivated for PILR-α and PILR-β1</title><p>To evaluate a role of PILR-α or PILR-β in leukocyte extravasation, gene inactivated mice were generated by the CRISPR-Cas9 approach (Material and methods).

To this end, we incubated bone marrow cells of the different genotypes (in the presence of ICAM-1-Fc) with polyclonal anti PILR antibodies (recognizing both PILR isoforms) for 15 min, followed by 0, 3 and 5 min incubation with CXCL1. After fixation, Ly6G<sup>+</sup> cells were analyzed for ICAM-1-Fc binding by FACS. For all genotypes, PILR crosslinking before chemokine stimulation enhanced ICAM-1-binding only weakly. For WT neutrophils, PILR crosslinking strongly enhanced ICAM-1 binding by 48% (±6%) at 3 and 5 min post-chemokine stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Slightly stronger increases were found for PILR-α<sup>-/-</sup> neutrophils (76% (±8%)) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). In contrast, the increase of integrin activation was strongly reduced to only 18% (±3%) for PILR-β1<sup>-/-</sup> neutrophils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). The residual increase could be due to the presence of PILR-β2. When a calcium ionophore instead of CXCL-1 was used to stimulate WT neutrophils, PILRs crosslinking no longer enhanced ICAM-1 binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Since calcium influx is downstream of chemokine induced GPCR signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Block et al., 2016</xref>), we conclude that PILR-β1 acts at a step upstream of calcium influx. Collectively, these in vitro findings suggest PILR-β1 on neutrophils is required for CD99 stimulated signals that enhance chemokine-induced β2 integrin activation.</p><p>To learn more about the signaling mechanism behind these effects we tested whether the tyrosine kinase Syk could be involved. We found that chemokine induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Syk was strongly enhanced if PMNs were co-incubated with polyclonal antibodies recognizing the extracellular domain of both PILR forms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). To test the relevance of Syk for the modulating effect of PILR-α and PILR-β1 on the adhesive function of β<sub>2</sub>-integrins, we performed adhesion assays with immobilized ICAM-1-Fc and chemokine-stimulated PMNs of all three genotypes treated with or without the Syk inhibitor PRT-060318. We found that the Syk inhibitor blocked the adhesion modulating effects of each of the two PILR receptors, (i.e. adhesion of the KO cells was as efficient as that of WT cells if all cells were treated with the inhibitor) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). To investigate the involvement of Syk in CD99 facilitated chemokine-induced adhesion, PILR-α<sup>-/-</sup> or PILR-β1<sup>-/-</sup> neutrophils were allowed to adhere under flow competitively with WT neutrophils on a surface coated with P-selectin-Fc, CXCL-1, ICAM-1-Fc and CD99-Fc or a control IgG as described in the presence of the Syk inhibitor. We observed that the adhesion support by CD99 for WT and PILR-α<sup>-/-</sup> neutrophils vanished when Syk was inhibited (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G and H</xref>), clearly indicating that CD99 driven β2 integrin activation enhancement requires Syk activity.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>PILR-β1, but not PILR-α, is required for CD99-support of neutrophil arrest in vivo</title><p>To test, whether CD99 mediated support of neutrophil arrest in vivo depends on PILR-β1, we generated chimeric mice by bone marrow transplantation, which were deficient for CD99 on endothelium and lacked one of the two PILRs on neutrophils.

In agreement with our previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Goswami et al., 2017</xref>), ablation of endothelial CD99 reduced adhesion of WT neutrophils by 57% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) and 43% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Neutrophils lacking PILR-β1 and transplanted into WT recipients phenocopied this effect (46 ± 8%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Importantly, the combination of PILR-β1<sup>-/-</sup> neutrophils and CD99<sup>-/-</sup> endothelium did not further reduce neutrophil arrest (34 ± 8%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>), suggesting both proteins act in the same pathway. In contrast, neutrophils lacking PILR-α were more adhesive than their WT counterparts (38 ± 8%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). In general, all adhesion effects observed in the various chimeric mice translated into extravasation effects, with the exception of PILR-α gene deficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and C</xref>), where extravasation was like in WT mice despite increased numbers of arrested neutrophils.

Therefore, we studied the interaction of CD99-tranfected CHO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), with PILR-α-Fc or PILR-β-Fc coated surfaces in the absence or presence of flow. Under static conditions, 22 fold more CHO-CD99 cells adhered to PILR-α-Fc than to PILR-β-Fc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.47642.038</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Shear stress enhances the interaction of CD99 with PILR-β.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) CHO cells overexpressing CD99 (CHO-CD99) were constructed and analyzed for surface expression of CD99.

To clarify, why enhanced adhesion does not lead to more transmigration, we tested whether PILR-α would participate in the transmigration steps downstream of the adhesion step. Therefore, we performed static transmigration assays through primary MDMVEC with PILR-α<sup>-/-</sup>, PILR-β1<sup>-/-</sup>, and WT neutrophils. In order to compare transmigration without the complication of enhanced adhesive function of PILR-α<sup>-/-</sup> neutrophils, assays were performed with neutrophil numbers ranging from 1 to 15 × 10<sup>5</sup> cells per transwell filter. After 40 min, transmigrated neutrophils were counted, in pair with counting neutrophils adherent to the apical surface of MDMVEC. Results were divided into four groups according to adhesion levels and numbers of transmigrated cells were plotted for each group and each genotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Whereas WT neutrophils and PILR-β1<sup>-/-</sup> neutrophils transmigrated with similar efficiency when standardized to the same number of adherent cells, PILR-α<sup>-/-</sup> neutrophils clearly transmigrated less efficiently.

In addition, the time needed for diapedesis was 2-fold increased in PILR-α<sup>-/-</sup> neutrophils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). Thus, PILR-α participates in transmigration by supporting the switch from leukocyte arrest to crawling and by supporting the efficiency of the diapedesis process.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Here, we show that the two antagonistic, paired receptors PILR-α and PILR-β1 each support neutrophil extravasation at different, consecutive steps of the extravasation process. Gene deficiency of the activating PILR-β1 receptor strongly impaired neutrophil arrest, which matched a similar effect we found recently in mice lacking endothelial CD99 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Goswami et al., 2017</xref>). In agreement with this, we show that despite a 40 times lower affinity of PILR-β1 for CD99 compared to PILR-α under static conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Tabata et al., 2008</xref>), flow-induced shear forces enhanced the interaction between CD99 and PILR-β1 and made it even superior over the interaction with PILR-α. Furthermore, in vitro flow adhesion assays revealed that PILR-β1 was required for CD99 to boost chemokine-induced activation of β2-integrins on neutrophils. Thus, PILR-β1 acts as a neutrophil receptor required for endothelial CD99 to support efficient neutrophil arrest. Gene inactivation of PILR-α affects the next step leading to reduced numbers of crawling neutrophils and impaired transmigration. We conclude that neutrophils require the inhibitory effect of PILR-α to redeem cellular motility by restraining β2-integrin activity. Collectively, we describe a molecular mechanism whereby flow-driven shear forces guide sequential signaling of first activating PILR-β1 followed by inhibitory PILR-α to prompt neutrophil arrest and subsequently transmigration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.47642.062</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Graphical depiction.</title><p>An antagonistic pair of receptors, PILR-β1 and PILR-α, supports neutrophil arrest and seamless transition to crawling via modulating β2 integrin activity at different steps during extravasation.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-47642-fig8-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Blood flow-induced shear forces largely prevent the interaction of leukocytes with the vessel wall keeping extravasation in healthy tissues at bay. The selectin/chemokine/integrin-based machinery explains, how inflamed venules circumvent this block of extravasation and even take advantage of shear forces as a driver for extravasation. Selectins on inflamed endothelial cells are specialized to capture leukocytes under flow, since their ligand-binding is improved under flow conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Marshall et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Yago et al., 2004</xref>). Moreover, selectins trigger signals that activate integrins in addition to the chemokine stimulated signaling cascades, which finally leads to leukocyte arrest and attachment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Zarbock et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Block et al., 2012</xref>). This model has been well studied over decades and is solidly established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">McEver and Zhu, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Zarbock et al., 2011</xref>). We suggest here, that CD99 and PILR-β1 represent new players in addition to selectins, chemokines and integrins in the multistep cascade of leukocyte arrest. Although selectins and chemokines trigger leukocyte integrin activation and leukocyte attachment efficiently in vivo, lack of CD99 or PILR-β1 reduces this efficiency by about twofold. This is a significant contribution. It is intriguing that similar to the selectins, the PILR-β1/CD99 interaction is also lectin-carbohydrate based and is supported by shear forces.</p><p>In light of the important role of PILR-β1 for leukocyte arrest and attachment, it is particularly interesting to consider how this is coordinated with the function of the inhibitory PILR-α. As mentioned above, shear drives the interaction of CD99 with PILR-β1. Thus, this interaction is ‘switched-on’ under flow, when it is needed and is ‘switched-off’ once the leukocyte has come to a standstill. This would turn off PILR-β1 support of integrin activation and could tip the balance towards a more prominent contribution of PILR-α. Indeed, we found that PILR-α participates in the extravasation process at a step following leukocyte arrest. PILR-α deficient neutrophils initiated crawling at a lower frequency than WT neutrophils arguing for a role of PILR-α as facilitator of the crawling process. Furthermore, a larger number of WT than PILR-α deficient neutrophils transmigrated per given time period through endothelial monolayers under static conditions and the duration of the diapedesis process per transmigrating neutrophil was prolonged for PILR-α deficient neutrophils in transmigration assays under flow. Thus, the inhibitory PILR-α receptor supports the onset of crawling and enhances transmigration velocity. It is intriguing that a pair of two functionally opposing receptors is able to support the same process, leukocyte extravasation, by acting consecutively at different steps of the extravasation cascade. This sequential action of first PILR-β1 and then PILR-α is made possible by the shear-sensitivity of the PILR-β1/CD99 interaction, which leads to stimulation of PILR-β1 when the cell still moves, whereas this stimulus ceases when the leukocyte comes to a halt, which then allows PILR-α to prevail over PILR-β1 signaling and restrain integrin activation.</p><p>This concerted and sequential action of first PILR-β and then PILR-α argues for the benefit of an optimal balance of integrin activation during the extravasation process: a rapid activation of integrins to an optimal level is needed to ensure proper arrest of leukocytes. This then is followed by cell migration, which requires mechanisms that can restrain integrin activation, in order to facilitate proper functioning of integrins during the crawling and transmigration process. Indeed, a defect in integrin inactivation by mutating the cytoplasmic tail of the α<sub>L</sub>-chain of LFA-1, rendering the integrin constitutively active, leads to enhanced adhesion of leukocytes to the vessel wall accompanied by a defect in transmigration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Semmrich et al., 2005</xref>). We believe, that the shear-sensitivity of the interaction of PILR-β1 with CD99 regulates the sequential action of both receptors and allows optimal balancing of integrin activation during the leukocyte extravasation process.</p><p>Despite the much higher affinity of PILR-α for CD99, it is not clear whether PILR-α on neutrophils is indeed accessible for endothelial CD99 in trans. It was reported that PILR-α is masked by sialylated carbohydrates presented by glycosylated proteins in cis on the surface of neutrophils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Wang et al., 2013</xref>). Indeed, we confirmed that simply incubating CHO cells expressing PILR-α with a CD99-Fc fusion construct did not yield signals by FACS analysis, while binding was observed after treating the cells with sialidase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). However, using a biochemical approach we could transfer a tag by photoactivation from a CD99-Fc fusion protein to PILR on the cell surface of neutrophils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Goswami et al., 2017</xref>). The tag was mainly found on the smaller MW form of the two broad, overlapping PILR-bands, which was probably representing PILR-β. This is in line with PILR-α being masked in cis, which suggests that the functional effects we have observed for PILR-α depend on its intrinsic activity (possibly triggered by cis ligands). This is in agreement with our concept of a sequential action of PILR-β1 and PILR-α during the extravasation process, and argues for a balance between CD99-driven PILR-β1 signaling and the intrinsic signaling of PILR-α. Shear driven stimulation of PILR-β1 by endothelial CD99 would tilt the balance towards activation of integrins, whereas static cell attachment would cease the stimulation of PILR-β1 which would favor intrinsic inhibitory signaling of PILR-α supporting deactivation of integrins during neutrophil migration. An interesting aspect of cis-masking of PILR-α is that PILR-β1 is probably spared from this effect due to its very low affinity under static conditions. This would ensure that PILR-β1 is accessible for CD99 as trans ligand under conditions of flow.</p><p>In addition to modulating integrin activation on neutrophils, the PILRs also balance the production of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines in infection models. PILR-β gene deficiency strongly reduced pro-inflammatory cytokines and enhanced the levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines in infection models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Banerjee et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Tato et al., 2012</xref>). Gene inactivation of PILR-α generally aggravates inflammation, although the mechanisms may vary according to the stimulus and the tissue analyzed. It was reported that the absence of PILR-α augments β2 integrin activation on myeloid cells, which was accompanied with enhanced accumulation of such cells in a chemically induced peritonitis model, and increased monocyte levels in adipose tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Wang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kohyama et al., 2016</xref>). In an autoimmune arthritis model, inflammation was strongly enhanced in the absence of PILR-α, yet this was caused through elevated pro-inflammatory cytokine levels and not by enhanced myeloid cell infiltration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Sun et al., 2014</xref>). Likewise, PILR-α deficiency did not enhance infiltration of myeloid cells into the <italic>S. aureus</italic> infected peritoneal cavity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Sun et al., 2014</xref>). All these studies agree on that PILR-α and PILR-β are important balancers of inflammatory responses, with PILR-α acting to restrain inflammation. Balancing the systemic inflammatory cytokine profile is certainly one important mechanism to achieve this.</p><p>Depending on the inflammatory model analyzed, PILR-α exerts varying effects on neutrophil extravasation. For example, PILR-α deficiency increased neutrophil extravasation in thioglycollate-induced peritonitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Wang et al., 2013</xref>), whereas no such effect was found for the <italic>S. aureus</italic> infected peritoneal cavity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Sun et al., 2014</xref>). Likewise, in our TNF-α inflamed cremaster model PILR-α deficiency did not lead to enhanced extravasation. The reason for these contrasting results in different inflammation models are probably due to the different cytokine repertoires. It is well known that thioglycollate stimulates the generation of a rich and complex mixture of cytokines in the peritoneum, which differs from that generated upon <italic>S. aureus</italic> infection, and likely from that generated in our TNF-α inflamed cremaster model. We speculate that a strong and mixed cytokine stimulation, as is induced by thioglycollate, may override the role of PILR-α in crawling and leads to more overall extravasation. With respect to the effect of PILR-α on leukocyte migration it was reported that PILR-α deficiency enhances neutrophil transmigration through ICAM-1-Fc coated transwell filters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Wang et al., 2013</xref>). We could confirm this effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>). However, such ‘transmigration’ assays lack endothelial cells. In proper transmigration assays across a monolayer of endothelial cells we found that PILR-α deficiency inhibited this process, pointing towards a function for PILR-α in the transendothelial diapedesis process, which goes beyond simple migration on ICAM-1. Despite this function, we found no net effect on extravasation in the TNF-α inflamed cremaster model in PILR-α deficient mice. We believe the reason for this is that the crawling/diapedesis defect in PILR-α<sup>-/-</sup> neutrophils is balanced by an increased adhesion.</p><p>In conclusion, we show here that PILR-β1 on neutrophils and CD99 on endothelium represent a new pair of important players in the multistep cascade of leukocyte extravasation, which are needed to support the combined function of selectins, chemokines and integrins. Flow induced shear forces support and initiate the interaction between this ligand-receptor pair, which augments chemokine-induced integrin activity and leads to leukocyte arrest. Upon attachment, shear dependent ligand binding is terminated, which via PILR-α leads to integrin deactivation, which may support recycling as it is needed for cell migration. We propose that PILR-β1 and PILR-α represent a receptor pair that is important on neutrophils for the balance of integrin activation during leukocyte extravasation.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

Unstimulated samples and samples stimulated for 30, 60 or 75 s were fixed in 2% PFA at RT for 5 min, washed and lysed in 400 ul lysis buffer (1% TritonX-100, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 140 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM Tris-HCl pH7.5, protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche), 300 uM orthovanadate, 1 mM NaF). Lysate was immunoprecipitated with 3 μg anti-Syk (Thermo Fisher, PA5-27262) or rabbit IgG on Protein G dynabead (Thermo Fisher) at 4°C overnight. Immunoprecipitated samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and blotted for phospho-tyrosine on Syk (4G10) and total Syk protein (Thermo Fisher, PA5-27262).</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Monitoring CHO-CD99 interactions with PILR-coated surfaces under flow</title><p>Flow chambers (as above) were coated with 50 μg/ml PILR-α-Fc or PILR-β-Fc in PBS at 4°C overnight, followed by casein blockade. CHO cells were labeled (as neutrophils above), mixed 1:1 with CHO-CD99 at 7.5 × 10<sup>5</sup> per ml each in MC-buffer and passed through the flow chamber at a step-down shear stress gradient of 1, 0.5, 0.3, 0.2, 0.1, 0 dyn/cm<sup>2</sup>, in 3 min intervals at RT. Flow at 1 dyn/cm<sup>2</sup> was applied to clear the observation field after the static interval. Video-recording was at 0.5 frame per second (fps) under a 10x objective. Interactions were defined as cells stopping under flow for at least one frame. CD99-specific interactions were defined as number of interacting CHO-CD99 minus the number of interacting CHO cells for a particular frame. From 180 s onwards, cell-surface interactions were counted every minute except for the static interval, where interactions were counted immediately after the field-clearing laminar flow pulse.</p><p>In other experiments, CHO-CD99 were resuspended at 3.75 × 10<sup>5</sup> per ml in MC-buffer, passed through flow chambers either coated with PILR-α-Fc or PILR-β-Fc or uncoated under a ramping shear from 0.1 to 0.7 dyn/cm<sup>2</sup> in 15 min at RT, and videos recorded at 1 fps and 50 ms brightfield exposure. Surface interacting cells were identified at each frame by TrackMate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Tinevez et al., 2017</xref>) and normalized to input cells. PILR-specific interaction was defined as the interaction flux on either PILR-coated surface subtracted by the interaction flux on uncoated surfaces, and was determined for each frame. Average interaction fluxes were plotted against the corresponding mean shear stress at 0.05 dyn/cm<sup>2</sup> intervals.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Statistics</title><p>2-tailed Student’s t-test or Mann-Whitney U-test was used to compare two groups. One-sample t-test was used to compare a control-normalized group against a value. To compare more than two groups, 1-way ANOVA, 2-way ANOVA or ANOVA on rank was used followed by a post-test indicated for each experiment. A difference was considered as statistically significant for an α-value of 0.05.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Tanja Möller fpr her excellent technical assistance.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Reinhard Fässler as Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Tadatsugu Taniguchi as the Senior Editor.

This must be clarified.</p><p>2) Figure 6: add experiments under constant low shear stress conditions kept over 20 min (1200s) to exclude that the observed differences depend on the duration of the experiment rather than on changes in shear stress. In addition, one may also run those experiments starting with high shear stress and then reduce shear stress in a step like fashion.</p><p>3) The mechanism through which PILR-β1 and PILR-α control adhesion under shear flow, in particular whether they affect the degree of integrin activation should be addressed. The authors should consider whether a transient phosphorylation-dephosphorylation of the tyrosine kinase Syk may be involved in the mechanism by which PILR-α/β1 regulates the on-off switch of the integrin.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Blood flow guides sequential support of neutrophil arrest and diapedesis by PILR-β1 and PILR-α&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by three reviewers, including Reinhard Fässler as the Reviewing Editor, and the evaluation has been overseen by Tadatsugu Taniguchi as the Senior Editor. The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>1) Off target effects: according to the Materials and methods section, several independent null lines were generated. Please mention in the text that at least two Crispr/Cas9-induced PILR-α- and PILR-β1-null mutation produced the same in vivo and in vitro phenotypes.</p><p>2) Define rolling flux fraction as number of rolling leukocytes expressed as a percent of all leukocytes traveling through microvessel.</p><p>3) Label PILR-β<sup>-/-</sup> throughout the paper as PILR-β1<sup>-/-</sup> to indicate that the gene inactivation specifically targeted only the PILR-β1 isoform</p><p>4) Does the arrest of WT and mutant neutrophils on control IgG differ? Can this be clarified in the manuscript?</p><p>5) Syk inhibition experiments should be done in the presence of CD99-Fc. Please repeat this assay accordingly.</p><p>6) The discrepant findings between the present manuscript by the Vestweber lab and the published Wang et al. (NI) report are not well handled. Firstly, the authors should show their in vitro transmigration data though ICAM-1-Fc coated transwell filters in their manuscript. Secondly, their arguments regarding the values and pitfalls of the different in vivo extravasation models used in the two studies should be better discussed. They have a strong argument that the 'thioglycollate' trigger may produce a non-physiological response (storm) that overrides effects caused by the PILR-α-deficiency. It would have been wonderful if the authors would have shown the 'thioglycollate' and the 'TNF/cremaster muscle' in their paper side by side. Although this would have been the best argument for their findings, they should at least improve their discussion.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.47642.067</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The PILR-α data are in conflict with the paper published by Wang et al., 2013.

We will first discuss the in vitro, then the in vivo results.</p><p>Our in vitro results are in part in agreement with the published results. We found that adhesion of CXCL-stimulated PILR-α<sup>-/-</sup> neutrophils to ICAM-1-Fc or to TNF-α-stimulated endothelial cells is increased in comparison to similarly treated WT neutrophils (Figure 7—figure supplement 1). This was also shown by Wang et al. for fMLF-stimulated PMNs, however only analyzed for ICAM-Fc; not for endothelial cells. Our results differ when it comes to transmigration assays:</p><p>Importantly, we analyzed transmigration of PMNs through endothelial cell layers grown on transwell filters, Wang et al. analyzed transmigration with ICAM-1-Fc coated transwell filters. We analyzed transmigration for different time periods, and found that fewer PILR-α<sup>-/-</sup> deleted PMNs transmigrated after 45 and 60 minutes; at later time points the number of transmigrated cells plateaued and PILR-α<sup>-/-</sup> cells caught up (Figure 7B). In contrast, PILR-α<sup>-/-</sup> PMNs transmigrated more efficiently than WT PMNS, however, transmigration was only analyzed for ICAM-1-Fc coated filters. We have now repeated such experiments and find a tendency of slightly enhanced transmigration of PILR-α<sup>-/-</sup> PMNs through ICAM-1-Fc coated filters, although the effect was not significant (p=0.0658).</p><fig id="respfig1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.47642.065</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Transmigration of WT and PILR-α<sup>-/-</sup> PMNs towards 40ng/ml CXCL1 through polycarbonate transwell filters (3μm pore size) coated with 2μg/ml ICAM-1-Fc for 1 h at 37°C.</title><p>(P value is 0.0658 (2-tailed t-test)).</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-47642-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Thus, this type of transmigration assay (in the absence of endothelium) may reflect the enhanced adhesion of PMNs to ICAM-1. However, a proper transmigration assay with endothelial cells is more complex and reflects the diapedesis process through a cell layer. We suggest that PILR-α supports the diapedesis process in ways, which may go beyond the simple activation of β<sub>2</sub>-integrins on leukocytes. In agreement with these results, we also found that the duration of the diapedesis process was extended 2 fold for PILR-α<sup>-/-</sup> PMNs.</p><p>Collectively, we believe that our results are not in contradiction with those by Wang et al., since the experimental conditions of the transmigration assays differ significantly. In vivo, we found that deletion of PILR-α slightly enhanced adhesion in postcapillary venules of the TNF-α stimulated cremaster muscle, although this effect did not translate into more extravasation, which is in agreement with our in vitro results: enhanced adhesion was compensated by reduced transmigration efficiency. In contrast to our results in the TNF-α-stimulated cremaster muscle, Wang et al. found that thioglycollate stimulation of the peritoneum enhanced recruitment of PILR-α<sup>-/-</sup> PMNs more efficiently than recruitment of WT PMNs. However, as we pointed out in the Discussion of our manuscript (sixth paragraph), a group at Genentech (Sun et al., 2014) found that infection of the peritoneal cavity with <italic>S. aureus</italic> did <italic>not</italic> enhance the recruitment of PILR-α<sup>-/-</sup> neutrophils more efficiently than WT neutrophils (analyzed at 2h and 6h post infection). Thus, even in the same tissue (peritoneal cavity), the contribution of PILR-α to PMN recruitment differs, dependent on the type of inflammatory stimulus. Thioglycollate is a complex mixture of chemicals described as “thioglycollate-bouillon” which is left to “mature” for several weeks before use. It is known to stimulate intraperitoneal macrophages to produce a rich cocktail of pro-inflammatory factors and chemoattractants which act in combination to activate endothelium and attract neutrophils. At present, we assume that thioglycollate may trigger some chemoattractant, that contributes to integrin activation, which may be induced much less upon <italic>S. aureus</italic> infection or upon stimulation of the cremaster with TNF-α. If the receptor for this chemoattractant would be more sensitive to the inhibitory action of PILR-α than the chemokine receptor that is mainly responsible for TNF-α-induced or <italic>S.aureus</italic>-induced PMN recruitment, the discrepancy of the results by Wang et al., on one side and the results by Sun et al., and our group on the other side could be explained. We have slightly changed the corresponding paragraph in our Discussion, to better address this point.</p><p>In addition to the thioglycollate-peritonitis data, Wang et al., also reported results obtained with a septic shock model based on the systemic stimulation with LPS. Higher MPO activities, which did not distinguish between intravascular and extravascular neutrophils, were detected in lung and liver tissues from PILR-α<sup>-/-</sup> mice. However, the liver of PILR-α<sup>-/-</sup> mice showed signs of haemorrhage, clearly indicating vascular damage. Thus, the higher number of PMNs found in liver and lung might not have been a result of a proper multistep extravasation process across an intact endothelial barrier. Thus, this model is very complex and difficult to compare with our results obtained in a well-defined extravasation model which allows direct analysis of the different steps of the process.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Figure 6: add experiments under constant low shear stress conditions kept over 20 min (1200s) to exclude that the observed differences depend on the duration of the experiment rather than on changes in shear stress.

The authors should consider whether a transient phosphorylation-dephosphorylation of the tyrosine kinase Syk may be involved in the mechanism by which PILR-α/β regulates the on-off switch of the integrin.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now analyzed whether stimulation of PILR modulates chemokine-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Syk. We found that CXCL1-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Syk was strongly enhanced if PMNs were incubated with crosslinking polyclonal antibodies recognizing the extracellular domain of both PILR forms (Figure 3—figure supplement 1A). To test the relevance of Syk for the modulating effect of PILR-α and PILR-β1 on the adhesive function of β<sub>2</sub>-integrins, we performed adhesion assays with immobilized ICAM-1-Fc and chemokine-stimulated PMNs of all three genotypes treated with or without the Syk inhibitor PRT-060318. We found that the Syk inhibitor blocked the adhesion modulating effects of each of the two PILR receptors, (i.e. adhesion of the KO cells was as efficient as that of WT cells if all cells were treated with the inhibitor).</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p></disp-quote><p> <italic>1) Off target effects: according to the Materials and methods section, several independent null lines were generated.

Firstly, the authors should show their in vitro transmigration data though ICAM-1-Fc coated transwell filters in their manuscript. Secondly, their arguments regarding the values and pitfalls of the different in vivo extravasation models used in the two studies should be better discussed. They have a strong argument that the 'thioglycollate' trigger may produce a non-physiological response (storm) that overrides effects caused by the PILR-α -deficiency. It would have been wonderful if the authors would have shown the 'thioglycollate' and the 'TNF/cremaster muscle' in their paper side by side. Although this would have been the best argument for their findings, they should at least improve their discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now discussed these points accordingly in a new in the Discussion section.
