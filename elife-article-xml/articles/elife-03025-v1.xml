status, genetic background and individual differences. It remains unknown how pheromone information interacts to trigger innate behaviors. In this study, we identify vomeronasal receptors responsible for detecting female pheromones. A sub-group of V1re clade members recognizes gender-identifying cues in female urine. Multiple members of the V1rj clade are cognate receptors for urinary estrus signals, as well as for sulfated estrogen (SE) compounds. In both cases, the same cue activates multiple homologous receptors, suggesting redundancy in encoding female pheromone cues. Neither gender-specific cues nor SEs alone are sufficient to promote courtship behavior in male mice, whereas robust courtship behavior can be induced when the two cues are applied together. Thus, integrated action of different female cues is required in pheromone-triggered mating behavior. These results suggest a gating mechanism in the vomeronasal circuit in promoting specific innate behavior.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03025.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03025.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03025.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Pheromones are chemicals that are given off by living things and they lead to a range of social responses in others of the same species. These chemical signals, for example, can let an animal know when a suitable mate is near and trigger the release of hormones that encourage the animal to mate.</p><p>In mammals, an organ found between the roof of the mouth and the nose detects pheromones. This organ contains more than 300 different receptors for these chemicals. However, only a few of these receptors have been matched with the pheromones that they detect. One example is a chemical released by male mice that interacts with a specific nasal receptor and causes a female mouse to arch her back in a way that signals she is ready to mate.</p><p>One reason that more pheromone-receptor pairs are not known is that pheromones are released in very small quantities, which makes them hard to detect. In an effort to identify more pairs, Haga-Yamanaka et al. took tissue slices from the organ that detects pheromones in mice and then looked for cells that responded to the urine of female mice. Two previously unknown pheromone-receptor pairs were found. One helps male mice detect when a female is present, while the other lets him know if she is ready to mate. Together these two chemicals alert a male mouse to a potential mate and cause him to mount her in order to mate. However, neither chemical is able to trigger this male courtship behavior on its own.</p><p>The techniques developed by Haga-Yamanaka et al. may, in the future, help identify more pheromone-receptor pairs. The next challenge will be to identify the pathways of nerve cells that integrate the information about pheromones and trigger the courtship behaviors.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03025.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03025.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>olfactory</kwd><kwd>vomeronasal</kwd><kwd>pheromone</kwd><kwd>innate behavior</kwd><kwd>GCaMP</kwd><kwd>imaging</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Stowers Institute for Medical Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yu</surname><given-names>C Ron</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01DC008003</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yu</surname><given-names>C Ron</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lavis</surname><given-names>Luke D</given-names></name><name><surname>Looger</surname><given-names>Loren L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Haga-Yamanaka</surname><given-names>Sachiko</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Identification of two classes of mouse vomeronasal receptors for female pheromone cues suggests distinct gating mechanisms in pheromone-triggered reproductive behaviors.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Pheromones play an essential role in reproductive behaviors. Sexually mature animals respond to pheromone signals from potential mates with endocrine changes and ritualistic action patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wyatt, 2003</xref>). In spite of their innate nature, reproductive behaviors are not simple reflexes. They are complex neural processes that are modulated not only by the reproductive status of the animal (e.g., hormonal states, social ranks and past experiences), but also the status of potential mates and environmental factors such as the presence of predators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tinbergen, 1951</xref>). A fundamental question in understanding pheromone communication is how the confluence of different signals works to trigger innate behaviors.</p><p>Vomeronasal organ (VNO), the major sensory organ responsible for pheromone detection in mammalian species, expresses more than 300 vomeronasal receptors (VRs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dulac and Axel, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Herrada and Dulac, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Matsunami and Buck, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ryba and Tirindelli, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dulac and Torello, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shi and Zhang, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Young and Trask, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liberles et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Riviere et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Liberles, 2014</xref>). The vomeronasal sensory neurons (VSNs) encode information about gender, reproductive status, genetic background and individual differences of animals of the same species, as well as that of heterospecifics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Halem et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Holy et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Boschat et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wyatt, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Leinders-Zufall et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kimoto et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chamero et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kimoto et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">He et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Haga et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Papes et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Isogai et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tolokh et al., 2013</xref>). The multitude of cues potentially provides snapshots of other animals and surrounding environments to influence reproductive behaviors. To date, our understanding of the neural logic that controls these innate behaviors remains limited. It has been shown that individual pheromones can directly trigger distinct innate behaviors. For example, the male-specific exocrine peptide ESP1 induces lordosis in female mice, a stereotypic gesture characterized by the arching of the back with raised rear, to signal receptivity to potential mates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kimoto et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Haga et al., 2010</xref>). ESP1 induces lordosis through its receptor V2Rp5 (Vmn2r116), a member of the V2r family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Haga et al., 2010</xref>). In this case, the circuit that connects receptor-expressing neurons to brain centers appears to be a labeled line—the activation of a single receptor and its downstream neurons is sufficient to trigger lordosis, and removing the V2Rp5 receptor abolishes both the ESP1-evoked neural activation in the brain and the behavioral output of ESP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Haga et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>On the other hand, there is likely more complex circuit logic than labeled lines in the vertebrate species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wyatt, 2003</xref>). In contrast to the myriad sensory cues that induce behavioral responses and the large number of putative receptors, there is a limited repertoire of highly stereotyped behavioral outputs resulting from VNO activation. In genetic and surgical disruptions of VNO function that lead to the alterations of innate behaviors, it is often observed that the onset and frequency of specific behaviors, but not the behavioral patterns per se, are altered. This revelation indicates that the signals processed by distinct VR circuits are likely integrated in brain networks to induce a behavior selected from a fixed set of behavioral patterns. Thus, the neural circuits that process pheromone information must have an intrinsic logic in integrating external and internal signals to produce coordinated behaviors in order to maximize reproductive fitness. This logic has not been clearly illustrated. Given that only a few receptors among the more than 300 members of the vomeronasal receptor families have been paired with ligands and assigned with functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Boschat et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shi and Zhang, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Young and Trask, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Haga et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Liberles, 2014</xref>), identification of receptors responding to specific pheromone signals should provide us with insights into the logic of information processing in the vomeronasal system.</p><p>To date, despite advances in identifying pheromones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kimoto et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chamero et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Haga et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Roberts et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ferrero et al., 2013</xref>), the receptors for most pheromones have not been identified. In particular, the receptors conveying sex information remain elusive. We seek to identify VRs that convey information about sex and reproductive status of the female mice. In a previous study, we developed transgenic mice expressing the genetically encoded Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor GCaMP2 in the VNO neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">He et al., 2008</xref>). By profiling the calcium response of individual VNO neurons in slice preparations, we were able to identify neurons that respond to gender- or estrus-specific urinary stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">He et al., 2008</xref>). These cells likely convey information regarding gender identity and reproductive status of the emitter. In this study, we combine this approach with single-cell degenerate reverse transcription-PCR to clone receptor genes from neurons with specific response profiles. This novel approach allows us to identify vomeronasal receptors that detect specific signals whether or not the ligands are known. The identification of the receptors facilitated the purification of a urinary fraction that activates those receptors. The urinary signals act synergistically to induce robust mounting behavior in male mice. Our study suggests two distinct operating principles in pheromone-triggered mating behaviors.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Sulfated estrogens mimic the activity of estrus signal in urine</title><p>Male mice exhibit robust mounting behaviors towards sexually mature females in the presence of estrus female urine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dixon and Mackintosh, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ingersoll and Weinhold, 1987</xref>).

To examine whether these cues communicate sexual receptivity to males, we painted ovariectomized females, which are not influenced by endogenous hormonal and pheromonal fluctuations, with female mouse urine collected during the estrus phase (estrus urine, or EU; ‘Materials and methods’) or non-estrus phase (non-estrus urine, or NEU), and exposed them to sexually naïve males. Although males showed baseline mounting behavior toward ovariectomized females painted with vehicle or NEU (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), the number of mounts and mounting duration increased significantly when the females were painted with EU (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

Consequently, the majority of the vomeronasal receptors have not been characterized, nor have they been assigned with specific functions. In insect species, pheromones have traditionally been first identified through behavioral assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wyatt, 2003</xref>). The identification of specific receptors for the pheromones usually follows. The pairing of pheromones and their cognate receptors then leads to the characterization of the specific neural circuits involved in pheromone communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Dahanukar and Ray, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gomez-Diaz and Benton, 2013</xref>). In mammals, chemical purification studies have revealed a number of urinary chemicals as putative pheromones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Novotny et al., 1985</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jemiolo et al., 1989</xref>). However, few compounds are able to elicit behavioral or physiological responses by themselves. Moreover, some recent studies have raised doubts about the effects of some of these compounds as pheromones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Flanagan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brechbuhl et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Osada et al., 2013</xref>). The lack of information about the ligands creates a conundrum in identifying functional receptor/ligand pairs and characterizing their downstream circuits.</p><p>We present here an approach to resolve this conundrum. Previously, we have established an approach to profile the response of individual VSNs to urine samples from both sexes with different genetic backgrounds or reproductive status such that the cells detecting specific signals can be identified even in the absence of specific information of pheromones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">He et al., 2008</xref>). In this study, we extended this approach by combining it with single cell degenerate RT-PCR to clone and identify the receptor genes expressed in neurons that show specific response profiles.</p><p>In addition, we have developed a transgenic approach to characterize VRs and to purify their ligands. To date, there are only a few members of the V1r and V2r families of receptors that have been functionally expressed in heterologous expression systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Shirokova et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dey and Matsunami, 2011</xref>). Adopting a transgenic approach not only eliminates the difficulty in establishing a robust heterologous assay system for each receptor, but also allows the analysis of receptor function in their native environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zhao et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nguyen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Haga et al., 2010</xref>). By taking advantage of the tetracycline-inducible system in transgenic mice, we ectopically expressed the identified V1r genes in the VNO to characterize their response properties. Moreover, the transgenic mice expressing the V1rs also enabled us to fractionate and partially purify their natural ligands. The physiological importance of these semi-purified ligands was confirmed by subsequent behavioral assays.</p><p>These approaches enable us to identify receptors that receive specific information whether or not their respective ligands are known. A similar approach has recently been established by using immediate early genes (IEGs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Isogai et al., 2011</xref>). Double staining of IEGs and receptor genes by in situ hybridization allowed the categorization of receptor groups based on their putative functions. However, conventional in situ hybridization techniques do not provide a clear distinction among highly homologous genes such as members of a given receptor clade. Moreover, in situ IEG staining is less sensitive than calcium imaging for measuring neuronal activation. These limitations can be overcome by using our current methodology.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Ligand recognition by the vomeronasal receptors</title><p>The VSNs have been shown to be highly sensitive to their ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Leinders-Zufall et al., 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kimoto et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">He et al., 2010</xref>). Consistent with this, we found that the sulfated estrogen compounds activate the VSNs at sub-nanomolar concentrations: neurons can be activated by 100 pM concentrations of E1103 or E1050. Importantly, the same sensitivity was recapitulated by the ectopically expressed V1rj2 and V1rj3 receptors. The V1rj receptors are not only sensitive to sulfated steroids, but they are also highly selective. Except one sulfated androgen, none of the sulfated steroids other than estrogens activated the V1rj2 and V1rj3 receptors. On the other hand, although the V1rj2 and V1rj3 receptors are specifically activated by the sulfated estrogens, they tolerate some structural variation of the sulfated estrogens. The bisulfated estrogen, E1050, and the monosulfated estrogen, E1103, activated the V1rj receptors with comparable efficacy. These observations indicate that V1r receptors can discriminate distinct structural classes of steroids, while accepting minor structural variations within the class.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Redundancy in female pheromone recognition</title><p>SEs and estrus signals are recognized by multiple members of V1rj group receptors while female-specific gender cues are recognized by several V1re-Chr.7 group receptors. This suggests that receptors that recognize a given female cue are closely related family members belonging to the same clade of the V1r family. Moreover, the members of each receptor group are clustered in the same chromosomal loci. The V1rj members are located in close proximity to each other on Chr.7 in a stretch of ∼150 kb DNA. The receptors identified from FUSCs are V1re clade members also clustered on Chr.7. The V1re clade members located on Chr.17 were not identified from any of the FUSCs, despite their sequence similarity to those located on Chr.7. Although it is not clear whether the V1re-Chr.17 receptors also respond to female-specific gender cues, the evidence so far suggests a tight association between the chromosomal location of the receptor genes and their ligand recognition specificity. Thus, it is likely that the pools of receptor genes have been expanded locally in the genome to enable the redundant recognition of estrus or gender specific signals. This expansion may also diversify the response properties of the receptor pools. V1rj3 appears to be narrowly tuned to sulfated estrogens and is more sensitive to E1103. V1rj2, on the other hand, is more sensitive to E1050. In addition, it can be activated by additional sulfated steroid compounds. These diversified response properties may allow the fine tuning of behavioral response.</p><p>Similar to our findings, other studies also showed the recognition of a given ligand by multiple receptors. For example, one of the ESP family peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kimoto et al., 2007</xref>), ESP5, is recognized by both V2rp1 (Vmn2r112) and V2rp2 (Vmn2r111), both located on Chr.17 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dey and Matsunami, 2011</xref>). In another case, the MHC peptide ‘AAPDNRETF’ activates not only V2r1b (Vmn2r26)-positive but also V2r1b-negative VSNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Leinders-Zufall et al., 2009</xref>). 2-heptanone stimulates V1rb2-expressing VSNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Boschat et al., 2002</xref>), but it can still stimulate the VNO of the mutant mice with a genomic deletion of the V1ra and b clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Del Punta et al., 2002</xref>). The identity of the additional receptors, however, remains unknown in the latter two cases.</p><p>It should be noted that some pheromones are specifically recognized by a single cognate vomeronasal receptor. For instance, the male specific ESP family peptide, ESP1, is recognized by V2rp5, and the deletion of V2rp5 completely abolishes VNO activation and the behavioral response to ESP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Haga et al., 2010</xref>). The highly specific pairing between ESP1 and V2rp5 enables a labeled line transmission of ESP1 information in triggering lordosis behavior. However, a highly specific labeled line carries a price—the disruption of a single receptor gene completely eliminates the behavioral effect of ESP1.</p><p>The observation that several receptors recognize the same set of female pheromone cues suggests that the receptors may serve a redundant function in encoding pheromone information. Building a redundancy in pheromone recognition would enable robust detection of important cues. Both the estrus and the female-specific gender cues are recognized by multiple receptors, and both are required to trigger male mounting behaviors. Since male mounting behavior is an essential component of male reproductive behavior, redundant coding of these signals may be advantageous to reproductive success. In addition, activation of multiple receptors by a given ligand may offer an advantage in detecting a broader range of ligand concentrations. Indeed, in the present study, the SEs showed different threshold concentrations in activating V1rj2 and V1rj3. Such diversity should enable the VNO to detect the threshold concentration of the ligand with the most sensitive receptor, as well as to accommodate high concentrations of the ligand that can fully activate several receptors. In this scenario, redundancy offers an advantage in expanding the dynamic range of pheromone detection and providing quantitative information of a given pheromone ligand.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Plausible logic in pheromone information processing</title><p>VNO activation triggers endocrine changes and ritualistic action patterns through preprogrammed neural circuits. Individual pheromones can directly trigger distinct innate behaviors, but complex interactions of pheromones in eliciting behaviors are observed in vertebrate species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wyatt, 2003</xref>). Our observations suggest a model of neural circuitry that processes complex pheromone cues. In this model, activation of both the V1rj and V1re-Chr.7 receptor circuits promotes mating behavior in male mice. This requirement of two sets of pheromone cues suggests an ‘AND’ gate in circuit logic, which can provide safeguard against spurious signals. The gender cue is not sufficient to induce mounting behavior unless the estrus signal is also present. This mechanism may enhance reproductive success by inducing males to mate preferentially with estrous females. Likewise, the activation of the V1rj receptors alone is not sufficient to induce mounting behaviors. Estrogen metabolites, including sulfated estrogens, may be excreted by animals of other species. Responding to these compounds alone may induce an inappropriate behavioral response to false targets. It is conceivable that only when both estrus signals and gender specific signals from their own species are present, the mating circuit is activated. On the other hand, the observation that several receptors recognize the same set of female pheromone cues suggests that the receptors may serve a redundant function in encoding pheromone information, which resembles an ‘OR’ gate in circuit logic. Building a redundancy in pheromone recognition would enable robust detection of important cues with expanded dynamic range and provide better quantitative information of a given pheromone ligand.</p><p>An intriguing question is where the signal integration occurs in the brain. One potential site is the connection between the VSN axon terminals and dendrites of mitral cells within the glomeruli in the accessory olfactory bulb (AOB), the primary relay center in the vomeronasal system. It has been shown that VSN axons expressing homologous receptors intermingle within spatially conserved domains of the AOB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wagner et al., 2006</xref>), providing a potential integration site for ‘OR’ gated signals. The AOB secondary neurons, mitral cells, arborize multiple dendrites onto different glomeruli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Takami and Graziadei, 1991</xref>), providing an anatomical structure for a potential integration site of ‘AND’ gated signals. This scenario fits to the hierarchical integration model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>), where the female or estrus signals received by multiple members of V1re or V1rj receptors reach the ‘OR’ gates for each receptor group, and then the signals passing through the gates are integrated again at the ‘AND’ gate. Alternatively, it is also possible that the female signals received by any of V1re receptors are integrated with the estrus signals received by any of V1rj receptors at the multiple nodes of the ‘AND’ gates. The signals that passed through each ‘AND’ gate are integrated again at the ‘OR’ gate (multiple node integration model, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>). These integration events may also occur at higher-level circuitry in the brain. Anatomical tracing of the circuits will further reveal this logic.</p><p>In conclusion, our results suggest that the VNO system may harness these two opposing logical mechanisms to fulfill divergent duties in pheromone signal processing: detecting cues with high sensitivity while preventing non-specific induction of behaviors by false signals. This logic complements the highly specific, ‘labeled line’ circuit that directly links sensory stimuli to behavioral responses, such as the one that regulates lordosis behaviors triggered by the peptide ESP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Haga et al., 2010</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p>All mice were maintained in Lab Animal Service Facility of Stowers Institute at 12:12 light/dark cycle and provided with food and water <italic>ad libitum</italic>.

Then, for each stimulus, the local (specific to the stimulus) ROIs were detected in two steps: (1) generate ROI candidates by using a customized signal-to-noise ratio criteria; (2) select the candidates as ROIs with manual inspection. Subsequently, the local ROIs were integrated to generate a list of global (non-specific to any stimulus) ROIs. For signal peak analysis, the temporal profiles of image intensity at the global ROIs were individually extracted as raw signals and a scalar value ΔF/F was calculated. In order to compute F, a baseline fitting step was performed to model photo-bleaching effect and a peak detection step was performed to model the signal peak. ΔF was computed as the difference between the signal peak and the baseline. The computation was then manually validated to exclude possible errors.

Fractions were lyophilized and stored at −20°C until use.</p><p>For VNO imaging experiment, lyophilized fractions were dissolved in Ringer’s solution with final concentration correspond to 1/10 of the original urine sample used. For behavioral experiment, lyophilized T16 fraction was dissolved in PBS with the final concentration was equivalent to the original urine sample used.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Electro-olfactogram (EOG) recordings</title><p>Field potentials were recorded from the ciliated layer of intact MOE. Briefly, the MOE was exposed and perfused with oxygenated mACSF. Field potential was recorded using glass pipettes (10 μm diameter) connected to an AI 401 pre-amplifier (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). The signals were further amplified by a signal conditioner (Molecular Devices), digitized at 1 kHz by Digidata 1322A (Molecular Devices), low-pass filtered at 20 Hz and further analyzed using pCLAMP. Stimuli were delivered through a second glass pipette controlled by the HPLC injection valve. Applications of ACSF and 0.1% DMSO were used for evaluating the baseline activities. Multiple applications of 2-heptanone (twice at a beginning and once at the last) was used for evaluating the tissue viability.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Behavior assay</title><p>Individual males were single-housed for at least 3 weeks without bedding change prior to the test. Assays were performed in the home cages. Males were habituated to the behavioral room by transferring their cages to the room for 1 hr each day for 3 days prior to the assay. On the day of assay, males were again habituated for 30 min before recipient females were introduced into male cages. The females were painted with one of the following stimuli: vehicle (PBS), estrus or non-estrus urine, 10 μM sulfated estrogens (E1050, E1103) in vehicle or in none-estrus urine, HPLC fraction in vehicle or with 10 μM sulfated estrogens. The stimuli were painted on the anogenital area and dried for 10 min before the females were introduced to male home cages. All assays were conducted in the dark cycle of the animals and video-taped. To minimize the influence of behavioral differences of the recipient females, each female was randomly assigned to each of the stimuli and used multiple times with at least 2 weeks of interval. For aggression assay, individual males were singly housed for 2–3 weeks. During the test, a group-housed CBA male was introduced to the home cage of the resident male.</p><p>All the behavioral data were scored manually using Observer XT software (Noldus Information Technology, Wageningen, Netherlands). Male mounting behavior was counted based on the definitions as follows: (1) males approach females and run his head first along her flank then onto the back, (2) male arms are locked in front over female's hips and over her middle section so that males and females are positioned genital to genital, (3) males show the pelvic thrust with a stable frequency. At least 10 naïve males were tested with each stimulus. Male aggression was scored when the resident male attacked and bit the flank of the intruder male. Kruskal–Wallis test and Mann–Whitney's post-hoc test were used to analyze the data on the frequency, duration and latency of mounting behavior.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Drs R Krumlauf, R Axel, JW Wang, K Touhara and N Yamanaka for helpful discussion and comments on the manuscript.

Your manuscript has been evaluated by three expert reviewers and a member of the Board of Reviewing Editors (Jeremy Nathans), all of whom are enthusiastic about it. The following comments reflect the consensus view of these four individuals.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This is an impressive and important manuscript describing different components in female urine that activate VNO neurons expressing specific VR clades in males. Using a technically difficult combination of slice calcium imaging and single-cell RT-PCR, the authors identified two subtypes of VRs, V1rjs that respond to sulfated estrogen products (found only in urine from females in estrous) and V1res that respond to a specific fraction of female urine (T16). Using transgenic ectopic overexpression the authors demonstrate that ectopic expression of these receptors confers responsiveness to VNO neurons that normally do not express these receptors, supporting their hypothesis that these are the cognate receptors for these ligands.</p><p>The dissection of the genes that are likely to contribute and the chemicals that stimulate mating responses is an important new finding. A very significant aspect of the manuscript is the convincing evidence regarding the logic of the mechanisms that build the signals required to elicit behavioral responses. Although additional evidence will be needed to demonstrate genetic sufficiency of the identified receptors, the present work considerably focuses that effort.</p><p>Major points (points 1, 2, and 5 are the most significant; points 3 and 4 are of interest but are not as central):</p><p>1) The use of degenerate PCR is obviously essential to the authors' approach, but there is insufficient information to evaluate whether the receptors identified reflect PCR bias (positively or negatively). For example does one see a broad repertoire if random cells are chosen (or if VR are amplified from a bulk pool of mRNA)? Additionally, can V1rj1 be identified with the receptor oligos? This point is critical to the subsequent assignment of these receptors as detectors of the cognate ligands. One approach to this question would be to PCR amplify total VNO cDNA with the degenerate primers, subject the resulting mixture of PCR products to NextGen sequencing, and then use the read counts to quantitatively assess the repertoire that is revealed by PCR. This would allow one to recast the statement in the Results section: “It is highly improbably that, out of more than 300 VRs, the receptors belonging...” as a quantitative statement.</p><p>2) It is not clear how many cells were ’profiled‘ in order to get the 15 cells that expressed the restricted subset of VRs. If the authors looked at only 15 and got at least 1 receptor from each of them that would support the conclusion that the repertoire of receptors that can respond is restricted. Therefore it would be helpful to indicate that the data came from isolating the contents of X cells from which Y expressed VRs (where X and Y indicate the numbers).</p><p>3) Showing a causal relationship between activation of V1R e and j members and mating behavior is beyond the scope of the current study, as this would require knocking out these genes. That said, in odorant receptor M71 overexpressing mice, the mice show impaired detection of the M71 ligand acetophenone. Have the authors checked if any of the V1R overexpressing males show normal mounting behavior? It would be interesting to see how the transgenic mice that express V1rj and V1re in most cells of the VNO respond behaviorally to total female urine or SE and T16. Given that these receptors are now expressed in VNO neurons involved in other functions (for example aggression) one would expect that these mice might show some other behavioral alterations.</p><p>4) Could there also be female-specific pheromones that are still produced in ovarectomized females? In other words, if the authors paint a castrated male with the two SEs and T16 would males attempt to mate with them?</p><p>5) The authors do not make any reference to expression of the VNO receptors in females. Are they expressed in similar frequency as in the male VNO, and if so do they respond to the same compounds?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03025.026</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) The use of degenerate PCR is obviously essential to the authors' approach, but there is insufficient information to evaluate whether the receptors identified reflect PCR bias (positively or negatively).

Using cDNA from the whole VNO, we were able to identify majority of known members of the V1r and V2r families from every clade. A table is added to illustrate the result. In addition to the whole VNO samples, we have results from many single cells from control and experiments designed to identify receptors for specific ligands. Results from single cells indicated that some receptors were more frequently identified than others. This observation may be related to the difference in abundance. The results are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>.</p><p>V1rj1 is amplified. In fact, it is one of the receptors we identified from neurons responding to SEs, which is identical to Vmn1r86. The sequence is annotated in NCBI database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/AY044668.1">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/AY044668.1</ext-link>). However, perhaps due to the imperfection of the DNA sequence submitted to NCBI, V1rj1 is not annotated in Blat and Ensemble. Moreover, for some reason it is not linked with Vmn1r86 in NCBI: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NM_001167536.1">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NM_001167536.1</ext-link>). To clarify this point, we have indicated this fact in a note.</p><p><italic>2) It is not clear how many cells were ’profiled‘ in order to get the 15 cells that expressed the restricted subset of VRs.

Approximately 50 cells in each slice responded to SEs. We picked 22 SE-responding cells and subjected them to degenerate RT-PCR. 15 of these cells were chosen for further analyses based on the criterion that the sample was not amplified by more than 3 pairs of degenerate PCR primers. Although the primer pairs were designed against specific sets of receptor genes, the same product could be amplified by more than one pair of primers. Out of the 15 cells analyzed, 14 cells of them expressed V1rj members.</p><p><italic>3) Showing a causal relationship between activation of V1R e and j members and mating behavior is beyond the scope of the current study, as this would require knocking out these genes.

Our preliminary results indicate that the male mice expressing an ectopic receptor (OMP-IRES-tTA:tetO-V1rj3) exhibit relatively normal mating behaviors but diminished territorial aggression.</p><p>These observations are consistent with previous studies showing that VNO is required for pheromone-triggered territorial aggression. The interpretation of this result, however, is complicated by many factors. The expression of ectopic receptor may displace the endogenous receptor genes to effect a general reduction of VNO function. Alternatively, it is possible that suppressed expression of VRs responding the male cues selectively reduces male aggression. Further complicating the interpretation is that the main olfactory system may be compromised as well. Similar to the ectopic expression of M71 receptor in the monoclonal nose mice, our transgenes are also driven by OMP, which allows the expression of VRs in the main olfactory epithelium. A systematic investigation of different lines will be required to address the questions being raised.</p><p><italic>4) Could there also be female-specific pheromones that are still produced in ovarectomized females?

However, we found that these receptors were activated to lesser extent by urine from ovariectomized females. The data is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>.

In situ data show that the expression patterns of the receptor genes are not sexually dimorphic. Moreover, VNO slices from male and female mice show similar responses to the SEs and estrous urine. This is an important point and we have added a figure to illustrate it (revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).</p></body></sub-article></article>
