reorganisation into an array of paraxial microtubules, which serves as template for contractile sarcomere formation. In this study, we identify a previously uncharacterised isoform of microtubule-associated protein MAP4, oMAP4, as a microtubule organising factor that is crucial for myogenesis. We show that oMAP4 is expressed upon muscle cell differentiation and is the only MAP4 isoform essential for normal progression of the myogenic differentiation programme. Depletion of oMAP4 impairs cell elongation and cell–cell fusion. Most notably, oMAP4 is required for paraxial microtubule organisation in muscle cells and prevents dynein- and kinesin-driven microtubule–microtubule sliding. Purified oMAP4 aligns dynamic microtubules into antiparallel bundles that withstand motor forces in vitro. We propose a model in which the cooperation of dynein-mediated microtubule transport and oMAP4-mediated zippering of microtubules drives formation of a paraxial microtubule array that provides critical support for the polarisation and elongation of myotubes.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05697.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05697.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05697.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Skeletal muscles—which enable animals to move—are made up of large elongated muscle cells that span the entire length of the muscle. These cells contain stacks of structures called sarcomeres that enable the cells to contract and generate the force required for movement.</p><p>Cells called myoblasts elongate and fuse together at their tips to make the muscle cells. Within the myoblasts, long filaments called microtubules are arranged in an overlapping linear pattern. The filaments act as a template that helps the sarcomeres to align as the muscle cells form. A family of microtubule-associated proteins (or ‘MAPs’ for short) bind to microtubules and assist in organising the filaments, but it is not clear how they work.</p><p>Mogessie et al. used microscopy to observe the formation of the microtubule filaments in living myoblasts. The experiments show that the filaments progressively become more ordered as the myoblasts develop into muscle cells. Mogessie et al. identified a new member of the MAP family that is produced in myoblasts as soon as they start to form muscle fibres, and named it oMAP4. The microtubules in cells that make smaller amounts of this protein were more disorganised, and these cells were unable to fuse with each other to form muscle cells.</p><p>The experiments also found that oMAP4 can create links between different microtubules and act as a brake to prevent the filaments being moved excessively by motor proteins. Therefore, Mogessie et al. suggest that oMAP4 contributes to the formation of a strong and stable arrangement of filaments. This, in turn, allows the muscle cells to become very long.</p><p>Making more oMAP4 alone is not sufficient to form the elongated muscle cells. Therefore, the next challenge is to understand how other processes—such as the selective stabilisation of some microtubules and the movement of cell materials along the microtubules—cooperate to control muscle fibre formation.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05697.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05697.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>microtubule organisation</kwd><kwd>microtubule-associated protein</kwd><kwd>molecular motor</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000654</institution-id><institution>Marie Curie Cancer Care</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Core Funding/Programme Grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mogessie</surname><given-names>Binyam</given-names></name><name><surname>Roth</surname><given-names>Daniel</given-names></name><name><surname>Straube</surname><given-names>Anne</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001255</institution-id><institution>Lister Institute of Preventive Medicine</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Research Prize</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Roth</surname><given-names>Daniel</given-names></name><name><surname>Straube</surname><given-names>Anne</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>oMAP4 is a microtubule crosslinker that restricts motor driven microtubule motility and cooperates with microtubule motors in the establishment of paraxial microtubule arrangements in differentiating muscle cells.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Skeletal muscle fibre formation requires a coordinated programme of morphological and biochemical changes in the differentiating cells. Upon differentiation, mono-nucleated myoblasts withdraw from the cell cycle and fuse to form syncytial myotubes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wakelam, 1985</xref>). The microtubule cytoskeleton is required for these processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bischoff and Holtzer, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Holtzer et al., 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Toyama et al., 1982</xref>) and undergoes reorganisation into an array of paraxial microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Warren, 1974</xref>), which serves as template for contractile sarcomere formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Antin et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pizon et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>During myogenesis, microtubules are rearranged from a dynamic radial array to a parallel array of stable posttranslationally modified microtubules within the elongating cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Warren, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tassin et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Saitoh et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gundersen et al., 1989</xref>). Preventing detyrosination of tubulin or interfering with microtubule stabilisation by depletion of EB1 or MURF impairs expression of myogenic markers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Spencer et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chang et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zhang et al., 2009</xref>), thus suggesting that signalling through modified microtubules might control myogenic differentiation. On the other hand, changes in the regulation of microtubule dynamics at the cell cortex that neither affect the content of tubulin modifications nor the expression of differentiation markers can result in cell polarisation and fusion defects as caused by the depletion of EB3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Straube and Merdes, 2007</xref>). This suggests a dual function of microtubules during the early stages of muscle cell differentiation to control (1) morphological changes and (2) biochemical composition, before later serving as structural templates for myofibrillogenesis.</p><p>A number of microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) have been implicated in the organisation of microtubules into bundles. MAP2 and tau determine the spacing between microtubules in dendrites and axons, but do not control the directionality of microtubules within those bundles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 1992</xref>). Proteins of the PRC1/MAP65/Ase1 family preferentially bundle microtubules in antiparallel orientation and are responsible for the stabilisation of the antiparallel microtubule overlaps in the spindle midzone during mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Loiodice et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gaillard et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Subramanian et al., 2010</xref>). Microtubule–microtubule sliding by Eg5, kinesin-1, kinesin-14, and dynein has been implicated in microtubule organisation and force generation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kapitein et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fink and Steinberg, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Straube et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Braun et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fink et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tanenbaum et al., 2013</xref>), and we begin to understand how the interplay of motors and MAPs organises particular microtubule arrangements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Janson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bieling et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Braun et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Here, we show that the microtubule array in myoblasts is highly motile and becomes increasingly parallelised and immobilised as cells progress through the differentiation programme. We identify a previously uncharacterised differentially regulated isoform of microtubule-associated protein MAP4, called oMAP4, as a key organiser of microtubules in differentiating cells. Depletion of oMAP4 results in microtubule misalignment and increased microtubule motility in differentiating muscle cells. This results in defects in myogenic progression, cell polarisation, and cell–cell fusion. We further show that oMAP4 zippers preferentially antiparallel microtubules in vitro and restricts motor-driven microtubule sliding in differentiating muscle cells. Based on our own data, we propose a model whereby the cooperation of motor-driven microtubule–microtubule sliding and oMAP4-mediated zippering organises the microtubule cytoskeleton in differentiating muscle cells to support and govern cell polarisation and differentiation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Microtubules become progressively more ordered and immobile during muscle differentiation</title><p>To characterise microtubule organisation in differentiating muscle cells, we determined filament orientation, motility, and growth characteristics of microtubules at different stages during differentiation of C2C12 cells. As reported previously, we found that microtubule organisation changes from a radial, centrosome-dominated array in undifferentiated cells, to a paraxial array in myotubes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Warren, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tassin et al., 1985</xref>). Microtubule growth directionality relative to the longitudinal axis of the cell was determined by tracking EB3-tdTomato-labelled microtubule ends. The asymmetry in the distribution of microtubule growth angles increases significantly during the first two days of differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). This suggests that guided growth of microtubules (probably along existing microtubules) contributes to the progressively more ordered parallel microtubule array in differentiating cells. Furthermore, microtubules within the array are highly motile in undifferentiated myoblasts as visualised by the photoactivation of paGFP-Tubulin or conversion of mEos2-Tubulin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E,F</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1 media2">Videos 1, 2</xref>). In differentiating muscle cells, microtubules become very stable and static as seen by the low frequency and speed of microtubule-sliding movements and by diminished loss of microtubules from the photoactivated region due to depolymerisation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E–H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media3">Video 3</xref>). The reduction in microtubule movements could be due to the differential regulation of motors that drive microtubule sliding. Conventional kinesin as well as dynein has been implicated in microtubule–microtubule sliding and microtubule movement along the cell cortex in other cell systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rusan et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fink and Steinberg, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Straube et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bicek et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jolly et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Samora et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lu et al., 2013</xref>). Both motors contribute to microtubule movements in myoblasts as the frequency of microtubule movements was reduced more than threefold upon depletion of either dynein heavy chain or Kif5b (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E–H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media4 media5">Videos 4, 5</xref>). However, Kif5b and dynein were continuously expressed during muscle differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>), suggesting that other factors prevent motor-dependent microtubule sliding and promote parallel microtubule array formation during myogenesis.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05697.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Microtubules are arranged in stable paraxial arrays during muscle cell differentiation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Structured illumination microscopy of anti-tubulin-stained C2C12 cells pre/post induction of muscle differentiation as indicated.

MAP4, the only non-neuronal member of the MAP2/Tau family, has been reported to stabilise and bundle microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aizawa et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">West et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ookata et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nguyen et al., 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hasan et al., 2006</xref>). Our previous finding that MAP4 can limit force generation by dynein motors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Samora et al., 2011</xref>) suggested that MAP4 might prevent dynein-driven microtubule motility in muscle cells. Mouse skeletal muscle cells express tissue-specific isoforms of MAP4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mangan and Olmsted, 1996</xref>). To investigate the differential regulation of experimentally confirmed and predicted MAP4 transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), we performed RT-PCR analysis of total RNA isolated from differentiating C2C12 cells. We confirmed the continuous expression of the ubiquitous isoform uMAP4 and upregulation of muscle-specific mMAP4 24 hr post induction of differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Interestingly, we found that a previously uncharacterised isoform, with a unique 48 kD projection domain, was also upregulated after 24 hr of differentiation. In addition to muscle, this isoform is also highly expressed in brain tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). We refer to this isoform as oMAP4. Further analysis revealed that uMAP4, mMAP4, and oMAP4 transcripts were each expressed as variants with three, four, or five tau-like microtubule binding repeats due to alternative splicing of exons 14 and 15 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). To confirm that these transcripts encode proteins, we generated specific antibodies for mMAP4 and oMAP4 and probed whole cell lysates of C2C12 cells on Western blots. Both mMAP4 and oMAP4 protein levels increase between 24 and 48 hr after differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,D</xref>). As expected, GFP-fusion proteins of uMAP4, mMAP4, and oMAP4 decorated microtubules along their length in C2C12 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05697.012</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>oMAP4 is required for myoblast elongation and fusion.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Domain organization of MAP4 isoforms.

GFP-Tubulin was co-expressed with the short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) to serve as a marker to detect successful transfection. Efficient depletion was confirmed by Western blotting of FACS-sorted GFP-positive cells and by immunofluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4 fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplements 4, 5</xref>). Muscle differentiation phenotypes were assessed as (1) the ability of single nucleated cells to elongate and (2) the efficiency of cells to fuse and form syncytia containing three or more nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Straube and Merdes, 2007</xref>). 48 hr after differentiation, the average length of myoblasts treated with control shRNA was 107 ± 40 μm. Depletion of uMAP4 did not significantly affect this (105 ± 36 μm, p = 0.4; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E,F</xref>). Depletion of mMAP4 allowed myoblasts to elongate to an average length of 143 ± 58 μm, which is significantly longer than control cells. Myoblast fusion efficiency was not significantly affected following the depletion of uMAP4 or mMAP4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). In contrast, the depletion of oMAP4 caused severe defects in myoblast elongation and fusion. oMAP4-depleted cells had an average length of 82 ± 39 μm, which is significantly shorter than control myoblasts (p &lt;&lt; 0.001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E,F</xref>). Furthermore, cell–cell fusion efficiency was reduced more than fourfold following depletion of oMAP4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). Importantly, co-transfection of an RNAi-resistant version of oMAP4 (FLAG-oMAP4<sup>RIP</sup>) rescued the myoblast elongation and fusion defects caused by oMAP4 shRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H,I</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2—figure supplement 6</xref>). The overexpression of uMAP4 was not able to rescue oMAP4-depletion phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>). Our data collectively demonstrate that oMAP4 is specifically required for morphogenesis and cell–cell fusion during muscle cell differentiation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>oMAP4 depletion leads to disorganised microtubules</title><p>To understand which processes in the myogenic programme depend on oMAP4, we analysed the timing of myogenic events. We find a severe delay and reduction in the expression of embryonic myosin, a structural protein required for sarcomere formation, in oMAP4-depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–C</xref>). Likewise, the relocation of centrosomal proteins to the nuclear surface of myoblasts, a characteristic event during myogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tassin et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Srsen et al., 2009</xref>), is severely delayed in oMAP4-depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D,E</xref>). These results confirm that progression through the myogenic differentiation programme depends on oMAP4. Previous work has shown that interference with microtubule stability and the acquisition of posttranslational modifications of tubulin result in similar myogenesis defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Spencer et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chang et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zhang et al., 2009</xref>). Depletion of oMAP4 did not result in a reduction of tubulin acetylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>), perhaps because other microtubule stabilisers were still present. Nevertheless, the microtubule cytoskeleton appeared disorganised in oMAP4-depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref>). To quantitatively assess microtubule network organisation and distinguish this from effects due to different morphology and differentiation status, we selected mono-nucleated elongated myoblasts treated with control and oMAP4 shRNA and manually traced GFP-Tubulin-labelled microtubules in equivalent sections of these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media6 media7">Videos 6, 7</xref>). We found that the microtubule network was largely parallel in control cells with ∼80% of microtubules oriented ±15° of the longitudinal cell axis. This was reduced to ∼50% in oMAP4-depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>). Microtubule orientation was fully rescued by expression of an RNAi-resistant oMAP4 construct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Depletion of mMAP4 increased paraxial microtubule alignment and uMAP4 depletion slightly reduced it (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). We confirmed the microtubule alignment defect caused by oMAP4 depletion results by tracking growing microtubule ends labelled with EB3-tdTomato (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media8 media9">Videos 8, 9</xref>). While microtubule growth speed and duration were only slightly affected, the orientation of microtubule growth deviated more from the longitudinal cell axis when oMAP4 was depleted compared to control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J–L</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05697.019</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>oMAP4 is required for the parallel arrangement of microtubules in differentiating muscle cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold> and <bold>B</bold>) C2C12 myoblasts 48 hr after induction of differentiation treated with shRNA as indicated and stained for Myogenin (a marker for differentiating myoblasts, yellow), PCM-1 (red) and DAPI (blue).

Alternatively, microtubule sliding and looping as observed in undifferentiated cells could disorganise the microtubule network in oMAP4-depleted cells. To distinguish between these possibilities, we analysed microtubule motility in differentiated, shRNA-treated cells, again selecting elongated, mono-nucleated cells to exclude effects due to morphology alone. As described above, microtubule motility was strongly suppressed in differentiating muscle cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1 fig4">Figures 1E–H, 4a</xref>). Depletion of oMAP4 resulted in a more than fourfold increase in the frequency of microtubule sliding events, and these were significantly faster than those in control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–D</xref>). In addition, the rare sliding events in differentiated control cells were usually restricted to movements parallel to the long axis of the cell, while microtubules were observed to loop in oMAP4-depleted cells, similarly to undifferentiated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1 media2 media3 media10 media11">Videos 1–3, 10, 11</xref>).

In order to distinguish between these possibilities, we co-depleted dynein from oMAP4-depleted cells. If oMAP4 would act exclusively through dynein, we posited this should rescue the depletion phenotypes. Depletion of dynein heavy chain alone did not significantly affect the already low-microtubule sliding frequencies in differentiated cells, although the velocity of microtubule sliding was reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B–D</xref>). Cells co-depleted for dynein and oMAP4 still showed a high frequency of microtubule-sliding events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B,C</xref>), although fast sliding events and looping were reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D,E</xref>). Consequently, dynein co-depletion slightly alleviated the microtubule disorganisation caused by oMAP4 depletion, but did not fully rescue it (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). These results suggest that oMAP4 prevents microtubule sliding by crosslinking microtubules rather than by inhibiting dynein force generation per se. Indeed, expression of GFP-oMAP4 in undifferentiated myoblasts resulted in a significant increase in strong microtubule bundles, while expression of GFP-uMAP4 had no effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F,G</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>oMAP4 crosslinks antiparallel microtubules in vitro</title><p>To directly test the hypothesis that oMAP4 is a crosslinker, we recombinantly expressed and purified oMAP4 and GFP-oMAP4 from <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Using in vitro microtubule co-sedimentation assays, we confirmed microtubule-binding activity of the purified proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). When Taxol- or GMP-CPP-stabilised microtubules were incubated with 60-nM oMAP4, we frequently observed microtubule bundles and structures with crossovers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C–F</xref>). This confirmed that oMAP4 has microtubule cross-linking activity. We next asked whether oMAP4 has the ability to organise dynamic microtubules into antiparallel bundles in vitro. To do this, we used total internal reflection (TIRF) microscopy to visualise microtubules assembled from biotinylated microtubule seeds immobilised on streptavidin-coated coverslips. In control chambers, microtubules continued growing without changing direction when they encountered other microtubules and microtubules only overlapped when they happened to grow in the same direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,B</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media12">Video 12</xref>). The addition of GFP-oMAP4 promoted zippering of those growing microtubules that encountered each other at shallow angles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–C</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="media13">Video 13</xref>). To assess whether oMAP4 was specific for the orientation of the microtubules, we determined microtubule polarity based on the growth characteristics of the microtubule ends observed in the video (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>) and determined the rate of microtubule zippering relative to the incident angle of the two microtubules. No microtubule-zippering events were observed at angles between 25° and 150°, suggesting that oMAP4 can only generate forces to bend microtubules by up to 30°. Furthermore, oMAP4 showed a strong preference for zippering antiparallel-oriented microtubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B,C</xref>).<fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05697.030</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>oMAP4 bundles microtubules in vitro.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) SDS-PAGE analysis of oMAP4 protein purification.

We observed that PRC1 was more potent to bundle-stabilised microtubules free in solution than oMAP4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E,F</xref>). However, PRC1 was not able to zipper microtubules in our assays using dynamic microtubules growing from immobilised seeds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). This is in agreement with the literature that described PRC1 to specifically bind to antiparallel-microtubule overlaps that form when microtubules ‘occasionally encountered each other in a plus end-to-plus end configuration’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bieling et al., 2010</xref>) rather than PRC1 itself causing the formation of the overlaps. We do not observe a substantial enrichment of GFP-oMAP4 in antiparallel or parallel overlaps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). To determine whether the bias in zippering towards antiparallel-oriented microtubules could be due to differences in the length of microtubules that encountered each other, we measured the length dependence of MAP4-mediated zippering. We found similar distributions of microtubule lengths for encounters that resulted in zippering and those encounters that occurred at similarly shallow-incipient angles but not led to zippering (p = 0.22). Likewise, there was no difference between parallel and antiparallel encounters that were zippered (p = 0.59) and those that did not result in zippering (p = 0.88) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Therefore, our results demonstrate that oMAP4 is a microtubule-organising factor, which can arrange microtubules into antiparallel and with lesser efficiency parallel bundles. This function is consistent with the depletion phenotypes observed in differentiating muscle cells, where oMAP4 helps to arrange paraxial microtubules and thereby supports cell differentiation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>oMAP4 bundles withstand motor forces</title><p>PRC-1 is dimer that forms highly ordered crosslinks that do not substantially limit microtubule–microtubule sliding at moderate concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Subramanian et al., 2010</xref>). As we proposed that oMAP4 contributes to microtubule alignment by preventing microtubule sliding in differentiating muscle cells, we next asked how oMAP4-crosslinks microtubules and whether these can withstand motor forces. We considered whether the unique projection domain in oMAP4 confers microtubule cross-linking activity by dimerisation. Proteins of the MAP2/tau family are highly elongated, structurally disordered monomers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hernandez et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Devred et al., 2004</xref>). Using the GOR secondary structure prediction method, we find that oMAP4, uMAP4, and tau share a similar structure of over 60% random coil, about 20% helical, and 13% extended strand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Garnier et al., 1996</xref>). Furthermore, no significant coiled-coil domain was predicted. To confirm this, we performed sedimentation analysis of bacterially expressed oMAP4 and GFP-oMAP4 in comparison with a number of standard proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D,E</xref>). We obtained sedimentation constants of 3.6 ± 0.25 S and 4.3 ± 0.21 S, respectively. Given the molecular weight of the monomers being 99 kD and 131 kD, respectively, we can calculate the frictional ratio <italic>ƒ/ƒ</italic><sub>min</sub> = 2.1, suggesting that oMAP4 is a highly elongated monomer with a shape comparable to tau (<italic>ƒ/ƒ</italic><sub>min</sub> = 1.8, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Devred et al., 2004</xref>]). We, therefore, predict that oMAP4 most likely bundles microtubules using a second microtubule-binding region in its projection domain.</p><p>Single kinesin-1 and dynein molecules can generate forces of up to 7 pN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nishiyama et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Toba et al., 2006</xref>). To determine whether oMAP4 bundling can indeed withstand the forces exerted by several motors tugging the microtubules apart, we performed gliding assays with kinesin-1. The presence of 80 nM oMAP4 did only slightly affect the velocity of kinesin-mediated movements of single microtubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A,B</xref>). However, antiparallel-microtubule bundles formed in solution and landing on the kinesin surface were often static or their movement was slow and non-persistent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C–E</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media14">Video 14</xref>). Given their predominantly antiparallel arrangement, forces on the microtubules within a bundle would cancel each other out as long as the linkage between the microtubules is maintained. Occasionally, bundles were driven apart. This usually occurred in bundles where extensive lateral forces were generated on one microtubule that was significantly longer than other microtubules in the bundle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). The antiparallel nature of the oMAP4-generated bundles was confirmed in these cases from the opposing direction of their movement after separation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>, magenta arrows). Most importantly, we observed that more than 75% of microtubule bundles withstand motor forces for the entire duration of our 7.5 min videos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C,E,F</xref>, yellow arrows), suggesting that oMAP4-mediated cross-linking is indeed able to prevent motor-driven microtubule sliding as we hypothesised.<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05697.035</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>oMAP4 bundles can withstand motor forces.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Microtubule gliding assay on a Drosophila kinesin-1-coated surface.

Our data support a model in which microtubules fulfil a structural role during the elongation of muscle cells. If so, one would expect that the degree of alignment of microtubules will correlate with a cell's ability to elongate. We tested this by plotting the Kuiper statistic as a measure of microtubule orderliness against the mean cell length of 48 hr differentiated cells for different RNAi treatments used in this study and found indeed a linear correlation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). Likewise, the depletion of mMAP4, which increases the length of differentiating myoblasts also increases the paraxial microtubule alignment beyond that of control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). These data support the idea that MT orientation is strongly linked to the morphological changes required for muscle differentiation. As observed for oMAP4, our previously published data on EB3 depletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Straube and Merdes, 2007</xref>) and a number of unpublished observations, myoblasts that fail to elongate are also impaired in cell–cell fusion. While we don't yet understand the relationship between cell elongation and fusion, a mechanism to prevent the fusion of myoblasts that did not complete the previous step of differentiation, makes intuitively sense. oMAP4-depleted cells show in addition to impaired morphological changes, also a delay in the expression of myogenic markers, such as myogenin and embryonic myosin, further suggesting that a signalling step in the differentiation programme has not been completed. Microtubules have been implicated in a signalling role during myogenesis based on the observation that altering the level of posttranslational tubulin modifications either through chemical inhibition or depletion of microtubule-stabilising MAPs leads to similar delays in the expression of differentiation markers and impaired formation of myotubes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Spencer et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chang et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zhang et al., 2009</xref>). The depletion of oMAP4 does not negatively affect tubulin acetylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>) but might impact other aspects of this putative microtubule-dependent signalling event. It will be a future challenge to elucidate the pathway that couples microtubule organisation and chemical modification to the timing of the myogenic protein expression programme.<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05697.037</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>oMAP4 and dynein co-operate in the organisation of the paraxial microtubule network in differentiating muscle cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Kuiper statistics of traced microtubule filaments as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3 fig4">Figures 3G, 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref> as a measure for microtubule orderliness is plotted against the mean cell length of 48 hr differentiated C2C12 myoblasts treated with shRNAs as indicated.

While PRC1 is an antiparallel dimer that forms ordered crosslinks of a defined distance and specifically enriches in antiparallel-microtubule overlaps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bieling et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Subramanian et al., 2010</xref>), oMAP4 has little preference for binding to bundles, but instead is able to zipper microtubules. Zippering of microtubules growing from surface-attached seeds requires bending of microtubules. We consider that the lateral forces required to bring two microtubules close together against the rigidity of the microtubule have to be borne by a single crosslinking molecule. Thus, our data suggest that single molecules of oMAP4 can resist higher loads than PRC1 crosslinks. When we apply longitudinal forces as experienced by pre-formed bundles in kinesin-gliding assays, the shear forces are probably shared between several crosslinking molecules, thus enabling oMAP4 to withstand counteracting motor forces on the bundled microtubules. Bundles that contain one very long microtubule that is driven laterally on the kinesin surface, eventually splay apart as lateral forces cannot be shared between the crosslinkers. In contrast, PRC1 cannot resist motor forces and at moderate levels only slightly slows motor-driven sliding of microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bieling et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Subramanian et al., 2010</xref>). Thus, oMAP4 has the required properties to fulfil the role of a microtubule organiser, justifying its name as organising MAP4, although the structural basis for oMAP4's antiparallel zippering remains to be elucidated.</p><p>The motors dynein and kinesin move microtubules and cause apparent disorder that is limited by oMAP4 crosslinking. However, both motors have also been reported to bundle and organise microtubules. Indeed, dynein depletion alone results in reduced microtubule alignment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). This is consistent with the finding that dynein controls muscle length in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Folker et al., 2012</xref>) and earlier reports of dynein involvement in the self-organisation of microtubule networks and its ability to crosslink and slide antiparallel microtubules as well as transporting microtubules along the cell cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Heald et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adames and Cooper, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Merdes et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fink and Steinberg, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Samora et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tanenbaum et al., 2013</xref>). As oMAP4 is only able to efficiently zipper microtubules at incident angles of less than 30° if antiparallel and less than 10° if parallel, we propose that dynein-mediated looping and buckling of microtubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fink and Steinberg, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tanenbaum et al., 2013</xref>) brings microtubules into a favourable position for oMAP4-mediated zippering. As oMAP4-mediated bundling resists motor-driven sliding, dynein can only move those microtubules that are not yet aligned to the paraxial network. Thus, dynein and oMAP4 are likely to cooperate in the formation of the highly ordered microtubule arrangement in differentiating muscle cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). In the absence of oMAP4, excessive motor-driven microtubule motility disorganises microtubules. In the absence of dynein, oMAP4 might stabilise high-angle microtubule crossovers, but will not be able to align them into the network. If the activity of both oMAP4 and dynein is reduced, oMAP4 zippering is missing and kinesin-mediated sliding and bundling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Straube et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jolly et al., 2010</xref>) prevails (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). In agreement with this model, some disorganisation of microtubules has been observed in kinesin-1-depleted myotubes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wilson and Holzbaur, 2012</xref>). Microtubule–microtubule sliding has recently been implicated in driving neurite outgrowth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lu et al., 2013</xref>), and paraxial microtubule arrangements have been shown to drive dorsal closure during embryonic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jankovics and Brunner, 2006</xref>). Thus, the mechanisms we reveal here for motor and MAP cooperation in the formation of paraxial microtubule networks are likely to be of importance beyond muscle cells. Indeed, oMAP4 is highly expressed in brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), suggesting that it might be required to support the paraxial microtubule arrays in dendrites and the axon.</p><p>While the zippering model described above explains how a paraxial array is maintained in the presence of microtubule turnover, it does not explain how the symmetry of the radial microtubule cytoskeleton in the myoblast is broken in the first place. We think that a bipolar elongating myoblast can be compared to a migrating cell with two fronts. Symmetry breaking in cell migration occurs through protrusion mediated by the actin cytoskeleton. Microtubules support and stabilise cell protrusions, and microtubule plus ends are selectively stabilised at the leading edge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Waterman-Storer et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kaverina and Straube, 2011</xref>). This establishes and reinforces the new polarity axis. Similarly, in differentiating myoblasts dynamic capture of microtubule plus ends occurs at the cell tips (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Straube and Merdes, 2007</xref>). This leads to the selective stabilisation of paraxial microtubules to break the symmetry in the microtubule network. The zippering mechanism described here would promote shorter microtubules to align to longer and already bundled microtubules and thus amplify the directional bias and increase stability and orderliness in the paraxial array. It is likely that the guidance of microtubule growth through the cooperation of plus end tracking proteins and motors also contributes to maintenance of the ordered array (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mattie et al., 2010</xref>). It will be interesting to dissect the contributions of these different pathways to microtubule network reorganisation, not only at the onset of myogenesis, but also during later stages when the parallel network is replaced by the grid-like lattice found in adult muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Oddoux et al., 2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>RNA extraction, cDNA preparation, and gene expression analyses</title><p>RNA was extracted from 0 to 60 hr differentiated C2C12 cells using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, Life Technologies, UK), and random-primed cDNA was synthesized using RevertAid H Minus M-MuLV Reverse Transcriptase (Fermentas, Fisher Scientific, UK) according to manufacturer's protocol.

For all analysis of microtubule phenotypes, mono-nucleated, elongated cells were selected. For analyses of microtubule dynamics during myoblast differentiation, fluorescence images of EB3-tdTomato were acquired with 500 ms exposure at a temporal resolution of 3 s for 120 s. EB comets were tracked using plusTipTracker and further analysed for microtubule directionality using custom MATLAB code (see supplementary file MTdirectionality.m).

The microtubule cytoskeleton was focussed and bar-shaped regions of interest perpendicular to the microtubule network were selected using the non-converted mEOS2-Tubulin or mCherry-Tubulin signal. After photoactivation or photoconversion of these regions of interest using 10% 406 nm with the Deltavision photokinetics module laser power, images were acquired with 500 ms exposure at a temporal resolution of 1.6 s per frame for 60 s or lower temporal resolution for up to 6 min. Images were deconvolved with low noise filtering method for 10 iterations using SoftWorx (Applied Precision, LLC).

Labelled tubulin was from Cytoskleleton Inc. (Denver, CO), nucleotides were from Jena Biosciences (Germany) and all other chemicals were from Sigma unless indicated. Microtubule seeds were assembled from tubulin, biotin-tubulin, and Hilyte647-tubulin at a molar ratio of 25:1:2 in the presence of 1 mM GMP-CPP in MRB80 (80 mM PIPES, pH 6.8 with KOH, 1 mM EGTA, 4 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>) for 1 hr at 37°C, diluted 20-fold with MRB80 + 2 μM Paclitaxel and stored at RT. A 100-μm deep flow chamber was made from a slide and a hydrochloric acid-treated coverslip using double-sided tape (Scotch 3M, UK). For MT dynamics assays, the flow chamber was passivated with PLL-PEG-50% biotin (Susos AG, Zurich, Switzerland). Seeds were attached to this surface using streptavidin and blocked with 1 mg/ml κ-casein. A reaction mix containing 15 μM tubulin, 1 μM X-Rhodamine tubulin, 50 mM KCl, 1 mM GTP, 0.6 mg/ml κ-casein, 0.2% methyl cellulose, 4 mM DTT, 0.2 mg/ml catalase, 0.4 mg/ml glucose oxidase, 50 mM glucose in MRB80, supplemented with 80 nM GFP-oMAP4 or buffer was clarified for 8 min at 190,000×<italic>g</italic> in an airfuge (Beckman Coulter, UK), the supernatant added to the flow chamber and sealed with candle wax. For gliding assays, 3 nM <italic>Drosophila</italic> kinesin in MRB80, supplemented with 10 mM β-Mercaptoethanol and 0.1 mM MgATP were flown into the glass chamber, before blocking with 1 mg/ml κ-casein. The gliding mix containing X-rhodamine- and Hilyte647-labelled microtubules, 1 mM ATP, 4 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, oxygen scavenger system (4 mM DTT, 0.2 mg/ml catalase, 0.4 mg/ml glucose oxidase, 50 mM glucose), ATP regeneration system (5 mM phosphocreatine, 7 U/ml creatine phosphokinase), 80 nM GFP-oMAP4 in MRB80 was added to the flow chamber and sealed with candle wax. Microtubule assembly and gliding assays were observed on an Olympus TIRF system using a 100× NA 1.49 objective, 1.6× additional magnification, 488 nm, 561 nm, and 640 nm laser lines, a Hamamatsu ImageEM-1k back-illuminated EM-CCD camera under the control of xcellence software (Olympus, Germany). Microtubule gliding speeds were determined from tracks obtained using ImageJ plugin MTrackJ. Microtubule encounters were classified as zippering when they resulted in bundling for a minimum length of 2 μm away from the initial point of contact. For parallel bundling, zippering would need to occur towards the minus end of both microtubules. For antiparallel zippering, both aligned microtubule ends would need to continue growth for at least 2 μm along the lattice of the other microtubule. Microtubule lengths were measured to address whether the bias in microtubule zippering by oMAP4 arises from differences in lengths between parallel and antiparallel microtubules. For microtubule encounters in either orientation that resulted in successful zippering, distance from the point of encounter to the microtubule seed or to the next microtubule crossover point was measured. Microtubule lengths were measured similarly for unsuccessful encounters but these were restricted to shallow angle encounters at which oMAP4-mediated zippering typically occurs, that is, 10°–30°.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Microtubule pelleting and bundling assays</title><p>Microtubules were polymerised in BRB80 buffer from 40 to 50 μM pig-brain tubulin in the presence of 1 mM GTP by incubation at 37°C for 30 min and stabilised by addition of 20 μM Paclitaxel (Sigma). To remove non-polymerised tubulin, microtubules were pelleted by centrifugation at 45,000 RPM for 25 min at 27°C, washed with and resuspended in BRB80 and 20 μM Paclitaxel. To test binding of MAP4 proteins to microtubules, 1.5 μM of Taxol-stabilised microtubules was mixed with purified 60 nM oMAP4 in the presence of 20 μM Paclitaxel in BRB80 in a total volume of 50 μl. Reactions were then incubated for 20 min at 37°C and centrifuged at 35°C, 50,000 RPM for 15 min. After recovery of the supernatant, the pellet was washed with and then resuspended in 50 μl BRB80 and 20 μM Paclitaxel. After addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer, pellet and supernatant fractions were analysed by SDS-PAGE. For microtubule bundling experiments, 40 μl drops of 0.1 mg/ml Poly-L-Lysine (Sigma) were placed onto 70% ethanol washed and air-dried 22 × 22 mm glass coverslips (Menzel-Gläser, Germany). After removal of the Poly-L-Lysine solution using a bench top coverslip centrifuge (Technical Video Ltd., Port Townsend, WA), coverslips were rinsed three times with 150 μl ddH<sub>2</sub>O using the same procedure and air dried. To test if oMAP4 can bundle microtubules, Rhodamine-labelled microtubule seeds stabilised with GMP-CPP or Taxol-stabilised microtubules were mixed in BRB80 in a total volume of 10 μl and incubated with buffer or with 60 nM oMAP4 at 22°C for 10–15 min. 1 μl samples of reactions were then placed onto slides, mounted with Poly-L-Lysine coated coverslips, and imaged using the Deltavision widefield system as above. For comparative analysis of EB1-, PRC1-, and oMAP4-mediated bundling, freshly polymerised GMPCPP-stabilised Hilyte647-labelled microtubules were incubated with 80 nM protein in MRB80 for 10 min before loading into a 10 μm flow chamber made from a slide and a poly-lysine-coated coverslip. At least 30 random fields were imaged using TIRF microscopy at critical angle. Bundles were counted if at least three times as bright as single microtubules.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Statistical data analysis</title><p>Statistical data analyses and graphing were performed using Origin Pro 8.5 (OriginLab, Northampton, MA) or MATLAB (Mathworks, Natick, MA).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Vivek Malhotra (Senior editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>1) The in vitro experiments require additional controls and quantification:</p><p>1A) There is a huge difference in electrophoretic mobility between the endogenous oMAP4 and the recombinant protein used for reconstitution experiments. The validity of the in vitro reconstitution relies completely on the quality of the protein used, so this point requires clarification.</p><p>1B) A negative and a positive control for the formation of microtubule bundles should be shown. The negative control would be a protein that does not create microtubule bundles (for example, kinesin-1 motor domain, EB1 or another microtubule-binding protein which does not function as a microtubule-bundling factor in cells). This would be used to exclude artifactual sources of bundling in the assay (e.g., protein misfolding). The positive control would be an established microtubule bundler, such as PRC1. A comparison with an established anti-parallel bundler is important because the provided data do not conclusively prove that oMAP4 a “true” antiparallel bundler (a protein, whose structure dictates a preference for binding to antiparallel microtubule overlaps). The alternative is that oMAP4 creates randomly-oriented bundles with microtubules pointing in both directions. Such bundles would also resist gliding by kinesin motors and splay apart, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>. To create a random bundle, oMAP4 would need to zipper both parallel and antiparallel overlaps. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> shows that zippering occurs with higher frequency when the microtubules grow towards each other at ∼180 degrees. This higher frequency is the only evidence that oMAP4 has a structural preference for antiparallel overlaps. But there might be explanations other than structural preference: for example microtubules may be longer when they encounter each other at ∼180 degrees, and longer microtubules zipper more easily. In this context a positive control would be very useful. What does <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> look like for PRC1, for example? This is an essential point, because random bundles and structured, antiparallel bundles have different implications for the structure of oMAP4, for its cellular function and the model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>. The microtubule-binding domain of MAP4 alone could be another optional control.</p><p>1C) The data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C, D</xref> (loops and bundles in vitro) should be quantified: for example, the length of bundled microtubules, the frequency of looping, or some other objective measure could be determined and compared to a positive and negative control.</p><p>2) Experiments in cells require some additional analyses and explanation:</p><p>2A) Images and quantification of microtubule organization in cells depleted of mMAP4 and uMAP4, as well as in rescue experiments with the oMAP4 isoform should be included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> (now these controls and rescue are only shown for the fusion phenotype, but it is not even clear how exactly the fusion phenotype relates to the microtubule organization). Further, the quality of microtubule images in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> is less good than in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, so the microtubule tracing is less convincing. It would be good to improve this, especially if the authors have access to structured illumination microscopy. Some quantification of the extent of microtubule bundling in different RNAi conditions, if possible, would also be useful.</p><p>2B) The authors should provide a better description and some explanation of the differences in the expression of embryonic myosin and relocalization of PCM-1. How can these phenotypes be caused by microtubule disorganization? A better discussion would seem appropriate. Likewise, it is not clear how the reduction of the expression in embryonic myosin follows from the provided images, and how this might be connected to the geometry of microtubule arrays. Again, some additional discussion would help. It would also be helpful if the authors explained what “myogenin” is so that a reader does not have to look it up.</p><p>3) Other comments:</p><p>3A) The expression of oMAP4 in real muscles should be addressed at least by review of database data, because gene expression in a particular cell line does not necessarily reflect the in vivo situation.</p><p>3B) In the Discussion, the authors write: “Thus the mechanisms we reveal here for motor and MAP cooperation in the formation of antiparallel microtubule networks are likely to be of importance beyond muscle cells” but do not expound further. This point gets at the potential impact of this work and its appropriateness for <italic>eLife</italic>, a journal meant to appeal to broad audiences. The appeal could be broadened by describing exactly how these mechanisms are important beyond muscle cells, comparing/contrasting oMAP4 with other bundling proteins, and possibly by phrasing the paper in terms of general mechanisms of bundling. Here, the controls would help, because using a positive control will lead naturally to a comparison that places the work in a broader context.</p><p>3C) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A, B</xref> seems to belong in the Results and not in the Discussion. It would also be good if the authors provided some explanation of the fact that the double DHC+oMAP4 depletion has a weaker phenotype that the single ones.</p><p>3D) The authors should consider presenting some data as radial histograms, specifically <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1 fig3">Figures 1C, 3H, and 3</xref>. The point of the data will be clearer.</p><p>3E) An explanation for the “o” in oMAP4 would be helpful. Is the “o” for overlap?</p><p>3F) The authors give a <italic>p</italic>-value of something like 10^-52. Saying <italic>p</italic>&lt;&lt;0.001 is the norm.</p><p>3G) There are no supplemental movies for the EB experiments (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>). These should be included.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled “A novel isoform of MAP4 organises the antiparallel microtubule array required for muscle cell differentiation” for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Vivek Malhotra (Senior editor) and a member of the Board of Reviewing Editors. The manuscript has been improved but there are two remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>1) The quality of the images in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref> is rather poor. Since these data are crucial for your conclusions, we would like to ask you to include additional images and tracings for all conditions shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1 fig3s2">Figure 3–figure supplement 1 and 2</xref>, so that the readers can judge for themselves whether they find the data reliable.</p><p>2) The in vitro evidence on oMAP4 as an anti-parallel bundler is still not convincing. For the proposed function, it actually would make sense that oMAP4 can make both parallel and anti-parallel bundles. We would like to suggest you reformulate the Title and downplay the message about anti-parallel bundling in the Abstract.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05697.042</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) The in vitro experiments require additional controls and quantification</italic>:</p><p><italic>1A) There is a huge difference in electrophoretic mobility between the endogenous oMAP4 and the recombinant protein used for reconstitution experiments.

However, expressing the same protein in HeLa cells, causes an increase in apparent molecular weight and the native protein detected by specific antibodies in differentiating muscles cells runs even higher. As proteins are not subject to modifications when expressed recombinantly in bacteria and MAP4 could be subject to different modifications when expressed exogenously in HeLa cells, the observed differences are likely caused by posttranslational modifications. MAP4 is known to be subject to phosphorylation (Semenova et al., Mol Biol Cell 2014) and all MAP4 isoforms as well as other structural MAPs run well above their molecular weight on SDS-PAGE: uMAP4 (West et al., J Biol Chem 1991), mMAP4 (Mangan et al., Development 1996) and other structural MAPs (Noble et al., J Cell Biol 1989; Lee et al., Science 1988; Irminger-Finger et al., J Cell Biol. 1990). We have confirmed the identity of the purified protein using mass spectroscopy, peptides found covered 77% of the proteins with no substantial gaps. We are therefore confident that the protein expressed from our RNAi-resistant rescue constructs mediating oMAP4 function and the purified protein used for in vitro experiments are functionally equivalent.</p><p><italic>1B) A negative and a positive control for the formation of microtubule bundles should be shown. The negative control would be a protein that does not create microtubule bundles (for example, kinesin-1 motor domain, EB1 or another microtubule-binding protein which does not function as a microtubule-bundling factor in cells).

The new data are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E-F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>. We found that PRC1 was a more efficient bundling protein for free microtubules, but failed to zipper surface attached microtubules. Therefore, we could not compare the antiparallel bias in zippering for PRC1 and oMAP4. Instead, we have followed the additional suggestion to determine the length dependence of zippering and did not find a significant difference between the length distributions of microtubules that are zippered by oMAP4, fail to be zippered, are of parallel or antiparallel orientation. These data are included in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6–figure supplement 1</xref>. Thus our data show that oMAP4 more efficiently zippers antiparallel microtubules, but can also zipper parallel microtubules. We do think that zippering in either orientation supports an ordered paraxial array and there is no requirement for a preference for its cellular function.</p><p><italic>1C) The data shown in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"><italic>Figure 5C, D</italic></xref> <italic>(loops and bundles in vitro) should be quantified: for example, the length of bundled microtubules, the frequency of looping, or some other objective measure could be determined and compared to a positive and negative control</italic>.</p><p>As mentioned in response to 1B above, we have repeated these experiments, included PRC1 and EB1 as controls and quantified the occurrence of microtubule bundles formed in solution.

While it is not possible to trace every single microtubule, we believe the assay is valid and robust as it is reproducible even if different individuals blind to the expected result manually segment microtubules. The density of microtubules in differentiating cells precludes a meaningful analysis of bundling with light microscopy methods.</p><p><italic>2B) The authors should provide a better description and some explanation of the differences in the expression of embryonic myosin and relocalization of PCM-1. How can these phenotypes be caused by microtubule disorganization? A better discussion would seem appropriate. Likewise, it is not clear how the reduction of the expression in embryonic myosin follows from the provided images, and how this might be connected to the geometry of microtubule arrays. Again, some additional discussion would help. It would also be helpful if the authors explained what “myogenin” is so that a reader does not have to look it up</italic>.</p><p>We have added a paragraph to the Discussion (first paragraph) that elaborates on this issue, but we cannot do much more than speculate at this point as substantially more research in this area is required to understand the relationship between microtubule organisation, chemical modifications and the myogenic programme. We have added a note to the figure legend explaining that myogenin is used here as a marker for differentiating myoblasts.</p><p><italic>3) Other comments</italic>:</p><p><italic>3A) The expression of oMAP4 in real muscles should be addressed at least by review of database data, because gene expression in a particular cell line does not necessarily reflect the in vivo situation</italic>.</p><p>We added a new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2–figure supplement 1</xref> showing RNA sequencing and tissue microarray data that (1) verify our data regarding differential expressing in C2C12 myoblasts and differentiated myocytes and (2) show the expression profile of all MAP4 isoforms in different tissues. oMAP4 is highly expressed in brain and skeletal muscle, while mMAP4 is most prevalent in skeletal muscle and heart. The ubiquitous uMAP4 shows little differential expression.</p><p><italic>3B) In the Discussion, the authors write: “Thus the mechanisms we reveal here for motor and MAP cooperation in the formation of antiparallel microtubule networks are likely to be of importance beyond muscle cells” but do not expound further. This point gets at the potential impact of this work and its appropriateness for</italic> eLife<italic>, a journal meant to appeal to broad audiences. The appeal could be broadened by describing exactly how these mechanisms are important beyond muscle cells, comparing/contrasting oMAP4 with other bundling proteins, and possibly by phrasing the paper in terms of general mechanisms of bundling. Here, the controls would help, because using a positive control will lead naturally to a comparison that places the work in a broader context</italic>.</p><p>The additional data showing expression of oMAP4 in brain suggest an importance for oMAP4 in organising the non-centrosomal microtubules in axon and dendrites that remains to be confirmed. MAP4 has so far been considered as the non-neuronal tau equivalent and its role in the presence of the other members of the structural MAP family remain to be elucidated. Further, our additional in vitro experiment show differences in the properties of PRC1 and oMAP4, prompting a number of open questions to understand the structural basis of the ability to zipper microtubules and the directional bias in crosslinking by a largely unstructured protein. We now explain this is the Discussion section.</p><p><italic>3C)</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8"><italic>Figure 8A, B</italic></xref> <italic>seems to belong in the Results and not in the Discussion. It would also be good if the authors provided some explanation of the fact that the double DHC+oMAP4 depletion has a weaker phenotype that the single ones</italic>.</p><p>Our model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref> and described in the Discussion offers a possible explanation why co-depletion of dynein alleviates microtubule alignment. As in many biological processes, imbalance probably causes the biggest problems and the removal of dynein that is responsible for looping movements and the crosslinker oMAP4 that prevents this, probably allows room for other proteins with crosslinking activity such as kinesin-1 and other organising activities such as guided microtubule assembly to dominate. We now moved the data from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> into <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4–figure supplement 1</xref> and mention them in the Results.</p><p><italic>3D) The authors should consider presenting some data as radial histograms, specifically</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1 fig3"><italic>Figures 1C, 3H, and 3</italic></xref><italic>.

We included a statement to this effect in the Discussion.</p><p><italic>3F) The authors give a</italic> p<italic>-value of something like 10^-52.

For the proposed function, it actually would make sense that oMAP4 can make both parallel and anti-parallel bundles. We would like to suggest you reformulate the Title and downplay the message about anti-parallel bundling in the Abstract</italic>.</p><p>We exchanged the word antiparallel with paraxial in the Title and Abstract and throughout the manuscript text where it was more appropriate, i.e. referred to MTs in cells as this describes the arrangement more accurately. oMAP4 shows a bias for zippering antiparallel versus parallel microtubules. We feel we described this accurately in the manuscript, but there isn’t sufficient space in the Abstract to include all detail, especially as we could only assess kinesin forces on antiparallel bundles.</p></body></sub-article></article>
