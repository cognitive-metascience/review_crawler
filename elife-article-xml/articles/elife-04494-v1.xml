Patients with mutations in <italic>HOIL1</italic> (<italic>RBCK1</italic>) present with amylopectinosis-associated myopathy with or without hyper-inflammation and immunodeficiency. We report that barrier-raised HOIL-1-deficient mice exhibit amylopectin-like deposits in the myocardium but show minimal signs of hyper-inflammation. However, they show immunodeficiency upon acute infection with <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic>, <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> or <italic>Citrobacter rodentium</italic>. Increased susceptibility to <italic>Listeria</italic> was due to HOIL-1 function in hematopoietic cells and macrophages in production of protective cytokines. In contrast, HOIL-1-deficient mice showed enhanced control of chronic <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> or murine γ-herpesvirus 68 (MHV68), and these infections conferred a hyper-inflammatory phenotype. Surprisingly, chronic infection with MHV68 complemented the immunodeficiency of HOIL-1, IL-6, Caspase-1 and Caspase-1;Caspase-11-deficient mice following <italic>Listeria</italic> infection. Thus chronic herpesvirus infection generates signs of auto-inflammation and complements genetic immunodeficiency in mutant mice, highlighting the importance of accounting for the virome in genotype-phenotype studies.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04494.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04494.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04494.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The immune system protects an individual from invading bacteria, viruses and parasites, as well as malfunctioning or cancerous host cells. However, some people inherit genetic defects that cause part of the immune system to be missing or to not work properly. This is called a genetic immunodeficiency, and puts individuals at a higher risk of infection and disease.</p><p>The symptoms of immunodeficiencies can vary substantially between individuals, even when they have defects in the same gene. For example, only some of the individuals who have defects in both of their copies of a gene called <italic>HOIL-1</italic>—which has been linked to several roles in the body's immune response—are reported to suffer from an altered susceptibility to bacterial infections and chronic (persistent) inflammation. Gaining a clear understanding of the possible factors that influence such variations in the symptoms of genetic immune deficiencies could help to speed up their diagnosis, as well as helping to develop more effective treatments.</p><p>MacDuff et al. studied mice that had mutations in both copies of the mouse equivalent of the <italic>HOIL-1</italic> gene. These mice, when raised in a clean barrier facility that reduces their exposure to viruses, were severely immunodeficient and died when infected by certain bacteria and parasites, including <italic>Listeria monocytogenes.</italic> However, they were able to tolerate infections with a herpesvirus or the bacterium that causes tuberculosis. The immunodeficiency to <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> was linked to problems producing protective molecules called cytokines, which form a crucial part of the immune response. Unexpectedly, MacDuff et al. found that a chronic herpesvirus infection substantially protected these very immunodeficient animals from infection with <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic>, and the mice were able to efficiently produce protective cytokines.</p><p>Mice with two other distinct genetic deficiencies that affect their immune system were also better able to survive otherwise lethal bacterial infections if they had a long-term herpesvirus infection. Macduff et al. suggest that the chronic herpesvirus infection stimulates the immune system, and so allows it to compensate for the lack of cytokine production associated with various immunodeficiencies, including those caused by mutations in the <italic>HOIL-1</italic> gene. This suggests that the presence of viruses or other long-term infections may be responsible for some of the variability seen in the symptoms of different individuals with the same genetic immunodeficiency. This is an important concept since essentially all humans have life-long chronic infections from various herpesviruses, as well as other viruses that form the human virome.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold>

<italic>RBCK1</italic> gene), HOIP (RNF31) and SHARPIN form the linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex (LUBAC), which linearly ubiquitinates receptor signaling complex components such as NEMO to

Recently, HOIL-1/LUBAC was also shown to be important for activation of the NLRP3/ASC inflammasome in macrophages via linear ubiquitination of ASC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Rodgers et al., 2014</xref>). These data suggest that HOIL-1 plays multiple roles in inflammation and infection. In mice, SHARPIN deficiency results in auto-inflammation involving multiple organs including the liver, esophagus, lung and, most noticeably, chronic proliferative dermatitis of the skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Seymour et al., 2007</xref>). The development and organization of secondary lymphoid organs and antibody isotype switching are also impaired in these mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">HogenEsch et al., 1999</xref>). Loss of HOIP catalytic activity in B cells results in the impaired development of B1 B cells and antibody responses to antigen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Sasaki et al., 2013</xref>). However, HOIL-1-deficient mice have not been analyzed extensively to date.</p><p>Sixteen patients with bi-allelic mutations in the gene encoding HOIL-1 have been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boisson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Nilsson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wang et al., 2013</xref>). Three patients exhibited cardiomyopathy, amylopectinosis, hyper-inflammation and mild immunodeficiency associated with an increased frequency of bacterial infections, whereas other patients presented with amylopectinosis and myopathy alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). The role of HOIL-1 in inflammation and immunity to infection in vivo is, therefore, uncertain.</p><p>Although there are multiple possible explanations for the variable clinical presentations of the reported patients including hypomorphic expression of HOIL-1 or effects of mutations on protein function, another possibility was that environmental factors alter the clinical presentation of HOIL-1 deficiency. In this study we define the function of HOIL-1 in murine immunity to infection and explore the potential role of the virome in determining HOIL-1 deficiency-associated phenotypes.</p><p>The bacterial microbiome and the virome regulate inflammation and immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Virgin, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Virgin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Belkaid and Hand, 2014</xref>). Within the virome, herpesviruses persistently infect most humans, and exert significant effects on innate immunity in mice during experimental chronic infection, including increasing resistance to tumors and a range of pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barton et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">White et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Yager et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Nguyen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Haque et al., 2004</xref>). However, the potential effects of chronic infection on the phenotypic manifestations of immune deficiencies have not been considered.</p><p>In this study, we show that chronic herpesvirus infection can alter the presentation of several genetic immunodeficiencies in mice. We first found that, in naïve mice, HOIL-1 is essential during infection with <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic>, <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> and <italic>Citrobacter rodentium</italic> and for efficient induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines that are known to be essential for resistance to lethal infection by hematopoietic cells during <italic>Listeria</italic> infection. In contrast, HOIL-1 knock-out (KO) mice, with null mutations in the <italic>Rbck1</italic> gene that encodes HOIL-1, were resistant to infection with murine γ-herpesvirus 68 (MHV68) and <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>. Although HOIL-1 KO mice raised in a barrier facility did not display signs of auto-inflammation, chronic infection with MHV68 or <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> resulted in elevated inflammatory cytokines circulating in the serum, similar to that observed in some patients with mutations in <italic>RBCK1</italic> (<italic>HOIL1</italic>). Interestingly, latent infection with MHV68 rescued HOIL-1 deficient mice from lethality during <italic>Listeria</italic> infection and induced high levels of the protective cytokine, interferon-gamma (IFNγ). MHV68 latency also protected IL-6, Caspase-1 and Caspase-1;Caspase-11 deficient mice from <italic>Listeria</italic>-induced lethality, indicating that the ability of latent infection to complement a genetic immunodeficiency is not restricted to mutation of <italic>Hoil-1</italic>. These data indicate that chronic infections can modify the clinical presentations of genetic variations, thereby opening a new avenue for the analysis and interpretation of human genotype-phenotype association studies. We speculate that the protective effect of chronic herpesvirus infection is due to the stimulation of the function of the innate immune system in a manner that compensates for deficient early cytokine responses associated with multiple immunodeficiencies.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>HOIL-1 is essential during acute infection with <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic>, <italic>Citrobacter rodentium</italic> and <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic></title><p>HOIL-1 KO mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Tokunaga et al., 2009</xref>) were born at Mendelian ratios and, in contrast to SHARPIN-deficient mice, failed to develop TNFα-driven inflammatory skin disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ikeda et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Gerlach et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Tokunaga et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Tokunaga and Iwai, 2012</xref>) and exhibited normal histology of lymphoid organs, liver, lung, and kidney, and the presence of Peyer's patches along the small intestine (not shown).

Expression of HOIL-1 was critical in innate, hematopoietic-derived cells during <italic>Listeria</italic> infection in vivo<italic>.</italic> The requirement of HOIL-1 for the induction of protective inflammatory cytokines, TNFα, IL-6 and IL-12, following infection of macrophages with <italic>Listeria</italic> in vitro is consistent with reports that LUBAC is required for efficient NF-κB activation following TLR engagement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zak et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boisson et al., 2012</xref>), but not with a recent report that NF-κB activation following stimulation of TLR4 and TNF-R1 on macrophages by LPS and TNFα, respectively, is unaffected by HOIL-1 deficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Rodgers et al., 2014</xref>). These apparently conflicting results suggest that HOIL-1 and LUBAC may not only have cell-type specific functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boisson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Rodgers et al., 2014</xref>), but also stimulus-specific roles that vary between different cell types. This may be further highlighted by the excessive inflammatory response and enhanced control of MHV68 and <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection—two pathogens that also infect macrophages—by HOIL-1-deficient mice. It has been proposed that low levels of viral reactivation during MHV68 latency are responsible for the low level of constant immune activation and cytokine production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barton et al., 2007</xref>). It is paradoxical, then, that reactivation is almost undetectable in HOIL-1-deficient animals, and yet their inflammatory response is elevated. Since the negative regulator of NF-κB signaling, A20, binds to linear ubiquitin chains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Tokunaga et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Verhelst et al., 2012</xref>), HOIL-1/LUBAC may also be important for recruiting A20 to receptor signaling complexes to turn off signaling. Therefore, receptor signaling may be sustained in cells in HOIL-1 KO mice, resulting in the increase in TNFα, IL-6 and IL-12, and ultimately IFNγ protein, observed in the serum of chronically infected mice. Decreased viral reactivation may be the result of this increased IFNγ, the inability of latently infected cells to response to a stimulus of reactivation or a combination thereof.</p><p>It is unclear why HOIL-1 KO mice are extremely susceptible to some pathogens, yet control other infections remarkably well. This might be due to HOIL-1/LUBAC having differential roles in transducing signals from different immune sensors stimulated by different infections. Other possibilities include a differential requirement for the innate immune system to hold the acute infection in check while an adaptive response is being generated, the speed at which the pathogen replicates, the tissues that it damages, and whether pathology during acute infection is mostly immune- or pathogen-derived. Further studies will be required to address these possibilities.</p><p>We further show that chronic infection with MHV68 rescued HOIL-1, IL-6, Caspase-1 and Caspase-1;Caspase-11-deficient mice from lethal <italic>Listeria</italic> infection, thereby masking the genetic immunodeficiency observed in MHV68-negative mice. As reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barton et al., 2007</xref>), MHV68 latency was associated with increased basal levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNFα, IL-6, IL-12 and IFNγ in the serum of wild-type animals, which were further increased in HOIL-1 KO mice. These cytokines appear to increase the activation status of the innate immune system such that their induction following <italic>Listeria</italic> infection is no longer as important as would be the case in a naïve mouse. Indeed, MHV68 infection did not enhance the transcription of <italic>Tnf</italic>, and only marginally enhanced the transcription of <italic>Il6</italic> and <italic>Il12b</italic> even in control mice following <italic>Listeria</italic> infection, and did not rescue the defect in <italic>Tnf</italic> and <italic>Il6</italic> induction observed in HOIL-1 KO mice. Conversely, transcription of <italic>Ifng</italic> and the effector molecule, <italic>iNOS (</italic>encoded by <italic>Nos2)</italic>, was elevated in cells from latently infected mice and enhanced substantially by both HOIL-1 KO and control animals very rapidly following infection with <italic>Listeria</italic>. Macrophages require priming with IFNγ to induce IL-12 in response to <italic>Listeria</italic> infection. In a latently infected animal, IFNγ is already present and so IL-12 and additional IFNγ may be induced more rapidly. Furthermore, as reported previously for wild-type mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barton et al., 2007</xref>), MHV68 latency enhanced the ability of peritoneal macrophages from control and HOIL-1 KO mice to kill <italic>Listeria</italic>. Together, these data suggest that the constant presence of low levels of IFNγ driven by latent virus infection results in an increase in the basal expression levels of downstream effector molecules and the priming of cells for the enhanced immediate killing of <italic>Listeria</italic> upon infection, as well as for a more rapid further induction of IFNγ and its effector molecules in response to the bacterial challenge. In this sense, chronic virus infection sets the level of innate immunity to subsequent infection.</p><p>HOIL-1 KO mice bred in a high grade barrier facility failed to exhibit certain phenotypes of HOIL-1 deficient patients, specifically by not exhibiting baseline hyper-inflammation and by displaying a striking immunodeficiency out of proportion to that observed in some humans with bi-allelic mutations in <italic>RBCK1</italic> (<italic>HOIL1</italic>). Most humans are infected life-long with multiple herpesviruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Virgin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Virgin, 2014</xref>), and many also carry other chronic or latent infections such as tuberculosis. Importantly, we observed complementation of immunodeficiency to <italic>Listeria</italic> by chronic herpesvirus infection in four different strains of immunodeficient mice, revealing virus infection as one possible environmental factor that might alter the genotype-phenotype relationship for patients with mutations in immune system genes. HOIL-1 KO mice chronically infected with either a herpesvirus or <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> also exhibited increases in some of the same cytokines reported in the serum of HOIL-1 deficient humans. At least three of the HOIL-1 mutant patients were infected with at least one herpesvirus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boisson et al., 2012</xref>), and it is likely that other chronic infections were present. However, in the absence of data regarding the complete infection status of the HOIL-1 mutant patients, the relevance of the mouse studies to the human phenotypes is unclear. Nevertheless, perhaps the presence of the virome, and potentially variations in the virome or other chronic infections between people, confers significant phenotypic variation by complementing mutations in host genes responsible for innate immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Virgin, 2014</xref>).</p><p>The genes involved in immunity and inflammation are the most rapidly evolving in the mammalian genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Lindblad-Toh et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Casanova et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Quintana-Murci and Clark, 2013</xref>). Survival from infection requires a trade-off between alleles that promote or limit inflammation to balance immunity vs immunopathology. We speculate that the virome or other chronic infections hide or enhance the effects of genetic variations in immune responsiveness by complementing chromosomal variations in immune response genes. As the nature of the virome changes in persons growing up in different cultural and economic environments, it is possible that the immunophenotype of the host changes, and the beneficial or deleterious effects of existing genetic variation are unmasked by removal of complementation provided by chronic virus infection. It is also plausible that the striking auto-inflammation observed in humans with a variety of immune defects could be due to even well controlled herpesvirus infection alone or in combination with other chronic infections. Our data suggest that analysis of the metagenome, including the virome, may be of value in linking human phenotype and genotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Virgin, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Virgin and Todd, 2011</xref>). Recent rapid advances in sequencing and analysis of the metagenome will make integration of data from the virome into human genetic studies practical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Virgin, 2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p>HOIL-1 KO mice, with null mutations in the <italic>Rbck1</italic> gene that encodes HOIL-1, have been described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Tokunaga et al., 2009</xref>).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Stylianos Antonarakis (Senior editor), Stephen Goff (Reviewing editor), and 3 reviewers, one of whom, Bill Sugden, has agreed to reveal his identity.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This paper presents a substantial body of work characterizing the responses to infection of mutant mice with HOIL1 deficiency. We were impressed with the extent of the work. As noted by the reviewers, the selectivity of the effects for some pathogens over others is of interest; and most important is the effect of preinfection with MHV68 on subsequent challenges by other pathogens. We summarize some of the key points of criticism here, before passing on the full detailed comments of the reviewers.</p><p>The first reviewer found the paper difficult to read. I too found it very dense and not as linear in presentation as I thought was possible. The experiments cover diverse situations and the responses depend on diverse cytokine levels that are introduced as the experiments are described; perhaps some overview of the plan would be helpful to have at the start of the results. And similarly a clearer summary of the authors' thinking on the cytokines' levels' roles in the outcome would be helpful.</p><p>In addition, he raises a substantial number of very specific issues that I think need to be addressed. Most cannot be dismissed simply, including issues of significance of some of the findings.</p><p>The second reviewer had two major issues. The first concerns the effects of MHV68 preinfection in a non-barrier mouse. This is raised because the human situation is obviously non-barrier, and human data might be available to provide information in this setting. While the requested human data would be helpful to have, I am less concerned here about the need to perfectly model the human situation, and comfortable that the barrier mouse findings stand as interesting even without that bearing on the human situation.</p><p>His second concern is an apparent discrepancy between the data and the claims (this is referring to data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). This should be directly addressed and clarified.</p><p>The third reviewer was also supportive but felt many of the findings were unsurprising or predicted by previous work. I feel that there is adequate value to presenting data that might have been expected but in fact have not previously been obtained (as he notes, surprisingly so!). He also felt that there was insufficient explanation of mechanism of action. I think helpful here, as noted above, is for the authors to at least present a clearer case of what they think is the mechanism, even if the case is not proven. With the right caveats, this would make the paper's punchline much stronger, or at least clearer.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1</italic>:</p><p>This is an interesting study that examines the effect of HOIL1 deficiency on infection of mice with several strains of bacteria (<italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic>, <italic>Citrobacter rodentium</italic>, and <italic>Mycobacterium Tuberculosis</italic>) a parasite (<italic>Toxoplasma gondii)</italic> and a herpesvirus that establishes a latent infection (murine gamma-herpesvirus 68-MHV68). The results show that the HOIL1 mutant mice are much more susceptible to infection with <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic>, <italic>Citrobacter rodentium</italic>, and <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> than wild type mice, but have comparable susceptibility to <italic>Mycobacterium Tuberculosis</italic> and MHV68. Moreover, prior infection of HOIL1 mutant mice with MHV68 reduces their susceptibility to <italic>Listeria</italic> such that it is now comparable to wild type. Latent infection of IL6 mutant mice with MHV68 also reduces their susceptibility to <italic>Listeria</italic> infection.</p><p>The importance of this paper is that it highlights the increasing appreciation that prior viral infection (or bacterial infections) may greatly influence the outcome of subsequent infections and establishment of a hyperinflammatory environment, particularly in the context of immunodeficiency.</p><p>This is a difficult paper to read, as the differential experimental conditions are not clearly delineated in the text. For example, the measurement of cytokine proteins in serum is interspersed with measurement of transcripts, and it is not always evident in the text what is being measured. Likewise, some infections are in vivo, while others are in bone-marrow-derived macrophages. There is also use of <italic>Rag</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mice as the background for HOIL1 mutation interspersed with use of the wild type background.</p><p>The major criticism is that, mechanistically, it is not clear why the HOIL1 animals are more susceptible to some infections but not others. The assumption is that it is relative level of induced cytokines, but this is never directly shown. Although it is stated that the <italic>Mycobacterium Tuberculosis</italic> and MHV68 infections established a hyper-inflammatory phenotype in HOIL1 mutant animals with significant induction of TNFα, IL6, IL12p40, and IFNγ, there is also significant induction of the inflammatory cytokines in wild type mice, albeit to a lower level. Increased expression of inflammatory cytokines is also observed in <italic>Listeria</italic> infected HOIL1 mutant mice, although in this case the levels are lower than those in wild type mice. It is important to note that in some cases the data may be statistically significant, but the differences are marginal.</p><p>Specific comments:</p><p>1) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2–figure supplement 2</xref> shows that immunized HOIL1 mutant mice are resistant to high dose secondary of <italic>Listeria</italic>. The data are only shown for day 3. Is this resistance maintained at the same level at later times?</p><p>2) It is important in the text to differentiate between small, and likely insignificant differences, versus larger ones. For example, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>: production of TNFα by HOIL1 mutant mice macrophages is only 2-fold lower than wild type mice infected with <italic>Listeria</italic> while there are greater differences in production of IL-6 and IL12p40.</p><p>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3–figure supplement 1</xref>: what is the point of this figure? It appears that application of IFNγ has same effect on macrophages in both wild type and HOIL1 mutant, as the wild type do not kill <italic>Listeria</italic> in the absence of IFNγ.</p><p>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3–figure supplement 2</xref>: it should be stated in text that there is no difference in IL12p40. Also the text should state clearly why the <italic>Rag</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mouse background is used in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3–figure supplement 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>.</p><p>5) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3–figure supplement 3</xref> only shows data for <italic>Rag</italic><sup><italic>+/+</italic></sup> mice. Since the <italic>Rag</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mice are also used, the data for non B and non T cells (e.g. macrophages, neutrophils and NK cells) should also be shown for the HOIL1 mutant mice on this background.</p><p>6) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>: it should be noted that the IL12p40 difference is only seen at one time point.</p><p>7) In the Results section, it is stated that fewer NK cells and neutrophils at 6 hours correlated with decreased expression of cytokine and IFNγ mRNA. However, there is no difference in the number of NK and neutrophils at 12 h and differences in cytokine and IFNγ mRNA are still present.</p><p>8) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>: the impairment of reactivation of MHV68 is quite modest (∼2- fold) and it is not “very significant”, as stated in the Results section. Also the “enhanced control of MHV68 replication” in the HOIL1 mutant mice as measured by lower titers is only seen at two of the time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4–figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>9) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>: given MHV68 infected wt mouse outlier, the data do not appear to be significant for TNFα.</p><p>10) The legend for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref> is incorrect. It states that it is the same as 4D. However, from the text in the Results section, this appears to show the data for the mice infected with tuberculosis. What day of the infection is shown?</p><p>11) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>: it should be clearly stated in the text that the MHV68 latency provided enhanced resistance to <italic>Listeria</italic> infection not only for the HOIL1 mutant and IL6 mutant mice, but also for the wild type mice. Also, from the data shown, one cannot state that the IL6 mutant mice had increased sensitivity to <italic>Listeria</italic> infection, as both the mutant and wild type mice showed the same survival curve due to the large inoculum of <italic>Listeria</italic> that is used.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2</italic>:</p><p>In this manuscript MacDuff et al. determine that barrier-raised <italic>Hoil-1</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mice are more susceptible to certain pathogens such as <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic>, <italic>T. gondii</italic> and <italic>C. rodentium</italic> than wild type animals. They find a correlated decrease in the levels of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and TNFα. The authors go on to infect the <italic>Hoil-1</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mice with either MHV68 or <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> and find that infection with either pathogen increases resistance to subsequent challenges with the other pathogens. They hypothesize that infection with MHV68 modifies the immune response of the <italic>Hoil-1</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mice and that this phenomenon is mirrored in human patients with defective Hoil-1.</p><p>The authors present some potentially exciting findings. However, we find two substantive issues need to be addressed to support and clarify them.</p><p>1) The authors show that infection with MHV68 strengthens the immune response of the <italic>Hoil-1</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mice to subsequent infection with other pathogens. It is essential to know what happens to non-barrier-raised subjects as human patients with Hoil-1 deficiencies are continuously exposed to pathogens. In this context the authors could, for example, look at the high-throughput sequencing data available for human Hoil-1 patients and determine if there are correlations between clinical symptoms and presence/absence of specific pathogens in those samples.</p><p>2) There exists a dissonance in the authors' proposal as to how infection with MHV68 or <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> protects the <italic>Hoil-1</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mice from subsequent pathogen challenges. While in the Discussion section the authors write “MHV68 latency was associated with increased basal levels of TNFα, IL-6, IL-12 and IFNγ…”, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> indicates that TNFα, IL-6 and IL-12 levels did not rise with MHV68 infection. The authors need both to address this discrepancy and explain how IFNγ levels are increasing in the <italic>Hoil-1</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mice when they are infected with MHV68.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3</italic>:</p><p>MacDuff and colleagues use a <italic>Hoil-1</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mouse model to examine the role of Hoil-1 in host-defense against bacterial, parasitic, and viral infections. Although the Hoil-1 knockout has been available since 2009, surprisingly, it has not yet been characterized with infection models in detail. By comparison, biallelic loss-of-expression and loss-of-function HOIL-1L deficiencies in humans causes a fatal disorder characterized by chronic auto-inflammation, invasive bacterial infections, and muscular amylopectinosis. Likewise, mice deficient in the LUBAC component sharpin have immune-deficiency. MacDuff et al. report that in barrier-housed mice, amylopectin-like deposits occur, but hyper-inflammation does not. Nonetheless, they are immunodeficient, and are highly susceptible to challenge with <italic>listeria</italic>, <italic>toxoplasma</italic> or <italic>citrobacter</italic>.</p><p>The authors show that Hoil-1 expression in bone-marrow-derived cells is important for protection from bacterial challenge, and for cytokine production. <italic>Hoil-1</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mice survive at least 3 months of challenge with γ-68 herpesvirus (IP or intranasal), with similar levels of intraperitoneal pool of latent virus. By contrast, they observed that MHV68 reactivation from latently-infected peritoneal cells was impaired by <italic>Hoil-1</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> deficiency. Challenge with wildtype MHV68 or <italic>mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> leads to enhanced production of IL-6, IL-12 and IFNγ in Hoil-1 deficient mice, and also higher levels of TNFα in MTB- treated Hoil-1 deficient mice. Mice infected with MHV68 for 28 days are protected from IP challenge with <italic>listeria</italic>, while MHV68orf73.stop, which does not establish latency, does not protect Hoil-1 knockout mice from <italic>listeria</italic> challenge.</p><p>A strength of the manuscript is that it raises many interesting issues, and highlights the role of LUBAC and inflammation in the host-response to infection. However, many of the results presented are incremental advances that are largely expected from the current literature. For instance, based on the phenotype of humans with Hoil-1 deficiency, it is not surprising that mice are highly susceptible to bacterial challenge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Likewise, although it is interesting that Hoil-1 expression in hematopoietic cells and even in the granulocyte lineage is important for control of <italic>listeria</italic>, it is not a particularly surprising result (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). That cytokine production is impaired in Hoil-1 knockouts in response to <italic>listeria</italic> is also a largely expected result (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). It is however interesting that Hoil-1 deficiency has protective effects on MHV68 infection and tuberculosis. While we are shown modest decreases in MTB loads in lung and spleen in Hoil knockouts, we are not shown whether MHV68 viral load is affected by Hoil-1 deficiency, but rather that similar levels of latently infected cells are present in the peritoneum, that MHV68 reactivates less efficiently with Hoil-1 deficiency, and that MHV68 results in increased pro-inflammatory cytokine production with hoil deficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).</p><p>Perhaps because of this cytokine production that exists 28 days after viral inoculation, Hoil-1 mice are protected from listeriosis. While the results are interesting, a shortcoming of the paper is the lack of novel mechanistic insights. What is the intrinsic mechanism of how latent infection with γ68 protects mice from subsequent challenge with <italic>listeria</italic>? Is it a phenomenon that exists during acute herpesvirus infections? By analogy with human infectious mononucleosis, MHV68-infected mice are likely immune-stimulated by acute herpes virus infections at 28 days post-infection. Does protection from listeriosis persist at later timepoints following MHV68 infection (the situation in most humans with asymptomatic/chronic herpes virus infections), or is it merely a transient phenomenon of acute infection? Since Hoil-1 knockout mice survive for at least 3 months after MHV68 infection, repeating the experiments at that timepoint would add something to the study.</p><p>Importantly, the results presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> contrast with the phenotype of human Hoil-1 deficiency. For instance, one of the Hoil-1 deficient patients described in PMID 23104095 had recurrent cytomegalovirus (human herpesvirus 5) viremia, and even died of complications of cytomegalovirus infection. Other patients had documented herpesvirus infections by VZV, and “viral infections, such as roseola and chicken-pox, followed a regular course and triggered a less prolonged inflammatory response than the pyogenic bacterial infections”. It is also likely that Hoil-1 deficient human patients had additional chronic herpes viral infections, given that EBV, HHV6 and 7 are acquired within the first two years of life for most individuals. Despite these chronic herpes viral infections, they suffer from severe and recurrent bacterial infection. Thus, the results reported in the mouse model, while interesting, do not appear to be broadly applicable to human disease. Likewise, it is not clear why wildtype mice, become susceptible to <italic>listeria</italic> challenge after MHV68 infection, and to a lesser extent, upon infection by MHVorf73.stop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>).</p><p>Overall, the manuscript is interesting and worthy of publication, and we commend the authors on a large body of work that was overall well-done. However, for the reasons described above, this paper may be more appropriate for another journal.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04494.024</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>We herein respond to comments and queries about our paper ‘Complementation of genetic immunodeficiency by chronic herpesvirus infection’.

These new data show that, even though cultured Hoil-1 deficient bone marrow-derived macrophages primed with IFNγ are able to kill <italic>Listeria</italic> as effectively as wild-type cells, peritoneal macrophages from <italic>Hoil-1</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mice showed a reduced capacity to kill <italic>Listeria</italic> (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5–figure supplement 2</xref>). In the setting of latent herpesvirus infection, this deficiency in <italic>Hoil-1</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mice is corrected to a level commensurate with that observed in control mice that are not infected with the herpesvirus. Therefore the chronic herpesvirus infection provides the capacity for macrophages to control infection in vivo better than they would otherwise be able to do.

However, the experiment is technically challenging, since 1000 CFU administered i.p. is a border-line dose for inducing protective immunity (you can see in the figure that some of the mice of both WT and mutant genotypes were not well protected), but around 50% of the Hoil-1-mutant mice die from this dose during acute infection (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). It may be possible to immunize with an attenuated strain (e.g. ActA-deficient), but this will require a significant amount of optimization to determine the required immunization dose (that does not kill the knock-out mice) and a suitable challenge dose with the wild-type <italic>Listeria</italic> strain.

It is essential to know what happens to non-barrier-raised subjects as human patients with Hoil-1 deficiencies are continuously exposed to pathogens. In this context the authors could, for example, look at the high-throughput sequencing data available for human Hoil-1 patients and determine if there are correlations between clinical symptoms and presence/absence of specific pathogens in those samples.</italic></p><p>We certainly would like to know the infection status of the HOIL-1 patients with various phenotypes. However, to our knowledge, high-throughput sequencing data or complete serologic data is not available for reported HOIL patients, and we have been unsuccessful in obtaining samples from the two groups that reported HOIL-1 patients with cardiomyopathy but without immunodeficiency. We hypothesize that the humans do not show quite such a striking immunodeficiency when compared to the SPF mice due to their constant exposure to pathogens, and hence latent infection of SPF mice with MHV68 may allow the mouse phenotype to more closely mimic the human phenotype. Notably patients reported to be immunodeficient also received immunosuppressive drugs to treat their auto-inflammation. We agree that the relevance of the present study to humans remains to be proven, and we have added a similar statement to the Discussion.</p><p><italic>2) There exists a dissonance in the authors' proposal as to how infection with MHV68 or</italic> M. tuberculosis <italic>protects the</italic> Hoil-1<sup>-/-</sup> <italic>mice from subsequent pathogen challenges. While in the Discussion section the authors write “MHV68 latency was associated with increased basal levels of TNFα, IL-6, IL-12 and IFNγ…”,</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"><italic>Figure 5C</italic></xref> <italic>indicates that TNFα, IL-6 and IL-12 levels did not rise with MHV68 infection.

We have added color, increased the size of the panels and split the data from T=0 and T=3 hours after <italic>Listeria</italic> infection into separate panels to help with visualization. Both <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref> (now 4C) and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> show that MHV68 latency is associated with increases in these cytokines in the serum and in peritoneal cells for both control and <italic>Hoil-1</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mice (although IL-12 transcripts were not significantly elevated in WT mice compared to naïve mice). Significant findings are indicated above the symbols. We do not know why IFNγ levels are increased in <italic>Hoil-1</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mice compared to controls when they are infected with MHV68. We have speculated as to the mechanisms in the Discussion.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p><italic>MacDuff and colleagues use a</italic> Hoil-1<sup>-/-</sup> <italic>mouse model to examine the role of Hoil-1 in host-defense against bacterial, parasitic, and viral infections. Although the Hoil-1 knockout has been available since 2009, surprisingly, it has not yet been characterized with infection models in detail. By comparison, biallelic loss-of-expression and loss-of-function HOIL-1L deficiencies in humans causes a fatal disorder characterized by chronic auto-inflammation, invasive bacterial infections, and muscular amylopectinosis.

Mice infected with MHV68 for 28 days are protected from IP challenge with</italic> listeria<italic>, while MHV68orf73.stop, which does not establish latency, does not protect Hoil-1 knockout mice from</italic> listeria <italic>challenge.</italic></p><p><italic>A strength of the manuscript is that it raises many interesting issues, and highlights the role of LUBAC and inflammation in the host-response to infection. However, many of the results presented are incremental advances that are largely expected from the current literature. For instance, based on the phenotype of humans with Hoil-1 deficiency, it is not surprising that mice are highly susceptible to bacterial challenge (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1</italic></xref><italic>). Likewise, although it is interesting that Hoil-1 expression in hematopoietic cells and even in the granulocyte lineage is important for control of</italic> listeria<italic>, it is not a particularly surprising result (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2</italic></xref><italic>). That cytokine production is impaired in Hoil-1 knockouts in response to</italic> listeria <italic>is also a largely expected result (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3</italic></xref><italic>).</italic></p><p>Of the 16 Hoil-1 mutant patients reported to date, only three were reported to be immunodeficient, calling into question whether Hoil-1 deficiency results in immune-deficiency. This is now mentioned in the Introduction and Discussion. While it is true that decreased cytokine production is the expected result, a recent study by Rodgers MA et al., J Exp Med, 2014 found that Hoil-1 is not required for NFκB activation or NFκB-dependent gene expression in bone marrow derived macrophages following LPS or TNF α treatment. Our data show that Hoil-1 is required for efficient cytokine production by bone marrow derived macrophages following <italic>Listeria</italic> infection, suggesting that Hoil-1 is required for proper activation of NFκB in response to certain stimuli in these cells.</p><p><italic>It is however interesting that Hoil-1 deficiency has protective effects on MHV68 infection and tuberculosis. While we are shown modest decreases in MTB loads in lung and spleen in Hoil knockouts, we are not shown whether MHV68 viral load is affected by Hoil-1 deficiency, but rather that similar levels of latently infected cells are present in the peritoneum, that MHV68 reactivates less efficiently with Hoil-1 deficiency, and that MHV68 results in increased pro-inflammatory cytokine production with hoil deficiency (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><italic>Figure 4</italic></xref><italic>)</italic>.</p><p><italic>Perhaps because of this cytokine production that exists 28 days after viral inoculation, Hoil-1 mice are protected from listeriosis</italic>.</p><p>MHV68 viral load is minimally decreased in the absence of Hoil-1 as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and figure supplement 1B. We agree that it is likely that the increased cytokine production during MHV68 latency protects the mice from listeriosis. We have included more discussion of possible mechanism in the Discussion section.</p><p><italic>While the results are interesting, a shortcoming of the paper is the lack of novel mechanistic insights. What is the intrinsic mechanism of how latent infection with γ68 protects mice from subsequent challenge with</italic> listeria<italic>? Is it a phenomenon that exists during acute herpesvirus infections?</italic></p><p>Barton et al., Nature, 2007 showed that acute infection (after 1 week) does not confer protection against <italic>listeria</italic> in wild-type mice, and that a virus that can undergo acute replication, but does not establish latency effectively (MHV68 orf73.stop), also does not protect against <italic>listeria</italic> infection after 4 weeks. We have included data from experiments using the orf73.stop mutant virus in both wild-type and mutant mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), which indicate that immune stimulation from the acute phase of infection is not responsible for the protection. However, we have not challenged <italic>Hoil-1</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mice with <italic>Listeria</italic> during acute MHV68 infection. It is possible that the outcome would be different to that for wild-type mice.</p><p>As suggested by the Editor, we have included more discussion of possible mechanisms. It appears that MHV68 latency increases the basal activation state of the innate immune system, perhaps priming it to respond more rapidly to subsequent infections that also induce IFNγ and IFNγ-dependent effector mechanisms. For example, macrophages require IFNγ to make IL-12 in response to <italic>Listeria</italic> infection. In a latently infected animal, IFNγ is already present and so IL-12 is induced much more rapidly and IFNγ is further up regulated faster than in a non-latently infected animal.</p><p>A new piece of data that addresses one aspect of potential mechanism has also been added. Even though Hoil-1 deficient bone marrow-derived macrophages primed with IFNγ are able to kill <italic>Listeria</italic> as effectively as wild-type cells (shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3–figure supplement 1</xref>), peritoneal macrophages from <italic>Hoil-1</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mice showed a reduced capacity to kill <italic>Listeria</italic> (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5–figure supplement 2</xref>). As has been shown previously (Barton et al., Nature, 2007), peritoneal macrophages from latently-infected wild-type mice have an enhanced ability to kill <italic>Listeria</italic>. Peritoneal macrophages from latently infected <italic>Hoil-1</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mice also showed an enhanced ability to kill <italic>Listeria</italic> when compared to cells from wild-type or <italic>Hoil-1</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mice that are not latently infected. However, these cells do not kill <italic>Listeria</italic> as effectively as cells from latently infected wild-type mice. We speculate that the difference in listericidal activity of bone marrow-derived macrophages and peritoneal macrophages may reflect differences in the environment in the peritoneum of wild-type and mutant mice.</p><p><italic>By analogy with human infectious mononucleosis, MHV68-infected mice are likely immune-stimulated by acute herpes virus infections at 28 days post-infection. Does protection from listeriosis persist at later timepoints following MHV68 infection (the situation in most humans with asymptomatic/chronic herpes virus infections), or is it merely a transient phenomenon of acute infection? Since Hoil-1 knockout mice survive for at least 3 months after MHV68 infection, repeating the experiments at that timepoint would add something to the study</italic>.</p><p>Both control and <italic>Hoil-1</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mice are still partially protected from <italic>listeria</italic> infection 6 months after MHV68 infection, and these data are now in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5–figure supplement 1</xref>.</p><p><italic>Importantly, the results presented in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"><italic>Figure 5</italic></xref> <italic>contrast with the phenotype of human Hoil-1 deficiency. For instance, one of the Hoil-1 deficient patients described in PMID 23104095 had recurrent cytomegalovirus (human herpesvirus 5) viremia, and even died of complications of cytomegalovirus infection. Other patients had documented herpesvirus infections by VZV, and “viral infections, such as roseola and chicken-pox, followed a regular course and triggered a less prolonged inflammatory response than the pyogenic bacterial infections”</italic>.</p><p>We agree that this is an apparent difference, but MHV-68 is a γ-herpesvirus and HHV5 is a β-herpesvirus and the pathogenesis of the viruses may be quite distinct therefore. We have not challenged our mutant mice with a β-herpesvirus.</p><p><italic>It is also likely that Hoil-1 deficient human patients had additional chronic herpes viral infections, given that EBV, HHV6 and 7 are acquired within the first two years of life for most individuals. Despite these chronic herpes viral infections, they suffer from severe and recurrent bacterial infection. Thus, the results reported in the mouse model, while interesting, do not appear to be broadly applicable to human disease. Likewise, it is not clear why wildtype mice, become susceptible to</italic> listeria <italic>challenge after MHV68 infection, and to a lesser extent, upon infection by MHVorf73.stop (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"><italic>Figure 5B</italic></xref><italic>).</italic></p><p>We agree that it is possible that HOIL-1 mutant patients were infected with multiple herpesviruses, but have been unable to obtain samples with which to test this. The immunodeficiencies in the human patients were actually relatively mild, particularly given that they were on steroid treatments to suppress the auto-inflammation. The SFP mice appear to have a much more severe immunodeficiency than the humans, which is made less severe by MHV68 latency. We agree that it is difficult to directly compare humans with SPF mice. We used a γ-herpesvirus model for our mouse studies, but α-(i.e. VZV) or β-(i.e. HCMV)-herpesviruses may not produce the same phenotypes.</p></body></sub-article></article>
