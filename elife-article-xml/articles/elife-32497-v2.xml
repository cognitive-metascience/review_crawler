at effector phase. We report here that deletion of <italic>Rptor</italic> in mouse hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells causes self-destructive innate immunity by massively increasing the population of previously uncharacterized innate myelolymphoblastoid effector cells (IMLECs). Mouse IMLECs are CD3<sup>-</sup>B220<sup>-</sup>NK1.1<sup>-</sup>Ter119<sup>-</sup> CD11c<sup>low/-</sup>CD115<sup>-</sup>F4/80<sup>low/-</sup>Gr-1<sup>-</sup> CD11b<sup>+</sup>, but surprisingly express high levels of PD-L1. Although they morphologically resemble lymphocytes and actively produce transcripts from Immunoglobulin loci, IMLECs have non-rearranged <italic>Ig</italic> loci, are phenotypically distinguishable from all known lymphocytes, and have a gene signature that bridges lymphoid and myeloid leukocytes. <italic>Rptor</italic> deletion unleashes differentiation of IMLECs from common myeloid progenitor cells by reducing expression of <italic>Myb</italic>. Importantly, IMLECs broadly overexpress pattern-recognition receptors and their expansion causes systemic inflammation in response to Toll-like receptor ligands in mice. Our data unveil a novel leukocyte population and an unrecognized role of Raptor/mTORC1 in innate immune tolerance.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32497.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The cells of the immune system defend us from bacteria, viruses and other microbes that might cause harm to the body. Immune cells develop from stem cells in the bone marrow. The stem cells first develop into one of two types of progenitor cell before specializing further into the different types of mature immune cell. Researchers often categorize immune cells as either myeloid or lymphoid, depending on which progenitor cell they developed from.</p><p>A protein complex called mTORC1 in the stem cells helps to guide immune cell development. One of the proteins in the mTORC1 complex is called Raptor. In mice that lack the Raptor protein, cells with particular markers on their surface accumulate in the bone marrow. The exact identity of these cells and why they appear was not known.</p><p>Tang et al. have analyzed these cells in mice that lacked Raptor in their bone marrow stem cells. This revealed that the cells have features of both myeloid and lymphoid cells: although they develop from myeloid progenitor cells, they are shaped like lymphoid cells. The cells also have a surface marker normally found on myeloid cells. Tang et al. have named the cells innate myelolymphoblastoid effector cells (IMLECs).</p><p>Further investigation showed that the lack of the Raptor protein caused another gene in the stem cells, called <italic>Myb</italic>, to become less active than normal. Tang et al. suggest that this lack of activity causes more IMLECs to develop from the stem cells. The overproduction of IMLECs also causes inflammation in the mice.</p><p>IMLECs bridge the gap between myeloid and lymphoid cells, challenging the current categorization of these as separate cell types. Targeting this new cell population could help researchers to develop new methods to control the immune response, for example, during autoimmune disorders where the immune system is overactive and damages the body’s own cells.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>hemotopoiesis</kwd><kwd>TSC-mTOR signaling</kwd><kwd>mTORC1</kwd><kwd>innate immunity</kwd><kwd>inflammation</kwd><kwd>immune tolerance</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AI64350</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Yang</given-names></name><name><surname>Zheng</surname><given-names>Pan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CA183030</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Yang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000049</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Aging</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AG036690</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zheng</surname><given-names>Pan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CA171972</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Yang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A novel population of hematopoietic cells unmasked by mTORC1 inactivation reveals a new mechanism of innate immune tolerance and a new consequence of defective hematopoiesis.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Autoreactive T and B lymphocytes are controlled by regulation of population sizes and pathogenicity through clonal deletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Burnet, 1957</xref>), clonal anergy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Nossal and Pike, 1980</xref>) and regulatory T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sakaguchi et al., 1995</xref>). Through broadly-reactive pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Janeway, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Medzhitov et al., 1997</xref>), innate immunity protects host against infections by both direct effector function and, indirectly, by induction of adaptive immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Liu and Janeway, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Liu and Janeway, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wu and Liu, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Pasare and Medzhitov, 2005</xref>). Since innate immune responses triggered by host components can also cause fatal tissue damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Stetson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2009</xref>), it must be properly regulated to protect hosts against self-destruction. Although a number of mechanisms have been proposed to prevent self-destructive innate effector functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Liu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Liu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ljunggren and Kärre, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Liew et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Takeuchi and Akira, 2010</xref>), it is less clear if population sizes of innate effectors are suppressed to limit self-destruction.</p><p>The significance of protective self-tolerance mechanisms in adaptive immunity are revealed only when they have gone awry. For example, the significance of clonal deletion was elucidated when it was prevented by blocking either costimulation or antigen-expression in the thymus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anderson et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gao et al., 2002</xref>), while mice with Foxp3 mutation informed us of the consequence of defective regulatory T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hori et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fontenot et al., 2003</xref>). Since removal of the forbidden autoreactive T and B cells is achieved during T and B cell development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Nemazee and Bürki, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sha et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kisielow et al., 1988</xref>), it is intriguing whether certain parallel mechanisms in innate immunity might also remain to be uncovered through genetic inactivation of key regulators in development of innate effector cells.</p><p>The hematopoietic system is among the best characterized of all tissue/systems in mammalians, with cell types and lineages clearly defined in the context of developmental stages and localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Metcalf, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Weissman, 1994</xref>). Hematopoiesis in bone marrow (BM) is responsible for generation of major lineages of innate effectors, including NK cells, granulocytes, monocytes and dendritic cells. While genetic switch in generation of innate immune system has been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Weissman, 1994</xref>), we are not aware of defects that predispose host to innate immune attack through increasing population sizes of self-destructive innate effectors.</p><p>The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, which couples energy and nutrient abundance to the execution of cell growth and division, has emerged as a major regulator of hematopoiesis. Thus, activation of mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) by deleting <italic>Tsc1</italic>, which encodes a negative regulator for mTORC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Inoki et al., 2002</xref>), causes loss of hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) function and renders mice prone to leukemiogenesis in conjunction with loss of tumor suppressor <italic>Pten</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Yilmaz et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Zhang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2008</xref>). More recently, two groups reported that deletion of <italic>Rptor</italic>, which encodes a critical component of mTORC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hara et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kim et al., 2002</xref>), dramatically perturbed hematopoiesis in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hoshii et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kalaitzidis et al., 2012</xref>), as evidenced by defects in production of mature lymphoid and myeloid cells. Remarkably, cells with CD11b<sup>+</sup> Gr-1<sup>-</sup> surface markers massively accumulated in BM following <italic>Rptor</italic> deletion in HSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hoshii et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kalaitzidis et al., 2012</xref>). The nature of this population and consequences of their accumulation, however, remains a mystery.</p><p>Here we systematically analyzed the gene expression signature, cell surface markers, morphology and functions of the CD11b<sup>+</sup>Gr-1<sup>-</sup> population in the <italic>Rptor</italic>-deficient BM and other organs and sought for their physiological counterpart in the normal mice. We found that these cells can be identified in both normal and <italic>Rptor</italic>-deficient hosts by CD3<sup>-</sup>B220<sup>-</sup>NK1.1<sup>-</sup>Ter119<sup>-</sup> CD11c<sup>low/-</sup>CD115<sup>-</sup>F4/80<sup>low/-</sup>Gr-1<sup>-</sup> CD11b<sup>+</sup>PD-L1<sup>+</sup> markers, lymphoid morphology and actively transcribed <italic>Ig</italic> loci. Interestingly, these cells broadly express essentially all TLRs along with many other pattern recognition receptors and mount a greatly exacerbated response to all TLR ligands tested. We name this population IMLEC for innate myelolymphoblastoid effector cell that can be derived from common myeloid progenitors. Because their expansion and broad distribution render the host vulnerable to TLR ligands, we suggest that mTORC1-mediated repression of IMLEC expansion represents a new mechanism of immune tolerance in the innate immunity. Our study also raises an intriguing perspective that while repressing mTOR over-activation suppresses leukemia, a functional mTORC1 must be maintained to limit generation of IMLECs to avoid innate immune destruction.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Raptor suppresses accumulation of a previously uncharacterized subset of leukocytes with features of both myeloid and lymphoid cells</title><p>As germline deletion of <italic>Rptor</italic> (which encode the Raptor protein) is embryonic-lethal, we crossed mice harboring homozygous loxp-flanked <italic>Rptor</italic> exon 6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Polak et al., 2008</xref>) to those with interferon-inducible <italic>Mx1-Cre</italic> recombinase transgene, which allows inducible deletion of target genes effectively in the hematopoietic system upon treatment of interferon or its inducers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kühn et al., 1995</xref>).

Surprisingly, despite the expression of myeloid marker CD11b on the expanded population of BM cells, histological analysis of BM section revealed pervasive expansion of lymphoblastoid cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). The cKO BM contained markedly decreased erythroid and myeloid lineage cells and markedly increased lymphocytes. Lymphocytes were predominantly small-to-medium sized and had normal cytological features. There was also an increased population of large blast-like cells with prominent nucleoli and perinuclear clearing resembling lymphoblasts. Plasma cells were present in small numbers. The myeloid: erythroid ratio was within normal range (3.04) but the overall number of erythroid and myeloid cells was very low. In particular, very few erythroid cells were present. In the myeloid lineage there was also maturation disruption since immature ring form neutrophils (neutrophilic metamyelocytes) predominated over mature neutrophils (condensed chromatin) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Giemsa staining of BM smear revealed a massively increased lymphoblast population and severe depletion of both immature erythroid cells and granulocytes in the cKO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). These cells were replaced by cells with prominent nucleoli and perinuclear clearing resembling lymphoblasts. To confirm that the lymphoblasts were the CD11b<sup>+</sup> Gr-1<sup>-</sup> cells identified by flow cytometry in the cKO BM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>), we FACS-sorted the subset based on CD11b<sup>+</sup> Gr-1<sup>-</sup> surface markers and validated its lymphoid morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>).</p><p>The spleen was greatly enlarged due to expansion of the follicular centers and periarteriolar sheaths within the splenic white pulp (lymphoid areas) of the cKO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). The expanding white pulp populations consisted of lightly stained, large cells that morphologically resembled germinal center lymphocytes. In some areas, these populations expanded within the marginal zones while in others, they involved the periarteriolar sheaths. The cells had an increased amount of pale eosinophilic cytoplasm and mild pleomorphism with both centroblast-like cells (larger cells with large ovoid nuclei and 1–2 prominent nucleoli per cell) and centrocyte-like cells (smaller cells with cleaved or elongated nuclei and unapparent nucleoli).</p><p>Since cells with such combination of morphology and surface markers had not been identified previously, we FACS-sorted the CD11b<sup>+</sup> Gr-1<sup>-</sup> cells from the <italic>Rptor</italic> cKO BM and carried out next-generation RNA sequencing (RNA-seq).

This analysis demonstrates that the CD11b<sup>+</sup>Gr-1<sup>-</sup> cKO BM cells were distinct from all known blood cell types, although they appear to be closely related to B lymphocytes and macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>).

To test this possibility, we analyzed the proliferation of IMLECs by Ki-67 staining and BrdU incorporation. Remarkably, Lin<sup>-</sup> CD11b<sup>+</sup> PD-L1<sup>+</sup> IMLECs from both Raptor Ctrl and cKO BM had much fewer Ki-67<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F,G</xref>) or BrdU<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B,C</xref>) when compared with other lineages. The fact that IMLECs are not proliferating at a higher rate than other BM cell types effectively rules out rapid proliferation as an explanation for IMLECs accumulation in Raptor cKO BM. Likewise, the massive increase of IMLEC in cKO mice over those in the Ctrl mice cannot be due to proliferation, as the percentage of Ki-67<sup>+</sup> or BrdU<sup>+</sup> cells is not increased in cKO mice. Furthermore, based on cell surface Annexin V staining, IMLECs from cKO BM were more prone to apoptosis than total lineage<sup>+</sup> population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H,I</xref>) and had apoptosis rate that was comparable to granulocytes, B cells and T cells in BM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D,E</xref>). The pronounced apoptosis also rules out the possibility that increased survival may account for preferential accumulation of IMLECs in cKO mice. The robust apoptosis detected among WT IMLECs likely contributed to the reduced amount of IMLECs in normal BM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Consistent with the reduced proliferation and increased apoptosis of IMLECs, our exhaustive efforts to demonstrate self-renewal of IMLEC through transplantation of massive numbers of IMLEC have all been unsuccessful (data not shown).</p><p>As an alternative hypothesis, we evaluated whether IMLECs accumulated because of altered differentiation of hematopoietic stem and progenitors (HSPCs).

Furthermore, our data reveal an unexpected function of mTORC1 in suppressing IMLEC expansion. The high vulnerability to TLR ligands after IMLEC expansion highlights a new consequence of defective hematopoiesis and a new mechanism of immune tolerance.</p><p>Two groups have previous reported that inactivation of mTORC1 by deletion of <italic>Rptor</italic> leads to massive accumulation of CD11b<sup>+</sup>Gr-1<sup>-</sup> cells in the BM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hoshii et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kalaitzidis et al., 2012</xref>). Similar results were obtained in mice with <italic>Mtor</italic> deletion in the hematopoietic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Guo et al., 2013</xref>). We have demonstrated here that despite expression of a myeloid cell marker CD11b, the CD11b<sup>+</sup>Gr-1<sup>-</sup> BM cells have lymphoid morphology. The active production of sterile transcripts at Ig loci suggests that these cells have partially committed to the B-cell lineage, while lack of VDJ rearrangement and cell surface B cell markers suggests that the differentiation toward the B cell lineage is limited. Importantly, this cell population expresses high levels of PD-L1 but does not express markers for other lymphoid cells including T cells (CD3) and NK cells (NK1.1) as well as for myeloid cells including F4/80, Gr-1 and CD115. Expression of CD11b also distinguishes IMLECs from ILCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Walker et al., 2013</xref>), which are CD11b<sup>-</sup>. PCA analysis demonstrated that IMLECs are distinct from but close to B cells and macrophages in gene expression profiles. While at much lower frequencies, cells with the same phenotypes and functional properties were also identified in normal BM, peripheral lymphoid and non-lymphoid organs.</p><p>It is of interest to note that the hallmark of IMLECs is the high expression of cell surface PD-L1. First identified as B7-H1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dong et al., 1999</xref>), PD-L1 has been shown to be involved in tumor evasion of T cell immunity, both by inducing exhaustion of effector T cells and by shielding tumor cells from effector T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hirano et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barber et al., 2006</xref>). With the induction by cytokines such as IFN-γ and hypoxic tumor microenvironment, PD-L1 has been found on both tumor cells and host inflammatory cells such as myeloid derived DCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Curiel et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dong et al., 2002</xref>), tumor-infiltrating myeloid derived suppressor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Noman et al., 2014</xref>). Recent studies have demonstrated that PD-L1 is an important biomarker and therapeutic target in cancer immunotherapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Garon et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brahmer et al., 2012</xref>). Since IMLECs constitutively express high levels of PD-L1, it will be of interest to investigate their function in cancer immunity. It’s worth noting that IMLECs of Raptor-deficient BM have an overall higher expression of PD-L1 than that of Raptor-sufficient BM, perhaps this reflects the indirect consequence of reduced mTORC1-mediated translation of PD-L1 negative regulators.</p><p>Since the IMLEC population expanded at the expense of granulocytes in the BM, we tested if IMLECs were derived by trans-differentiation of the granulocytes. Our genetic analyses demonstrated that inactivation of mTORC1 in the granulocytes, using <italic>Lyz2-Cre</italic>, failed to produce this subset, suggesting that loss of mTORC1 in granulocytes does not cause their trans-differentiation into IMLECs. Furthermore, since inactivation of mTORC1 in CD11b<sup>+</sup>Gr-1<sup>+</sup> granulocytes did not affect their abundance in BM, loss of granulocytes in the mice with broad deletion of <italic>Rptor</italic> in all hematopoietic cells was not due to a cell-intrinsic requirement for mTORC1 in survival of granulocytes. Since IMLECs generally do not undergo active proliferation and are prone to apoptosis, their massive accumulation is most likely due to continuous production rather than self-renewal. Indeed, while LSKs and CMPs differentiate into IMLECs both in vitro and in vivo, IMLECs are not able to propagate in vivo (data not shown). Since <italic>Lyz2-Cre</italic> mediated <italic>Rptor</italic> deletion does not result in accumulation of IMLECs, it is obvious that IMLEC differentiation pathway is initiated before <italic>Lyz2-Cre</italic> expression which also occurs in some CMPs, and not all CMPs can give rise to IMLEC. On the other hand, since CLPs give rise to IMLEC in vitro, the possibility that other progenitor cells may give rise to IMLECs has not been ruled out.</p><p>Since heterozygous mutation of <italic>Myb</italic> causes an increase of CD11b<sup>+</sup>Gr-1<sup>low/-</sup> cells in BM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">García et al., 2009</xref>), we tested if conditional deletion of <italic>Myb</italic> is sufficient to cause accumulation of IMLEC. Our data demonstrate that cell-intrinsic reduction of <italic>Myb</italic> in BM resulted in accumulation of CD11b<sup>+</sup> Gr-1<sup>-</sup> PD-L1<sup>+</sup> IMLECs. It is of interest to note that mice with inactivation of <italic>Rptor</italic> share many hematopoietic phenotypes with mice harboring targeted disruption of <italic>Myb</italic>, such as an increase in HSPCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sandberg et al., 2005</xref>) and defective B-lymphopoiesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fahl et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Thomas et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Greig et al., 2010</xref>). Moreover, consistent with the proposed roles of c-Myb in regulating precise hematopoietic commitments, CMPs with deletion of either <italic>Rptor</italic> or <italic>Myb</italic> favored differentiation to CD11b<sup>+</sup> Gr-1<sup>-</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lieu and Reddy, 2012</xref>). Since our data show that the majority of the CD11b<sup>+</sup>Gr-1<sup>-</sup> cells generated from CMPs are IMLECs, these data support the notion that IMLEC accumulation in <italic>Rptor</italic> cKO BM is caused by reduced <italic>Myb</italic> expression in CMPs.</p><p>While the mechanism by which mTORC1 down-regulates <italic>Myb</italic> remains to be fully elucidated, we have found a general up-regulation of putative miRNAs targeting <italic>Myb</italic> in HSPCs after <italic>Rptor</italic> deletion. Our data suggest that mTORC1 inactivation in HSPCs expands IMLECs by down-regulation of <italic>Myb</italic>, perhaps through increased miRNA biogenesis.</p><p>Previous studies by us and others have demonstrated a critical role for regulated mTOR signaling in hematopoiesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Yilmaz et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Zhang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2008</xref>). Thus, while mTOR activation by deletion of <italic>Tsc1</italic> complex expands the numbers of hematopoietic stem cells, it causes reduced hematopoietic stem cell function but induced leukemic stem cells in conjunction with <italic>Pten</italic> deletion. This is consistent with the generally accepted association between defective differentiation and leukemiogenesis, which forms the foundation for treatment of leukemia through induction of differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Nowak et al., 2009</xref>). The expansion of IMLECs caused by mTORC1 inactivation did not lead to leukemiogenesis as IMLECs are non-dividing cells that undergo a high rate of apoptosis. Instead, our data demonstrate a new consequence of defective differentiation, namely generation of a new population of cells with distinct effector function, as discussed below.</p><p>Our RNA-seq data suggest that IMLECs broadly over-express pattern recognition receptors for innate immunity. Corresponding to a broad, although not universal TLR elevation, IMLECs mount drastically exacerbated responses to all TLR ligands tested in vitro. Intracellular cytokine staining revealed that both normal and <italic>Rptor</italic>-cKO IMLECs were among the most active producers of inflammatory cytokines. Surprisingly, although <italic>Rptor<sup>-/-</sup></italic> BM cells have normal TLR5 levels, they produce 10–20 folds more inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α and MCP-1 in response to TLR5 ligand. It is therefore likely that beyond TLRs, IMLECs have acquired other features that enhance their response to TLR ligands.</p><p>Apart from BM, expanded IMLECs are broadly distributed in lymphoid and non-lymphoid organs such as lung and liver. Our data demonstrate that an increase in IMLEC numbers makes the host highly vulnerable to TLR ligands such as LPS and polyI:C, as indicated by rapid demise of mice following pIpC and low doses of LPS injections. Since necrosis of normal tissues leads to release of endogenous TLR ligands, such as HMGB1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Scaffidi et al., 2002</xref>) and HSP70 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Millar et al., 2003</xref>), and since unregulated host response to HMGB1 leads to fatal inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2009</xref>), it is conceivable that expansion of IMLECs may also make the host more vulnerable to tissue injury- induced inflammation. This is evidenced by elevated inflammation in acetaminophen-triggered liver necrosis model.</p><p>The severe pathological consequences may explain the paradoxical functions of mTOR in regulation of inflammation. While mTOR signaling is known to be activated by inflammatory cytokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2010</xref>) and rapamycin has been shown to inhibit production of inflammatory cytokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abraham and Wiederrecht, 1996</xref>), perhaps through its inhibition of mTOR-mediated NFκB activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lee et al., 2007</xref>), rapamycin has been shown to induce inflammation in a small number of transplantation patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Diekmann et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Thaunat et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dittrich et al., 2004</xref>). Likewise, we have observed that rapamycin increases production of inflammatory cytokines in autoimmune Scurfy mice and in mice treated with high doses of endotoxin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2010</xref>). It would be of great interest to determine if rapamycin can expand IMLECs in transplantation patients and in mice that either receive high doses of endotoxin or are genetically predisposed to autoimmune disease. It is also reported that persistent mTORC1 inhibition can result in elevated inflammation, activation of STAT3 and enhanced hepatocellular carcinoma development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Umemura et al., 2014</xref>). Our findings focused on characterizing IMLECs and inflammation support the provocative findings of this report, and might provide alternative and complementary explanations. However, despite an extensive effort, we have failed to induce IMLECs by mTOR kinase inhibitor Torin2 or rapamycin in WT mice (data not shown). Therefore, under normal circumstances, pharmaceutical inhibition of mTORC1 alone cannot achieve comparable levels of inflammation as those achieved by genetic inactivation of either <italic>Mtor</italic> or <italic>Rptor</italic>. Additional conditions must be met for mTOR inhibitors to cause inflammation. While these unknown barriers have ensured safety of mTOR inhibitors in most circumstances, their breakdown may explain paradoxical induction of inflammation by rapamycin.</p><p>The concept of immune tolerance has traditionally been reserved for adaptive immunity to avoid autoimmune diseases. A multitude of mechanisms, including clonal deletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sha et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kisielow et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kappler et al., 1987</xref>), clonal anergy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Nossal and Pike, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Schwartz et al., 1989</xref>) and dominant regulatory T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sakaguchi et al., 1995</xref>), have been described to reduce self-reactive T and B cell clone sizes to avoid autoimmune diseases. On the other hand, innate immunity is known to be regulated at levels of cellular activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kärre et al., 1986</xref>) and cellular recruitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Springer, 1994</xref>). However, we and others have reported that innate immune effectors, especially NK cells, have features of adaptive immunity as their immune protective function against cancer and viruses is amplified through increased population sizes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gao et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Sun et al., 2009</xref>). However, a regulatory mechanism to control innate effector population size for the sake of preventing self-destruction has not been described. Our discovery of a developmentally regulated mechanism to control the population size of IMLECs to avoid unwanted self-destruction, as described herein, reveals a parallel between adaptive and innate immunity to avoid potentially life-threatening inflammation and tissue damage. It is therefore of interest to consider the concept of immune tolerance in the area of innate immunity.</p><p>An important consideration is whether IMLEC is a normal population of hematopoietic cells or a population that arises after pathogenic mutations. While we have identified cells of similar phenotypes and functional properties in normal mice, they are extremely rare and thus have no obvious physiological functions unless they are substantially expanded. We have demonstrated that these cells do not undergo proliferation and are prone to apoptosis, and that their expansion depends on abnormal hematopoiesis. Therefore, the pathological consequence observed herein is only known to manifest itself if the mTORC1-Myb pathway is genetically inactivated, resulting in disruption of normal hematopoiesis. Further studies are needed to identify conditions that can lead to accumulation of IMLEC short of these known mutations.</p><p>In summary, our data demonstrate that inactivation of mTORC1 in hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells leads to generation of IMLECs, a new cell population that shares features with myeloid and lymphoid lineages. The greater than 500-fold increase in population size of IMLECs in mTORC1- or <italic>Myb</italic>-defective BM highlights the critical role for mTORC1 and c-Myb in repressing the development of sufficient number of IMLECs to cause serious inflammation and tissue damage. Our study reveals a new consequence of defective hematopoiesis and may help to extend the concept of immune tolerance to innate immunity.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">strain, strain background (<italic>Mus musculus,C57BL/6</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>Rptor<sup>F/F</sup></italic></td><td valign="top">PMID: 19046572</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">strain, strain background (<italic>Mus musculus,C57BL/6</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>Myb<sup>F/F</sup>;</italic> <break/><italic>Myb<sup>F/F</sup>,Rag2<sup>-/-</sup>,CreER</italic></td><td valign="top">PMID: 15195090; <break/>PMID: 16169500</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">strain, strain background (<italic>Mus musculus,C57BL/6</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>Mx1-Cre</italic></td><td valign="top">The Jackson Laboratory</td><td valign="top">Stock No: 003556; <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:003556">IMSR_JAX:003556</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">strain, strain background (<italic>Mus musculus,C57BL/6</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>CreER</italic></td><td valign="top">The Jackson Laboratory</td><td valign="top">Stock No: 007001; <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:007001">IMSR_JAX:007001</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">strain, strain background (<italic>Mus musculus,C57BL/6</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>Lyz2-Cre</italic></td><td valign="top">The Jackson Laboratory</td><td valign="top">Stock No: 004781; <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:004781">IMSR_JAX:004781</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice and induction of gene deletion</title><p><italic>Rptor <sup>F/F</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bentzinger et al., 2008</xref>) were crossed to the C57BL/6 background for more than 10 generations. <italic>Myb <sup>F/F</sup></italic> and <italic>Myb <sup>F/F</sup>, Rag2<sup>-/-</sup></italic>, <italic>CreER</italic> mice were reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fahl et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Thomas et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bender et al., 2004</xref>).

editorial decision letter and accompanying author responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>[Editors’ note: a previous version of this study was rejected after peer review, but the authors submitted for reconsideration. The first decision letter after peer review is shown below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;A Population of Innate Myelolymphoblastoid Effector Cell Expanded by Inactivation of mTOR Complex 1&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors and the evaluation has been overseen by Tadatsugu Taniguchi as the Senior Editor. Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: (peer reviewer: Frederic Geissman).</p><p>While your study was thought to be interesting and thought-provoking by all reviewers, you will see that they all share major concerns about the characterization of WT 'IMLECs', and feel that without far more analysis and characterization of the so-called WT IMLECs, the report presented here does not warrant a case for them in normal myelopoiesis. The extent of additional work involved to address this concern would be far too much to be practical within a two-month revision window.</p><p>The reviewers also think that your demonstration of the 'Raptor-deletion-induced IMECs' and their potential role in pathogenic myeloid differentiation, particularly in specific situations of inflammatory pathology such as in patients with mutations in relevant pathways or in situations of long-term MTORC1 inhibition therapy, could be very interesting independent of any claims about identification of 'WT IMLECs'. However, as you will see from the reviews, they remain concerned that the present manuscript does not provide adequate clarity about the inflammatory impact of these specific cells in such situations and about the mechanisms involved. Of course, such a manuscript would be quite different from the present one, and will be considered as a new submission subject to a fresh and completely independent review process.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>The manuscript shows very interesting data demonstrating the characteristics of an odd innate myelo-lymphoid cell population in the normal mouse bone marrow that becomes very prominent in the bone marrow of the Raptor-deficient mouse, along with some data regarding the genesis and the functional consequences of this population. These are putatively novel findings and well worth publication. However, enthusiasm for publication would be enhanced if major concerns as identified below could be substantively addressed.</p><p>1) The manuscript focuses far too much on the issue of the role of cell numbers in regulating self-tolerance, as well as on the so-called 'novelty' of this cell population. While the first question is interesting, it is quite peripheral to the findings in the manuscript. The second claim of novelty somewhat over-interprets the data, which currently address the characterisation, genesis and functions of an identifiable group of leukocytes without actually quite identifying a stable differentiated cell lineage with normal physiological role/s.</p><p>2) The use of polyIC as an inducer of Cre-mediated gene deletion introduces a substantial potential confounder in an analysis of a putative myeloid cell subset. It would be advisable to have confirmatory data for most critical findings using another system of inducible Cre expression, such as the ER-Cre the authors have used.</p><p>3) The claim of the putative 'IMLECs' being present in wild-type bone marrow needs somewhat more robust support. Thus, the flow cytometric data showing such cells in normal bone marrow indicate two distinct populations in the gate, one CD11b<sup>dull</sup>PDL1<sup>bright</sup> and one CD11b<sup>bright</sup>PDL1<sup>dull</sup>, neither of which precisely corresponds to the population in Raptor-deficient bone marrow cells. Upon differentiation in vitro, too, WT LSKs and CMPs generate apparent 'IMLECs' that show much lower levels of PD-L1 than Raptor-deficient 'IMLECs' do. Also, the data on TLR/PRR and cytokine expression on 'IMLECs' from WT bone marrow again show that these cells are PDL1low compared to 'IMLECs' from Raptor-deficient mice, and that they are less efficient at producing TNF-α. Greater clarity in the similarities and differences in this cell population from wild-type versus Raptor-deficient mice, both in terms of cell-surface phenotype and transcript profiles, is needed.</p><p>4) The finding that LysM-Cre-mediated rptor deletion does not lead to the generation of the putative IMLECs needs further explanation, since a substantial proportion of CMPs would be expected to express LysM-Cre and would therefore be expected to be redirected into an IMLEC differentiation pathway per the authors' model. It is thus possible that altered commitment is programmed prior to the CMP stage. This is further complicated by the fact that, while mixed chimeras using whole bone marrow cells generate Raptor-deficient myeloid cells that are mostly 'IMLECs' rather than granulocytic cells, this is not true when LSKs are used; Raptor-deficient LSK cells give rise mostly to granulocytic cells in vivo. It is possible that this differentiation pathway is imprinted as a result of the absence of Raptor in a very early hematopoietic cell stage leading to some degree of loss of myeloid/lymphoid distinction as well as downstream loss of granulocytic differentiation. Acknowledgement and some explanation of these ambiguities are essential.</p><p>5) The c-Myb-deletion data require further support. The phenotype of the heterozygous c-Myb-deleted mouse with reference to PDL1 expression needs to be shown. Also, the connection between c-myb and Raptor deficiencies in generating these putative IMLECs requires clarity; thus, for example, does provision of heterologous c-myb modify the generation of 'IMLECs' from Raptor-deficient LSK cells in vitro?</p><p>6) The claim that the explanation for the disease phenotype in vivo in Raptor-deficient mice solely or even primarily lies in the abnormally large numbers of normally functioning highly sensitive pro-inflammatory 'IMLECs' needs much more substantiation. At the very least, mixed bone marrow chimeras with graded contributions from Raptor-deficient and WT bone marrow need to be done to examine the disease consequences when Raptor-deficient 'IMLEC' cell numbers approach their apparent WT counterparts.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>Research article – Tang et al. A population of Innate Myelolymphoblastoid Effector Cell Expanded by Inactivation of mTOR Complex 1</p><p>The authors report a previously uncharacterized leukocyte subset (Lin-, CD11b+, Gr1-, PD-L1+) expressing IgH and Rag2, they name IMLEC. IMLEC are present in the bone marrow of Rptor deficient, pIpc treated mice, as well, in much lower numbers in the BM of Rptor <sup>F/F</sup>, pIpc treated mice. The authors also show the presence of cells with similar features in the spleen BM and blood of wt mice. When genetic deletion of <italic>Rptor</italic> or <italic>Myb</italic> is introduced in Mx1-Cre expressing cells the population expands dramatically, in a cell-autonomous manner. IMLEC are also present in the progeny of Myb-deficient hematopoietic progenitors. IMLEC produce cytokines in response to TLR stimulation, and accumulate in tissues. The authors conclude that mTOR is able to suppress IMLEC expansion via <italic>Myb</italic> (in a relatively mysterious manner), and when mTOR is dysregulated, IMLEC production can lead to severe pathological consequences due to a high vulnerability of IMLECs to TLR ligands.</p><p>The experiments are well performed, the authors analyze IMLECs in depth and describe how genetic dysregulation of hematopoietic cells can lead to the aberrant expansion of these dysfunctional myelo/lymphoid cells. The main interrogation about this study, is whether this cell type is physiological, or only appears in the absence of Rptor or Myb. The characterization of 'WT' IMLEC is not convincing. Nevertheless, this study indicates how cell autonomous genetic events in hematopoietic progenitors can lead to inflammation, by the generation of 'abnormal' myeloid cells.</p><p>Altogether, this study is interesting and well performed, but the description of a new physiological cell type is not convincing, and the manuscript could be revised to focus on the 'pathological' consequences of Raptor deficiency.</p><p>The claim of the paper describing WT IMLEC as a cell type is not convincing, and extensive experiments would be needed if the authors were to maintain this claim.</p><p>This work is however very interesting as there was evidence in particular in a recent article in Cell by the group of M. Karin that 'long term mTORC1 inhibition' (in this model raptor deletion, or rapamycin treatment) in vivo induces inflammation, and this pathway is of obvious relevance as longterm rapamycin treatment is used or maybe(?) misused in human. The authors observations may support the provocative findings of Karin, and provide an (alternative) or complementary mechanism for this important observation.</p><p>Specific comments:</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>: It is, just by looking at the HE stain, not possible to appreciate the expansion of the lymphocyte population. Controls would need to be displayed bigger. (see also comment for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref></p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>: Display control spleen in the same way as the Rptor-/- spleen (comparable to liver in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref> where control and experimental animals are shown in the same magnifications)</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4A, B</xref>: ST-HSCs are CD150- and CD48-, please revise the FACS plots and the quantification in B</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>: Sorted wild-type IMLECs do not look exactly as Rptor-deficient IMLECs (shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">figure 1F</xref>). This brings back the concern mentioned above of whether these cells are the same cell type, or whether the KO changes the phenotypic nature of WT IMLECs. The authors should at least sort and stain Ctrl and KO cells at the same time to see whether these histological differences are not due to technical reasons. It would be also of interest to see these cells in comparison in histograms showing their FSC and SSC sizes as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2E</xref>.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>: The authors speculate about the CD11chigh population in the liver, which could be CD8<sup>+</sup> DCs. Since these are WT samples, it would be reasonable to repeat this experiment and include CD8 in the lineage or to define these populations further.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>: The authors should either (always) speculate that miRNAs might be the reason for Myb downregulation in Rptor<sup>-/-</sup> mice, or (always) strongly state it. For now, it seems that the authors could not decide as their statements change in the text and the figure legends.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>Tang et al. described here a previously reported population of cell expanded in a mouse model presenting an inactivation of the mTOR Complex 1. These cells present a lymphoid morphology with a myeloid phenotype, clustering with macrophages at the gene expression level. They also express a wide range of TLR and are functional, secreting pro-inflammatory cytokines when challenged.</p><p>The main concern here is that the nature of the cell population remains elusive especially in the WT environment: is it a real independent lineage? Is it a &quot;blocked and frustrated&quot; progenitor stage? Most importantly, its physiological relevance is also not addressed since this population is seen mostly when deleting Rptor in hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells and as its existence in WT bone marrow is really not convincingly addressed. It rather appears as a blocked and dysfunctional dead end of abnormal hematopoiesis that does not exist in normal hematopoiesis. Again, the authors do not provide enough convincing data supporting the significance of this population.</p><p>In term of phenotype, the authors found that IMLEC express PD-L1 and CD11b. Do they express other markers such as Ly6C? MHC-II? Of note, CD11b is indeed a myeloid marker but also express by lymphoid cells such as NK cells and cannot really be used as a lineage marker. In addition, among the 317 CD markers described in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>, the authors should test other markers than PDL1. Also, since these markers where found from the KO IMLEC, any risk that some of the negative markers tested are controlled by functional mTOR complex? Phenotype should be tested in WT bone marrow.</p><p>The authors used RNAseq data to investigate the nature of the cells. However, they isolated IMLEC from Rptor deficient bone marrow and hence, the lack of functional mTOR could blur the true nature of the cells. The authors should perform gene expression profiling using WT cells. Also, it is not clear in the comparison of gene expression profiles of KO IMLEC with other known subsets of hematopoietic cells if the authors sorted the cells for the other known subsets from KO, WT mice or use only public database. If the latter, they should precise if all these arrays were made with a comparable approach using similar aged and sex match mice of the same background.</p><p>The characterization of the WT IMLEC is not convincing at all and the data provided mostly correlative. How comparable are the WT and KO populations in phenotype, gene expression profile, TLR expression and function.</p><p>The statement &quot;Perhaps the CD11c<sup>high</sup> cells in the spleen are the CD8<sup>+</sup> PDL-1<sup>+</sup> DCs and the CD11c<sup>low/-</sup> cells are IMLECs.&quot; is not acceptable. The authors should prove it.</p><p>To identify the progenitor that may give rise to IMLECs, the authors omitted to test the contribution of CLP, which will be important to test as CLP give rise to B cells and IMLEC present high levels of sterile transcripts thay may suggest that they correspond to a stage before early B cell commitment.</p><p>How do the authors exclude that the broad expression of TLR could be a response to induction of Mx1 by pIpC administration?</p><p>For the Ki67 and annexin stainings, the authors are comparing IMLEC to the rest of the bone marrow, which is a mix of heterogeneous population of progenitors and differentiated cells. This is not really comparable and not relevant. For proliferation, the authors should rather do a Brdu labeling or cell cycle assay by flow cytometry that measure DNA content (and which is more accurate and sensitive than Ki67 staining).</p><p>[Editors’ note: what now follows is the decision letter after the authors submitted for further consideration.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;A Population of Innate Myelolymphoblastoid Effector Cell Expanded by Inactivation of mTOR Complex 1&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors and the evaluation has been overseen by Tadatsugu Taniguchi as the Senior Editor.

These are putatively novel findings and well worth publication. The authors have made efforts to address any, though not all, of the concerns expressed regarding the earlier version. Some reservations do, however, remain.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Specifically, it is still not quite clear if the data indicate a stable differentiated cell lineage with normal physiological role/s, and/or a specific non-redundant role in the inflammatory phenotype seen in Rptor-deficient mice. The characterisation of the IMLECs in WT mice remains preliminary and is not fully convincing, making it unclear if they really exist as a homogeneous population in normal bone marrow. The massive generation of IMLEC following Myb deletion (revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">figure 6</xref>) further and strongly suggests that IMLEC may be some kind of a preleukemic cell type. It is not clear if WT IMLECs preserve their phenotype stably in vivo, and if induced deletion of Rptor in them lead to further, putatively aberrant differentiation. Therefore, the manuscript needs to acknowledge these issues and substantially modulate the claims to identification of a new 'normal' bone marrow cell type in a far more modest and qualified direction.</p><p>2) More convincingly, the study indicates how cell autonomous genetic events in hematopoietic progenitors can lead to inflammation by the generation of 'abnormal' myeloid cells. That issue, too, will be strengthened by demonstrations of the disease-related consequences of WT and/or Rptor-deficient IMLECs.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;A Population of Innate Myelolymphoblastoid Effector Cell Expanded by Inactivation of mTOR Complex 1 in Mice&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.

However, it is essential to make further major and extensive text modifications (1) to reflect the primary focus of the manuscript on the disease-related role/s of Rptor-deficient IMLECs, and (2) to make it much more clear that the provenance of the IMLEC-like population found in WT mice is quite unclear at the moment.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32497.055</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the first round of peer review follow.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>The manuscript shows very interesting data demonstrating the characteristics of an odd innate myelo-lymphoid cell population in the normal mouse bone marrow that becomes very prominent in the bone marrow of the Raptor-deficient mouse, along with some data regarding the genesis and the functional consequences of this population.

Although with an extremely low abundance, the WT IMLECs were proven to display same morphology, size and granularity, expression for sterile transcripts of Ig loci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), comparable levels of TLR expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), much similar extents of specific transcription factors expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), comparable ability in TNF production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). These data demonstrated that IMLEC existed under physiological condition at low numbers and thus support the notion that Raptor deletion increases IMLEC population size rather than creates a new cell population. As such, we believe it is reasonable to state that the new function of Raptor described herein is to prevent expansion of IMLEC under physiological conditions, and in doing so, it prevents pathological consequences associated with IMLEC expansion.</p><p>We would like to cast the new findings in the context of adaptive and innate immune regulatory mechanisms.

Rather, we think the generation of granulocytes from LSK relates to the short-term transplantation protocol designed to study progenitors. LSK was used as positive control.</p><p>Transplantation of progenitor cells in the context of induced deletion is difficult because the progenitor cells do not self-renew and thus could further differentiate before the deletion effect. We believe some, although most likely not all, CMP can generate IMLEC based on in vitro co-culture and in vivo transplantation studies. This does not exclude other possibilities, as detailed in revised texts.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The c-Myb-deletion data require further support. The phenotype of the heterozygous c-Myb-deleted mouse with reference to PDL1 expression needs to be shown.

The WT BM-derived cells will be overwhelmingly dominant and the contribution of Rptor<sup>-/-</sup> IMLECs cannot be evaluated in this mixed BM model. We also attempted to transfer Rptor<sup>-/-</sup> IMLECs into Rag1<sup>-/-</sup> mice but these cells did not survive in vivo. As a result, we were not able use adoptive transfer to substantiate pathogenicity of IMLEC.</p><p>On the other hand, we have presented data that IMLEC produce high levels of cytokines which are known to be pathogenic in mice.</p><p>We have now carefully discussed this issue to reflect the reviewer’s concern.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>The authors report a previously uncharacterized leukocyte subset (Lin-, CD11b+, Gr1-, PD-L1+) expressing IgH and Rag2, they name IMLEC.

The authors conclude that mTOR is able to suppress IMLEC expansion via Myb (in a relatively mysterious manner), and when mTOR is dysregulated, IMLEC production can lead to severe pathological consequences due to a high vulnerability of IMLECs to TLR ligands.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the expert evaluation of our work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The experiments are well performed, the authors analyze IMLECs in depth and describe how genetic dysregulation of hematopoietic cells can lead to the aberrant expansion of these dysfunctional myelo/lymphoid cells.

The characterisation of the IMLECs in WT mice remains preliminary and is not fully convincing, making it unclear if they really exist as a homogeneous population in normal bone marrow. The massive generation of IMLEC following Myb deletion (revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">figure 6</xref>) further and strongly suggests that IMLEC may be some kind of a preleukemic cell type. It is not clear if WT IMLECs preserve their phenotype stably in vivo, and if induced deletion of Rptor in them lead to further, putatively aberrant differentiation. Therefore, the manuscript needs to acknowledge these issues and substantially modulate the claims to identification of a new 'normal' bone marrow cell type in a far more modest and qualified direction.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the suggestions on further acknowledging these issues, and we have now carefully discussed these issues to reflect the editors and reviewers’ concerns.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) More convincingly, the study indicates how cell autonomous genetic events in hematopoietic progenitors can lead to inflammation by the generation of 'abnormal' myeloid cells.
