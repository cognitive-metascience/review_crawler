Although the molecular identity and structure of the MET channel remains elusive, a growing body of evidence supports the hypothesis that the transmembrane channel-like 1 and 2 (TMC1 and TMC2) proteins are pore-forming subunits of the MET channel. TMC1 is the most abundant subtype expressed in mature auditory hair cells, whereas TMC2 is more abundantly expressed early in postnatal development, coinciding with the onset of mechanotransduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Corns et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kawashima et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kim and Fettiplace, 2013</xref>). Hair cells from TMC1 and TMC2 double knockout mice appear structurally unperturbed at P5, yet exhibit no MET channel currents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Pan et al., 2013</xref>). Both TMC1 and TMC2 have been shown to biochemically interact with the tip link that is required for mechanical gating of the MET channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Assad et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Maeda et al., 2014</xref>). In addition, both TMC1 and TMC2 are expressed at the tip of the shorter stereocilia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Kurima et al., 2015</xref>) where the MET channel has been localized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Beurg et al., 2009</xref>). Finally, the deafness-causing TMC1 Beethoven (<italic>Bth</italic>) mutation (M418K in hTMC1 or M412K in mTMC1) alters the Ca<sup>2+</sup> permeability, single channel conductance and dihydrostreptomycin blockade of the MET channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Beurg et al., 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Corns et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Pan et al., 2013</xref>).

Our mTMC1 models establish the presence of 10 transmembrane (TM) helices, suggest that the TMC proteins are dimers and reveal that the conserved Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding site found in TMEM16 proteins is not conserved in TMC. Each TMC1 protomer contains a large cavity at the periphery of the protein that is formed by the TM4 to TM7 helices and contains the <italic>Bth</italic> mutation, raising the possibility that it functions as an ion permeation pathway. To test the prediction that the MET channel contains an unusually large permeation pathway, we investigated the permeability of hair cells to fluorescently-labeled dextrans and we provide evidence that dextrans as large as 3 kDa can permeate. Dextran permeation is abolished by breaking tip links, blocking the MET channel or genetic deletion of TMC1/TMC2 proteins, suggesting that functional MET channels are required. Taken together, our results provide a structural framework for investigating TMC proteins, suggest the presence of a large permeation pathway and support the hypothesis that TMC1 is a pore forming subunit of the MET channel complex.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Structural relationship between TMC1 and TMEM16 proteins</title><p>We began by investigating whether the application of hidden Markov model (HMM)-based profiles would allow the identification of suitable templates to model the structure of TMC1.

Our TMC1 models were generated as dimers, similar to the templates used, with a two-fold symmetry axis located between the two TM10 helices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>). Residues in TM10 forming the dimer interface are highly conserved, consistent with TMC1 forming dimers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Each protomer contained a cavity formed by helices TM4-TM7 that faces the membrane. The major divergences among the three models were dictated by the structural templates, which exhibited unique rearrangements of helices TM4 and TM6 that contour the cavity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The cavity observed in model 1 was wide open, forming a deep cleft towards the lipid bilayer, whereas in model 2, the cavity was narrower at the extracellular side and partially shielded from the membrane.

It is known that inner ear hair cells are permeable to relatively large cationic molecules. For instance, amphipathic styryl dyes (FM1-43 and FM4-64, 0.5–0.8 kDa) and Texas Red-labeled aminoglycosides (1.29–1.43 kDa) label the hair cell body, and both molecules are thought to enter through the MET channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alharazneh et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kawashima et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Marcotti et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Meyers et al., 2003</xref>). To explore the limits of the MET pore size and provide experimental support for the large cavity observed in our TMC1 model, we investigated whether cochlear hair cells might be permeable to Texas Red-labeled 3 kDa dextrans (dextran-TR) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), polar polymers of glucose molecules that are derivatized with Lys for fixation and making them cationic. When organ of Corti explants from wild-type postnatal day (P) 6 mice were incubated for 2 hr with dextran-TR at room temperature, we observed robust and specific labeling of auditory hair cells using confocal Airyscan super-resolution microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Labeling was observed for both the inner and outer hair cells (IHC and OHC) along the entire organ of Corti from the basal to the apical regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B–D</xref>). Interestingly, we found that hair cells from the basal area incorporated significantly more dextran compared to those from the middle or the apical regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C,D</xref>), a result that is consistent with reports for uptake of FM1-43 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gale et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Lelli et al., 2009</xref>).

In contrast to the diffuse pattern of uptake observed with 3 kDa dextran-TR, 10 kDa dextran-TR showed only punctate vesicle-like structures in the hair cell body. Moreover, the 10 kDa dextran accumulated around the hair cell membrane in a patchy pattern regardless of whether the label was Texas Red or anionic FITC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>). In addition, vesicle-like structures were seen in supporting cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Interestingly, the same vesicle-like pattern was observed when cells were incubated with anionic 3 kDa dextran-FITC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B</xref>), suggesting that the properties of the fluorophore influence whether a diffuse pattern of uptake is observed. FITC is actually smaller than Texas Red, so most likely the absence of diffuse uptake observed with FITC is related to the negative charge on the fluorophore or its increased hydrophilicity. The size-dependence for dextran uptake demonstrates specificity to the diffuse pattern of uptake observed with 3 kDa dextran-TR, and shows that a vesicle-like pattern of uptake can be distinguished from the more diffuse pattern.</p><p>To test whether the diffuse pattern of uptake observed with 3 kDa dextran-TR is caused by cell damage during the preparation of the explant, we examined the uptake of 3 kDa dextran-TR and 10 kDa dextran-FITC simultaneously. As in the experiments described thus far, we observed both diffuse uptake and a vesicle-like pattern of hair cell body labeling for the 3 kDa dextran-TR. However, only a vesicle-like pattern of uptake was observed for 10 kDa dextran-FITC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1C</xref>). The vesicle-like structures observed with both 10 kDa dextran-FITC and with 3 kDa dextran-TR suggest that this form of uptake likely reflects endocytosis. From these results, we concluded that small dextran-TR enters the hair cells through two pathways, one common to other dextrans and involving vesicle-like structures, and another that does not involve endocytosis and producing a diffuse pattern of uptake.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Disruption of tip links and MET channel blockers prevent uptake of dextran-TR into hair cells</title><p>To explore whether the non-endocytic pathway for uptake of 3 kDa dextran-TR might be the pore of the MET channel, we assessed dextran incorporation in hair cells from explants incubated with MET channel blockers or with the Ca<sup>2+</sup> chelator BAPTA, a manipulation that abolishes the mechanotransduction current in hair cells by breaking the tip links (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Assad et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fettiplace and Kim, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Marcotti et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Rüsch et al., 1994</xref>).

TMC1 and TMC2 are strong candidates for forming the pore of the MET channel in hair cells, while TMEM16A and B are Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated Cl<sup>-</sup> channels and the TMEM16F is a phospholipid scramblase. Our HMM-based sequence alignments and hydrophobicity analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), together with the homology models we built and assessed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), establish that TMC and TMEM16 proteins adopt a similar fold. Our models suggest that the TMC proteins have a transmembrane cavity at the protein-lipid interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>), a feature that is dictated by the structures we used as templates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). In the case of the nhTMEM16 scramblase (model 1), this cavity is completely open to the lipid bilayer and is thought to be the pathway for lipids to diffuse across the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brunner et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Malvezzi et al., 2013</xref>). In the case of the TMEM16A Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated Cl<sup>-</sup> channels, the cavity is partially closed to the surrounding membrane, primarily within the outer half of the bilayer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Paulino et al., 2017</xref>). Although our models are inherently low resolution, it is interesting that the model based on the nhTMEM16 structure exhibited the highest ProQM score, in particular for the TM4-6 helices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), regions where the structures differ the most between nhTMEM16 and TMEM16A in the absence and presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>. The cavity in our model of the TMC1 protein is wide and anionic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), consistent with the possibility that this region contributes to forming the permeation pathway for the cation selective MET channel. It is also interesting that the cavity in our TMC1 models is highly conserved across TMC proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), supporting a critical role in the structure and function of the protein. In addition, many mutations in TMC1 that cause deafness localize near the peripheral cavity, with several lining the putative permeation pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Notably, the only two positions where mutations lead to autosomal dominant progressive deafness in humans (DFNA36) are the <italic>Bth</italic> mutation (mTMC1 M412) and two mutations in residue D572 (mTMC1 D569), and both of these positions line the cavity in our TMC1 model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).</p><p>Our model of the TMC1 protein provides a framework for further exploring the structural interactions between the components of the MET channel complex. For example, the peripheral location of the cavity in TMC1 raises the possibility that TM regions of TMHS, TMIE and/or PCDH15 might contribute to forming the permeation pathway together with TMC1. The homodimeric architecture of our TMC1 model is also interesting because the tip link is a homodimer of PCDH15 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kachar et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kazmierczak et al., 2007</xref>) and each tip link is thought to bind to two MET channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Beurg et al., 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Beurg et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Ricci et al., 2003</xref>). PCDH15 contains a single TM helix and its intracellular C-terminus has been shown to interact with the N-terminus of TMC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Maeda et al., 2014</xref>), which in our model is positioned on the intracellular surface below the cavity that opens to the surrounding membrane.</p><p>The large cavity in our model of TMC1 raises the possibility that the permeation pathway in TMC is larger than has been seen in most ion channel proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Goldschen-Ohm and Chanda, 2017</xref>). In addition, the permeability of hair cells to FM1-43 (~11 Å minimal diameter, MW 0.56 kDa) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gale et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Meyers et al., 2003</xref>), Texas Red-labeled aminoglycosides (~15 Å minimal diameter, MW 1.29–1.43 kDa) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alharazneh et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Marcotti et al., 2005</xref>) and Texas Red-labeled 3 kDa dextran (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9</xref>), suggests the presence of a unusually large permeation pathway. The time course for labeling of hair cells by these fluorescent molecules varies with their size, with the maximal labeling requiring a few minutes for FM1-43 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alharazneh et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Meyers et al., 2003</xref>), 30–60 min for Texas Red-labeled aminoglycosides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alharazneh et al., 2011</xref>) and 1–2 hr. for Texas Red-labeled 3 kDa dextran, consistent with these molecules permeating through the MET channel. As far as we are aware, the large conductance mechanosensitive channel (MscL) is the only other ion channel known to be permeable to 3 kDa dextran-TR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Doerner et al., 2012</xref>). MscL has no ion selectivity and its open pore has been estimated to have a minimal diameter &gt;25 Å (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Perozo et al., 2002</xref>). In the case of MscL, uptake of dextran-TR occurs over minutes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Doerner et al., 2012</xref>), whereas our most consistent uptake was measured after 2 hr, suggesting that the rate of dextran permeation through the pore of the MET channel is considerably lower than MscL. Although it is conceivable that dextran permeation occurs in a conformation of the MET channel that is only rarely visited, most likely the pore of the MET channel is considerably smaller than that of MscL. The permeation of Texas Red-labeled aminoglycosides and dextrans would require a pore considerably larger than the 12 Å estimate that is based on the relative permeability of the MET channel to quaternary ammonium ions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Farris et al., 2004</xref>). If the permeation pathway of the MET channel has some exposure to the surrounding lipid membrane, as is the case for the TMEM16 proteins, it may also exhibit structural plasticity.</p><p>The cavity at the protein-lipid interface in our model of TMC also has important implications for understanding the role of membrane lipids in regulating the activity of the MET channel. Phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP<sub>2</sub>) is known to regulate a diverse array of ion channel proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hilgemann et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Suh and Hille, 2008</xref>), including the MET channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Effertz et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hirono et al., 2004</xref>). In hair cells, the concentration of PIP<sub>2</sub> is carefully regulated such that its concentration is high at the location of the MET channel at the tips of stereocilia. In addition, depletion of PIP<sub>2</sub> has been reported to alter the gating properties of the MET channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Effertz et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hirono et al., 2004</xref>). For example, depletion of PIP<sub>2</sub> increases the resting open probability of the MET channel, leads to loss of mechanotransduction current and dramatically alters fast adaptation, a process whereby the MET channel closes in the continual presence of a mechanical stimulus. Moreover, depletion of PIP<sub>2</sub> has also been shown to influence single channel conductance and both Ca<sup>2+</sup> permeability and blockade of the channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Effertz et al., 2017</xref>), suggesting an intimate connection between this membrane lipid and the process of ion permeation. It has also been proposed that the influence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> on the resting open probability of the MET channel is due to interactions of the divalent ion with membrane lipids rather than with a Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding site on proteins in the MET complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Peng et al., 2016</xref>). It will be interesting to use our models of TMC1 to investigate structural interactions between proteins in the MET channel complex, to explore the unique properties of its ion permeation pathway and the role of membrane lipids in hair cell mechanotransduction.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Structural template search</title><p>To obtain possible structural templates to build a 3D model of mTMC1 we used two strategies.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Baron Chanda as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Senior Editor.</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>In this study, the authors develop a structural model of TMC 1 based on its homology to the TMEM16 proteins. The TMC1 is a multi-transmembrane protein which is thought to be an essential pore-forming subunit of hair cell mechanotransduction complex. Direct evidence that the TMC1 is a channel is lacking because these channels are not expressed in any heterologous system. Thus, despite tremendous interest, these proteins remain recalcitrant to structural and functional analysis. This study gets around these hurdles by building a high-quality homology model of the channel and testing the predictions of this model by sizing the pore of native channels in hair cells. While the reviewers agree that the overall approach is creative, they are not convinced that the sizing experiments with variously sized dextrans are sufficiently specific to discriminate between the authors' model and other existing models. Attached below are the individual reviews, some of which have been amended to reflect the full scope of discussion between the reviewers.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>The vertebrate mechanotransduction channel in inner hair cells converts the mechanical stimulus produced as a result of sound waves into electrical signals. Although the molecular identity of this mechanotransduction channel complex has not been established, recent studies suggest that transmembrane channel-like 1 and 2 proteins are part of the pore-forming subunit of this complex. Bioinformatic studies have previously suggested that the TMC proteins are phylogenetically related to the TMEM16 ion channels, which are a family of calcium-activated chloride channels. In this study, Ballesteros et al. exploited the newly available high-resolution structures of TMEM16 ion channel to build a homology model of the TMC 1 protein. TMEM 16 proteins are known to act as lipid scramblases and therefore it is not surprising that the structural model predicts a large lipid-facing cavity. Unfortunately, it is difficult to test this model directly because TMC1 proteins do not traffic to the cell membrane. A creative attempt to overcome this limitation by creating fusions between TMEM16 and TMC1 also did not result in functional expression. The authors then tested their model by measuring the rate of uptake of fluorescently labeled dextrans in native hair cells. Their studies reveal that the 3KD but not 10 KD dextrans are able to permeate through these channels allowing them to size the permeation pathway.</p><p>This is a timely study and a detailed structural model of the TMC1 has the potential to guide the next set of experiments. However, it is not clear to this reviewer whether the structural link between TMC1 protein and TMEM16 has been established in this study. Based on their modeling, the authors predict that this channel has more transmembrane segments than predicted by others, but this prediction was not specifically tested. Given the challenges of working with this system, I am not sure if this limitation of this study can be overcome. The Dextran experiments are interesting and shed new information about the pore of the mechanotransduction channel, but they do not conclusively establish that the TMC1 protein is structurally related to TMEM16. I wonder if the authors can use more specific tests such as measuring the lipid scramblase activity to establish a more specific functional link between TMC1 and TMEM16.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>This interesting and thought provoking manuscript Ballestreros and colleagues investigate the structural relationship between the TMC1 channel and the TMEM16 proteins. The TMC1 channel plays a key role in mechanotransduction, allowing these cells to transform sound waves in electrical signals. While the role of this channel in physiology is well established, our mechanistic understanding is more limited since attempts to heterologously express it have been unsuccessful so far. The authors build a homology model of the channel based on its reported similarity to the nhTMEM16 scramblase and to the TMEM16A channel. This model suggests that this protein forms a wide, membrane-exposed hydrophilic cavity, which they propose serves as the ion permeation pathway. To test this hypothesis the authors show that hair cells are able to uptake large molecules, such as 3 kDa dextrans, in a manner that is dependent upon the activity of the TMC1 and 2 channels.</p><p>Overall, this is an interesting manuscript that addresses an important question. Their structural model is intriguing and thought provoking. However, while the manuscript has merits, the intrinsic limitations of the experimental system prevent the authors from rigorously testing their proposed model. The dextran permeation experiments are evocative, but not a definitive proof of their model. The authors cannot rule out that permeation occurs via other channels in the hair cells; heterologous expression of TMEM16A/TMC1 chimeras fail to traffic to the plasma membrane preventing structure-function studies or experiments aimed at determining the topology of the channel.</p><p>In addition to these concerns, I have a few concerns:</p><p>1) TMC1 is highly cation selective and discriminates between mono- and divalent cations. Such a selectivity profile is difficult to reconcile with the hypothesis that these ions are permeating through a pathway that is wide enough to accommodate 3kDa dextrans and is partly lipid lined. Indeed, the TMEM16 scramblases that also function as ion channels are poorly selective and do not discriminate between anions and cations. I wonder if one of the two models built using the TMEM16A channel serve as a better template to think of TMC1 as an ion channel. Indeed, the dextran uptake observed here is slow. This could suggest that TMC1 visits a dextran-permissive conformation only rarely, or that it allows dextran to go through very slowly. This should be discussed.</p><p>2) A second, and related, point is that most of the human deafness missense mutations cluster to the periphery of the pathway, and only one (at least only one that I could see in Figure 4) inside the pathway. The authors could analyze their model 2 (based on the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-bound TMEM16A structure) concerning the placement of the human mutations and see if a higher fraction would face the inside of the pore. This possibility should be discussed.</p><p>3) The authors should compare their models to previously published ones, based on other proposed topologies and score them quantitatively.</p><p>4) I am somewhat confused by the data in Figure 4—figure supplement 2. In cells expressing TMEM16A and the TMEM16A/TMC1 chimeras the distribution of F-actin changes quite dramatically. For example, in the top panel there is a single sharp peak corresponding to the plasma membrane, whereas in the third panel from the top there are two peaks. Does this mean that the authors are measuring across multiple plasma membranes? The placement of the white reference bar would suggest otherwise. More generally, the F-actin distribution in all panels is significantly broader compared to the top panel. What does this imply?</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>The multi-transmembrane protein TMC1 is important for hair cell mechanotransduction and has been proposed to be the pore-forming subunit of the channel. However, direct evidence is missing that TMC1 is an ion channel because it has not been possible to express TMC1 at the surface of cells to characterize its properties. While TMC1 can be localized to stereocilia of hair cells, it remains in the ER in heterologous cells. The authors now generated structural models of TMC1 based on structural information available for the TMEM16, a calcium activated chloride channel. While there is no substantial sequence homology between the two proteins, the authors argue that their predicted hydrophobicity profile is similar thus justifying homology modelling. The models predict that TMC1 has 10 transmembrane domains and a relative large cavity that could serve as an ion permeation pathway. The authors also show that hair cells can take up 3 kDa dextran and that this uptake is blocked when mechanotransduction channels are blocked or in mice with mutations in TMC1/2. The authors take this as support for their structural model, which predicts a relatively large pore for the channel.</p><p>While this paper begins to investigate intriguing similarities between TMC and TMEM16 proteins, the findings remain speculative. It has also been suggested before that TMC proteins might be channels with a relatively large permeation pathway. Others have already suggested that TMC proteins might have similarities to TMEM16 (Hahn, 2009; Medrano-Soto, 2018). The experimental data in the manuscript are not directly related to the structural predictions.</p><p>Specific comments:</p><p>1) The model of the authors is low-resolution and predicts a 10 TM domain topography, which is different from the reported 6TM domain structure that was based on experimental data (Labay and Griffith, 2010) or the 8 TM structure that has been proposed by others. Without experimental validation, the 10TM domain remains an interesting idea but has now strong experimental foundation. Membrane topography could be mapped by expressing epitope tagged molecules in hair cells. This is admittedly a very difficult experiment but ultimately necessary to establish protein topography (or to achieve expression in a heterologous system).</p><p>2) Efforts by the authors to experimentally verify the model have unfortunately not met with success. They generated chimera between TMC1 and TMEM16 that remained in the ER. Thus, the paper is lacking sufficient experimental context to validate the significance of the proposed structural similarities between TMEM16 and TMC proteins.</p><p>3) The observation that 3 kDa dextran may enter hair cells through the transduction channel does not establish a structural link between TMC1 and TMEM16. It is already established that the pore of the hair cell mechanotransduction channel is large, and that permeation through the pore depends upon TMC1/2 proteins and intact tip links. A variety of large compounds have been shown to permeate the hair cells transduction channel. Far more detailed studies on the uptake and effects of conditions that change channel properties would be important to investigate dextran uptake (e.g. how is uptake affected by changes in internal and external Ca<sup>2+</sup> that affect gating properties of the transduction channel) (see Farris and Ricci, 2014). Even if these experiments are performed, it is hard to link the results to a particular molecule because the compound does not have specific characteristics that would tell about the specific protein that lines the pore.</p><p>4) There is some concern that the data do not directly show that the dextran compound penetrates through the channel. Uptake takes 2 hours, which is a very slow time frame. Other large compounds that go through the channel such as FM143 enter in 10-20 seconds. The cells take up more compound during an extended time period through endocytosis. Breaking transduction channels or tip links does not directly address whether the compound goes through the channel. Studies from the Fettiplace lab have shown that when you inactivate transduction channels, a &quot;reverse polarity channel&quot; become activated in hair cells, which could also be permeant for the dye.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38433.039</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the first round of peer review follow.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in eLife.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for overseeing the review of our recent submission to <italic>eLife</italic> on the structural relationship between TMC and TMEM16 proteins. We have carefully gone through the reviews comments and would like to appeal the decision. We appreciate that the focus of our work lies at the interface between different communities and that it may not be straightforward for everyone to appreciate the contribution of our study. In the following we respond to each of the points raised by reviewers, and outline areas where we have revised the manuscript to address the reviewer’s comments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In this study, the authors develop a structural model of TMC 1 based on its homology to the TMEM16 proteins. The TMC1 is a multi-transmembrane protein which is thought to be an essential pore-forming subunit of hair cell mechanotransduction complex. Direct evidence that the TMC1 is a channel is lacking because these channels are not expressed in any heterologous system. Thus, despite tremendous interest, these proteins remain recalcitrant to structural and functional analysis. This study gets around these hurdles by building a high-quality homology model of the channel and testing the predictions of this model by sizing the pore of native channels in hair cells. While the reviewers agree that the overall approach is creative, they are not convinced that the sizing experiments with variously sized dextrans are sufficiently specific to discriminate between the authors' model and other existing models. Attached below are the individual reviews, some of which have been amended to reflect the full scope of discussion between the reviewers.</p></disp-quote><p>We believe the core reason for rejecting our manuscript is based on a misunderstanding of what our modelling provides. This work started in our lab over three years ago when we undertook an HHpred search of structural databases to see if any proteins of known structure exist that are related to the TMC proteins. The E-values, sequence coverage, and other results obtained from those HHpred searches shown in Figure 1—figure supplement 1 reveal that the TMC proteins are highly likely to be related to TMEM16 proteins. We then analyzed the hydrophobicity profiles (Figure 1), which clearly show that the membrane spanning architecture of TMC matches that of the known structure of the TMEM16 proteins. The purpose of the model was to further interrogate the relationship to see if homology models of TMC based on the three available TMEM16 structures could be built that could then withstand structural interrogation using ProQM, a powerful computational tool used for evaluating the quality of structural membrane protein models. That analysis shown in Figure 2 and Figure 2—figure supplement 2 reveals that the three models score almost as high as the structures on which they are built, providing additional confidence in the prediction that the fold of the TMC and TMEM16 proteins are remarkably similar throughout the entirely of the transmembrane region and some N- and C- terminal helices. Although there are many specific features of our models that would be exciting to experimentally test if that were possible (Is the cavity open to the membrane? Do other subunits contribute to the permeation pathway?), that the folds of TMC and TMEM16 proteins are similar is a solid conclusion of our work. We also note that the only two autosomal dominant hearing loss mutations identified to date are located inside the cavity in our models (see below), suggesting that the cavity plays an important role in TMC function. Moreover, electrophysiology data showing that one of these mutations affects MET channel single channel conductance suggests that this residue contributes to forming the permeation pathway and agreeing with its localization in our model.</p><p>We were surprised that the reviewers have requested a detailed comparison between our model and the previously published topology models of TMC proteins. From reading the comments we wonder whether there is confusion about the nature of those previous models. They are simply models for the transmembrane topology of TMC proteins (not an attempt to deduce the fold, as is the case in our model) that are based largely on transmembrane prediction programs and having been published as speculation, or in one case accompanied by biochemical experiments on proteins that were retained in the ER. Although we are concerned about the extent to which ER-retained proteins may be misfolded, that data are largely consistent with our model, it’s just that they are also consistent with many other models too.</p><p>We would also like to comment on the two related publications proposing a relationship between TMC and TMEM16 proteins. The first published in 2009 shows a partial sequence alignment that suggests the proteins may be related. The second was published in March of 2018 while we were preparing our manuscript for submission to <italic>eLife</italic>. That work uses bioinformatic tools to provide further support for a relationship between the TMC and TMEM16 proteins, but the focus of that work is characterizing the TMEM16 superfamily and they do not computationally explore the relationship to derive strong conclusions. We openly cite these studies in our introduction and give the authors credit for providing evidence of a relationship, but we feel that our work is more extensive and allows much stronger conclusions to be drawn. We would also hope that the <italic>eLife</italic> no-scoop policy would influence the extent to which the most recent publication could be viewed as lowering the novelty or impact of our work.</p><p>Establishing that the fold of TMC and TMEM16 proteins are very similar is important because it helps to explain a range of observations that have not been previously discussed in a structural context, including the very large single channel conductance of the MET channel, its permeability to relatively large molecules, including Texas Red-labeled aminoglycosides, and to the influence of PIP2 on both the gating and permeation properties of the MET channel. In the second part of our manuscript we tested whether even larger fluorescently-labeled dextrans could permeate hair cells, as might be expected based on the unusual predicted permeation pathway. The extensive results shown in Figure 5, Figure 6, Figure 7, Figure 8 and Figure 9 (with supplements) clearly establishes that 3kDa Texas Red dextrans can permeate hair cells and that this requires TMC1/TMC2 proteins as well as functional MET channels. We appreciate that these experiments are necessarily indirect and do not allow us to conclude that dextrans directly permeate the TMC proteins. However, our results rule out endocytosis as the mechanism for the diffuse uptake that we see, and we have used cautious language throughout the manuscript to reflect the indirect nature of our permeation experiments.</p><p>Collectively, we think that our work establishing a relationship between TMC and TMEM16 proteins is a significant breakthrough for the MET channel field and that it will provide the stimulus for a lot of important work in other laboratories.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>[…] This is a timely study and a detailed structural model of the TMC1 has the potential to guide the next set of experiments.

We also believe that the results in the Labay and Griffith paper are largely consistent with our model. Briefly, their results localizing HA epitopes to the cytosol or ER lumen agree with our model for five of the seven positions studied. One HA epitope tag was inserted into TM4 and would be expected to cause radical structural distortions. Only one of their epitopes (between TM5 and TM6) gave results that are seemingly inconsistent with our model.

However, as we point out in the discussion, with think the kinetics of uptake for FM1-43, TR-aminoglycosides and TR-dextran vary as would be expected based on their size if all three permeate the MET channel. To provide more information on the kinetics of TR-dextran uptake, we have examined the time course more carefully and show uptake of dextran as early as 60 minutes. We have included an additional Figure5—figure supplement 1 containing this information.</p><p>We found this reviewer’s comments about the reverse polarity current seen in the TMC1/2 dKO confusing. The calcium selective Piezo2 channel has been suggested to give rise to this reverse polarity current (Beurg and Fettiplace, 2017), but Piezo has a very small pore and could not conceivably be involved in dextran uptake. Moreover, dextran uptake is ablated under conditions where the reverse polarity current is seen.</p><p>The comment about endocytosis is also confusing. We provide direct evidence that endocytosis is not responsible for the diffuse uptake observed with 3kDa dextran. We also provide clear evidence that both 3kDa and 10kDa dextrans can be taken up into small vesicle like structures, clearly showing that we can distinguish endocytic events from the more diffuse pattern of uptake only seen with the 3kDa dextran that requires functional MET channels and TMC1/2 proteins.</p></body></sub-article></article>
