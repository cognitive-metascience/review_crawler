prone to drug addiction, but the underlying biological basis of their increased vulnerability remains unknown. We reveal that translational control by phosphorylation of the translation initiation factor eIF2α (p-eIF2α) accounts for adolescent hypersensitivity to cocaine. In adolescent (but not adult) mice, a low dose of cocaine reduced p-eIF2α in the ventral tegmental area (VTA), potentiated synaptic inputs to VTA dopaminergic neurons, and induced drug-reinforced behavior. Like adolescents, adult mice with reduced p-eIF2α-mediated translational control were more susceptible to cocaine-induced synaptic potentiation and behavior. Conversely, like adults, adolescent mice with increased p-eIF2α became more resistant to cocaine's effects. Accordingly, metabotropic glutamate receptor-mediated long-term depression (mGluR-LTD)—whose disruption is postulated to increase vulnerability to drug addiction—was impaired in both adolescent mice and adult mice with reduced p-eIF2α mediated translation. Thus, during addiction, cocaine hijacks translational control by p-eIF2α, initiating synaptic potentiation and addiction-related behaviors. These insights may hold promise for new treatments for addiction.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.12052.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.12052.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12052.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Drug addiction a is major mental health problem that presents a huge financial, social and legal burden worldwide. Adolescents are notoriously prone to drug abuse and addicts typically begin using drugs at a young age. However, an explanation for why young people are particularly vulnerable to the effects of addictive substances remains elusive.</p><p>Addictive drugs change how the brain works, in particular by strengthening the connections (synapses) between brain cells (neurons) and making it easier for neurons to communicate with each other. Such strengthening of synaptic connections, which can be observed when the activity of the neurons is recorded with microelectrodes, relies on new proteins being made in the brain. Since adolescents have a greater capacity than adults to make new proteins, Huang et al. hypothesized that changes in synaptic strength might occur more easily in the brain of adolescents, explaining why they are more likely to become addicted to drugs than adults.</p><p>A protein called eIF2α plays a key role in regulating the production of new proteins. Huang et al. discovered that reduced eIF2α activity accounts for why adolescents are particularly vulnerable to the synaptic and behavioral effects of cocaine. Giving adolescent mice a low dose of cocaine reduced the activity of eIF2α, caused an increase in the strength of synaptic connections in a part of the brain that processes pleasurable feelings, and promoted drug-reinforced behavior. This did not occur in adult mice.</p><p>Reducing the activity of eIF2α using either genetics or pharmacological methods caused adult mice to become as vulnerable as adolescents to cocaine-induced changes in synaptic strength and addiction-related behavior. Conversely, increasing the activity of eIF2α made adolescent mice more resistant to cocaine’s effects; in other words, adolescents responded to cocaine more like adults.</p><p>Huang et al. also found that other drugs of abuse, including alcohol, methamphetamine and nicotine, all reduce eIF2α activity, suggesting that eIF2α is a common target of different drugs of abuse. In a related study, Placzek et al. investigated the role of eIF2α in nicotine addiction in mice and humans.</p><p>These findings raise several intriguing questions. How do cocaine and other drugs of abuse reduce eIF2α activity? Could variations in the activity of eIF2α or other components of the eIF2α pathway in the brain explain why some people are more likely to abuse drugs? Finally, could compounds that regulate the activity of eIF2α be useful for treating addiction?</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.12052.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.12052.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>ventral tegemental area</kwd><kwd>long-term potentiation (LTP)</kwd><kwd>long-term depression (LTD)</kwd><kwd>protein synthesis</kwd><kwd>cocaine</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Costa-Mattioli</surname><given-names>Mauro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dani</surname><given-names>John A</given-names></name><name><surname>Costa-Mattioli</surname><given-names>Mauro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Walter</surname><given-names>Peter</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000026</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Drug Abuse</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dani</surname><given-names>John A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Vulnerability to cocaine addiction during adolescence depends on translational control.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In humans, adolescence is a period of heightened susceptibility to drug addiction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chambers et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kandel et al., 1992</xref>).

Converging evidence supports the notion that addictive drugs hijack the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying long-term changes in synaptic strength in the mesocorticolimbic dopamine (DA) system (including the ventral tegmental area (VTA), a key brain reward area implicated in the development of addiction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kauer, 2004</xref>)) in a way that reinforces drug-seeking behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bowers et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kauer and Malenka, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hyman et al., 2006</xref>). Addiction has both initiation and maintenance phases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lüscher and Malenka, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wise and Koob, 2014</xref>). Here we focus on the molecular mechanisms underpinning the initial neuronal circuit adaptations caused by addictive drugs because they represent important targets for therapeutic interventions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lüscher and Malenka, 2011</xref>) and are thought to contribute to the development of drug addiction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lüscher and Malenka, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kauer and Malenka, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kalivas et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lammel et al., 2014</xref>). For instance, drugs of abuse (including cocaine, amphetamine, nicotine, ethanol, and morphine) <italic>all</italic> induce long-term potentiation (LTP) of excitatory synapses on VTA DA neurons that lasts for several days after exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bowers et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lammel et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ungless et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Saal et al., 2003</xref>). This LTP, resulting from the insertion of α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors (AMPARs) in the postsynaptic membrane, is measured by recording glutamatergic synaptic currents (EPSCs) at positive holding potentials, and is manifested as an increase in the AMPAR/<italic>N</italic>-methyl D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) ratio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ungless et al., 2001</xref>). Furthermore, metabotropic glutamate receptor-mediated long-term depression (mGluR-LTD), resulting from the removal of postsynaptic AMPARs, blocks cocaine-induced LTP in VTA DA neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bellone and Lüscher, 2006</xref>). Thus, it has been postulated that impaired mGluR-LTD increases vulnerability to drugs of abuse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bellone and Lüscher, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lüscher and Huber, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Loweth et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>In VTA DA neurons, protein synthesis is required for cocaine-induced LTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Argilli et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Yuan et al., 2013</xref>) and mGluR-LTD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mameli et al., 2007</xref>). In addition, protein synthesis is also required for cocaine-induced behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sorg and Ulibarri, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kuo et al., 2007</xref>). Protein synthesis encompasses three steps: initiation, elongation, and termination. Initiation is the rate limiting step and a major target for translational control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sonenberg and Hinnebusch, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Buffington et al., 2014</xref>). There are two main mechanisms by which translation initiation is controlled. The first is by regulation of the eIF4F complex <italic>via</italic> the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1). The second mechanism is by regulating ternary complex formation <italic>via</italic> phosphorylation of the translation initiation factor eIF2α. Phosphorylation of eIF2α blocks general translation, but also results in translational up-regulation of a small subset of select mRNAs that contain upstream open reading frames (uORFs) in their 5’ untranslated region (5’UTR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sonenberg and Hinnebusch, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Buffington et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Here we report a new mechanism underlying adolescent hypersensitivity to the synaptic and behavioral effects of cocaine. In particular, we show that drugs of abuse selectively hijack the translational program controlled by phosphorylation of eIF2α in the VTA, thus potentiating synaptic inputs to VTA DA neurons and drug-induced behaviors.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Adolescent mice are more susceptible to cocaine-evoked LTP and behavior</title><p>To examine the nature of the adolescent hypersensitivity to drugs of abuse, we first studied cocaine-induced LTP in the VTA. To this end, we recorded glutamate-mediated excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) from VTA dopaminergic (DA) neurons in midbrain slices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) from adolescent (5 weeks old) and adult (3-5 months old) mice 24 hr after a single intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of saline or cocaine (1–20 mg/kg; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). We used the peak amplitudes (at +40 mV) of the AMPAR and NMDAR-mediated components of the EPSCs (isolated as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ungless et al., 2001</xref>) and Methods) to calculate the AMPAR/NMDAR ratio, an index of the efficacy of synaptic transmission mediated by AMPARs. In adolescent ) mice, a relatively low dose of cocaine (5 mg/kg i.p.) elicited LTP, manifested by an increase in the AMPAR/NMDAR ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).

In this task, mice were first presented with either cocaine or saline in different environments. The amount of time spent in the environment previously associated with cocaine versus saline was subsequently recorded. Strikingly, we found that enhanced LTP in the VTA was mirrored in the behavior of adolescent mice: low doses of cocaine (5 mg/kg) elicited CPP only in adolescents, but not in adult mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). Further mirroring the LTP results, higher doses of cocaine (10 mg/kg) were required to induce CPP in adult mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>).

Changes in gene expression in key reward areas have been shown to play a critical role in drug-induced changes in synaptic potentiation and reward-related behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hyman et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Robison and Nestler, 2011</xref>).

Our focus on translational control was based on several key observations. Compared to the brains of adolescent mice—which are more vulnerable to drugs of abuse—protein synthesis is reduced in the brains of adult mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Vargas and Castaneda, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hovda et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sun et al., 1995</xref>). Furthermore, translational control of gene expression is the ultimate step in the functional output of gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sonenberg and Hinnebusch, 2009</xref>) and neurons could regulate protein synthesis without altering mRNA synthesis or transport, allowing for local control of protein synthesis at synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Holt and Schuman, 2013</xref>). Moreover, protein synthesis is required for cocaine-evoked LTP in VTA DA neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Argilli et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Yuan et al., 2013</xref>), as well as cocaine-induced behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sorg and Ulibarri, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kuo et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Our findings reveal a critical role for p-eIF2α-mediated translational control in the heightened susceptibility of adolescent mice to the initial synaptic and behavioral adaptations induced by cocaine. In adolescent, but not in adult mice, a low dose of cocaine selectively lowers eIF2α phosphorylation in the VTA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a–b</xref>), thereby eliciting LTP and drug-induced behavior. It is noteworthy that we could not detect a significant difference in the baseline phosphorylation of eIF2α between adolescent and adult mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). While the precise mechanism by which drugs of abuse lower phosphorylation of eIF2α in the VTA is currently under investigation, we hypothesize that drugs of abuse either inhibit the activity and/or expression of one of the eIF2α kinases or stimulate the activity of eIF2α phosphatases to lower p-eIF2α levels in the VTA. We suspect that adolescents are more prone to either (or both) of these processes. Genetic reduction of eIF2α phosphorylation or pharmacologically blunting its effects with ISRIB in adult mice enhances susceptibility to cocaine, mimicking the increased vulnerability of adolescent animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). By contrast, a local increase in p-eIF2α in the VTA blocked cocaine-evoked LTP and cocaine-induced behavior in adolescent mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). These effects converge on p-eIF2α–mediated translation of OPHN1, which is selectively synthesized in neurons under conditions where eIF2α is phosphorylated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Di Prisco et al., 2014</xref>) and leads to endocytic down-regulation of post-synaptic AMPARs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Nadif Kasri et al., 2011</xref>). Collectively, our data indicate that reduced p-eIF2α-mediated translation of <italic>Ophn1</italic> mRNA accounts for the adolescent hypersensitivity to cocaine.</p><p>Is p-eIF2α-mediated mGluR-LTD in VTA a defense mechanism that limits the early synaptic adaptations required for the initiation of addiction? A delicate interplay between LTP and mGluR-LTD in VTA DA neurons is believed to modulate cocaine’s synaptic and behavioral effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Loweth et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Luscher, 2013</xref>). Cocaine induces LTP at VTA DA synapses by inserting new AMPARs into the postsynaptic membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ungless et al., 2001</xref>). This process is reversed either by pharmacological or synaptic induction of mGluR-LTD in VTA by removing AMPARs from the post-synaptic DA neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bellone and Lüscher, 2006</xref>). Conversely, reduced mGluR-LTD in the midbrain is postulated to enhance vulnerability to drug addiction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lüscher and Huber, 2010</xref>). Our data provide the first compelling mechanistic evidence that p-eIF2α-mediated translational control of OPHN1 synthesis is a key mechanism underlying the reversal of cocaine-evoked LTP by mGluR-LTD. Thus, our findings provide a unifying model that explains how the two opposing forms of plasticity (cocaine-induced LTP and mGluR-LTD) are regulated by a single translational control mechanism.</p><p>Given that blocking mGluR function in the VTA renders cocaine-evoked LTP more long-lasting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mameli et al., 2009</xref>), it will be interesting to determine whether decreasing p-eIF2α also leads to a persistent LTP in the VTA. These drug-induced persistent changes on excitatory afferents onto dopamine neurons in the VTA are particularly relevant since they may represent the cellular processes driving the progression from recreational use to chronic drug seeking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2008</xref>). In addition, eIF2α phosphorylation may also be required for subsequent synaptic adaptation in other mesolimbic reward areas, such as the NAc, in response to chronic exposure to cocaine or after withdrawal.</p><p>The identification of a single common downstream mechanism of action of different drugs of abuse has been challenging. It is therefore significant that drugs of abuse that act on distinct receptors (cocaine, methamphetamine, nicotine and ethanol), and induce LTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bowers et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lüscher and Malenka, 2011</xref>) in VTA DA neurons, all reduce p-eIF2α in the VTA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Taken together with our findings that reduced p-eIF2α-mediated translational control increases the susceptibility of adolescent mice to cocaine, these observations raise an intriguing possibility that polymorphisms in the eIF2α signaling pathway could be associated with drug use in humans. Indeed, in an accompanying paper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Placzek et al., 2016</xref>), we provide evidence that eIF2α phosphorylation also controls adolescent hypersensitivity to nicotine-evoked synaptic potentiation and identify a polymorphism in the promoter of the <italic>Eif2s1</italic> gene (encoding eIF2α) that is associated with changes in reward-related activity in human smokers, as measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging. Thus, since eIF2α phosphorylation is reduced by a variety of addictive drugs, agents that selectively alter eIF2α phosphorylation-mediated translational control in key reward areas in the brain could be useful for the treatment of a broad range of addictive behaviors.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p>All experiments were conducted using male and female mice from the C57Bl/6 background. <italic>Eif2s1<sup>S/A</sup> and Eif2s1<sup>A/A</sup></italic>;ftg mice were previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Di Prisco et al., 2014</xref>).

Samples were collected in pre-chilled microcentrifuge tubes and lysed in homogenizing buffer [200 mM HEPES, 50 mM NaCl, 10% Glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mM EDTA, 50 mM NaF, 2 mM Na<sub>3</sub>VO<sub>4</sub>, 25 mM β-glycerophosphate, and EDTA-free complete ULTRA tablets (Roche, Indianapolis, IN)]. Western blotting was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Huang et al., 2013</xref>). Primary antibodies for Western blotting were rabbit anti-p-eIF2α (Ser51) (1:1000, Cell Signaling Technology Laboratories, Danver, MA), mouse anti-total eIF2α (1:1000, Cell Signaling Technology Laboratories, Danver, MA), and mouse anti-β-actin (1:10,000, EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Statistical Analyses</title><p>All data are presented as mean ± s.e.m. Statistical analyses were performed using SigmaPlot (Systat Software). Data distribution normality and homogeneity of variance were assessed using the Shapiro-Wilk and Levene tests, respectively. The statistics were based on the two-sided Student’s t test, or one- or two-way ANOVA with Tukey’s HSD (or HSD for unequal sample sizes where appropriate) to correct for multiple <italic>post hoc</italic> comparisons. Within-groups variation is indicated by standard errors of the mean of each distribution, which are depicted in the graphs as error bars. <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05 was considered significant (*<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05, **<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.01, ***<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001, ****<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.0001).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Hongyi Zhou for assisting in the maintenance of mouse colony and members of the Costa-Mattioli laboratory for comments on the paper.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission</p><p>The reviewers like your work and although they thought that some additional experiments may strengthen the study, as per <italic>eLife</italic> policy, they decided that your study should be acceptable without further experiments. We would ask if some parts that are not addressed in this study (like the existence of additional unspecified mechanism that allows low dose cocaine to decrease levels of p-eIF2α in adolescents but not adults) could be discussed in the final version. The full comments of both reviewers are posted below for your general guidance in preparing a final version of the paper.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>This very well written manuscript reports novel animal model studies and highly mechanistic evidence that identifies eIF2α as a major player in cocaine's effects in the ventral tegmental area, and more importantly, identifies this molecule and translation control as a key reason for why adolescents are especially sensitive to cocaine. Importantly, the authors go well beyond implicating eIF2α-dependent translation, and go on to identify a likely target (OPHN1), the cellular mechanisms involved (in vivo and slice synaptic plasticity studies of LTP/LTD), the key brain region involved (VTA) and compelling behavioral data with a number of impressive rescuing experiments that turn the cocaine susceptibility from adults to adolescents and vice versa. This is by far one of the very best papers I have read this year, and the implications of these results are considerable, since the findings seem to apply to not only cocaine but also to other abused substances (methamphetamine, nicotine, and ethanol). Impressively, in a companion paper the authors report evidence (allelic variability) that this mechanism may be at play in human populations.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This is a potentially interesting manuscript, from an excellent cadre of investigators, that ultimately suggests that adults may be less susceptible to addiction because adults don't respond as much to low doses of cocaine. In general, the manuscript attempts to demonstrate Eif2a's role in addiction, but makes a stronger case for its role in gating acute drug-induced VTA DA plasticity. This manuscript has bits of important data, but needs more experiments in order to become a seamless, outstanding story.</p><p>Comments:</p><p>Are baseline levels of p-eIF2α different in adolescent compared to adult mice? is the baseline ratio of p-eIF2α/total eIF2α different in adolescent compared to adult mice? If the authors wish to argue that low abundance of p-eIF2α is a permissive factor for induction of cocaine plasticity, and that this is a critical factor in the lower threshold for cocaine plasticity in adolescents, this seems like a critical experiment.</p><p>The authors make a case that increased translation of OPHN1 downstream of increased levels of p-eIF2α is what supports mGluR-LTD in adults and blocks/counteracts cocaine LTP in VTA DA neurons. Are baseline levels of OPHN1 lower in adolescent compared to adult mice? If one overexpresses OPHN1 in adolescent VTA DA neurons, would you get effective mGluR-LTD and block the ability of low dose cocaine to induce LTP/CPP?</p><p>Bottom line: the link between Eif2α and mGluR LTD would benefit from more work, beyond simply referencing previous publications.</p><p>There also seems to be some circular logic here – the authors have a lot of experiments to show that preexisting lower levels of p-eIF2α (or OPHN1) are the permissive factor that allows low dose cocaine to induce LTP / CPP, and the reason that they offer for why adolescents are more susceptible to drugs is that low dose cocaine can lead to reductions in p-eIF2α in adolescent but not adult VTA. Therefore, there must be some additional unspecified mechanism that allows low dose cocaine to decrease levels of p-eIF2α in adolescents but not adults.</p><p>What is it that determines why low dose of cocaine (or nicotine, or methamphetamine, or ethanol) can change the p-eIF2α/total eIF2α ratio in adolescent but not adult mice? In the absence of data for the above two bullet points (showing that there are preexisting lower levels of p-eIF2α / OPHN1 in adolescent mice), it would seem that this additional unspecified factor is what renders adolescents more vulnerable to cocaine plasticity, not translational control by p-eIF2α.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12052.019</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>In response to the editor’s request, we have addressed the points raised by reviewer #2 in the Discussion section of the revised manuscript.
