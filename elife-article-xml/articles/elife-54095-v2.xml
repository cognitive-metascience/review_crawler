in cancer patients that occur prior to initiation of cancer therapy. Inflammation in the brain is a driver of these symptoms, yet cellular sources of neuroinflammation during malignancy are unknown. In a mouse model of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), we observed early and robust myeloid cell infiltration into the brain. Infiltrating immune cells were predominately neutrophils, which accumulated at a unique central nervous system entry portal called the velum interpositum, where they expressed CCR2. Pharmacologic CCR2 blockade and genetic deletion of <italic>Ccr2</italic> both resulted in significantly decreased brain-infiltrating myeloid cells as well as attenuated cachexia during PDAC. Lastly, intracerebroventricular blockade of the purinergic receptor P2RX7 during PDAC abolished immune cell recruitment to the brain and attenuated anorexia. Our data demonstrate a novel function for the CCR2/CCL2 axis in recruiting neutrophils to the brain, which drives anorexia and muscle catabolism.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Weight loss, decreased appetite and fatigue are symptoms of a wasting disorder known as cachexia, which is common in several serious diseases such as AIDS, chronic lung disease and heart failure. Up to 80 percent of people with advanced cancer also develop cachexia, and there are no effective treatments.</p><p>It is not known how cachexia develops, but symptoms like appetite loss and fatigue are controlled by the brain. One theory is that the brain may be responding to a malfunctioning immune response that causes inflammation. While the brain was thought to be protected from this, new research has shown that it is possible for cells from the immune system to reach the brain in some conditions. To find out if this also happens in cancer, Burfeind et al. studied mice that had been implanted with pancreatic cancer cells and were showing signs of cachexia.</p><p>Samples from the mice’s brains showed that immune cells known as neutrophils were present and active. A protein known as CCR2 was found in higher levels in the brains of these mice. This protein is involved in the movement of neutrophil cells through the body. To see what effect this protein had, Burfeind et al. gave the mice a drug that blocks CCR2. This prevented the neutrophils from entering the brain and reduced the symptoms of cachexia in the mice.</p><p>To further confirm the role of CCR2, the mice were genetically modified so that they could not produce the protein. This reduced the number of neutrophils seen in the brain but not in the rest of the body. This suggests that a drug targeting CCR2 could help to reduce the symptoms of cachexia, without disrupting the normal immune response away from the brain. This approach would still need to be tested in clinical trials before it is possible to know how effective it might be in humans.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cachexia</kwd><kwd>neuroimmunology</kwd><kwd>neutrophils</kwd><kwd>brain</kwd><kwd>pancreatic cancer</kwd><kwd>myeloid cells</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01CA184324-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Marks</surname><given-names>Daniel L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01CA217989-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Marks</surname><given-names>Daniel L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006668</institution-id><institution>Oregon Health and Science University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Brenden-Colson Center for Pancreatic Care</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Marks</surname><given-names>Daniel L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5F30CA213745</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Burfeind</surname><given-names>Kevin Glenn</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Circulating myeloid cells invade the brain during pancreatic cancer, where they accumulate at a unique central nervous system interface and drive anorexia and muscle catabolism.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cancer patients commonly present with symptoms driven by disruption of normal CNS function. Weight loss, weakness, fatigue, and cognitive decline often occur in malignancies outside the CNS, and develop prior to initiation of cancer therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Meyers, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Miller et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Olson and Marks, 2019</xref>). Many of these symptoms are part of a syndrome called cachexia, a devastating state of malnutrition characterized by decreased appetite, fatigue, adipose tissue loss, and muscle catabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fearon et al., 2011</xref>). There are currently no effective treatments for cachexia or other CNS-mediated cancer symptoms. While mechanisms of CNS dysfunction during malignancy are still not well understood, inflammation in the brain is proposed as a key driver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Burfeind et al., 2016</xref>). Inflammatory molecules (e.g. lipopolysaccharide, cytokines) can cause dysfunction of the appetite-, cognition-, weight-, and activity-regulating regions in the CNS, resulting in signs and symptoms nearly identical to those observed during cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Braun et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Burfeind et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Grossberg et al., 2011</xref>). Moreover, cytokines and chemokines are produced in these same regions during multiple types of cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Braun et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Michaelis et al., 2017</xref>). Our lab and others previously showed that disrupting inflammatory signaling by deleting either MyD88 or TRIF attenuates anorexia, muscle catabolism, fatigue, and neuroinflammation during malignancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Burfeind et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ruud et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zhu et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>The mechanisms by which inflammation generated in the periphery (e.g. at the site of a malignancy) is translated into inflammation in the brain, and how this is subsequently translated CNS dysfunction, are still not known. Circulating immune cells present an intriguing cellular candidate, as they are thought to infiltrate and interact with the brain during various states of inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Prinz and Priller, 2017</xref>), yet have not been investigated as potential mediators of brain dysfunction during cancer. We utilized a syngeneic, immunocompetent, mouse model of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), a deadly malignancy associated with profound anorexia, fatigue, weakness, and cognitive dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baekelandt et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Michaelis et al., 2017</xref>). We first demonstrated that the inflammatory transcripts upregulated in the CNS during PDAC consisted largely of chemokines. We then characterized the identity, properties, and function of immune cells in the brain during PDAC. We observed that circulating myeloid cells, primarily neutrophils, were recruited to the CNS early in PDAC, infiltrating throughout the brain parenchyma and accumulating in the meninges near regions important for appetite, behavior, and body composition regulation. We then demonstrated that CCR2 signaling is important for immune cell recruitment to the brain and cachexia during PDAC. Next, we blocked purinergic receptor P2RX7 signaling specifically on brain macrophages during PDAC via intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection of oxidized ATP (oATP), which prevented circulating myeloid cell recruitment to the brain and attenuated anorexia. Taken together, these results reveal a novel mechanism by which neutrophil and other myeloid cells are recruitment to the brain, where they contribute to cachexia symptoms.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Chemokine transcripts are upregulated in the brain in a mouse model of PDAC</title><p>Our lab previously demonstrated that inflammatory cytokine transcripts are upregulated in the hypothalamus in a mouse model of PDAC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Burfeind et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Michaelis et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zhu et al., 2019</xref>). To our knowledge, no studies have investigated whether inflammatory transcripts are upregulated during cachexia in other brain regions important for behavior and metabolism. Therefore, we used qRT-PCR to determine if various inflammatory cytokine or chemokine transcripts were upregulated in the hippocampus, hypothalamus, or area postrema during PDAC. We utilized a mouse model of PDAC, generated through a single intraperitoneal (IP) or orthotopic (OT) injection of C57BL/6 <italic>Kras</italic><sup>G12D</sup> <italic>Tp53</italic><sup>R172H</sup> <italic>Pdx1</italic>-Cre<sup>+/+</sup> (KPC) cells. This well-characterized model recapitulates several key signs and symptoms of CNS dysfunction observed in humans, including anorexia, muscle catabolism, and fatigue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Burfeind et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Michaelis et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Michaelis et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zhu et al., 2019</xref>). We performed qRT-PCR at 10 days post-IP inoculation, a time when animals reliably develop anorexia, muscle catabolism, and decreased locomotor activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Michaelis et al., 2017</xref>). We queried transcripts previously demonstrated to be upregulated in the brain during chronic systemic inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Burfeind et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Grossberg et al., 2010</xref>). In addition, no studies have investigated chemokine expression in the brain during extra-CNS malignancy, so we also queried expression of chemokine transcripts.</p><p>In agreement with our previous studies we observed that <italic>Il-1β</italic> was upregulated in the hypothalamus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). It was also upregulated in the area postrema, and showed a trend toward significance in the hippocampus (p=0.08). However, of the other cytokine transcripts analyzed, only those coding for prostaglandin synthase D2 (<italic>Ptgs2</italic> – in the hypothalamus and area postrema, but not the hippocampus) and IL-1R (<italic>Il1r</italic> - again in the hypothalamus and area postrema, but not the hippocampus) were upregulated. The anti-inflammatory transcript <italic>Il10</italic> was upregulated in the area postrema only. Interestingly, the transcript coding for nitric oxide synthase 2 (<italic>Nos2</italic> – induced during inflammation and mainly expressed by endothelial cells) was downregulated in all three brain regions.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Neuroinflammation in the CNS during PDAC.</title><p>qRT-PCR analysis of cytokine and chemokine transcripts in the hypothalamus, hippocampus, and area postrema in PDAC-bearing animals at 10 d.p.i.

There was no change in number of microglia (defined as CD45<sup>mid</sup>CD11b+) throughout the disease course (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Further phenotypic analysis of infiltrating myeloid cells revealed that by 7 d.p.i., there was an increase in relative number (as a percentage of total CD45+ and CD45<sup>high</sup>) of Ly6C<sup>mid</sup>Ly6G<sup>high</sup> neutrophils, Ly6C<sup>low</sup> myeloid cells, and Ly6C<sup>high</sup> monocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>). We observed an increase in absolute number of neutrophils, Ly6C<sup>high</sup> monocytes, and Ly6C<sup>low</sup> myeloid cells starting at 7 d.p.i., which became significant at either 7 (Ly6C<sup>high</sup> monocytes) or 10 d.p.i. (neutrophils and Ly6C<sup>low</sup> myeloid cells) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D and E</xref>). Neutrophils were by far the most numerous invading myeloid cell type, constituting 34% percent of CD45<sup>high</sup>CD11b+ cells in sham animals, and increasing to nearly 54% by 10.d.p.i. in tumor animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>).</p><p>In order to verify that the population, we defined as ‘microglia’ were actually microglia and also confirm that Ly6G+CD45<sup>high</sup> myeloid cells were neutrophils and not an artifact of nonspecific antibody binding on microglial or other brain macrophages, we performed an additional flow cytometry experiment incorporating CX3CR1 (a marker of macrophages). We observed that 95% of the population we defined as ‘microglia’ expressed CX3CR1, while only 6% of the population we defined as ‘neutrophils’ expressed this protein, confirming the identity of these cells as microglia and neutrophils, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>We considered the population within the gate labeled ‘CD45<sup>high</sup> myeloid cells’ to be mainly infiltrating immune cells. While we drew this gate based on a clearly defined population of the cells (see right panel on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), which we demonstrated consisted mainly of neutrophils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>), it is possible that the population within this gate could also contain activated microglia. Furthermore, the population of CD45<sup>high</sup>CD11b+Ly6C<sup>low</sup> myeloid cells could also be activated microglia. To address these issues, we generated GFP+ bone marrow chimera mice through conditioning WT mice with treosulfan to ablate marrow, then transplanting marrow from pan-GFP mice (Ly5.1<sup>GFP</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A</xref>). This system is advantageous because, unlike other alkylating agents, treosulfan does not cross or disrupt the blood brain barrier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Capotondo et al., 2012</xref>). On average, mice that underwent bone marrow transplant (GFP BMT mice) exhibited 75% chimerism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3C</xref>). In agreement with results from WT marrow animals, we observed that at 10 d.p.i., thousands of GFP+ myeloid cells infiltrated the brain in tumor animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3B and D</xref>). The majority of these cells were neutrophils, with a concurrent increase in Ly6C<sup>high</sup> monocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3C-F</xref>). As we observed previously, this coincided with a decrease in brain lymphocytes (CD45+GFP+CD11b-) in tumor animals (Figure 2—figure supplement 3D). We did not observe an increase in GFP+ Ly6C<sup>low</sup> myeloid cells (Figure 2—figure supplement 3F), suggesting that the increase in CD45<sup>high</sup>CD11b+Ly6C<sup>low</sup> cells in our WT marrow PDAC mice was a result of microglia activation, rather than infiltrating monocytes.</p><p>Taken together, these data show that myeloid cells infiltrate the brain during PDAC, temporally correlating with symptom onset. The majority of infiltrating immune cells were neutrophils. Since the purpose of this study was to investigate infiltrating cells, we chose to focus our subsequent analysis on myeloid cells, with an emphasis on neutrophils.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Invading myeloid cells accumulate at CNS interfaces during PDAC</title><p>Prior studies demonstrated regional vulnerability in the CNS to immune cell invasion during systemic inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">D'Mello et al., 2009</xref>). Therefore, we investigated the anatomic distribution of infiltrating myeloid cells in the CNS during PDAC. We performed immunofluorescence immunohistochemistry analysis at 10 d.p.i. in IP-inoculated animals, since all tumor-inoculated animals reliably developed anorexia, fatigue, and muscle catabolism at this time point, yet were not at terminal stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Michaelis et al., 2017</xref>). In addition, our flow cytometry analysis demonstrated a robust immune cell infiltrate in the brain at 10 d.p.i. For initial analysis, we defined leukocytes as CD45+ globoid cells. Although we observed scattered CD45+ globoid cells within the parenchyma in the cortex and thalamus in tumor mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), we observed a robust increase in leukocytes in the meninges adjacent to the hippocampus and median eminence (ME) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and C</xref>). We also performed quantification in the area postrema, based on our previous experiment demonstrating chemokine transcript upregulation in this region. While there was an increase in overall CD45 immunoreactivity in the area postrema, these cells appeared ramified rather than globoid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), suggesting microglia activation rather than immune cell infiltration. We did not observe any CD45+ cells in the lateral parabrachial nucleus (data not shown), which was implicated in cancer-associated anorexia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Campos et al., 2017</xref>). This was perhaps due to its lack of proximity to a circumventricular organ or meninges. Interestingly, we observed an increase in neutrophils (defined as myeloperoxidase [MPO] positive, CD45+ globoid cells) only in the meninges surrounding the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). This layer of meninges, known as the velum interpositum (VI), is a double-layered invagination of the pia matter. This potential space is closed rostrally, communicates caudally with the quadrigeminal cistern, and is highly vascularized via a number of internal cerebral arterioles and veins. Recent studies demonstrate robust immune cell recruitment into the brain via this anatomical route after mild trauma, during CNS infection, and during CNS autoimmune disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alvarez and Teale, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Schmitt et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Szmydynger-Chodobska et al., 2016</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Infiltrating immune cells accumulate at CNS interfaces during PDAC cachexia.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Picture of sagittal mouse brain section to illustrate different regions analyzed.

This phenomenon was only present in brains of tumor animals and not in brains of sham animals.

This supports previous studies showing that microglia protect the CNS parenchyma from neutrophil invasion during various states of inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Neumann et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Neumann et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Otxoa-de-Amezaga et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>The peripheral origin of the CD45+ globoid cells in the brain was assessed using our GFP BMT mice. Sham BMT mice showed very few GFP+ cells in the brain, including the cortex and thalamus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>), as well as the meninges (data not shown). In contrast, there was a large increase in GFP+ cells in the brains of KPC mice at 10 d.p.i. We observed a pattern of infiltrating GFP+ cells that was identical to CD45+ globoid cells in our previous experiments, with scattered GFP+ cells in the cortex and thalamus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>), and accumulations of GFP+ cells in the VI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2D</xref>). In agreement with our previous data, GFP+ cells were MPO+ in the VI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2D</xref>).</p><p>Since neutrophils were the predominant cell type infiltrating the brain during PDAC, we hypothesized that these cells are key drivers of cachexia. To test this hypothesis, we attempted to deplete neutrophils in our mouse model of PDAC. Beginning at 2 d.p.i., we treated tumor-bearing animals with either 500 μg anti-Ly6G antibody (clone 1A8) or isotype control IgG daily (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3A</xref>). At 10 d.p.i., there was complete abrogation of the population we defined as neutrophils (CD45+CD11b+Ly6C<sup>mid/high</sup>Ly6G<sup>high</sup>) in the circulation of 1A8-treated animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3D and E</xref>). However, there was a suspicious population of CD45+CD11b+Ly6C<sup>mid</sup>Ly6G- cells in 1A8-treated animals, which was not present in the isotype-treated animals, and had identical forward scatter and side scatter properties as neutrophils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3C and D</xref>). Since we used a fluorescently labeled anti-Ly6G antibody to identify neutrophils, it is possible that the neutralizing Ly6G antibody bound to all of the Ly6G antigens on neutrophils, therefore preventing the fluorescently labeled Ly6G antibody from binding. To address this issue, we used additional markers to identify neutrophils which did not require Ly6G labeling. It was previously reported that neutrophils could be differentiated from other circulating myeloid cells with the markers Dec205 and CD115 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Napier et al., 2015</xref>). We identified a population of cells that was CD45+CD11b+Dec205+CD115-, which was 95% Ly6C<sup>mid/high</sup>Ly6G+ neutrophils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3F</xref>). Using this new definition for neutrophils, we observed that there was no decrease in this population at 10 d.p.i. after daily treatment with 500 μg anti-Ly6G antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3E</xref>).</p><p>These results suggest that during PDAC, chronic neutrophil depletion with anti-Ly6G antibody is not possible.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>CCR2 inhibition attenuates anorexia and immune cell infiltration into the velum interpositum during PDAC</title><p>To identify unique mechanisms of immune cell recruitment to the brain and determine if inhibiting immune cells from infiltrating the brain attenuates cachexia, we treated OT-implanted tumor-bearing mice with either a CCR2 inhibitor (RS504393, Tocris) or CXCR2 inhibitor (SB225002, Tocris).

While we observed myeloid cell infiltration throughout the VI, we also observed sporadic accumulation of neutrophils and other leukocytes around the same pial vessels involved in the gateway reflex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arima et al., 2017</xref>) (data not shown, we were unable to quantify these cells due to the sporadic nature of cell infiltration). The role of the gateway reflex in feeding behavior is unknown. It is possible that, in our model of PDAC, brain infiltrating neutrophils were involved in generating anorexia and muscle catabolism via a neuro-immune circuit similar to the gateway reflex, involving inflammation generated in the VI, and possibly transmitted to the habenula, or other regions involved in appetite regulation.</p><p>The role and presence of infiltrating leukocytes in the CNS during systemic inflammation remain poorly understood. While previous reports show that neutrophils infiltrate the brain after septic doses of LPS or sepsis induced by cecal ligation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">He et al., 2016</xref>), it is still unknown if they contribute to neurologic sequelae (anorexia, fatigue, cognition and memory deficits, etc.) during and after sepsis. A series of studies utilizing a mouse model of inflammatory liver disease showed that ‘sickness behaviors’ could be attenuated if myeloid cell recruitment to the brain was abrogated via any one of several different interventions, including: 1) administration of a P-selectin inhibitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kerfoot et al., 2006</xref>), 2) deleting <italic>Ccr2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">D'Mello et al., 2009</xref>), and 3) inhibiting microglia activation with minocycline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">D'Mello et al., 2013</xref>). However, unlike our study, these studies did not address many CNS-mediated signs and symptoms associated with chronic disease, including anorexia and muscle catabolism, instead using social interaction as their sole measure of sickness behaviors. They also did not address whether their interventions affected monocyte infiltration in other tissues. Therefore, our results, along with previous studies, implicate brain-infiltrating myeloid cells as key players in driving CNS-mediated signs and symptoms during inflammatory disease.</p><p>We were unable to deplete neutrophils, despite daily IP injections of high-dose anti-Ly6G antibody. This dosing regimen was previously thought to thoroughly deplete neutrophils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Daley et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Reber et al., 2017</xref>). However, most studies used Ly6G labeling to verify depletion, which can result in incorrectly assuming that neutrophils are depleted. This issue was discussed in a recent study, which demonstrated that despite lack of Ly6G labeling, neutrophils are still present in conditions of immune activation and even increased in some compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pollenus et al., 2019</xref>). In our PDAC model, this is problematic since there is massive neutrophil mobilization from the bone marrow. Moreover, previous studies demonstrated that PDAC reprograms macrophages, effectively impairing their phagocytic capabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mantovani and Sica, 2010</xref>), Since macrophage phagocytosis was shown to be required for Ly6G antibody-mediated neutrophil depletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bruhn et al., 2016</xref>), this may explain why the Ly6G antibody bound to neutrophils, but they were not depleted.</p><p>We observed a decrease in total number of lymphocytes in the brain starting at 5 d.p.i., which persisted throughout the course of PDAC. This was driven by a decrease in B-cells and CD4+ T-cells. We chose not pursue this further as the purpose of this series of studies was to investigate infiltrating immune cells in the brain. However, with the recent discovery of the meningeal lymphatics and immune surveillance in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Louveau et al., 2018</xref>), the role of lymphocytes in brain immune regulation is beginning to be appreciated. While the vast majority of lymphocytes in the non-inflamed murine brain are intravascular, even after thorough perfusion of the vasculature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mrdjen et al., 2018</xref>), there are lymphocytes in the CSF and meningeal lymphatics. Indeed, a decrease in CD4+ T-cells in the brain during PDAC may reflect a loss of immune regulation in the brain, as they cells have a key cerebroprotective role during neuroinflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Liesz et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Hypothalamic microglia were previously implicated in orchestrating a multicellular hypothalamic immune response, including infiltrating myeloid cells, during high fat diet-induced obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Valdearcos et al., 2017</xref>). While we did not observe neutrophil infiltration in the hypothalamus during PDAC, we did observe infiltration of non-neutrophil C45+ globoid cells in the meninges surrounding the median eminence. This population of cells should be identified in future studies, and the role of these cells and hypothalamic microglia in PDAC cachexia should be investigated.</p><p>We showed that CCR2 inhibition, but not CXCR2 inhibition, attenuated immune cell infiltration into the brain and resulted in decreased anorexia during PDAC. <italic>Ccr2</italic> deletion resulted in even greater attenuation in cachexia and immune cell infiltration into the brain. The difference between genetic and pharmacologic CCR2 blockade is likely due to incomplete blockade of CCR2 signaling with RS504393. It should be noted that both RS504393 and SB225002 treatment resulted in a nonsignificant decrease in neutrophils in the VI, yet only RS504393 treatment decreased cachexia, suggesting that monocytes (since CCR2 is typically important in monocyte chemotaxis) may be important mediators of cachexia. Also, it is worth noting that our pharmacologic inhibition of CXCR2 may have been incomplete. Therefore, it remains to be determined whether CXCR2 ligands are important for recruitment of cachexia-inducing neutrophils to the CNS. Regardless, our results are in agreement with previous studies investigating sickness behaviors during inflammatory liver disease, which showed that CCR2KO mice exhibited attenuated monocyte infiltration into the brain, along with decreased sickness behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">D'Mello et al., 2009</xref>). Furthermore, it was recently reported that mice lacking <italic>Ccr2 </italic>had decreased myeloid cell infiltration into the brain and attenuated cognitive impairment during a model of sepsis induced by <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> injection into the lungs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andonegui et al., 2018</xref>). In an attempt to identify inflammatory biomarkers for PDAC-associated cachexia, Talbert et al. identified CCL2 as the only cytokine or chemokine (out of a panel of 25) that was increased in the serum of cachectic PDAC patients but not increased in the serum of non-cachectic patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Talbert et al., 2018</xref>). It is possible that the differences we observed in gastrocnemius catabolism between WT and CCR2KO tumor animals were due to differences in food intake, but the fact that we observed a significant decrease in induction of the catabolic genes <italic>Mafbx</italic>, <italic>Murf1</italic>, and <italic>Foxo1</italic> in CCR2KO tumor animals, which are not induced by decreased food intake/starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Braun et al., 2011</xref>), makes this unlikely. However, CCR2KO tumor-bearing mice still experienced anorexia and muscle catabolism compared to CCR2KO sham mice, reflecting incomplete resolution of cachexia. It remains possible that more prominent factors, yet to be identified, contribute to cachexia during PDAC.</p><p>While CCR2 is usually not considered a key receptor for neutrophil recruitment, previous studies show it is important for neutrophil chemotaxis during sepsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Souto et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Souto et al., 2011</xref>). Interestingly, while we observed a robust decrease in brain-infiltrating neutrophils in CCR2KO mice, we did not observe a decrease in liver- or tumor-infiltrating neutrophils, indicating that CCR2 is important for neutrophil recruitment specifically to the brain. Circulating neutrophils in sham animals did not express CCR2, but a small percentage of circulating neutrophils expressed CCR2 in tumor animals, suggesting that the presence of a tumor induces CCR2 expression in neutrophils. Furthermore, a significant percentage of neutrophils in the brain expressed CCR2 during PDAC, meaning a distinct population of neutrophils is recruited to the brain from the circulation. These results, suggest that the population recruited to the brain has a distinct function from those recruited to other organs.</p><p>We administered oxidized ATP, a purinergic receptor antagonist, directly into the brain and observed complete abrogation of circulating myeloid cell recruitment to the brain in tumor animals, as well as anorexia attenuation. These results show that brain inflammation is an important driver of PDAC-associated anorexia. While there was no change in microglia morphology after oATP administration, consistent with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Martin et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Roth et al., 2014</xref>), nor was there a change in expression of genes associated with microglia activation, we cannot rule out the possibility that the difference in anorexia we observed were due to changes in microglia phenotype. The presence of an indwelling lateral ventricle cannula may have also induced microglia activation and influenced morphology quantification. However, we did take care to acquire images from the contralateral hemisphere. It is also worth noting that, unlike our previous experiments in non-cannulated mice, we did not observe a significant increase in brain-infiltrating Ly6C<sup>high</sup> monocytes in aCSF-treated tumor mice compared to oATP-treated sham mice. However, this comparison was nearly significant (p=0.06), and the lack of significance was likely due to heterogeneous results caused by cannulation. Furthermore, we observed an increased Ly6C<sup>high</sup> monocyte infiltrate in our aCSF-treated tumor animals compared to non-cannulated tumor animals, suggesting the indwelling lateral ventricle cannula did affect the inflammatory response in the brain to at least a small degree. Nevertheless, oATP completely prevented myeloid cells from infiltrating the brain during PDAC, strongly implicating these cells as mediators of anorexia.</p><p>We observed that the transcriptional profile of brain-infiltrating neutrophils was distinct from those in the circulation, liver, and tumor. It was previously demonstrated that the CNS induces a more ‘inflammatory’ transcriptional profile in infiltrating myeloid cells compared to those that infiltrate other organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Spath et al., 2017</xref>). Reasons for this are not entirely clear, but may be due to relative lack of regulatory T-cells, the blood brain barrier preventing access to soluble anti-inflammatory factors, and presence of immunogenic substances more abundant in the brain, such as myelin-associated lipids.</p><p>A few limitations should be considered when interpreting results of this study. First, our data were produced in a single model of pancreatic cancer. While our model is extensively characterized and reliably recapitulates many of the CNS-mediated symptoms observed in humans, other malignancies should also be considered. Second, it is possible, even likely, that circulating immune cells infiltrate and influence function in other organs dysfunctional during cancer (skeletal muscle, adipose tissue, etc.). However, the purpose of this study was to investigate and characterize interactions between circulating immune cells and the brain during PDAC. Therefore, we chose to focus specifically on the brain so as to not overcomplicate analysis. Third, since we were not able to selectively deplete neutrophils, we cannot definitely conclude that these cells are the sole cellular drivers of cachexia during PDAC. We observed a small increase in Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> monocytes in the brains of animals during PDAC, which was also attenuated by CCR2 deletion. Therefore, these cells may have contributed to anorexia and muscle catabolism. However, there were far fewer Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> monocytes (≈2,000) in the brain than neutrophils (≈9,000) during PDAC, and these cells only constituted about 15% of brain CD45<sup>high</sup> myeloid cells (vs. approximately 50% for neutrophils). Fourth, it is possible that the tumor metastasized to the brain, which drove the immune response. However, our lab has conducted countless PDAC experiments in mice and analyzed thousands of brain slices. We have yet to observe a single metastasis. Lastly, despite our extensive analysis, we cannot rule out with absolute certainty that the differences we observed in RS504393-treated or CCR2KO mice were not due to differences in tumor response. However, both the CCR2/CCL2 axis and neutrophils are reported to be ‘pro-tumor’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Coffelt et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Qian et al., 2011</xref>) and therefore systemic treatment targeting neutrophils or the CCR2/CCL2 axis in humans may be particularly beneficial in that they decrease tumor size and abrogate CNS dysfunction. This would be advantageous to conventional anti-tumor therapies such as chemotherapy and checkpoint inhibitors, which are both known to cause cachexia-like symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Braun et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Michot et al., 2016</xref>) and not effective against PDAC.</p><p>In summary, we demonstrated that myeloid cells infiltrate the CNS throughout the course of PDAC and that preventing myeloid cells from infiltrating the brain attenuates anorexia and muscle catabolism. We showed there are distinct mechanisms for immune cell recruitment to the brain during systemic inflammation, and demonstrated a novel role for CCR2 in neutrophil recruitment to the brain, providing key insights into mechanisms of neuroinflammation and associated symptoms.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals and treatment</title><p>Male and female 20–25 g WT C57BL/6J (stock no. 000664), <italic>Ptprc<sup>a</sup></italic>-EGFP (aka Ly5.1-eGFP, stock no. 002014), <italic>Ccl2</italic><sup>mCherry</sup> (stock no. 016849), <italic>Ccr2</italic><sup>RFP</sup> (stock no. 017586), and CCR2KO (stock no. 004999) were purchased at Jackson Laboratories.

Immune cells were defined as CD45+ cells. In the brain, microglia were defined as CD45<sup>mid</sup>CD11b+. Leukocytes were identified as either myeloid cells (CD45<sup>high</sup>CD11b+ in the brain, CD45+CD11b+ in all other tissues) or lymphocytes (CD45<sup>high</sup>CD11b- in the brain, CD45+CD11b- in all other tissues). From myeloid cells Ly6C<sup>low</sup> monocytes (Ly6C<sup>low</sup>Ly6G-), Ly6C<sup>high</sup> monocytes (Ly6C<sup>high</sup>Ly6G-), and neutrophils (Ly6C<sup>mid</sup>Ly6G+) were identified. From lymphocytes, CD3+ cells were identified as T-cells, and further phenotyped as CD4+ or CD8+ T-cells. CD3- T-cells were divided into NK1.1+ NK cells or CD19+ B-cells. Flow cytometry analysis was performed on a BD Fortessa, Symphony, or LSRII analytic flow cytometer.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12-6"><title>Antibodies</title><p>All antibodies were purchased from BioLegend, except for Live/Dead, which was purchased from Invitrogen (Fixable Aqua, used at 1:200 dilution).

Circulating leukocytes were then removed via transcardiac perfusion with PBS and brain, liver, and tumor were removed. Leukocytes were isolated from blood, brain, liver, and tumor as described above. Sorting was performed using an Influx sorter (BD) with a 100 μm nozzle. Neutrophils were defined as CD11b<sup>high</sup>Ly6G<sup>high</sup> live, singlet cells, and were sorted into lysis buffer (Qiagen), then stored at −80° C. Using this technique, our lab regularly achieves 95%+ post-sort purity.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>RNA isolation and sequencing</title><sec id="s4-13-1"><title>RNA Isolation, sequencing, and library preparation</title><p>Total RNA was isolated from FACS-sorted CD11b<sup>high</sup>Ly6G<sup>high</sup> neutrophils using an RNAeasy Plus Micro kit (Qiagen). RNA integrity was verified by a Bioanalyzer (Agilent). Sample cDNAs were prepared using the SMART-Seq v4 Ultra Low Input kit (Takara) using 250 pg of input total RNA followed by library preparation using a TruSeq DNA Nano kit (Illumina). Libraries were verified by Tapestation (Agilent). Library concentrations were determined by real-time PCR with a StepOnePlus Real Time PCR System (Thermo Fisher) and a Kapa Library Quantification Kit (Kapa Biosystems/Roche). Libraries were sequenced with a 100 cycle single read protocol on a HiSeq 2500 (Illumina) with four libraries per lane.

Raw reads were normalized and analyzed using the Bioconductor package DESeq2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Love et al., 2014</xref>), which uses negative binomial generalized linear models. Only those genes that were expressed in at least one sample were included in differential expression analysis. To identify transcripts differentially expressed in brain-infiltrating neutrophils compared to neutrophils infiltrating other organs, gene expression in neutrophils isolated from brain was compared to that in neutrophils isolated from liver, tumor, and blood. In order to control for the effects of tumor on circulating neutrophils, genes that also were differentially expressed in circulating neutrophils from tumor mice compared to circulating neutrophils from sham mice were excluded from analysis. All p-values were adjusted for multiple comparisons using the Benjamani-Hochberg method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995</xref>). Differential expression was defined based on statistical significance (adjusted p-value&lt;0.05) and effect size (log<sub>2</sub> fold change)≤or ≥ −2. Heatmaps were created using the pheatmap package from R. Gene Ontology analysis was performed using the Goseq Bioconductor R package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Young et al., 2010</xref>). For pathway enrichment analysis, pathway annotation from the Reactome knowledgebase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Croft et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fabregat et al., 2018</xref>) was used.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Data are expressed as means ± SEM. Statistical analysis was performed with Prism 7.0 software (Graphpad Software Corp). When two groups were compared, data were analyzed with either student’s t-test or Mann-Whitney U test. When more than two groups were compared, data were analyzed with either one-way (when multiple groups were compared to a single sham group) or two-way (when there were multiple genotypes within tumor and sham groups being compared) ANOVA analysis. For single time point experiments, the two factors in ANOVA analysis were genotype or treatment. In repeated measures experiments, the two factors were group and time. Main effects of genotype, treatment, group, and/or time were first analyzed, and if one effect was significant, Bonferroni <italic>post hoc</italic> analysis was then performed. For all analyses, significance was assigned at the level of p&lt;0.05.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Pamela Canaday, Dorian LaTocha, and Sara Christensen at the OHSU Flow Cytometry Core for their assistance with FACS sorting for RNASeq; Taylor McFarland at the OHSU Gene Profiling Shared Resource for his assistance with RNA isolation; Amy Carlos and Dr. Robert Searles at the OHSU Massively Parallel Sequencing Core for their assistance with RNA sequencing and library preparation; Dr. Elizabeth Jaffee from Johns Hopkins for providing KPC tumor cells; Drs.

Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>In the current manuscript, Burfeind et al. present an intriguing concept that neutrophil infiltration of the central nervous system (CNS) can play a role in peripheral phenotypes (e.g. anorexia and altered muscle catabolism) associated with tumor progression in a mouse model of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Flow cytometry, bone marrow chimeras and immunofluorescence were used to establish CNS neutrophil infiltration during a time when significant wasting and anorexia are observed (i.e. 10 days post inoculation (d.p.i.)), with one of the sites being within the velum interpositum (VI) meningeal layer that surrounds the hippocampus. Localization of these cells near the hippocampus provided the impetus to assess behavioral and cognitive function using open field (OFA) and novel object recognition (NOR) assays, respectively. Although NOR still demonstrated preferences for exploration of a novel object, suggesting cognitive function remained undisturbed, data using their paradigm of OFA presented with alterations that were interpreted as increased levels of anxiety in tumor bearing animals. Delving further into mechanism by which neutrophils may be recruited to the CNS, CCL2 expression in the VI was suggested to recruit CCR2+ neutrophils. RNAseq of flow cytometrically sorted neutrophils was conducted to demonstrate that these neutrophils represented a unique subset that were transcriptionally distinct from peripheral neutrophils. Furthermore, CCR2 KO animals were demonstrated to have a significant attenuation of anorexia and decreased muscle loss. Finally, intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection of oxidized ATP (oATP), which blocks P2RX7 signaling, resulted in decreased recruitment of neutrophils in the VI and partial amelioration of anorexia, with no significant alterations in muscle loss. Overall this manuscript attempts to like recruitment neutrophils to the CNS during tumor progression that then acts to elicit alterations in anxiety, wasting and anorexia.</p><p>Overall this manuscript provides an interesting concept and is well written. The data are interesting and could give insight into the interplay between neuroinflammation and peripheral outcomes during tumor progression but there are issues that need to be addressed. As we judge it will likely take longer than two months to attend to these points, we are returning your paper to you now in case you wish to submit it elsewhere. However, should you wish to resubmit to <italic>eLife</italic>, we would consider a new submission of your manuscript that addresses the points laid out in the reviewer comments below.</p><p>1) In order to provide convincing evidence that neutrophils are significantly increased in the CNS, additional flow cytometric data will need to be conducted. As it stands, the gating for CD45<sup>high</sup>CD11b+ cells may still include microglia, which may also non-specifically bind to antibodies and thus look &quot;positive&quot; for markers (e.g. Ly6G+). Although it is appreciated that the authors attempt to use a bone marrow chimera using chemotherapy based myeloablation (i.e. treosulfan/Ovastat) to circumvent blood brain barrier (BBB) disruptions, the gates in which the GFP+ cells fall in Figure 1—figure supplement 2B could still encompass microglia. Since this is a pivotal point for the paper, it would be crucial to re-conduct some of these experiments utilizing a marker which will eliminate microglia (e.g. <italic>Tmem119</italic>) to rule out this caveat. This impacts the entire paper since many of the results are based on how they gated for neutrophils in general, identify CCR2+ cells as including a subset of neutrophils in their flow cytometric studies, and sorting for RNAseq is theoretically also utilizing a similar gate.</p><p>2) Although the authors identify a behavioral phenotype using open field assay (OFA), a two-day test for OFA is highly atypical. There is no training day for OFA, and the results found on day 1 would be the actual results, thus indicating that there is no anxiety phenotype. Regardless, the second day of OFA, when a phenotype is shown, also coincides with day 8 post inoculation where the mice are clearly sick, as indicated by the sharp drop in daily food intake that occurs in this model system (see Figure 4F). The measurements used (i.e. Time spent in center and percent time in center) are both measurements that do not take into account the level of activity in these animals and do not normalize for the total level of activity. If these animals are simply sick and do not move much from the sides, it has little to do with anxiety versus sickness behavior which is clearly observed the next day with the great reduction in overall exploratory behavior. Other measurements should be reported to assess anxiety that normalize for activity level and test, such as elevated plus maze, that are most specifically geared for anxiety should be conducted if possible.</p><p>3) The authors show interesting data indicating that there is recruitment of cells, including neutrophils, to the brain in tumor bearing animals; however, very little is done in regards to assessing inflammation. They have referenced previous work from their lab (i.e. Braun et al., 2011) to indicate that CNS inflammation can be associated with alterations in muscle proteolysis and demonstrated in that work the impact of <italic>IL-1β</italic> driven neuroinflammation on this process. Assessment of pro-inflammatory cytokines should be reported in this current model system in order to determine if there is actual inflammation that accompanies infiltration.</p><p>4) Examination of the impact of oATP administration to block recruitment suggested that neutrophils were the only population that were significantly reduced with oATP treatment. However, although both CD45<sup>high</sup> myeloid cells and Ly6G<sup>high</sup> monocytes appeared to be reduced without reaching significance during oATP treatment relative to aCSF tumor controls, the aCSF tumor control animals themselves did not have a significant increase in these populations relative to sham oATP controls. This suggests that there should have been a longer period of time between the cannula placement and tumor inoculation to allow for any inflammation induced by that procedure to resolve. Additionally, it appears that there is really one outlier in both cases that is driving the lack of significance. This is important to clarify because just as CCR2KO significantly lowers the numbers of Ly6C<sup>high</sup> monocytes as well as neutrophils, the oATP appears to have a similar effect.</p><p>5) In order to determine that neutrophils, in general, are impacting the anorexia and muscle loss, a specific treatment targeting neutrophils (e.g. 1A8 antibody mediated depletion), should be conducted.</p><p>6) Authors need demonstrate the absence of metastasis in the brains as an event leading to the recruitment of neutrophils.</p><p>7) Authors need to compare the immune composition of the brain +/- meninges to clearly confirm their parenchymal location.</p><p>8) CCR2 is not the most common pathway known to promote recruitment of neutrophils. What happens when CXCR2 get blocked? The data leading to the selection of CCR2 should be presented.</p><p>9) The microglia activation data are not supporting the statement. Authors should present high magnification pictures with quantification of cell body and Sholl analysis to claim that microglia are or are not activated.</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;A distinct neutrophil population invades the central nervous system during pancreatic cancer&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Tadatsugu Taniguchi as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Dr. Daniel Marks and colleagues reported that the accumulation of circulating myeloid cells in the brain is associated with cachexia symptoms in malignancies outside the central nervous system (CNS), as has been demonstrated in a syngeneic, immunocompetent, mouse model of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). They discovered that CD45+CD11b+Ly6G+ neutrophils constitute a major proportion of brain-infiltrating myeloid cells that increases during PDAC progression. Consistently, MPO (a typical component of azurophilic granules in neutrophils and lysosomes in monocytes)-expressing CD45+ globoid cells were found primarily localized in the velum interpositum (VI) layer of meninges surrounding the hippocampus, where Iba1+CD206+ meningeal macrophages are the dominant cellular source of the chemokine CCL2. Pharmacologic blockade of CCR2, but not CXCR2, or genetic deletion of Ccr2 in mouse (not specifically in neutrophils) significantly reduced brain-infiltrating neutrophils, as well as attenuated anorexia and decreased muscle mass loss during PDAC. In addition, intracerebroventricular administration of a P2RX7 antagonist oxidized ATP phenocopied CCR2 blockade in this model, without affecting systemic inflammation or tumor progression. This work suggests a causative link between the accumulation of myeloid cell subpopulations in the brain parenchyma and cancer-associated cachexia.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) An important missing gap is to prove whether neutrophils in the VI, among multiple brain-infiltrating myeloid cell subsets, are the major inducers of cancer-associated anorexia. Further experiments are needed to consolidate whether neutrophils are the only cell involved. For example, antibody-mediated neutrophil depletion (e.g., with Ly6G mAb (clone 1A8), rather than Gr1 mAb) can be a feasible solution. It remains possible that the accumulation of CCR2-expressing monocytes in the CNS, preceding or accompanying the accumulation of neutrophils, also plays a role in the occurrence of cachexia.</p><p>2) The authors claim that CCL2 production by meningeal macrophages mediates neutrophil recruitment to the VI layer of meninges, which depends on CCR2, rather than CXCR2 signaling. To consolidate this conclusion, the PDAC model should be tested in genetically modified mice harboring neutrophil-specific deletion CCR2 or CXCR2 (e.g. by the Cre-lox strategy) respectively. As the upregulation of CXCR2 ligands is much greater than CCL2 (Figure 1), and pharmacologic inhibitors may be insufficient to block CXCR2 signaling, CXCR2 deficient mice should be tested in this setting. Although these suggestions can indeed help to nail down the conclusion, it is an overwhelming task to complete all these animal experiments. Therefore, the authors are encouraged to test the essential and doable ones, rephrase their interpretations of the data, as well as improve related discussions.</p><p>3) Some interesting observations can be emphasized and discussed. How does PDCA progression initiates CCL2 production by Iba1+CD206+ meningeal macrophages brain-resident macrophages? What are the possible factors (either derived from tumor cells or tumor microenvironment) that specifically activate this cell population? Could brain-infiltrating immune cell populations participate in regulating CCL2 and CXCL2 production in the brain (via positive or negative feedback loops)? Why brain-infiltrating neutrophils show distinct transcriptional features, compared with neutrophils in other compartments.</p><p>4) Neutrophil accumulation in the brain in PDCA bearing mice can be blocked with P2RX7 antagonist oATP or CCR2 inhibitor RS504393. Can oATP treatment interfere with CCL2 production by brain resident macrophages, or the CXCL2 level in different brain regions?</p><p>5) It is very difficult for readers to identify some labels in the figures. And some of the immunofluorescent images are vague. The quality of the figures must be largely improved.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.54095.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the authors resubmitted a revised version of the paper for consideration.

Nearly all brain macrophages, including microglia, express CX3CR1, but neutrophils do not. This new supplementary figure is now Figure 2—figure supplement 2. As you can see, 95% of the population we labeled as “microglia” expressed CX3CR1, whereas only 6% of Ly6G+ neutrophils expressed this marker. This confirms the identity of these cells as neutrophils and confirms that they are not microglia. Therefore, all of the neutrophil gates throughout the paper (including the RNASeq) are correct and do not include microglia.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Although the authors identify a behavioral phenotype using open field assay (OFA), a two-day test for OFA is highly atypical.

Assessment of pro-inflammatory cytokines should be reported in this current model system in order to determine if there is actual inflammation that accompanies infiltration.</p></disp-quote><p>We now include an extensive analysis of pro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine transcripts from the area postrema, hypothalamus, and hippocampus (see new Figure 1). While there is upregulation <italic>Il-1β</italic>, as well as <italic>Ptgs2</italic> (coding for prostaglandin synthase D2), the inflammatory response in the brain during PDAC is dominated by chemokines, suggesting that the cellular infiltration we describe throughout the manuscript is an important aspect of the overall inflammatory response.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Examination of the impact of oATP administration to block recruitment suggested that neutrophils were the only population that were significantly reduced with oATP treatment. However, although both CD45high myeloid cells and Ly6Ghigh monocytes appeared to be reduced without reaching significance during oATP treatment relative to aCSF tumor controls, the aCSF tumor control animals themselves did not have a significant increase in these populations relative to sham oATP controls. This suggests that there should have been a longer period of time between the cannula placement and tumor inoculation to allow for any inflammation induced by that procedure to resolve. Additionally, it appears that there is really one outlier in both cases that is driving the lack of significance. This is important to clarify because just as CCR2KO significantly lowers the numbers of Ly6Chigh monocytes as well as neutrophils, the oATP appears to have a similar effect.</p></disp-quote><p>We added the following sentence to the Discussion: “It is worth noting that, unlike our previous experiments in non-cannulated mice, we did not observe a significant increase in brain-infiltrating Ly6C<sup>high</sup> monocytes in aCSF-treated tumor mice compared to oATP-treated sham mice. However, this comparison was nearly significant (p=0.06), and the lack of significance was likely due to variation imposed by the cannulation procedure.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) In order to determine that neutrophils, in general, are impacting the anorexia and muscle loss, a specific treatment targeting neutrophils (e.g. 1A8 antibody mediated depletion), should be conducted.</p></disp-quote><p>We made numerous attempts to deplete neutrophils using several different techniques. The major issue is that there is massive neutrophil mobilization from the bone marrow during PDAC and the half-life of neutrophils is extremely short (often less than 24 hrs in the circulation), so chronic depletion in this setting is simply not possible. As you can see in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>, when we administered Ly6G 1A8 antibody daily at a very high concentration (500 ug IP daily), the antibody binds to the Ly6G antigen, as evidenced by the lack of immunoreactivity in subsequent Ly6GPE/ Cy7 labeling. However, there was a suspicious population present that was Ly6C<sup>mid</sup>Ly6G<sup>low</sup>. When we analyzed that population with additional neutrophil markers (Dec205+CD115-) (see Napier et al., 2015). We discovered that the population was in fact neutrophils, and this population was not decreased compared to the isotype control treated animals. We believe that the shift in this population is secondary to surface binding of the detection antibody.</p><fig id="sa2fig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Neutrophils are not depleted by Ly6G antibody administration.</title><p>Representative flow cytometry analysis of isolated circulating leukocytes from PDAC-bearing mice, 10 d.p.i.

This layer of meninges cannot be dissected. Furthermore, as demonstrated in Figure 3—figure supplement 2B, the majority of immune cells that infiltrate into the parenchyma are phagocytosed by microglia. Therefore, running flow cytometry on the brain with or without the outer meninges would not significantly contribute to the findings of this manuscript, as it would still include those that are located in VI, which is a substantial percentage of brain-infiltrating immune cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) CCR2 is not the most common pathway known to promote recruitment of neutrophils. What happens when CXCR2 get blocked? The data leading to the selection of CCR2 should be presented.</p></disp-quote><p>See new Figure 1 – <italic>Ccl2</italic> is highly upregulated in the hippocampus and is trending toward significance in the hypothalamus (p=0.06) during PDAC. Both <italic>Cxcl1</italic> and <italic>Cxcl2</italic> are upregulated in the hypothalamus and hippocampus. Furthermore, CCL2 is important for monocyte chemotaxis (and important for neutrophil chemotaxis in <italic>certain contexts</italic> – see Souto et al., 2009), while CXCL1 and CXCL2 are usually considered the primary chemokines for neutrophil chemotaxis. Since the brain-infiltrating immune cells we observed in our mouse model of PDAC consisted of neutrophils and monocytes, we decided to target CCR2 and CXCR2 (which is the receptor for CXCL1 and CXCL2). We added a new figure (Figure 4) that describes a series of experiments in which CCR2 and CXCR2 inhibitors are administered to PDAC-bearing mice. Mice that received the CCR2 inhibitor experienced decreased anorexia compared to vehicle-treated mice, whereas mice that received the CXCR2 inhibitor did not. Moreover, we demonstrated a decrease in VI-infiltrating immune cells in mice that received the CCR2 inhibitor, whereas there was no significant change in VI-infiltrating immune cells in mice that received the CXCR2 inhibitor. These data also validate the use of CCR2 knockout mice for more extensive analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) The microglia activation data are not supporting the statement. Authors should present high magnification pictures with quantification of cell body and Sholl analysis to claim that microglia are or are not activated.</p></disp-quote><p>We do not understand the reviewer comment “The microglia activation data are not supporting the statement”, since we performed microglia morphology analysis and observed that there was no microglia activation in the hippocampus in tumor-bearing animals (see Figure 7—figure supplement 2). This is in agreement with our statement “We did not observe any differences in microglia size, Iba-1 staining area, and Iba-1 intensity per cell when comparing aCSF-or oATP-treated tumor animals to oATP-treated sham animals or each other (Figure 7—figure supplement 2).” These results show that microglia activation state in the hippocampus is not affected by the presence of pancreatic tumor or oATP administration to the brain. While we understand and appreciate that there are more advanced means to analyze morphology, the topic of the current manuscript is brain-infiltrating myeloid cells, not resident myeloid cells. However, when we conducted qRT-PCR of hippocampal tissue and demonstrated that there was no difference in expression of transcripts associated with microglia activation, including <italic>Tnf</italic>, <italic>Cd68</italic>, <italic>Tmem119</italic>, <italic>P2y12</italic>, and <italic>P2x7r</italic>, when comparing oATP-treated to aCSF-treated tumor animals. These data are now part of Figure 7—figure supplement 2.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what follows is the authors’ response to the second round of review.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) An important missing gap is to prove whether neutrophils in the VI, among multiple brain-infiltrating myeloid cell subsets, are the major inducers of cancer-associated anorexia. Further experiments are needed to consolidate whether neutrophils are the only cell involved. For example, antibody-mediated neutrophil depletion (eg, with Ly6G mAb (clone 1A8), rather than Gr1 mAb) can be a feasible solution. It remains possible that the accumulation of CCR2-expressing monocytes in the CNS, preceding or accompanying the accumulation of neutrophils, also plays a role in the occurrence of cachexia.</p></disp-quote><p>We made numerous attempts to deplete neutrophils using the Ly6G clone 1A8 mAb. The major issues are that there is massive neutrophil mobilization from the bone marrow during PDAC, the half-life of neutrophils is extremely short (often less than 24 hrs in the circulation), and PDAC inhibits macrophage phagocytic capabilities (important for Ly6G antibody-mediated neutrophil depletion), so chronic depletion in this setting is simply not possible. We included these data as a new supplemental figure (Figure 3—figure supplement 3). As you can see, when Ly6G 1A8 antibody was administered daily at a very high concentration (500 µg IP daily), the antibody binds to the Ly6G antigen, as evidenced by the lack of immunoreactivity in subsequent Ly6GPE/Cy7 labeling. However, there was a suspicious Ly6C<sup>mid</sup>Ly6G<sup>low</sup> population present in animals that received the 1A8 antibody. We believe that the shift in this population is secondary to surface binding of the detection antibody. When we analyzed that population with additional neutrophil markers (Dec205+CD115-, see Napier et al., 2015<sup>1</sup>). We discovered that the population was almost exclusively neutrophils. This population was not decreased compared to the isotype control treated animals.</p><p>To comment on this issue, we added the following to the Discussion: “We were unable to deplete neutrophils, despite daily IP injections of high dose anti-Ly6G antibody. […] Moreover, previous studies demonstrated that PDAC reprograms macrophages, effectively impairing their phagocytic capabilities<sup>5,6</sup>, Since macrophage phagocytosis was shown to be required for Ly6G antibody-mediated neutrophil depletion<sup>7</sup>, this may explain why the Ly6G antibody bound to neutrophils, but they were not depleted.”</p><p>We were in the process of conducting additional experiments to more thoroughly address this comment, but these were stopped as a result of the COVID outbreak. Since we were unable to definitively identify neutrophils as they key cell type involved in cachexia, we modified our conclusions. We renamed the manuscript “Circulating myeloid cells invade the central nervous system to mediate cachexia during pancreatic cancer.” We also rephrased the Discussion to read as “Third, since we were not able to selectively deplete neutrophils, we cannot definitely conclude that these cells are the sole cellular drivers of cachexia during PDAC. […] However, there were far fewer Ly6C<sup>high</sup> monocytes (≈2,000) in the brain than neutrophils (≈9,000) during PDAC, and these cells only constituted about 15% of brain CD45<sup>high</sup> myeloid cells (vs. approximately 50% for neutrophils).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors claim that CCL2 production by meningeal macrophages mediates neutrophil recruitment to the VI layer of meninges, which depends on CCR2, rather than CXCR2 signaling. To consolidate this conclusion, the PDAC model should be tested in genetically modified mice harboring neutrophil-specific deletion CCR2 or CXCR2 (e.g. by the Cre-lox strategy) respectively. As the upregulation of CXCR2 ligands is much greater than CCL2 (Figure 1), and pharmacologic inhibitors may be insufficient to block CXCR2 signaling, CXCR2 deficient mice should be tested in this setting. Although these suggestions can indeed help to nail down the conclusion, it is an overwhelming task to complete all these animal experiments. Therefore, the authors are encouraged to test the essential and doable ones, rephrase their interpretations of the data, as well as improve related discussions.</p></disp-quote><p><italic>Ccr2</italic> floxed animals are not commercially available, nor were we able to find any publications describing these animals. <italic>Cxcr2</italic> floxed animals are commercially available, but take 10-14 weeks for cryorecovery, meaning that even in ideal circumstances it will take at least one year for breeding (with MRP8<sup>Cre</sup> mice, which is the only neutrophil specific Cre line available) and generating the appropriate experimental animals. Moreover, CXCR2 is almost exclusively expressed on neutrophils, making it unnecessary to selectively delete the associated gene from neutrophils. <italic>Cxcr2</italic> knockout animals are commercially available, but only as heterozygotes, which would have required at least 4 months to generate experimental animals prior to the COVID-19 outbreak. We ordered these animals and were planning to initiate breeding, but since all breeding and animal orders have been halted, we will not be able to have experimental animals available for at least eight months.</p><p>However, the CXCR2 blockade with the dosing regimen we used was previously validated<sup>8</sup>. Moreover, in response to the comment “As the upregulation of CXCR2 ligands is much greater than CCL2 (Figure 1)”, we respectfully disagree. As Figure 1 shows, in the hypothalamus <italic>Ccl2</italic> is upregulated approximately two-fold, <italic>Cxcl1</italic> is upregulated approximately five-fold, and <italic>Cxcl2</italic> is upregulated approximately 15-fold. However, as Figure 3 shows, neutrophils <italic>donot</italic> infiltrate the hypothalamus.

We changed the associated section in the Results to read “These data demonstrate that pharmacologic inhibition of CCR2 is important for cachexia and immune cell recruitment to the brain during PDAC.” In addition, we added the following to the Discussion: “Also, it is worth noting, that our pharmacologic inhibition of CXCR2 may have been incomplete. Therefore, it remains to be determined whether CXCR2 ligands are important for recruitment of cachexia-inducing neutrophils to the CNS.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Some interesting observations can be emphasized and discussed. How does PDCA progression initiates CCL2 production by Iba1+CD206+ meningeal macrophages brain-resident macrophages? What are the possible factors (either derived from tumor cells or tumor microenvironment) that specifically activate this cell population? Could brain-infiltrating immune cell populations participate in regulating CCL2 and CXCL2 production in the brain (via positive or negative feedback loops)? Why brain-infiltrating neutrophils show distinct transcriptional features, compared with neutrophils in other compartments.</p></disp-quote><p>We conducted an experiment demonstrating that tumor-conditioned media induces chemokine induction in microglia in vitro. This experiment involved isolating mixed glia from one to three-day old mouse pups, then after 14-16 days we removed microglia through shaking and treated them with KPC-conditioned media. 16 hours after treatment, we extracted RNA and performed qRT-PCR tumor-bearing mice (per Figure 1). We included these data as a new main figure (now Figure 6). As this figure shows, <italic>Ccl2,Cxcl1</italic>, and <italic>Cxcl2</italic> were all upregulated in microglia by tumor-conditioned media, but <italic>Cxcl9</italic> and <italic>Cxcl10</italic> were not. Of these transcripts, <italic>Ccl2</italic> was by far the most highly upregulated (136-fold vs. 15-fold for <italic>Cxcl1</italic> and 46-fold for <italic>Cxcl2</italic>) This recapitulates our in vivo data. We also included a positive control experiment, demonstrating nonselective robust upregulation of all chemokines analyzed in response to LPS treatment (Figure 6C). These findings demonstrate that tumor-derived factors cause brain macrophages to express chemokines, specifically CCL2, which in turn recruits neutrophils and other myeloid cells to the CNS. We understand this does not perfectly model meningeal macrophages; these cells cannot be isolated at sufficient numbers to perform a similar experiment. Furthermore, it was previously demonstrated that microglia likely become meningeal macrophage-like when they are in culture (higher expression of CD44, CD68)<sup>9</sup>.</p><p>In regards to the comment “Could brain-infiltrating immune cell populations participate in regulating CCL2 and CXCL2 production in the brain (via positive or negative feedback loops)”, these findings indicate it is unlikely that brain-infiltrating immune cell populations participate in regulating CCL2 and CXCL2 production in the brain (via positive or negative feedback loops).</p><p>In regards to the comment “Why brain-infiltrating neutrophils show distinct transcriptional features, compared with neutrophils in other compartments”, we believe this is due to the unique microenvironment of the CNS compared to other organs. It was previously demonstrated that the CNS induces a more “inflammatory” transcriptional profile in infiltrating myeloid cells compared to those that infiltrate other organs<sup>10</sup>. Therefore, we added the following to the Discussion: “We observed that the transcriptional profile of brain-infiltrating neutrophils was distinct from those in the circulation, liver, and tumor. […] Reasons for this are not entirely clear but may be due to relative lack of regulatory T-cells, the blood brain barrier preventing access to soluble anti-inflammatory factors, and presence of immunogenic substances more abundant in the brain, such as myelin-associated lipids.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Neutrophil accumulation in the brain in PDCA bearing mice can be blocked with P2RX7 antagonist oATP or CCR2 inhibitor RS504393.

There was no difference in expression of these transcripts with oATP treatment. However, this was from whole tissue, so brain macrophages were not isolated. PCR may not be sensitive enough to pick up these differences. So as to not unduly burden the reader, we chose not to include these data in the manuscript. Prior to the COVID-19 outbreak, we were planning on conducting an in vitro experiment to address this comment but were unable to perform it before labs were ordered shut down.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) It is very difficult for readers to identify some labels in the figures.
