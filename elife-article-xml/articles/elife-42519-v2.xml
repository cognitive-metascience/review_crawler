The mechanisms underlying spinal rhythmogenesis are unknown but network activity and interconnectivity of excitatory interneurons likely play prominent roles. Here, we investigate interconnectivity within the Shox2 interneuron population, a subset of which has been suggested to be involved in locomotor rhythm generation, using paired recordings in isolated spinal cords or slices from transgenic mice. Sparse unidirectional connections consistent with chemical synaptic transmission and prominent bidirectional connections mediated by electrical synapses were present within distinct subsets of Shox2 interneurons. Moreover, bidirectional electrical connections were preferentially found between functionally-related Shox2 interneurons. Though prevalent in neonatal mice, electrical coupling began to decline in incidence and strength in mice ~ 3 weeks of age. Overall, our data suggest that gap junctional coupling promotes synchronization of Shox2 interneurons, and may be implicated in locomotor rhythmicity in developing mice.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>spinal cord</kwd><kwd>rhythm generation</kwd><kwd>locomotion</kwd><kwd>synaptic connectivity</kwd><kwd>gap junctions</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 NS095366</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dougherty</surname><given-names>Kimberly J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008191</institution-id><institution>Wings for Life</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>WFL-US-003/15</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dougherty</surname><given-names>Kimberly J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Spinal Shox2 interneurons are strongly interconnected by gap junctional coupling in a function-specific manner, which provides a mechanism for synchronization of rhythm-generating neurons and may contribute to locomotor rhythmicity.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Central pattern generators (CPGs) are neural networks that can generate and control the rhythm and pattern of muscle activation, even in the absence of supraspinal input and sensory feedback. Such networks underlie many repetitive motor behaviors in vertebrates including chewing, breathing, and walking. Among these, the CPG controlling hindlimb locomotion is intrinsic to the spinal cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Grillner, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kiehn, 2016</xref>), and consists of rhythm-generating neurons and neurons participating in pattern formation. Although several constituent classes of locomotor CPG neurons have been identified based on transcription factor expression, most function as patterning neurons involved in left-right or flexor-extensor coordination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Garcia-Campmany et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">McLean and Dougherty, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Rybak et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kiehn, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Ziskind-Conhaim and Hochman, 2017</xref>). Rhythm-generating neurons have been more elusive as no single genetically identifiable population has been shown to be solely responsible for the rhythm.</p><p>Rhythm-generating neurons are excitatory, ipsilaterally-projecting, and mutually connected neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Buchanan and Grillner, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bracci et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kjaerulff and Kiehn, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kjaerulff and Kiehn, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Li et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Li et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hägglund et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hägglund et al., 2013</xref>). Two glutamatergic, ipsilaterally-projecting interneuronal populations have been identified as containing candidate rhythm-generating neurons. These neurons are identified by developmental expression of either the transcription factor Shox2 or Hb9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hinckley et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wilson et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dougherty et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Caldeira et al., 2017</xref>). Both Shox2 and Hb9 interneurons (INs) express many of the hallmark features of rhythm-generating neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brownstone and Wilson, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kiehn, 2016</xref>). Shox2 INs are located in the intermediate zone throughout the rostral-caudal extent of the spinal cord and Hb9 INs are in the ventromedial region, restricted to segments T13-L3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hinckley et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wilson et al., 2005</xref>). Shox2 INs can be further subdivided into two groups based on the expression of Chx10, the marker of V2a INs. Genetic manipulation experiments suggest that Shox2<sup>+</sup> non-V2a (Chx10<sup>-</sup>) INs are part of the locomotor rhythm generator, while Shox2<sup>+</sup> V2a (Chx10<sup>+</sup>) INs belong to the locomotor circuitry but are not directly involved in rhythm generation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dougherty et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>A key feature of rhythm-generating neurons is their ability to convert descending signals from hindbrain into a rhythmic output, which is transmitted to the circuit. The precise mechanisms by which this occurs in mammalian locomotor CPGs have been poorly described due to the difficulty in targeting specific populations of rhythm-generating neurons. Regardless of mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brownstone and Wilson, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brocard et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Harris-Warrick, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kiehn, 2016</xref>), connections between these neurons would be necessary to generate a synchronized rhythmic population activity. Therefore, neuronal connectivity is likely to play a significant role in locomotor rhythm generation.</p><p>In vertebrates, the majority of neuronal connectivity is mediated by chemical synapses but electrical synapses are also prevalent in neonatal rodent spinal cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chang et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kiehn and Tresch, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hinckley and Ziskind-Conhaim, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bautista et al., 2012</xref>). Functional evidence of gap junctional coupling has been extensively reported in neonatal rodent spinal cord and brainstem preparations with a decline as the animal matures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chang et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kiehn and Tresch, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Mentis et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hinckley and Ziskind-Conhaim, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lee et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bautista et al., 2012</xref>); however connexin proteins can be detected in the adult spinal cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Rash et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chang et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Nagy et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Rash et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Personius et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Marina et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bautista et al., 2012</xref>). Electrical transmission via gap junctions contributes to rhythmic oscillations and neuronal synchrony in many CPGs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Marder and Calabrese, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Rekling et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brownstone and Wilson, 2008</xref>). Gap junctions can enhance synchronization and affect frequency of rhythmic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bou-Flores and Berger, 2001</xref>), suggesting an involvement in rhythm. Further, blocking gap junctions eliminates most drug evoked locomotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Tresch and Kiehn, 2000</xref>). This may be due to a desynchronization of oscillating motor neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kiehn et al., 2000</xref>) and/or a loss of coupling between rhythm-generating interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hinckley and Ziskind-Conhaim, 2006</xref>).</p><p>Here, we investigate the connectivity properties of Shox2 interneurons (INs), a population shown to participate in locomotor rhythm generation. Dual whole-cell patch clamp recordings were performed to determine the degree of local connectivity among Shox2 neurons. Recordings were initially performed in dorsal horn-removed preparations and slices from neonatal mice (P0-5) as this is when fictive locomotion is readily elicited in vitro and where function of transcription factor-defined populations was first described. We found two types of interconnections between Shox2 INs: unidirectional connections consistent with chemical synaptic transmission and bidirectional connections mediated by electrical transmission. In more mature preparations, electrical connections between Shox2 INs began to decline around the third postnatal week and could not be detected in adult. Electrical coupling between Shox2 INs is preferential within identified subpopulations of Shox2 INs; therefore allowing for the synchronization of functional populations, particularly in young mice.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Unidirectional connections between spinal Shox2 INs are sparse</title><p>One feature common to populations of rhythm-generating neurons is mutual excitatory connections between them, which are thought to play a role in rhythmogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Rekling et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Li et al., 2006</xref>). Therefore, we sought to investigate the interconnectivity between Shox2 INs. We performed whole cell paired recordings from identified Shox2 INs in cords isolated from Shox2::Cre; Rosa26-lsl-tdTomato mice at P0-5. Proof of principle connectivity has previously been shown for a small number of Shox2 IN pairs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dougherty et al., 2013</xref>); however, here, we investigated local Shox2 interconnectivity in detail. Shox2 INs in close proximity were visually identified and targeted based on fluorescence. Initial recordings were performed in the lumbar region of the dorsal horn-removed preparation (84 pairs), as previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dougherty et al., 2013</xref>); however, the majority of the recordings were done in transverse spinal slices from lumbar cord (155 pairs). Recording from neurons in the slice preparation enables more direct comparison with recordings from more mature animals, which must be performed in spinal slices for visualization, oxygen penetration, and viability. Shox2 INs are primarily short-projecting, so local Shox2 IN connectivity is expected to be largely preserved in the slice preparation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dougherty et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Connectivity was tested by injecting current to evoke five action potentials in ‘Shox2 IN 1’ and averaging the response of ‘Shox2 IN 2’ in 50 trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The protocol was then reversed to measure the response of ‘Shox2 IN 1’ to action potentials evoked in ‘Shox2 IN 2’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Consistent with previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dougherty et al., 2013</xref>), a small number of Shox2 IN pairs were connected unidirectionally, such that action potentials evoked by current injections in one Shox2 IN resulted in EPSCs and EPSPs in the other Shox2 IN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A<sub>i</sub> and A<sub>ii</sub></xref>) but not when the protocol was reversed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B<sub>i</sub> and B<sub>ii</sub></xref>). Unidirectional connections between Shox2 INs were sparse (n = 4 of 239 pairs, two in slices, two in dorsal horn removed). This is likely to be an underestimate due to the proximity of the neurons selected for recordings and due to axon and dendritic loss in slicing.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.42519.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Unidirectional connections are present between Shox2 INs in neonatal mouse spinal cords.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold> and <bold>B</bold>) Examples of recordings from a pair of Shox2 INs that are unidirectionally connected.

This was obvious upon inspection of individual sweeps where postsynaptic responses were not always generated in response to each of the five presynaptic action potentials. In fact, in one postsynaptic neuron, evoked responses were seen in less than 10% of the sweeps. Therefore, for subsequent analysis only sweeps containing a postsynaptic response to the first presynaptic action potential were averaged. At a holding potential of −60 mV, the mean latency between the peak of the first presynaptic spikes and the peak of the first EPSC was 5.0 ± 2.4 ms (n = 3). The mean peak amplitude of the corresponding EPSC was −10.6 ± 3.9 pA. The delay between the peak of the first presynaptic spikes and the onset of the first EPSP was on average 2.0 ± 2.1 ms (n = 3). The mean peak amplitude of the corresponding EPSP was 1.4 ± 0.6 mV. The latency and unidirectional nature of these pairs was consistent with chemical synaptic transmission.</p><p>Synaptic failures in response to stimulation of single cells have been observed at other CNS synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bolshakov and Siegelbaum, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Stevens and Wang, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Rekling et al., 2000</xref>). It is possible that these chemical connections are not monosynaptic. However, regardless of whether the connections are monosynaptic or disynaptic, it suggests that Shox2 INs may be conditionally recurrently connected. In order to determine if failures were due to immature silent synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kerchner and Nicoll, 2008</xref>) or low vesicle release probabilities, subsets of non-connected pairs were tested at positive holding potentials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Liao et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Li and Zhuo, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baba et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Yasaka et al., 2009</xref>), in serotonin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Li and Zhuo, 1998</xref>), or increased extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> (i.e. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chuhma and Ohmori, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Moore et al., 2015</xref>). When the postsynaptic Shox2 IN was switched into voltage clamp mode and depolarized to +40 mV to remove the Mg<sup>2+</sup> block of the NMDA receptors, no additional connections were revealed (n = 0 of 22 pairs, data not shown). Connections were not more likely in 10 µM serotonin (5-HT, n = 0 of 15 pairs) or a high Ca<sup>2+</sup> (5 mM) solution (n = 0 of 4 pairs), data not shown. Taken together, unidirectional connections were evident in a small population of Shox2 INs, and properties of these connections are consistent with being mediated by chemical transmission.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Bidirectional connections are present in a large proportion of Shox2 IN pairs</title><p>Using the same protocols described above, we also observed bidirectional coupling between Shox2 INs with a higher incidence than unidirectional connections (n = 59 of 239 pairs, 51 of 155 in slices and 8 of 84 in dorsal horn-removed preparations). Specifically, action potentials evoked by current injection in one Shox2 IN produced EPSCs and EPSPs in the other Shox2 IN and vice versa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>). Unlike unidirectional connections, a postsynaptic response was present for every action potential in every sweep (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref>). The mean latency (average of 50 sweeps) for the postjunctional current, measured peak to peak, was 0.6 ± 0.5 ms (n = 26), which was significantly shorter than that measured in unidirectionally connected pairs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, Mann Whitney, p=0.0058), and likely too short to be mediated by chemical synaptic transmission. The mean peak amplitude of the corresponding postjunctional current was −11.1 ± 9.4 pA (n = 26), which was not statistically different (Mann Whitney, p=0.54) from that measured in unidirectional pairs (−10.6 ± 3.9 pA). In current clamp, it was evident that the postsynaptic EPSPs began prior to the peaks of the presynaptic action potentials, which was in stark contrast with the postsynaptic EPSPs observed in pairs that were connected unidirectionally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). In fact, in bidirectionally-connected pairs, depolarization started −8.5 ± 1.5 ms (n = 15) before the action potential peak, corresponding to the subthreshold depolarization in the current-injected cell. In the unidirectional pairs, the EPSPs began 2.0 ± 2.1 ms (n = 3) after the action potential peak (Mann Whitney, p=0.0092). The mean peak amplitude of the first EPSPs measured in bidirectionally connected pairs was 1.2 ± 1.0 mV (n = 21), which was not different (Mann Whitney, p=0.54) from that in unidirectional pairs (1.4 ± 0.6 mV).

However, the proximity of the recordings and the way in which we targeted the neurons may have biased our sample toward Shox2 INs more likely to be electrically connected since Shox2 INs were chosen for recordings by the presence of clear processes from one Shox2 IN passing in close proximity to the soma of another Shox2 IN, particularly in pairs recorded in spinal slices. It is expected that distance between neurons will be a factor in the type of connection, with incidence of electrical coupling decreasing at greater distances. However, between Shox2 INs in close proximity, there were no differences in the distances between the observed unidirectional and bidirectional pairs.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Bidirectional connections may be mediated entirely by gap junctional coupling</title><p>Mixed electrical and chemical synapses have been implicated in various systems.

Locomotor-related cellular oscillations are typically low frequency and therefore are likely to be partly transferred through gap junctions. In order to test the strength of electrical coupling between Shox2 INs as a function of frequency, we next injected subthreshold sinusoidal currents at frequencies of 0.2, 1, 2, 5, 10, and 20 Hz while monitoring the changes in membrane potentials both in the injected Shox2 IN and the electrically connected Shox2 IN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>).

As frequencies of drug evoked locomotion in neonatal mice range from approximately 0.2–0.8 Hz in isolated spinal cord preparations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Talpalar and Kiehn, 2010</xref>), this should place locomotor frequencies within a range where high coupling between Shox2 INs would occur. We reasoned that if electrical coupling played an important role in generating and promoting the rhythm in Shox2 INs, blocking gap junctions with carbenoxolone would have an effect on the frequency of locomotion. In order to test this, we recorded from a flexor-related (lumbar L2 or L3) and an extensor-related (L5) ventral root in isolated spinal cord preparations during locomotor-like activity evoked by NMDA and 5-HT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>).

Similar to neonates, electrical coupling was present in 30% of Shox2 IN pairs (n = 8/27) in the P13-17 group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A and B</xref>). Electrical coupling of Shox2 IN pairs dropped off in incidence to 10% in P23-35 mice (n = 4/41) and was not detected in adult (n = 0/22). The proportions of electrically connected Shox2 INs were significantly different between age groups (chi-square test, p=0.008). Of the pairs that were coupled, the mean electrical coupling coefficient was determined to be 13 ± 11% (n = 8) in the P13-17 mice and 5 ± 2% (n = 3) in P23-35 mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>).

Gap junctional connections are most likely to occur between nearby neurons as connexin 36 has been shown to be located on somata and proximal dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Rash et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Marina et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bautista et al., 2012</xref>). Here, the somata of Shox2 INs in paired recordings were typically within ~65 μm of each other and those with processes running between them were preferentially chosen for recordings. The way in which the pairs were targeted likely contributes to the relatively high degree of electrical coupling which was not seen in previous paired recordings where processes were not traced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dougherty et al., 2013</xref>). Consequently, by testing local interneurons, we are likely biasing our sample towards a higher degree of electrical connectivity. In contrast, it is possible that the low incidence of chemically-mediated connections detected between Shox2 INs is an underestimate since we restricted our sampling to local interneurons and slicing disrupts axonal projections and dendrites. Sparse recurrent connections within excitatory populations can support locomotor rhythm generation in computational models of rodent central pattern generators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Zhong et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Shevtsova et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bui and Brownstone, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Shevtsova and Rybak, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ausborn et al., 2018</xref>) and are thought to underlie rhythm generation in other networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Grillner, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Li et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kozlov et al., 2007</xref>), and this is even more robust when both electrical and reciprocal synapses are present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Asghar et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Li et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hull et al., 2015</xref>). Here, similar to rhythmogenic respiratory neurons in the pre-Bötzinger complex, none of the chemically coupled rhythmogenic Shox2 neurons were electrically coupled and vice versa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Rekling et al., 2000</xref>). Although it is possible that the remaining potential seen in carbenoxolone is due to mixed chemical synapse, carbenoxolone does not completely block gap junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kiehn and Tresch, 2002</xref>). Further, the time courses of the remaining potentials match with those mediated by gap junctions and do not appear to have a synaptic delay. Although we did not detect any pairs that were both electrically and chemically connected, we do not think that one connection necessarily precludes the other. Chemical connections were found at too low of an incidence to rule out the possibility that some electrically coupled neurons are also chemically connected.</p><p>We also observed a high failure rate in synaptic transmission in chemically-mediated Shox2 IN connections. This would be expected if the connections are not monosynaptic and we cannot rule out this possibility. Nevertheless, synaptic failures in unitary connections have been described in other regions of the central nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bolshakov and Siegelbaum, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Stevens and Wang, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Rekling et al., 2000</xref>) and high failure rates are linked to an enhanced propensity for long-term potentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Marina et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bolshakov and Siegelbaum, 1995</xref>). Thus, modifying synaptic fidelity between Shox2 neurons, monosynaptically or disynaptically connected, should be possible based on development, activity dependent mechanisms, or neuromodulatory control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bolshakov and Siegelbaum, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chang et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chang et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Mentis et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">O'Brien, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Marder et al., 2017</xref>). These possibilities are not mutually exclusive and raise interesting mechanisms to explore in terms of rhythm generation and dynamic circuit connectivity of the locomotor network.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Functional groups of Shox2 INs are preferentially connected</title><p>Using a triple transgenic strategy, we were able to distinguish between the two known functional populations of Shox2 INs. Approximately 1/4 of the Shox2 IN population does not express Chx10 (Shox2<sup>+</sup> non-V2a) and is thought to be part of the locomotor rhythm generator. The remaining Shox2 INs (~3/4 of population) co-express the transcription factor Chx10 (Shox2 V2a IN) and are proposed to belong to the pattern forming layer of the CPG, providing input to motoneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dougherty et al., 2013</xref>). Shox2 IN interconnections were preferential within each subpopulation (Shox2<sup>+</sup> non-V2a to Shox2<sup>+</sup> non-V2a and Shox2<sup>+</sup> V2a to Shox2<sup>+</sup> V2a). Electrical connections have previously been shown within the Chx10 population (not divided by Shox2 expression) in neonatal (P1-4) mice and coupling incidence was found to be higher among neurons with the same firing properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Zhong et al., 2010</xref>). Shox2 INs (V2a and non-V2a) display the similar firing properties to those reported in the Chx10 population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dougherty and Kiehn, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Zhong et al., 2010</xref>). Therefore, these two populations cannot be simply split by electrophysiological signatures; however, when considering subpopulations based on both molecular markers and firing properties, connectivity rates may be even higher. Similar separations by function have been previously seen both in motor neurons, where only homonymous pools are electrically connected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Walton and Navarrete, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kandler and Katz, 1995</xref>), in Hb9 neurons, where GFP populations were only electrically connected when they still contained Hb9 protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hinckley and Ziskind-Conhaim, 2006</xref>), and in descending rhythm-generating interneurons in Xenopus, which are not electrically coupled with other CPG neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Li et al., 2009</xref>), however, this is not always the case (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Eisen and Marder, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wilson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chopek et al., 2018</xref>). It is also possible that the presence/absence or range in strength of electrical coupling in Shox2 neurons is related to a further subdivision in transcription factor expression (i.e. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hayashi et al., 2018</xref>) or function (i.e. phasing relationship) of Shox2 INs. Altogether, preferential interconnectivity within molecularly-defined subsets of Shox2 INs further supports distinct functional roles of these populations.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Functional implications of interconnectivity between Shox2 INs</title><p>Gap junctional coupling is highly effective at promoting synchronization in neuronal activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kiehn and Tresch, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Personius et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wilson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Zhong et al., 2010</xref>) and has been implicated in rhythm generation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Marder and Calabrese, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Rekling et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Tresch and Kiehn, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bou-Flores and Berger, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sharifullina et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Li et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Pierce et al., 2010</xref>). Additionally, gap junctional coupling allows subthreshold activities to contribute to network function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Marder and Calabrese, 1996</xref>). Therefore, a network with prominent gap junctional coupling would require less extrinsic drive to initiate synchronous rhythmic oscillations, and this drive could be localized to a part of the population but evoked activity could spread through the network. This would allow for a small number of active neurons to rapidly synchronize specific Shox2 subpopulations. Further, the small number of neurons activated initially would not have to be the same neurons cycle to cycle, in order to result in synchronous activation of the population, as has been recently shown in respiration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Carroll and Ramirez, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kam et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Feldman and Kam, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Del Negro et al., 2018</xref>). In terms of locomotor network activity, blocking gap junctional coupling with carbenoxolone decreased the frequency of drug evoked locomotion, consistent with previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Tresch and Kiehn, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Falgairolle et al., 2017</xref>). This result is remarkably similar to the effect of removing the population of Shox2 neurons from the network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dougherty et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, it is possible that electrical connections between functionally-related Shox2 INs synchronize neuronal activity and may contribute to rhythmicity. These results should be cautiously interpreted, however, as there are alternative explanations. Gap junctions have been demonstrated between several interneuronal populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hinckley and Ziskind-Conhaim, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wilson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Zhong et al., 2010</xref>) and between motor neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Walton and Navarrete, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kandler and Katz, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Rash et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chang et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Tresch and Kiehn, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Mentis et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Marina et al., 2008</xref>). Additionally, functional electrical coupling has been reported between motor neurons and spinal excitatory interneurons in zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bhatt et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Song et al., 2016</xref>) and mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chopek et al., 2018</xref>). Lastly, carbenoxolone has been shown to have several non-specific effects, including decreasing input resistance, voltage gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents, and AMPA receptor-mediated currents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Rekling et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Vessey et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Tovar et al., 2009</xref>), which may also lead to similar effects.</p><p>Taken together, electrical coupling is prevalent in neonatal mice and preferential to functional groups of Shox2 interneurons. In addition to synchronizing functional populations, it is possible that this serves to promote rhythm generation and/or strengthen connections to downstream targets, i.e. via Hebbian mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Walton and Navarrete, 1991</xref>). Our results demonstrate that electrical coupling persists well through the transition to weight bearing stepping but could not be detected in the adult. This suggests that electrical transmission can serve as one of the mechanisms to synchronize rhythm-generating neurons during spinal circuit development, although this declines with age. In adult animals, it is possible that there is a shift in the neuronal populations requiring synchronization and that Shox2 neurons no longer play this role. We favor the possibility that as connectivity structures mature, other neuronal properties develop that can support similar functions but through different mechanisms. For example, sparse connectivity together with enhancement of intrinsic excitability or neuromodulatory control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Husch et al., 2015</xref>) may be sufficient to maintain synchronization and network function. Currently, this is speculative and requires direct experimental testing.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) <break/>or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th colspan="2">Source or <break/>reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th colspan="2">Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Genetic reagent <break/>(<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td>Shox2::Cre</td><td colspan="2">PMID: 24267650</td><td/><td colspan="2"/></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent <break/>(<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td>Rosa26-lsl- <break/>tdTomato</td><td colspan="2">Jackson <break/>Laboratory <break/></td><td>Stock #: 007909</td><td colspan="2">PMID: 20023653</td></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent <break/>(<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td>Chx10GFP</td><td colspan="2">Mutant Mouse <break/>Regional <break/>Resource Center</td><td>MMRRC Cat#: <break/>011391-UCD</td><td colspan="2">Now called <break/>Vsx2-EGFP; <break/>PMID: 14586460</td></tr><tr><td>Chemical <break/>compound, drug</td><td>carbenoxolone <break/>disodium salt</td><td colspan="2">Sigma</td><td>C4790</td><td colspan="2"/></tr><tr><td>Chemical <break/>compound, drug</td><td>5-HT, serotonin <break/>creatinine sulfate <break/>monohydrate</td><td colspan="2">Sigma</td><td>H7752</td><td colspan="2"/></tr><tr><td>Chemical <break/>compound, drug</td><td>NMDA, N-Methyl- <break/>D-aspartic acid</td><td colspan="2">Sigma</td><td>M3262</td><td colspan="2"/></tr><tr><td>Chemical <break/>compound, drug</td><td>CNQX, 6-cyano-7- <break/>nitroquinoxaline-2,3- <break/>dione disodium salt</td><td colspan="2">Tocris</td><td>1045</td><td colspan="2"/></tr><tr><td>Chemical <break/>compound, drug</td><td>AP-5, 2-amino-5- <break/>phosphopentanoic <break/>acid</td><td colspan="2">Tocris</td><td>1234</td><td colspan="2"/></tr><tr><td>Chemical <break/>compound, drug</td><td>CPP, 3-((R)−2- <break/>Carboxypiperazin <break/>-4-yl)-propyl-1- <break/>phosphonic <break/>acid</td><td colspan="2">Tocris</td><td>2411</td><td colspan="2"/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>Experiments were performed using Shox2::Cre (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dougherty et al., 2013</xref>); Rosa26-flox-Stop-flox-tdTomato (Ai9 from Jax Mice, #007909, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Madisen et al., 2010</xref>) or in Shox2::Cre; Ai9; Chx10eGFP (also called Vsx2-eGFP, MMRRC, 011391-UCD, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gong et al., 2003</xref>) transgenic mice.

Briefly, neonatal (P0-P5) mice were decapitated and eviscerated. Spinal cords were then removed in ice cold dissecting solution containing in mM: 111 NaCl, 3 KCl, 11 glucose, 25 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 3.7 MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 1.1 KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, and 0.25 CaCl<sub>2</sub>. For experiments in a dorsal horn-removed preparation, the dorsal lumbar region (L2-L5) was subsequently removed from one side of the cord with a surgical knife in order to gain access to the Shox2 INs. For slice experiments, lumbar spinal cord (L2-5) was sectioned transversely (300–350 µm) with a vibrating microtome (Leica Microsystems). Dorsal horn-removed preparations and slices were next transferred to room temperature (RT) artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) recording solution containing in mM: 111 NaCl, 3 KCl, 11 glucose, 25 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 1.3 MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 1.1 KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, and 2.5 CaCl<sub>2</sub>. Cords and slices were incubated for at least 30 min prior to recordings. Dissecting and recording solutions were continuously aerated with 95%/5% CO<sub>2</sub>/O<sub>2.</sub> Slices from older mice (P13-P17, P23-P35, and &gt;P55) were obtained in a similar manner with the following differences. Mice &gt; P5 were anesthetized with a mixture of ketamine (150 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg) prior to decapitation. Cords were isolated in ice cold glycerol-based ACSF solution containing in mM: 3 KCl, 11 glucose, 25 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 1.3 MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 1.1 KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 2.5 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 222 glycerol. Following sectioning, slices were transferred to ACSF at 37°C for 30 min and then passively equilibrated to RT for another 30 min before recording.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Patch-clamp recordings</title><p>All recordings were performed at room temperature. Fluorescently labeled (tdTomato) Shox2 INs were visualized with a 63X objective lens on a BX51WI scope (Olympus) using LED illumination (X-cite). Patch electrodes were pulled to tip resistances of 5–8 MΩ using a multi-stage puller (Sutter Instruments) and were filled with intracellular solution which contained in mM: 128 K-gluconate, 10 HEPES, 0.0001 CaCl2, one glucose, 4 NaCl, 5 ATP, and 0.3 GTP. In some experiments, biocytin (2 mg/ml, Sigma) was included in the patch electrode. Cells were targeted based on fluorescence and using differential interference contrast (DIC) optics for pairwise whole-cell patch recordings. Recordings were made from pairs of neurons located in close proximity and those with processes appearing to pass the soma of another cell were preferentially targeted. Data was collected with a Multiclamp 700B amplifier (Molecular Devices) and Clampex software (pClamp9, Molecular Devices). Signals were digitized at 10 kHz and filtered at 6 kHz.</p><p>To test for connectivity between two patched Shox2 INs, a train of five short (10 ms) strong (100–300 pA) current pulses (interstimulus interval of 20 ms), were applied to the Shox2 IN recorded with electrode 1, ‘Shox2 IN 1’, while the resulting synaptic activity in the other Shox2 IN was recorded with the other electrode, ‘Shox2 IN 2’. This was repeated for a total of 50 sweeps, with a start-to-start interval of 2 s, for offline averaging. In current clamp, biased current was applied to ‘Shox2 IN 2’ so that its membrane potential was around −65 mV. In voltage clamp, ‘Shox2 IN 2’ was held at −60 mV. The same protocol was then reversed and applied from ‘Shox2 IN 2’ to ‘Shox2 IN 1’. Any sweep in which a current pulse failed to produce an action potential in the injected cell was removed prior to averaging which resulted in 25–50 sweeps being averaged for each test. Additionally, series of hyperpolarizing and depolarizing steps were run sequentially to determine firing properties, membrane properties, and electrical connectivity. Coupling coefficient (k) was calculated using the depolarizing current step prior to rheobase and defined as the ratio of the voltage response in the postsynaptic cell to the presynaptic cell. Rheobase was defined as the lowest current step (in 5 pA increments) that evoked an action potential in Shox2 INs. Not every protocol was run for all pairs of neurons. For many of the pairs, either the voltage clamp or the current clamp protocol was run to test for connections. Both were run in later recordings. The protocol to determine coupling coefficient was added partway through the study. In cases where one of the two cells was lost or recording integrity declined, the protocol was not included in analyses. Data from dorsal horn-removed experiments was included in the analysis of incidence, amplitude, and latency. Pharmacology, coupling coefficients, and &gt;P5 experiments were exclusively performed in slices. Following the paired recording, an image of electrode position was captured. Distance between pairs was estimated by measuring the distance between the tips of the electrodes from the image file. An image was not collected for nine connected pairs and we began capturing images for non-connected pairs late in the study. If there was no image, the pairs were not included in the distance analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Ventral root recordings</title><p>Ventral root activity (signal band-pass filtered 10–1,000 Hz; gain 1000) was recorded from two lumbar (L) 2–5 ventral roots with tightly-fitting glass suction electrodes.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Spinal Shox2 interneuron interconnectivity related to function and development&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Ronald Calabrese as the Senior/Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have also agreed to reveal their identity: Robert M Brownstone (Reviewer #2); Ronald M Harris-Warrick (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors present an elegant electrophysiological analysis of connectivity between Shox2 INs in neonatal and post-natal mouse spinal cord slices. They find a high incidence of bidirectional electrical connectivity and a much lower incidence of unidirectional, failure prone, chemical connectivity (excitatory). They present extensive electrophysiological evidence supporting the electrical connectivity. They show that electrical connectivity declines over the first postnatal month and is apparently absent in adults. They also show that within the Shox2 IN population differentiated by Chx10+/- that electrical connectivity is subclass specific. This is an important observation because previous work has demonstrated that these two classes are involved in pattern (Chx10+) and rhythm (Chx10-) generation respectfully.</p><p>The data presented is convincing and clean. These types of detailed studies are necessary to crack the problem of how locomotory rhythms are generated in the spinal cord and how they mature during post-natal development.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The writing in Introduction and Discussion should be cleaned up and made more concise. Eliminating redundancy, especially in Discussion, will make the paper more readable and impactful.</p><p>2) The expert reviewers expressed concern that the conclusion that the chemical unidirectional connections may not indeed be monosynaptic.</p><p>3) The Discussion of the role of electrical coupling in rhythmogenesis in the neonate is interesting, but the authors do not show that the electrical coupling is responsible for rhythm generation – would need a specific knock-out to do so, and caution is advised. The idea that electrical coupling is replaced by something else in the adult also needs some caution.</p><p>4) There is a major concern that some data is presented as mean and SEM. We request that the data be presented with all points illustrated as in Figure 6C with mean sd or in whisker barrel format.</p><p>5) Several major comments from the expert reviewers are appended to amplify these primary concerns.</p><p>A) Carbenoxelone: unfortunately, we do not have a specific and reversible gap junction blocker, with Cbx being as good as it gets. Nonetheless, the authors should take care in pointing out the caveats (e.g. calcium channel blocking). Also, did they try it in any unidirectionally/chemically connected pairs? This might help to tease out non-GJ-related effects. Also, on a more minor note, how long was the Cbx applied before effects were seen (subsection “Bidirectional connections may be mediated entirely by gap junctional coupling”)?</p><p>B) The preparation: it seems that the authors have done experiments both in slices (I assume transverse but they should state this) and dorsal horn removed preps. It is unclear which experiments were which – I think there should be clarity here (throughout the manuscript, but see, for example, the last paragraph of the Introduction – I can't tell what's what). Also, how deep were the neurons in the latter preparation? And do we know anything about the path that their axons take? Subsection “Unidirectional connections between spinal Shox2 INs are sparse”, end of first paragraph – they expect the connections to be preserved but what's the evidence? Also, were the distances in connectivity different in the different preps? It sounds like the n's aren't high enough to know, but this should all be clear.</p><p>C) Chemical transmission: on the above note, of course it is difficult to prove something doesn't exist. I could certainly imagine that these neurons are connected with one another over longer distances, which could be evident in the dorsal horn removed prep, or in horizontal slices. How is there inter-segmental coordination of rhythm, for example? So I think some rewording acknowledging this – i.e. local connectivity only was tested – would be helpful.</p><p>D) It is not clear to me that the chemical transmission is monosynaptic. (On that note what temperature were the preps?) How can the authors be sure these aren't disynaptic, thus explaining the low incidence in slice as well as the failures? If they are disynaptic, a whole section of the Discussion can be reduced. (Related: subsection “Unidirectional connections between spinal Shox2 INs are sparse”, third paragraph – why is the EPSP so much faster than the EPSC?)</p><p>E) The authors in several locations discuss examples of coupling between like neurons. But this is not always the case in nervous systems, and in fact 100s of millions of years ago, evolution led to coupling of heterogeneous populations of neurons – which has some significant advantages. This has been seen in many invertebrate systems (see crustacean STG work from Marder lab (Eisen and Marder, 1982), for example), and in the mouse spinal cord (see Wilson, Cowan and Brownstone, 2007).</p><p>F) Statistics: I have only one issue with their reporting. I will say (as I always do) that the SEM should be eliminated from neuroscience. It is completely meaningless. We are interested in biological variability, which is shown by the standard deviation. We are not particularly interested in mean values, which are what the SEM reflects. It's great that the raw data are shown in places, but it should always be shown, and I would suggest showing either the s.d. (weaker) or using box-whisker plots on top of the raw data (stronger). And in the first paragraph of the subsection “Shox2 electrical coupling between Shox2 INs declines in incidence and strength with age”: there is no tendency: the statistical test showed that the null hypothesis – that they're the same – cannot be rejected. That's why we use statistics.</p><p>G) Conceptual model: It would be nice to understand in the Discussion what the authors are proposing. There are a lot of vague sentences like &quot;intriguing functional consequences.&quot; I would suggest they explicitly present a conceptual model. (A computational model would be nice, but that's for the next paper, I would imagine!)</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.42519.023</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The writing in Introduction and Discussion should be cleaned up and made more concise.

We have adjusted these statements in the Discussion accordingly, adding in additional references to caveats and other possibilities. We have also toned down and clarified the statement regarding electrical coupling being replaced in the adult. We show that electrical coupling decreases in both incidence and strength in older preparations (and is not detected in adult). The point we were attempting to make was that the roles electrical coupling play in synchronization, if necessary in the adult, would be carried out by another mechanism (or another population). We hope this has been made clear in our edited version.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) There is a major concern that some data is presented as mean and SEM. We request that the data be presented with all points illustrated as in Figure 6C with mean sd or in whisker barrel format.</p></disp-quote><p>All graphs have been edited and reported values in the text have been changed to mean +/- SD. All data is now shown as individual data points as mean +/- SD. Mean +/- SD was chosen so that it corresponds directly with the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Several major comments from the expert reviewers are appended to amplify these primary concerns.</p></disp-quote><p>These are addressed below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A) Carbenoxelone: unfortunately, we do not have a specific and reversible gap junction blocker, with Cbx being as good as it gets. Nonetheless, the authors should take care in pointing out the caveats (e.g. calcium channel blocking).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that there are caveats to using carbenoxolone and have expanded our mention of these, particularly related to interpreting network behavior, in both the Results (subsection “Electrical synapses between Shox2 INs act as low-pass filters”) the Discussion (subsection “Functional implications of interconnectivity between Shox2 Ins”, first paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, did they try it in any unidirectionally/chemically connected pairs? This might help to tease out non-GJ-related effects.</p></disp-quote><p>Carbenoxolone was not tested on unidirectionally/chemically connected Shox2 IN pairs. We agree that this is an experiment we would like to perform but the rate at which unidirectional pairs is found is very low. Although it does not speak to the specificity of the blocker, the other evidence (i.e. hyperpolarization transfer) strongly points to gap junctions being the major, if not exclusive source of coupling. Instead, we tried to get at non-gap junction related effects by performing the opposite, we applied CNQX and APV to bidirectionally connected pairs. Here, no changes were observed in the amplitude of the EPSPs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, on a more minor note, how long was the Cbx applied before effects were seen (subsection “Bidirectional connections may be mediated entirely by gap junctional coupling”)?</p></disp-quote><p>Analysis was carried out 30 minutes after washing in carbenoxolone. In some cases, the stimulation protocols were repeated 40 or 50 minutes after the addition of carbenoxolone and there was a further reduction in the EPSPs compared to those after 30 minutes. However, for consistency, all of the analysis included in the manuscript was taken 30 minutes after the drug was applied. This is now explicitly stated.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>B) The preparation: it seems that the authors have done experiments both in slices (I assume transverse but they should state this) and dorsal horn removed preps. It is unclear which experiments were which – I think there should be clarity here (throughout the manuscript, but see, for example, the last paragraph of the Introduction – I can't tell what's what).</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for pointing this out. Slices were transverse and this has now been specified in the Materials and methods and the Results. We had compressed the slice and dorsal horn removed data for simplicity, but we agree that the information should be included in the text. Most experiments were performed in slices but the initial P0-5 experiments were performed in the dorsal horn removed preparation. Data from these dorsal horn removed experiments was included in the analysis of incidence, amplitude, and latency. Pharmacology, coupling coefficients, and &gt;P5 experiments were exclusively performed in slices. Bidirectionally coupled pairs were found in both preparations – 46 of 134 pairs in slices and 8 of 84 pairs in dorsal horn removed. We think that the increased incidence rate in slices is due to visibility and our ability to better trace the processes, rather than what remains intact or the rostral-caudal/dorsal-ventral position of one cell relative to the other. It may also be due to the proximity of the neurons in slices compared to the neurons sampled in the dorsal horn removed preparation (see last response to this point). Unidirectional pairs were (perhaps surprisingly) found at relatively similar incidence rates in the two preparations – 2 of 134 pairs (1.5%) in slices and 2 in 84 pairs (2.4%) in dorsal horn removed. These details have been added to the Results section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, how deep were the neurons in the latter preparation?</p><p>And do we know anything about the path that their axons take? Subsection “Unidirectional connections between spinal Shox2 INs are sparse”, end of first paragraph – they expect the connections to be preserved but what's the evidence?</p></disp-quote><p>The neurons targeted are typically not in the first cell layer at the surface in the dorsal horn removed preparation but they are not far from it, likely 25-150μm from the surface. The depth relative to the dorsal or ventral surface of the intact cord varies since the dorsal horn is removed by hand. In other experiments where this preparation was sectioned transversely after the experiment, the part cut away varied but was rarely far off (dorsal-ventrally) from the level of the central canal.</p><p>Shox2 neuronal processes remain local and are primarily oriented medial-laterally (Dougherty et al., 2013, see Figure 1K). Therefore, we expect local connections to be largely preserved in both 300-350 µm slices and the dorsal horn removed preparation. However, we agree that any slicing procedure has the potential to disrupt axons and/or dendrites, which would particularly compromise chemical synapses.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, were the distances in connectivity different in the different preps? It sounds like the n's aren't high enough to know, but this should all be clear.</p></disp-quote><p>Neurons in electrically connected pairs in slices were closer together (40 +/- 19 μm, n=37) than in dorsal horn removed preparations (56 +/- 20 μm, n=8). Given that neurons in non-connected pairs were not significantly different from connected ones in both slices (49 +/- 14 μm, n=15) and dorsal horn removed (62 +/- 31 μm, n=7) and that the dual patching began in dorsal horn removed, this is likely due to the experimenter becoming more skilled and bolder in patching cells closer together with time (the closer the neurons are together, the more likely one is to disrupt the first seal while going for the second). Although the n’s are too small to say much about unidirectional pairs, we can report the distances for all four cases (25 μm and 48 μm in slices, 32 μm and 65 μm in dorsal horn removed). These values in the different preparations have been added to the text and the graph in Figure 3 has been replaced.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>C) Chemical transmission: on the above note, of course it is difficult to prove something doesn't exist. I could certainly imagine that these neurons are connected with one another over longer distances, which could be evident in the dorsal horn removed prep, or in horizontal slices. How is there inter-segmental coordination of rhythm, for example? So I think some rewording acknowledging this – i.e. local connectivity only was tested – would be helpful.</p><p>We agree that Shox2 INs are likely connected beyond the very local radii tested. As Shox2 IN processes mainly remain within segment, we do not think these neurons are involved in intrasegmental coordination but we are not testing this and we agree that there must be neurons with such connections. Our bias in testing very local connections is now stated in both the Results (subsection “Unidirectional connections between spinal Shox2 INs are sparse”, first paragraph) and the Discussion (subsection “Shox2 INs are interconnected by electrical synapses”, first paragraph).</p><p>D) It is not clear to me that the chemical transmission is monosynaptic. (On that note what temperature were the preps?) How can the authors be sure these aren't disynaptic, thus explaining the low incidence in slice as well as the failures? If they are disynaptic, a whole section of the Discussion can be reduced.</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned above, we cannot say definitively that the chemical transmission is monosynaptic, rather than disynaptic, and have reworded this in both the Results and Discussion. The experiments were done at room temperature, which may also contribute to the high synaptic failure rate. This has been clarified in the Materials and methods. The section the reviewer is referring to was condensed in the reworking of the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(Related: subsection “Unidirectional connections between spinal Shox2 INs are sparse”, third paragraph – why is the EPSP so much faster than the EPSC?)</p><p>The EPSP latency is shorter because it is measured as the start of the subthreshold depolarization in the postsynaptic neuron but the EPSC latency was measured as the peak of the inward current measured in the postsynaptic neuron. We have changed the wording to make this clear.</p><p>E) The authors in several locations discuss examples of coupling between like neurons. But this is not always the case in nervous systems, and in fact 100s of millions of years ago, evolution led to coupling of heterogeneous populations of neurons – which has some significant advantages. This has been seen in many invertebrate systems (see crustacean STG work from Marder lab (Eisen and Marder, 1982), for example), and in the mouse spinal cord (see Wilson, Cowan and Brownstone, 2007).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and initially restricted our statements to rodent spinal cord; however, we did omit Wilson et al., 2007. Thanks for pointing that out. We have reformulated these sections to include that reference and the more recent one from the Zhang and Brownstone groups (Chopek et al., 2018) which also contradicts our original statement.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>F) Statistics: I have only one issue with their reporting. I will say (as I always do) that the SEM should be eliminated from neuroscience. It is completely meaningless. We are interested in biological variability, which is shown by the standard deviation. We are not particularly interested in mean values, which are what the SEM reflects. It's great that the raw data are shown in places, but it should always be shown, and I would suggest showing either the s.d. (weaker) or using box-whisker plots on top of the raw data (stronger).</p></disp-quote><p>The point is well taken and now all the data is presented as mean ± sd. Additionally, all data points are shown in bar graphs with SD bars (to be consistent with values reported in the text). Raw data sets used in the graphs are appended as requested by <italic>eLife</italic>’s transparent data policy.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>And in the first paragraph of the subsection “Shox2 electrical coupling between Shox2 INs declines in incidence and strength with age”: there is no tendency: the statistical test showed that the null hypothesis – that they're the same – cannot be rejected. That's why we use statistics.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct and we have removed this statement.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>G) Conceptual model: It would be nice to understand in the Discussion what the authors are proposing. There are a lot of vague sentences like &quot;intriguing functional consequences.&quot; I would suggest they explicitly present a conceptual model. (A computational model would be nice, but that's for the next paper, I would imagine!)</p></disp-quote><p>We have made every effort to remove the vague sentences in the revised Discussion. We appreciate the comment and have added our conceptual model as the last paragraph of the revised Discussion. (Stay tuned!)</p></body></sub-article></article>
