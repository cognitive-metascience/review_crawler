This effect of insulin utilizes the FOXO-dependent regulation of the <italic>thor</italic> gene, which encodes the <italic>Drosophila</italic> homologue of the eif-4e binding protein (4eBP). A critical target of this regulatory mechanism is Complexin, a synaptic protein known to regulate synaptic vesicle exocytosis.

The loss of normal synapse function is believed to be an important contributor to all these disorders suggesting that changes in insulin signaling can influence synaptic connectivity throughout the nervous system. For example, analysis of human patients with type II diabetes (T2DM) reveals changes in brain structures, including synapse numbers, which correlate with decreased cognitive performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Qiu et al., 2014</xref>). In addition, numerous rodent studies have demonstrated that changes in peripheral and cerebral insulin result in changes to synapse function and plasticity in both the hippocampus and retinae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gispen and Biessels, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hombrebueno et al., 2014</xref>). Rodent and human studies have also demonstrated that changes in normal insulin signaling can alter peripheral synapses including neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allen et al., 2015a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2015b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fahim et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Francis et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Garcia et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Ramji et al., 2007</xref>). Despite the wide-spread effects of altered insulin signaling on synapse function, the cellular mechanisms underlying the effects insulin signaling on synapse function, especially the control of neurotransmitter release, are poorly understood.</p><p>There exist well-established evolutionarily conserved targets of insulin signaling that have been implicated in the effects of insulin on synapse function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kleinridders et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Park, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Plum et al., 2005</xref>). This includes the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex that is positively regulated by insulin signaling. In the postsynaptic compartment, TOR signaling has been directly implicated in the regulation of post-synaptic function including the formation of new synapses and the generation of retrograde signaling during homeostatic synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Penney et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Stoica et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Takei and Nawa, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Weston et al., 2012</xref>). The role of TOR signaling within the presynaptic nerve terminal is less clear. Another important target of insulin signaling is the FOXO family of transcription factors. Insulin negatively regulates FOXO via phosphorylation by Akt in both flies and rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Puig et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Teleman et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Yamamoto and Tatar, 2011</xref>). Previous studies have established that FOXO is required in <italic>Drosophila</italic> larval motor neurons for synapse growth, synaptic vesicle recycling, and for the control of neuronal excitability downstream of PI3K signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Howlett et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Nechipurenko and Broihier, 2012</xref>). In mammals, recent studies have revealed a requirement for FOXO6, a FOXO family member highly expressed in the hippocampus, during learning and memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Salih et al., 2012</xref>). It was shown in these studies that FOXO6 was required for the expression of genes involved in neurotransmission supporting a direct role for FOXO in the regulation of synapse function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Salih et al., 2012</xref>). It is unclear whether insulin signaling regulates FOXO activity in neurons in any system. In the present study, we present evidence that in adult Drosophila motor neurons, insulin signaling negatively regulates the presynaptic release of neurotransmitter via the FOXO-dependent regulation of the translational inhibitor the eukaryotic initiation factor 4e binding protein (4eBP). The translational target of this signaling system appears to be the Complexin protein, which is known to regulate the exocytosis of synaptic vesicles providing direct link between neuronal insulin signaling and neurotransmitter release.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Dietary protein regulates the probability of release at the CM9 NMJ</title><p>Electrical recordings from the CM9 muscle group on the adult fly proboscis previously revealed a decrease in the amount of neurotransmitter released from the CM9 NMJ in flies raised on a high-calorie diet compared to flies raised on a low-calorie diet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Rawson et al., 2012</xref>). The CM9 NMJ is ideal for this research since it combines motor neuron-specific genetic manipulations with a robust synaptic recording preparation allowing us to interrogate the cell autonomous effects of diet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Using this system, we have extended our initial observations by first determining that changing only the yeast component of the diet is sufficient to alter neurotransmission. Animals raised for 21 days on food containing 100 mg/ml of yeast (1X) release nearly twice as much neurotransmitter, represented as quantal content (the number of quanta per action potential) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fatt and Katz, 1951</xref>), compared to flies raised on food containing 200 mg/ml of yeast (2X) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–F</xref>; see <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref> for all electrophysiological recording data). We further find that shifting 20-day-old flies from the 1X diet to the 2X diet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) resulted in a gradual reduction in the quantal content (QC) that reaches the level of neurotransmission observed in 2X animals within 24 hr of diet shift (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and F</xref>) supporting that the effects of high-protein diet on release are likely not due to the accumulation of diet-related pathologies that result in reduced neurotransmitter release. In these recordings, we observed no effect of diet on the amplitude of the spontaneous release events (mEPSPs), the resting membrane potential, or the resistance of the muscle demonstrating that the effects of diet on presynaptic function are not due to changes in the excitability of the post-synaptic CM9 muscle fibers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Davis, 2013</xref>). Paired pulse analysis at the CM9 NMJ reveals that flies raised on 1X diet show pronounced synaptic depression when EPSPs were evoked with a 50-ms interpulse interval that was absent at CM9 NMJs in flies raised on the 2X diet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G and H</xref>). Under our recording conditions, this result is consistent with a reduction in the probability of release at CM9 NMJs in animals subjected to the 2X diet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Zucker and Regehr, 2002</xref>). Hypertonic challenge of NMJs with sucrose has been used to estimate the size of the readily-releasable pool at Drosophila NMJs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mahoney et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Müller and Davis, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Yoshihara et al., 2010</xref>). We find that there is no significant difference in the size of the sucrose-sensitive pool of synaptic vesicles (SVs) at the CM9 NMJs in flies raised on a 1X diet compared to flies raised on a 2X diet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I–K</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Rosenmund and Stevens, 1996</xref>). Combined with our previous observations of a lack of effect of diet on synaptic area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Rawson et al., 2012</xref>), these data support that increases in the protein content of the diet reduces the probability of SV release at the CM9 NMJ.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16807.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Effects of dietary protein concentrations on neurotransmission at the CM9 NMJ.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Diagram of Drosophila head indicating the location of the Cibarial Muscle 9 (CM9).

Previous studies in <italic>Drosophila</italic> using similar dietary conditions have shown that changes in diet can alter insulin signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Grönke et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Morris et al., 2012</xref>). To confirm that our diet conditions resulted in changes in insulin signaling, we performed immunoblot analysis of both phosphorylated Insulin receptor (InR) and phosphorylated Akt, reporters of increased insulin signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bai et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bjedov et al., 2010</xref>). This analysis found that both the 2X diet and the 1-2X diet shift conditions resulted in increased phosphorylation of InR and Akt compared to the 1X diet condition supporting that our 2X and 1-2X diet conditions result in increased insulin signaling in our flies. Consistent with insulin signaling in the CM9 motor neuron being responsible for the effects of diet on SV release, we observe that CM9-specific knock-down of the Drosophila IRS-1 homologue <italic>chico (chico<sup>RNAi</sup>)</italic> in flies raised on the 2X and 1-2X shift diets resulted in a significant increase SV release compared to the 2X controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J–L</xref>). This effect of <italic>chico<sup>RNAi</sup></italic>on SV release in flies raised on the 2X diet was phenocopied by the overexpression of a dominant negative insulin receptor (<italic>InR<sup>DN</sup></italic>) in the CM9 motor neuron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K and L</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Peru Y Colón de Portugal et al., 2012</xref>). We also observe that there is no difference in neurotransmitter release between <italic>chico<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> animals raised on 1X, 2X or 1-2X diets versus 1X controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K and L</xref>), except that <italic>chico<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> animals raised on 1X have slightly increased EPSPs (p=0.032) compared to 1X controls consistent with low-level insulin signaling even in animals raised on a 1X diet. Finally, the increase in neurotransmitter release observed in the <italic>chico<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> flies raised on the 2X diet was suppressed by the simultaneous knock-down of <italic>4eBP</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K–L</xref>), consistent with 4eBP functioning downstream of Chico during the regulation of neurotransmission in response to diet. This epistasis between <italic>chico</italic> and <italic>4eBP</italic> is similar to what has been recently observed for <italic>Drosophila</italic> lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bai et al., 2015</xref>). The regulation of neurotransmission by insulin signaling appears to be specific to the adult life stage since we do not observe the same effects of diet or presynaptic knockdown of <italic>4eBP</italic> or <italic>chico</italic> on SV release from larval NMJs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Because of the role of 4eBP in the inhibition of translation, our data suggests that insulin signaling results in the translation of a negative regulator(s) of SV release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>). To investigate this model, flies were raised on a 1X diet were fed the protein translation inhibitor cycloheximide (cmx) for 1 hr prior to being shifted to 2X diet supplemented with cmx for 24 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>). We predict that this 1-2X shift diet results in an increase in insulin signaling within the CM9 motor neuron resulting in increased protein translation, which is supported by our immunoblot analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). We find that cycloheximide effectively inhibits the reduction in SV release in response to a shift from 1X to 2X diet conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C and E</xref>) without significant effects on the amplitudes of the mEPSPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2D</xref>).

Analysis of <italic>4eBP</italic> mRNA levels in thoracic motor neurons purified by FACS from flies raised on a 1X diet, a 2X diet, or subjected to a diet switch from a 1X diet to a 2X diet reveals that <italic>4eBP</italic> mRNA levels are sensitive to diet and that during diet shift the declines in <italic>4eBP</italic> mRNA levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) correlate with our observed declines in SV release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). This suggested that the effects of diet on SV release are due to the transcriptional regulation of <italic>4eBP</italic>. Previous studies have identified dFOXO-binding sites near the 5’ end of the <italic>4eBP</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Puig et al., 2003</xref>). Using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) with anti-FOXO antibodies, we found that these dFOXO-binding sites in the <italic>4eBP</italic> promoter region were enriched in our dFOXO ChIP of thoracic ganglion isolated from animals raised on a 1X diet as compared to animals raised on a 2X diet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). This difference was not due to changes in <italic>dFOXO</italic> protein levels under our diet conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). This supports that dFOXO binding to the <italic>4eBP</italic> gene is increased under our 1X diet condition compared to the 2X diet condition consistent with dFOXO driving the expression of <italic>4eBP</italic> under 1X diet conditions. Importantly, these molecular data suggest that the regulation of 4eBP mRNA levels by diet is conserved among all motor neurons and not specific to CM9 MNs. Electrophysiological recordings from CM9 NMJs in <italic>dFOXO</italic> mutants raised on 1X, 2X or 1-2X shift diets found that neurotransmission is reduced in <italic>dFOXO</italic> mutants compared to 1X controls but are not different than the 2X controls, similar to what we observed in the <italic>4eBP<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E–G</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>).

An analogous process is the translational control of post-synaptic function by BDNF, which utilizes RNA particles consisting of target mRNAs, translational machinery, transport proteins and RNA-binding proteins such as the Staufen-family of RNA-binding proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Leal et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Takei et al., 2004</xref>). Therefore, we investigated whether Drosophila Staufen was involved in the effects of diet on neurotransmitter release at the CM9 NMJ. Similar to what we observed with cycloheximide, we found the RNAi knockdown of Staufen (<italic>staufen<sup>RNAi</sup></italic>) in CM9 motor neurons blocked the reduction in neurotransmitter in response to diet shift (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,C and D</xref>) without altering muscle sensitivity to glutamate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). These results support the model that a Staufen bound mRNA is involved in the effects of diet on neurotransmitter release. Recently, the collection of mRNAs bound to Staufen2 in mammalian brain tissues was defined and a number of important presynaptic regulators of synapse function were identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Heraud-Farlow et al., 2013</xref>).

Immunofluorescent microscopy of CM9 NMJs in flies raised on 1X and 2X diets found that Complexin staining was increased at CM9 NMJs in animals on a 2X diet compared to animals on the 1X diet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and B</xref>). We used deconvolution microscopy to quantify the intensity of Complexin staining at the CM9 NMJ and find that the average maximum pixel intensity of Complexin staining is significantly increased at NMJs from animals raised on the 2X diet compared to the 1X diet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>) and that the distribution of m.p.i values is also significantly different (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>; see source data file for Kolmogorov-Smirmov test results). Furthermore, <italic>chico<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> animals raised on a 2X diet had significantly reduced Complexin levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Identical results were observed for median and mean pixel intensity as well (data not shown). Because our molecular analyses suggested that this signaling system also functioned in motor neurons located within the thoracic ganglion, we investigate synaptic Complexin levels at the NMJs formed on the lateral abdominal muscles (LAMs), which are innervated by motor neurons found within the thoracic ganglion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hebbar et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Krzemien et al., 2012</xref>). Using an identical approach to quantifying Complexin at the CM9 NMJs, we find that there is significantly more Complexin at the LAM NMJs in flies raised on a 2X diet compared to flies raised on a 1X diet supporting that this signaling system is present in LAM motor neurons as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B–D</xref>). Functionally, we find that reduction of one copy of the <italic>complexin</italic> gene (<italic>cpx<sup>SH1</sup></italic>/+) significantly increases quantal content at CM9 NMJs in animals raised on both the 1X and 2X diets compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E and F</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>).

Conversely, we observe a reduction in quantal content if we overexpress Complexin in the CM9 motor neuron of animals raised on a 1X diet compared to 1X diet controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6K–M</xref>).

This control of neurotransmission by insulin signaling utilizes the FOXO transcription factor to transcriptionally regulate the eukaryotic initiation factor 4e binding protein (4eBP, also known as Thor in <italic>Drosophila</italic>), a negative regulator of cap-dependent translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gingras et al., 1999</xref>). Importantly, our data suggest that the control of neurotransmitter release by insulin signaling is dependent on the diet conditions and likely does not reflect a role for insulin in basal neurotransmitter release. Our data supports the model that repression of FOXO activity due to insulin signaling results in reduced levels of <italic>4eBP</italic> mRNA, subsequent increased protein translation, and reduced SV release. The activity of 4eBP is also regulated by phosphorylation via the actions of the target of rapamycin complex (TOR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Beretta et al., 1996</xref>) and numerous studies have implicated the TOR complex in the regulation of synapse function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Costa-Mattioli et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hoeffer and Klann, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Penney et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Takei et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Weston et al., 2012</xref>). The regulation of neurotransmission by diet at the CM9 NMJ appears to be largely independent of TOR since the effect of diet on neurotransmission is not affected by rapamycin, a potent inhibitor of the TOR. Importantly, we observe that our rapamycin treatment condition does result in the predicted change in the phosphorylation state of 4eBP demonstrating that TOR can regulate 4eBP in adult Drosophila motor neurons. Because most of the data on the effects of TOR on synapse function suggest a post-synaptic role for this complex, these data suggest that the regulation of 4eBP within the CM9 motor neuron is compartmentalized with the presynaptic pool regulated specifically by FOXO and the post-synaptic pool regulated by TOR. The localization of the TOR complex in neurons is unknown, but it presumably is localized within the cytoplasm and lysosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Betz and Hall, 2013</xref>). Whether TOR is excluded from the presynaptic terminal or enriched within the postsynaptic compartment remains to be investigated.</p><p>There exist three members of the 4eBP family in mammals with 4eBP2 being the most highly expressed family member in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Banko et al., 2005</xref>). Analysis of 4eBP2 knock-out mice has revealed that this protein is required for a broad range of cognitive and motor behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Banko et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gkogkas et al., 2013</xref>). The changes in behavior observed in 4eBP2 knock-out mice correlate with changes in synapse function that are highlighted by changes in post-synaptic glutamate receptor function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Banko et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bidinosti et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gkogkas et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Ran et al., 2013</xref>). To date, there is no evidence from these studies of an effect of the 4eBP2 knock-out on presynaptic function. In addition to effects on glutamate receptor function, 4eBP2 has also been implicated in the regulation of neuroligin levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gkogkas et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Khoutorsky et al., 2015</xref>), a post-synaptic scaffolding protein that functions to regulate synaptogenesis and neurotransmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Craig and Kang, 2007</xref>). The regulation of neurotransmission by neuroligin is likely due to its trans-synaptic interaction with the presynaptic binding protein neurexin, a cell adhesion molecule known to regulate synaptic vesicle exocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Südhof, 2008</xref>). Thus, changes in post-synaptic neuroligin levels can result in increased presynaptic function, although this would represent a non-autonomous role for 4eBP on neurotransmitter release. It is unclear if altered neuroligin-neurexin signaling contributes to the neurotransmission phenotypes observed in the 4eBP2 knock-out mice.</p><p>We find that phosphorylation of 4eBP by dTOR has no effect on the regulation of neurotransmitter release by insulin signaling in the CM9 MN. This result suggests that there might exist separate pools of 4eBP within the neuron that specify the effects of TOR versus FOXO on synapse function. Currently, it is unclear how the compartmentalization of 4eBP activity is achieved within the pre- versus postsynaptic compartments. We have found that Staufen binds to <italic>4eBP</italic> mRNA in motor neurons and is required for the effects of diet on neurotransmission. In addition to mRNA transport, Staufen is also known to bind nascent mRNAs and mediate their nuclear export (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Elvira et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jansen and Niessing, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Liu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Macchi et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Miki and Yoneda, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Miki et al., 2005</xref>). Perhaps, the association of Staufen with nascent <italic>4eBP</italic> mRNAs driven by FOXO differentiates the dendritic from axonal populations of 4eBP.</p><p>In addition to <italic>4eBP</italic> mRNA, we also find that <italic>Drosophila</italic> Staufen binds strongly to <italic>complexin</italic> mRNA. This suggested that diet might control neurotransmission via the regulation of Complexin. In support of this model, we find that Complexin levels at the CM9 NMJ is increased in animals raised on a 2X diet compared to a 1X diet and that these levels are sensitive to changes in insulin signaling. This suggests that the increased levels of Complexin in animals raised on the 2X diet inhibit the SV release. We also find that genetically altering <italic>complexin</italic> levels can influence neurotransmitter release from the CM9 NMJ in a diet-dependent manner similar to what is observed with <italic>4eBP, chico</italic> and <italic>dFOXO</italic> mutants supporting the model that Complexin is an important target for the regulation of neuronal function by insulin signaling. Because both <italic>complexin</italic> and <italic>4eBP</italic> mRNAs are bound to Staufen, perhaps diet controls neurotransmitter release by altering the relative amounts of bound <italic>4eBP</italic> to <italic>complexin</italic> mRNAs.</p><p>The effects of our diet switch on neurotransmission support that an acute increase in Complexin levels can inhibit neurotransmitter release at the CM9 NMJ. It is clear from knock-out studies in mice, worms and <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae that Complexin is required for normal calcium-dependent SV exocytosis and supports a facilitatory, not inhibitory, role for Complexin during neurotransmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cho et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jorquera et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Radoff et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Reim et al., 2001</xref>). But other studies, including acute injections and vesicle targeting studies, have indicated that Complexin can also have an inhibitory role on evoked release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Archer et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Giraudo et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Liu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ono et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Tang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Tokumaru et al., 2001</xref>). Further, comparison of <italic>complexin</italic> knock-down to knock-out in different neuronal cell types suggest that the effects of Complexin on SV exocytosis can be sensitive to chronic versus acute manipulations and dependent upon neuronal cell type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Yang et al., 2013</xref>). Although we find that diet has no effect on SV release from <italic>Drosophila</italic> larval NMJs, further studies will be needed to determine if this is due to differences between adult and larval motor neurons or to differences in the manipulations of Complexin. In addition, it is likely that the effects of Complexin that we observe require the co-translation of other exocytotic components. Regardless our data support the model that increases in synaptic Complexin levels resulting from insulin signaling can reduce neurotransmitter release. These results have broad implications for the effects of insulin signaling on the nervous system.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Fly stocks</title><p>All analyses were performed on virgin female flies that were flipped to freshly made food vials every other day and kept at 50% humidity on a 12 hr light/dark cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Rawson et al., 2012</xref>).

Dissections and recordings were performed in a modified HL3 solution (containing, in mM: 70 NaCl, 5 KCl, 10 NaHCO3, 5 trehalose, 115 sucrose, 5 HEPES, 0.5 CaCl2, 3 MgCl2). Flies were suctioned into a Pasteur pipette and placed on top of ice for 15–20 s until the fly lost postural control. The fly was then quickly transferred to a small Sylgard dissection surface where it was decapitated. The head was moved onto its flat posterior surface, and the proboscis was then pinned into the extended position, and the entire head was covered in ice-cold dissection solution. The anterior head cuticle containing the antennae was dissected from the preparation. The proboscis was then re-pinned in the retracted position to put tension on the CM9 muscles. A loop of the lateral pharyngeal nerve was drawn into a suction electrode filled with modified HL3 (pulled glass capillary tube with a fire-polished tip, ~15 μm opening) and stimulated at 0.5–5 V for 300 μs (Digitimer Ltd., Model DS2A). The presence of a presynaptic action potential-based EPSP was verified by the presence of a distinct voltage threshold for EPSP appearance. Intracellular recordings were made on the most cranial CM9 muscle fiber accessible from the anterior side with a sharp recording electrode (~30 MΩ, filled with 3 m potassium chloride). The overall organization of the fibers is highly stereotyped from animal to animal and across age, so it is likely we are interrogating the same fiber in each recording, which is supported by our low variance. A Neuroprobe Amplifier Model 1600 (A-M Systems) was used in combination with a PowerLab 4/30 (ADInstruments, Colorado Springs, CO) to amplify and digitize the data. LabChart7 (ADInstruments, Colorado Springs, CO) was used to record the data and MiniAnalysis (Synaptosoft, Fort Lee, NJ) was used to measure both miniature EPSP (mEPSP) and EPSP events. Muscle membrane resistance was calculated using the change in muscle potential in response to current injection. Instantaneous resting membrane potential was determined by measuring the initial potential reading when the recording electrode first penetrated the muscle membrane. For hypertonic stimulation of readily releasable vesicle pools, normal recording saline was initially applied to the preparation to record baseline spontaneous activity before being replaced with recording saline supplemented with sucrose to a total final concentration of 315 mm, and recordings continued for 60 s in hypertonic saline. For diet shift experiments, animals were fed on a 1X diet from day 5-post eclosion until day 20 when half of the animals were switched to a 2X diet. For Rapamycin (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) experiments, animals were either fed a 1X diet containing either 200 µM rapamycin or vehicle control (200 µM ethanol) from 14 days post-eclosion until animals were switched onto a 2X plus rapamycin food or vehicle control for 24 hr at 20 days post-eclosion. For cycloheximide (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) experiments, animals were either fed a 1X diet containing either 35 µM cycloheximide or vehicle control (35 µM ethanol) from 19 days post-eclosion to condition the animals until they were switched onto a 2X plus cycloheximide food or vehicle control for 24 hr at 20 days post-eclosion. For all electrophysiology analyses, 7–9 animals were assayed with only one recording performed per animal (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>).

All CM9 muscles were dissected, fixed, and stained on the same day. After primary dissection, all proboscises were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min. After three 5-min washes in PBT, the CM9 was dissected and placed into a microcentrifuge tube containing PBT. After fixation, CM9s were blocked in ImageIt FX Signal Enhance (LifeTechnologies, Waltham, MA) for 30 min.

Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>The reviewers agreed that this is a technically demanding and potentially interesting study. However, there were questions about whether the signaling pathway is required for diet-dependent or diet-independent changes in activity that seemed difficult to resolve on the timescale of a revision. In addition, it was unclear whether the pathway is specific to proboscis MNs or a general pathway. Overall, although there was enthusiasm for the study, limitations in the current dataset hindered evaluation.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This manuscript examines regulation of activity of proboscis motor neurons by nutritional state. The authors previously showed that diet causes changes in EPSP amplitude. In this study, they examine molecular mechanisms that regulate activity. They found that knockdown of 4eBP reduced EPSP and IRS knockdown increased EPSP. They found that complexin is increased in the high yeast diet and that manipulating complexin levels alters activity in the CM9 neurons. The authors propose that increased insulin signaling in the high yeast diet increases complexin levels and decreases neurotransmission.</p><p>There is a significant limitation in this study that makes the data difficult to interpret. Although the authors nicely show that EPSP size decreases in the 2x diet, and controls are shown for the 1x, 1x to 2x, and 2x diets, all experimental animals are shown for either the 1x or 2x diet. This makes it impossible to determine whether molecular manipulations cause a nutritional state dependent change in the response or alter responses in a state-independent manner. This is problematic. To resolve this would require examining all experimentals in the 1x, 2x and ideally 1x to 2x condition. These experiments seem unlikely to be possible to perform on the timescale of a resubmission.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In general, I found the data presented in this paper clear and convincing. However, I have a few significant reservations about the impact and conclusions that mitigate my enthusiasm.</p><p>Impact: The authors make a case that insulin signaling plays a pathological role in neuron function in a variety of disease states, and that their model presents a possible mechanism for these effects. However, the generalizability of these findings is unclear. The fact that the same mechanism is not relevant in larval body wall motor neurons can, as the authors suggest, possibly be attributed to differences between larvae and adults. But does diet affect other adult motor neurons? Addressing this experimentally is difficult, and admittedly beyond the scope of this article. However, the fact that this particular motor neuron is involved in a very diet-sensitive behavior (feeding) makes me wonder whether this may be a specific mechanism operating in feeding motor neurons to sensitize them to decrements in nutritive intake. This would be interesting, but changes the interpretation of the data.</p><p>Conclusions: although the authors do a good job of logically dissecting the role of sequential components of the insulin pathway downstream of dietary changes, the connection between these pathway components and diet remains somewhat tenuous. To solidify this connection, I think two main points could be addressed:</p><p>1) Does the 2X diet result in measurable changes in insulin release? Related to this, the statement that the 2X diet shows that protein content is sufficient to induce the effect is inaccurate. Doubling yeast concentration in food results in increased levels of protein, carbohydrates, fats, and other nutrients. However, compensatory feeding mechanisms will likely change consumption, so it cannot be assumed that this results in increased intake of any given nutrient.</p><p>2) Currently, each genetic manipulation is only assessed in the dietary condition where it is expected to give an effect. For example, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref> shows that 4eBP knockdown makes the EPSP size on the 1X diet equivalent to controls on the 2X diet. This is used to argue that 4eBP mediates the EPSP increase on the 1X diet. However, all this demonstrates is that 4eBP knockdown decreases EPSPs. The authors should show 4eBP knockdown in both dietary conditions to demonstrate that there is no diet effect on those flies.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Additional data files and statistical comments):</italic></p><p>The authors generally use ANOVAs to compare each genotype with the control &quot;1X&quot; condition. However, in cases where the argument being made is a change in the &quot;2X&quot; response, statistical significance should be assessed against the control 2X condition. For example, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>, <italic>chico<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> (2X) should be shown to be significantly different from control (2X). Showing that control (2X) is different from control (1X), but <italic>chico<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> (2X) is not, is not a robust test of the effects of <italic>chico<sup>RNAi</sup></italic>.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>This is a very interesting study with original observations on the link between nutrient levels and synaptic function, which are currently under exploited but important in neurosciences. The main finding is that higher dietary proteins enhance insulin signaling which in turn regulates synaptic Complexin levels to reduce quantal release. Taking advantage of the available tools (mutants, RNAi, and <italic>Gal4/UAS</italic>) in flies the authors reached the main conclusion through careful analysis and high quality data. There were some surprises as to the roles of specific downstream players along with the insulin pathway in regulating transmitter release. However, the lack of effect by mTor is not entirely surprising as one previous study has shown that Foxo rather than mTor plays a critical role in neuronal excitability. Overall, this study should be of interest to all neuroscientists interested in synaptic plasticity, cell biologists in cell signaling, and clinicians in diabetes and aging.</p><p>I do have some questions and concerns:</p><p>1) I am puzzled by the lack of conservation of this signaling pathway at the larval NMJ. One can imagine the critical role of insulin signaling in coordinating rapid larval growth and synaptic function. Yet this pathway as described by the authors is not used in larvae. However, this issue needs some reconsideration. The author ignored the landmark study by Mike Stern's lab (Howlett et al., PLoS Genet 4(11): e1000277), in which they showed that Foxo and mTor indeed had similar effects on larval NMJ function as the current authors found with adult fly NMJs. The Stern paper should be cited! Additionally, it might be a good idea to use the Stern approach to re-examine the role of nutrients and insulin signaling at larval NMJs.</p><p>2) Neuronal excitability vs. SNARE-mediated fusion: the authors have good data indicating the involvement of Complexin levels at the adult NMJ as a downstream factor of nutrient/insulin signaling. Without much doubts Complexin is known to be a regulator of SNARE-mediated fusion. One also wonders, given the Stern study, whether nutrients also regulate neuronal excitability.</p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, the authors used confocal imaging to quantify Complexin levels. Is this method quantitative enough or without bias? Is the postsynaptic marker Dlg used as a control to normalize Complexin signal levels?</p><p>3) Because the authors did not observe an effect of nutrients at the larval NMJ, I wonder how universal it is for insulin signaling to regulate transmitter release at other adult synapses (e.g., central synapses as well as another NMJ)?</p><p>I am not interested in asking the authors to do more additional work, but it is important for them to demonstrate that this pathway is physiologically conserved. Thus, data from either larval NMJ or another adult synapse would strengthen the significance of their new findings.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Additional data files and statistical comments):</italic></p><p>Supplementary figures are appropriate.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16807.016</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the first round of peer review follow.]</italic></p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p><italic>There is a significant limitation in this study that makes the data difficult to interpret.

This is particularly relevant for 4eBP and, which are believed to have highly pleiotropic functions within the cell. The reviewers suggest investigating the effects of <italic>4eBP</italic> mutations and others on multiple diet conditions to resolve whether this signaling pathway is required specifically for the dietary response, or if this signal plays a more general role during SV release. To address these questions, we have included new electrophysiological data for proximal (4eBP, <italic>chico</italic>, and) and distal components (Complexin) of the signaling pathway on multiple diets. To support this analyses, we have also performed immunoblot analysis to support that insulin signaling is increased under our 2X and 1-2X diet shift conditions compared to our 1X diet condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). These data also suggest that the 2X condition and the 1-2X shift both result in qualitatively similar effects on insulin signaling. This new data is now included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>. We will discuss these new data in more detail below.</p><p>We do not believe that these analyses are required for all experimental conditions. The 1-2X diet shift allows us to acutely increase the insulin signaling allowing us to design ideal paradigms for investigating the role of TOR and Staufen during the propagation of the insulin signal. Given our new data, we don’t believe that including new diet conditions for these experiments is necessary, especially given the similarities between the 2X and 1-2X diet conditions in terms of functional effects and whole animal insulin signaling.</p><p>1) 4eBP: Previously we showed that knock-down of 4eBP in animals raised on a 1X diet reduced release to levels observed in 2X controls. We have now repeated this analysis and have included data for knock-down of <italic>4eBP</italic> in both 2X and 1X-2X shift animals. The amount of neurotransmitter released in <italic>4eBP</italic> knock-down flies raised on either 2X and 1X-2X shift is the same as the 1X <italic>4eBP</italic> knock-downs and the 2X control animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). This new data provides support for the model that 4eBP is specifically required for the effects of diet on neurotransmitter release. It also suggests that 4eBP is not required for basal neurotransmission, similar to what we observe at the larval NMJ. Taken together, these data support that under high insulin signaling, 4eBP activity is low and contributes very little to neurotransmitter release. In addition to a brief presentation of the data in the results we have included a brief discussion of these data in the Discussion.</p><p>2) Chico and d: We also performed a similar analysis of <italic>chico</italic> mutants and observe that knock-down of <italic>chico</italic> in animals raised on a 1X diet resulted in a significant increase in release compared to 1X controls. This was also observed for <italic>chico</italic> mutants subjected to a 1-2X diet shift. These results suggest that there is basal insulin signaling through Chico even under the 1X diet conditions, which is supported by faint insulin receptor phosphorylation under 1X conditions. This is also consistent with our observation that overexpression of 4eBP in wild type animals raised on 1X diet increases neurotransmitter release compared to 1X control animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). We have included a statement in the results describing these data. We have also analyzed <italic>d</italic> mutants and found that consistent with the above data, <italic>d</italic> mutants on 2X diets have neurotransmitter release similar to 2X controls.</p><p>3) Complexin: We have now included data demonstrating that SV release in animals expressing Complexin is the same in animals raised on 2X compared to animals raised on 1X. Taken together, these new data support our model that this signaling system functions to control neurotransmitter release in response to changes in diet.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p><italic>In general, I found the data presented in this paper clear and convincing. However, I have a few significant reservations about the impact and conclusions that mitigate my enthusiasm.</italic></p><p><italic>Impact: The authors make a case that insulin signaling plays a pathological role in neuron function in a variety of disease states, and that their model presents a possible mechanism for these effects. However, the generalizability of these findings is unclear. The fact that the same mechanism is not relevant in larval body wall motor neurons can, as the authors suggest, possibly be attributed to differences between larvae and adults. But does diet affect other adult motor neurons? Addressing this experimentally is difficult, and admittedly beyond the scope of this article. However, the fact that this particular motor neuron is involved in a very diet-sensitive behavior (feeding) makes me wonder whether this may be a specific mechanism operating in feeding motor neurons to sensitize them to decrements in nutritive intake. This would be interesting, but changes the interpretation of the data.</italic></p><p>We would like to first point out that our analysis of <italic>4eBP</italic> mRNA expression in response to diet was generated on motor neurons isolated from thoracic ganglion demonstrating that the regulation of 4eBP by diet is common to all motor neurons. This point has been strengthened in the text. We also now provide evidence of changes in Complexin levels at the lateral abdominal muscle NMJs in response to diet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). These new data as well as our previous RT-PCR data support that this signaling system is not only a CM9 MN phenomenon but is likely generalized to adult motor neurons.</p><p>Finally, I think that it is important to remember that changes in peripheral insulin has important effects on brain function but that the cellular mechanisms, especially the regulation of presynaptic function, have not been pursued in mammals. Thus, the conservation of this effect of insulin is unknown. But the signaling pathway components and the SV release mechanisms detailed in this manuscript are highly conserved with mammals so I would argue that it is possible that some aspect of this regulation will be conserved.</p><p><italic>Conclusions: although the authors do a good job of logically dissecting the role of sequential components of the insulin pathway downstream of dietary changes, the connection between these pathway components and diet remains somewhat tenuous. To solidify this connection, I think two main points could be addressed:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) Does the 2X diet result in measurable changes in insulin release? Related to this, the statement that the 2X diet shows that protein content is sufficient to induce the effect is inaccurate. Doubling yeast concentration in food results in increased levels of protein, carbohydrates, fats, and other nutrients. However, compensatory feeding mechanisms will likely change consumption, so it cannot be assumed that this results in increased intake of any given nutrient.</italic></p><p>There exist a number of publications demonstrating the effects of diet on <italic>Drosophila</italic> insulin-like peptide (Dilps) gene expression (Morris et al., 2012; Gronke et al., 2010) but there is no assay for measuring circulating Dilps levels in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. To provide evidence of increased Dilp signaling, we used biochemical analyses of insulin receptor phosphorylation from flies raised on our different diet conditions. The increase in the phosphorylation state of the insulin receptor reflects an increase in insulin binding to the receptors providing strong evidence of increased insulin signaling under our diet conditions. We also observe an increase in Akt phosphorylation, consistent with increased insulin signaling (Bai et al., 2015 (Tatar lab); Bjedov et al., 2010 (Partridge lab)).</p><p><italic>2) Currently, each genetic manipulation is only assessed in the dietary condition where it is expected to give an effect. For example, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref> shows that 4eBP knockdown makes the EPSP size on the 1X diet equivalent to controls on the 2X diet. This is used to argue that 4eBP mediates the EPSP increase on the 1X diet. However, all this demonstrates is that 4eBP knockdown decreases EPSPs. The authors should show 4eBP knockdown in both dietary conditions to demonstrate that there is no diet effect on those flies.</italic></p><p>See response to Reviewer #1.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Additional data files and statistical comments):</italic></p><p><italic>The authors generally use ANOVAs to compare each genotype with the control &quot;1X&quot; condition. However, in cases where the argument being made is a change in the &quot;2X&quot; response, statistical significance should be assessed against the control 2X condition. For example, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>, chico<sup>RNAi</sup> (2X) should be shown to be significantly different from control (2X). Showing that control (2X) is different from control (1X), but chico<sup>RNAi</sup> (2X) is not, is not a robust test of the effects of chico<sup>RNAi</sup>.</italic></p><p>We agree and have reanalyzed this data as requested.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p><italic>This is a very interesting study with original observations on the link between nutrient levels and synaptic function, which are currently under exploited but important in neurosciences. The main finding is that higher dietary proteins enhance insulin signaling which in turn regulates synaptic Complexin levels to reduce quantal release. Taking advantage of the available tools (mutants, RNAi, and Gal4/UAS) in flies the authors reached the main conclusion through careful analysis and high quality data. There were some surprises as to the roles of specific downstream players along with the insulin pathway in regulating transmitter release. However, the lack of effect by mTor is not entirely surprising as one previous study has shown that Foxo rather than mTor plays a critical role in neuronal excitability. Overall, this study should be of interest to all neuroscientists interested in synaptic plasticity, cell biologists in cell signaling, and clinicians in diabetes and aging.</italic></p><p><italic>I do have some questions and concerns:</italic></p><p><italic>1) I am puzzled by the lack of conservation of this signaling pathway at the larval NMJ. One can imagine the critical role of insulin signaling in coordinating rapid larval growth and synaptic function. Yet this pathway as described by the authors is not used in larvae. However, this issue needs some reconsideration. The author ignored the landmark study by Mike Stern's lab (Howlett et al., PLoS Genet 4(11): e1000277), in which they showed that Foxo and mTor indeed had similar effects on larval NMJ function as the current authors found with adult fly NMJs. The Stern paper should be cited! Additionally, it might be a good idea to use the Stern approach to re-examine the role of nutrients and insulin signaling at larval NMJs.</italic></p><p>Although <italic>chico</italic> signaling has been previously implicated in synaptogenesis within the adult fly brain (Martin-pena et al. 2006), a role for <italic>chico</italic> and <italic>4eBP</italic> during neurotransmission at the larval NMJ has not been reported. We have no reason to doubt our experiments and we have repeated these experiments multiple times over the course of numerous years (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). We are also aware of a competing manuscript describing a postsynaptic role for <italic>4eBP</italic> in the larval muscle during homeostatic synaptic plasticity. 4eBP is likely the postsynaptic target of the TOR complex in the larval muscle that has previously been implicated in retrograde signaling during homeostasis at the larval NMJ (Penney et al., 2014). These researchers also found no role for 4eBP in the motor neuron during neurotransmission or synaptic homeostasis (personal communication) consistent with our data.</p><p>Although there is no evidence for <italic>4eBP</italic> or <italic>chico</italic> at the larval NMJ, there is previous data from the larval NMJ demonstrating a requirement for <italic>d</italic> during the control of neurotransmission by PI3K signaling downstream of mGluR signaling (Howlett et al., PLoS Genet 4(11): e1000277). Our data demonstrate that <italic>d</italic> is required for neurotransmission at the CM9 NMJ in animals raised on 1X diet. Although it is clearly difficult to compare these experiments, there does appear to be a requirement for <italic>d</italic> function during neurotransmission at both larval and adult NMJs. Finally, we appreciate the reviewer pointing our omission of this important study of <italic>d</italic> function during neurotransmission and have included it in our current manuscript.</p><p><italic>2) Neuronal excitability vs. SNARE-mediated fusion: the authors have good data indicating the involvement of Complexin levels at the adult NMJ as a downstream factor of nutrient/insulin signaling. Without much doubts Complexin is known to be a regulator of SNARE-mediated fusion. One also wonders, given the Stern study, whether nutrients also regulate neuronal excitability.</italic></p><p>In this paper, the Stern lab utilize the onset of long-term facilitation (LTF) as a reporter of motor neuron excitability largely based on previous studies of the effects of ion channel mutants on this response. In this study, the authors show that is required for normal basal neurotransmitter and neuronal excitability (as measured by LTF induction) downstream of mGluR signalling. Unfortunately, these researchers state that they use an undefined diet so there is no information given about nutrient conditions in this paper. Regardless, these data support that is required for basal neurotransmitter release at both larval and adult NMJs. We have included this point in the new manuscript.</p><p>The reviewer suggests using the Stern approach (we assume induction of LTF) to investigate if nutrients also influence excitability to the CM9 motor neuron. We agree that this is an interesting question but beyond the focus of this paper, which are the mechanisms downstream of that control neurotransmission. It should be noted that there is very little known about the mechanisms downstream of that alter neuronal function or excitability. Our current story represents one of the first descriptions of downstream mechanisms from that alter neuronal function.</p><p><italic>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, the authors used confocal imaging to quantify Complexin levels. Is this method quantitative enough or without bias? Is the postsynaptic marker Dlg used as a control to normalize Complexin signal levels?</italic></p><p>We agree that this is a tenuous approach to determining changes in synaptic protein levels but we have performed these as carefully as possible. We have attempted to use immunoblot analysis of dissected proboscis but have been unable to generate enough material to get a signal with the Cpx antibody. That said, this is a direct method for measuring synaptic protein levels that we support with our genetic manipulations of Complexin levels. We would also like to point out that all of the analyses of fluorescent levels were done in a blinded fashion and identities of genotypes only revealed after analysis. We have clarified this in the Methods. In addition, during our development of this approach we analyzed synaptic Complexin levels at the CM9 NMJ in <italic>wt</italic> versus <italic>cpx/+</italic> that revealed a significant decrease in synaptic protein levels. Importantly, these results also correlated well with the functional data from the recordings in the <italic>cpx/+</italic> heterozygotes. We have included these data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> of this version of the manuscript to strengthen this approach. We do not normalize to Dlg in these analyses. Rather, Dlg is used to evaluate the quality of the staining of each preparation. Preparations in which the Dlg staining is inconsistent are discarded prior to analysis of Cpx levels. Cpx signals are not normalized but are corrected for background of the Cpx staining (which is low, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).</p><p><italic>3) Because the authors did not observe an effect of nutrients at the larval NMJ, I wonder how universal it is for insulin signaling to regulate transmitter release at other adult synapses (e.g., central synapses as well as another NMJ)?</italic></p><p><italic>I am not interested in asking the authors to do more additional work, but it is important for them to demonstrate that this pathway is physiologically conserved. Thus, data from either larval NMJ or another adult synapse would strengthen the significance of their new findings.</italic></p><p>See first response to Reviewer #2.</p></body></sub-article></article>
