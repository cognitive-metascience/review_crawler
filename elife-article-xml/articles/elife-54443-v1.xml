Neural circuit wiring requires directed growth of axons towards target regions, self-avoidance of axons and dendrites, axon-dendrite target selection, and formation and specification of synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Hassan and Hiesinger, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Yogev and Shen, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Zipursky and Sanes, 2010</xref>). Although much is known about axon guidance, the molecular mechanisms governing target selection and synapse formation remain largely unclear.</p><p>Synaptic adhesion molecules form trans-synaptic complexes across the synaptic cleft that are thought to initiate synapse formation, maintain synapse stability, and regulate synapse properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Südhof, 2018</xref>). Many synaptic adhesion molecules have been identified, of which latrophilins and BAIs may be unique because these adhesion GPCRs are among the few molecules whose deletion not only alters synaptic transmission, but actually decrease synapse numbers, which suggests that these adhesion GPCRs are involved in synapse formation and maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bolliger et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Kakegawa et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anderson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Sando et al., 2019</xref>). In particular, we recently observed that the conditional deletion of latrophilin-2 (Lphn2) from CA1-region pyramidal neurons caused a selective loss of synapses formed in the Stratum lacunosum-moleculare by inputs from the entorhinal cortex, whereas the conditional deletion of latrophilin-3 (Lphn3) caused a selective loss of synapses formed in the Stratum oriens and Stratum radiatum by Schaffer-collateral inputs from the CA3 region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anderson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Sando et al., 2019</xref>). Importantly, rescue experiments involving overexpression of Lphn2 or Lphn3 revealed that Lphn2 and Lphn3 were non-redundant in the CA1-region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Sando et al., 2019</xref>). These two adhesion GPCRs could only rescue the phenotype of the deletion of the eponymous gene, but not of the deletion of the other gene, demonstrating an unexpected functional diversification of highly homologous genes. These results not only demonstrated that latrophilins function as postsynaptic adhesion molecules, but also that they exhibit synapse specificity and are essential for the existence of their target synapses.</p><p>Here, we asked whether this conclusion reflects a general principle of latrophilin function. We identified robust expression of Lphn2 and Lphn3 in cerebellar Purkinje cells, and thus examined whether Lphn2 and Lphn3 perform individual non-redundant functions in these neurons as well. Unexpectedly, we found that unlike the function of Lphn2 and Lphn3 in hippocampal CA1-region neurons, Lphn2 and Lphn3 perform redundant functions in Purkinje cells. This function selectively targets parallel-fiber synapses, corroborating the synapse specificity observed in hippocampus. In addition, in our studies on the cerebellar expression of latrophilins we observed high expression levels of Lphn3 in Bergmann glia, a cerebellum-specific type of astrocyte. However, here unlike Purkinje cells we detected no functional changes in cerebellar physiology upon the Lphn3 deletion, suggesting that Lphn3 is not essential for Bergmann glia function.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Differential expression of latrophilin genes in cerebellum</title><p>We first examined the expression of latrophilins in the cerebellum.

L7-Cre had no significant effect on the levels of either Lphn2 or Lphn3, although there was a trend towards a decrease for Lphn2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). This result seems to contradict the in situ data showing abundant expression of Lphn2 in Purkinje cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>). However, despite their remarkable size and prominence, the number of Purkinje cells is much lower than that of other cerebellar neurons (e.g., granule cells, interneurons, and deep cerebellar nuclei neurons), and the selective loss of Lphn2 and Lphn3 from Purkinje cells may have been occluded by the combined levels of these proteins in other neurons, in particular granule cells and deep cerebellar nuclei neurons. Consistent with this conclusion, both Lphn2 and Lphn3 were significantly decreased in PV-Cre mice that express Cre in deep cerebellar nuclei neurons and interneurons in addition to Purkinje cells, with Lphn2 expression reduced by nearly 80% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Math-Cre, conversely, had no significant effect on the levels of Lphn2 and Lphn3, consistent with the fact that granule cells primarily express Lphn1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). GLAST-Cre-mediated deletion of Lphn2 and Lphn3 in Bergmann glia, finally, did not detectably alter the levels of Lphn2, but dramatically decreased the levels of Lphn3, indicative of substantial Lphn3 expression in these astrocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Deletions of either Lphn2 or Lphn3 alone from Purkinje cells does not significantly alter parallel-fiber synapses, whereas the double deletion of both Lphn2 and Lphn3 suppresses parallel-fiber synapses</title><p>Since latrophilins are postsynaptic adhesion molecules and Purkinje cells are the postsynaptic target of almost all synapses in the cerebellar cortex, we focused our analyses of the cerebellar role of latrophilins on Purkinje cells.</p><p>First, we examined individual Lphn2 and Lphn3 cKO mice, examining parallel-fiber synapses as the most abundant cerebellar synapse. We analyzed mice obtained from crosses of Lphn2 and Lphn3 cKO mice with L7-Cre mice and compared Cre-negative homozygous Lphn2 or Lphn3 cKO mice to Cre-positive littermate mice to assess the effects of the Lphn deletion. To estimate parallel-fiber synapses morphologically, we stained cerebellar sections for vGluT1. Because parallel-fiber synapses are too abundant in the cerebellar cortex to resolve individual vGluT1-positive puncta by confocal microscopy, we measured the overall vGluT1 staining intensity, which depends on both the density and the size of parallel-fiber synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>). We observed no significant difference in vGluT1 staining intensity between sections from control mice and mice lacking either Lphn2 or Lphn3 in the Purkinje cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and E</xref>). Next, we cut acute slices from the mice and used whole-cell patch-clamp recordings to measure the input resistance and capacitance of Purkinje cells, but again detected no difference between control and Lphn2- or Lphn3-deficient Purkinje cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and F</xref>). Finally, we monitored parallel-fiber EPSCs induced by extracellular stimulation in the upper molecular layer, and determined both the paired-pulse ratio of EPSCs in response to two stimuli separated by 50 ms and the overall synaptic strength quantified by the input-output relation and the rise slope of EPSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C–D and G–H</xref>). Here, we also observed no differences between Purkinje cells expressing or lacking Lphn2 or Lphn3, suggesting that each isoform alone is not essential for proper parallel-fiber synapse numbers or parallel-fiber synaptic transmission.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Individual deletions of Lphn2 or Lphn3 in Purkinje cells do not detectably affect parallel-fiber synapse density or function.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Lphn2 deletion from Purkinje cells does not affect parallel-fiber synapse staining as shown by unchanged vGluT1 staining intensity. vGluT1 specifically labels parallel-fiber synapses and vGluT1 staining intensity serves as a proxy for parallel-fiber synapse density (left, representative images with vGluT1 in red and calbindin in green; right, summary graph).

Strikingly, we found that the Lphn2/3 double-deficient sections displayed a ~ 30% decrease in vGluT1 staining intensity, suggesting a decrease in parallel-fiber synapses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). The density of vGluT2-positive puncta and of vGAT-positive puncta was unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and C</xref>).

This question was prompted by our unpublished finding that the expression of neuroligin-3, another postsynaptic adhesion molecule, in Bergmann glia appears to be essential for the function of parallel-fiber synapses (Zhang, B. and Südhof, T.C., submitted). Thus, we used Lphn3 cKO mice crossed with GLAST-CreER mice to delete Lphn3 from astrocytic Bergmann glia in the cerebellum, employing daily 4-OHT injections from age P10-P12 to induce Cre recombination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). This manipulation caused a major decrease in Lphn3 protein levels as determined by immunoblot in total cerebellum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). Consistent with this observation, we observed a similar decrease in Lphn3 staining intensity (visualized by the HA-epitope knock-in) in the cerebellar cortex after deletion of Lphn3 in Bergmann glia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). These results indicate that the majority of Lphn3 in cerebellar cortex is expressed by Bergmann glia, and that despite the functional importance of Lphn3 in Purkinje cells as described above, the Lphn3 levels in Purkinje cells are much lower than those in Bergmann glia.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Deletion of Lphn3 in Bergmann glia has minimal effects on parallel-fiber, climbing-fiber or inhibitory synapse staining in the cerebellar cortex, Bergmann glia staining intensity, or synaptic protein composition of the cerebellum.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of experimental procedure.

As above, we quantified parallel-fiber synapses by overall vGluT1 staining intensity because the density of parallel-fiber synapses is too high to enable resolution of individual puncta by confocal microscopy. The resulting vGluT1 staining intensity reflects a combination of parallel-fiber synapse density and size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>). The deletion of Lphn3 from Bergmann glia had no effect on this parameter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). We then quantified the density, staining intensity, and size of vGluT2-positive puncta that represent climbing-fiber synapses. We observed no change in climbing-fiber density, but a significant decrease in their staining intensity and size, hinting at a possible impairment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>).

We used immunocytochemistry to stain the cerebellar cortex of littermate-control homozygous Lphn3 cKO mice containing or lacking a GLAST-Cre allele for three Bergmann glia-specific markers: the glutamate transporters GLAST and GLT-1, and the glutamate receptor GluA1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Rothstein et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bergles et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Saab et al., 2012</xref>). For every glial marker, the staining pattern intensity were indistinguishable between sections from control mice and mice in which Lphn3 had been deleted from Bergmann glia postnatally, suggesting that Bergmann glia were unaffected by Lphn3 deletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>).</p><p>These experiments suggest that the Lphn3 deletion from Bergmann glia does not cause a major change in the structure and synaptic composition of the cerebellar cortex. To independently confirm this conclusion, we analyzed the cerebellum from control mice and mice with a deletion of Lphn3 from Bergmann glia by quantitative immunoblotting for a series of synaptic marker proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>). We observed no changes in any synaptic protein, in particular not in vGluT1 and vGluT2 that are specific for parallel-fiber and climbing-fiber synapses, respectively, except for a decrease in the levels of vGAT that is specific for inhibitory synapses, and a trend towards a decrease for the scaffolding proteins CASK and gephyrin. These results confirm that the deletion of Lphn3 from Bergmann glia, the major cell type in cerebellum in which Lphn3 is expressed, does not cause a major change in the structure and composition of the cerebellar cortex.</p><p>In a final set of experiments we explored the possibility that the Lphn3 deletion from Bergmann glia may impair cerebellar synaptic functions even though the overall synaptic architecture of the cerebellum appears to be largely unaffected by the Lphn3 deletion. Using whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from Purkinje cells in acute cerebellar slices, we confirmed by measurements of the capacitance and input resistance that the Lphn3 deletion in Bergmann glia has no major effect on the basic properties of Purkinje cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Evoked climbing-fiber synaptic responses were unchanged in either amplitude, paired-pulse ratio or number of ‘steps’ (reflecting the number of climbing fibers innervating a Purkinje cell) after Lphn3 deletion from Bergmann glia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Measurements of spontaneous miniature EPSCs and IPSCs (performed in the presence of tetrodotoxin) showed that the frequency and amplitude of mEPSCs and of mIPSCs were also unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C–D</xref>). Thus, despite high levels of Lphn3 expression in Bergmann glia, Lphn3 is not essential in this type of astrocyte for any of the major synaptic components of the cerebellar cortex.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Deletion of Lphn3 in Bergmann glia does not alter climbing-fiber synaptic transmission or spontaneous Purkinje cell miniature currents.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Deletion of Lphn3 from Bergmann glia does not affect the Purkinje cell capacitance or input resistance.

Specifically, we showed that in pyramidal CA1-region neurons, postsynaptic Lphn2 is selectively essential for excitatory synapses formed onto the distal dendritic domains of these neurons in the Stratum lacunosum-moleculare (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anderson et al., 2017</xref>), whereas Lphn3 is selectively essential for excitatory synapses formed onto the proximal dendritic domains in the Stratum oriens and Stratum radiatum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Sando et al., 2019</xref>). In hippocampal CA1-region neurons, individual deletions of Lphn2 and Lphn3 produce robust but distinct phenotypes, and Lphn2 overexpression does not rescue the Lphn3 deletion phenotype, demonstrating that the two latrophilin isoforms are not functionally redundant in these neurons. It was thus surprising for us to find in the current experiments that the individual deletions of Lphn2 and Lphn3 in cerebellar Purkinje cells produced no significant phenotypes, but that the double deletion of both Lphn2 and Lphn3 caused a large selective impairment of parallel-fiber synapses. Based on these results, we conclude that although Lphn2 and Lphn3 are functionally distinct in CA1-region pyramidal neurons, they are functionally redundant in cerebellar Purkinje cells.</p><p>The effect of the Lphn2/3 double deletion on Purkinje cells is selective for parallel-fiber synapses as evidenced by immunocytochemistry for specific synaptic markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) and by electrophysiological recordings of evoked and spontaneous synaptic transmission (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). The most parsimonious explanation for the impairment of parallel-fiber synapses in Lphn2/3-deficient Purkinje cells is that there is a decrease in synapse numbers because the vGluT1 staining intensity in the cerebellar cortex was decreased and the strength of parallel-fiber synapses was suppressed without a change in paired-pulse ratio. In addition, the frequency of long (&gt;2 ms) rise time mEPSC events largely derived from parallel-fiber synapses was decreased while the frequency of short (&lt;0.6 ms) rise time events largely derived from climbing-fiber synapses was unchanged. In this respect, the Lphn2/3 double deletion phenotype resembles that of the Lphn2 and Lphn3 single deletions in CA1-region neurons of the hippocampus in which we also observed a loss of synapses without a change in release probability that was restricted to specific subset of excitatory synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anderson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Sando et al., 2019</xref>). The L7 promoter used for Purkinje cell-specific Cre recombination initiates Cre expression at P9-10, which is during the period of parallel-fiber synaptogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barski et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Mishina et al., 2012</xref>). While the current study does not distinguish between a role for Lphns in synapse formation versus synapse maintenance, excitatory synaptic transmission onto CA1 neurons of the hippocampus is similarly impaired by Lphn3 deletion at P0 and P21, suggesting that Lphns may have a broad role in excitatory synapse maintenance.</p><p>Many synaptic adhesion molecules, including neurexins and neuroligins, are expressed in glia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Saunders et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Zeisel et al., 2018</xref>). Our quantitative immunoblotting and smRNA-FISH data show that Lphn3 is expressed in Bergmann glia at extraordinarily high levels, as evidenced by the fact that the Lphn3 deletion from Bergmann glia caused a ~ 50% decrease in cerebellar Lphn3 protein content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). Nevertheless, deletion of latrophilin-3 from Bergmann glia had no major effect on Bergmann glia markers or synaptic parameters in the cerebellum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>). Although we observed a small decrease in climbing-fiber synapse puncta size and intensity by immunohistochemistry, climbing-fiber synaptic transmission was unchanged, suggesting that Lphn3 expression in Bergmann glia is not essential for the fundamental properties of these cerebellar synapses. This lack of a phenotype is unexpected especially if one compares the effect of the Lphn3 deletion when induced in combination with the Lphn2 deletion in Purkinje cells in the analyses of the Lphn2/3 double-deficient condition to that of the Lphn3 deletion in Bergmann glia. In Purkinje cells, Lphn3 is barely detectable by in situ hybridization and the deletion of Lphn3 from Purkinje cells has no significant effect on the overall cerebellar Lphn3 content; nevertheless, its deletion from Purkinje cells causes a massive impairment in parallel-fiber synapses. In Bergmann glia, in contrast, Lphn3 levels are so high that they contribute ~50% to the total cerebellar Lphn3 content even with widespread Lphn3 expression elsewhere in cerebellum, but here deletion of Lphn3 is without major consequences. Our findings do not preclude a role for Lphn3 in Bergmann glia earlier in development, as the deletion of Lphn3 studied here was initiated at P10, similar to the start of Cre expression in the L7-Cre mouse line. This example illustrates again a conclusion that has previously been proposed many times, namely that the expression levels of a protein are not necessarily indicative of its functional importance in a given cell type.</p><p>Finally, one may ask why the phenotype of the Lphn2 and Lphn3 deletions, although very significant and similar in magnitude to that of the cerebellin-1 deletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Ito-Ishida et al., 2008</xref>), is not even stronger at parallel-fiber synapses. It seems likely that there may be further redundancy between Lphn1, the latrophilin isoform that was not examined here, with Lphn2 and Lphn3. Lphn1 is highly expressed in many cerebellar cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), but no cKO mice are currently available. Given the redundancy between Lphn2 and Lphn3 observed here, presumably Lphn1 may also be redundant with Lphn2 and Lphn3, and a triple Lphn1/2/3 deletion could potentially have a much bigger impact on synaptic function than a double deletion of Lphn2 and Lphn3.</p><p>In summary, our results reveal a selective redundant function of Lphn2 and Lphn3 as postsynaptic adhesion molecules in parallel-fiber synapses of the cerebellum. These results extend the previous conclusion obtained in hippocampal CA1 region neurons that Lphn2 and Lphn3 are essential postsynaptic adhesion molecules, but demonstrate that although Lphn2 and Lphn3 perform distinct functions in these hippocampal neurons, they perform redundant functions in Purkinje cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and

Mice (P21 for L7-Cre, P35 for GLAST-CreER KOs) were anesthetized with isoflurane, perfused with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) to clear blood then with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in 0.1M PBS to fix tissues. Cerebella were dissected out and post-fixed in 4% PFA overnight at 4°C. Cerebella were then cryoprotected in 30% sucrose in 0.1 M PBS for a minimum of 48 hr at 4°C. Sagittal cerebellar sections (40 µm) were collected at −20°C with a cryostat (Leica CM1050). Sections were washed with PBS and incubated in blocking buffer (0.2% Triton X-100% and 5% goat serum in PBS) for 1 hr at RT under gentle agitation, followed by incubation for 24 hr at 4°C with primary antibodies diluted in blocking buffer (antibodies used: anti-vGluT1, 1:1000, guinea pig, Millipore, AB5905; anti-vGluT2, 1:1000, guinea pig, Millipore, AB2251; anti-vGaT, 1:1000, rabbit, Millipore, AB5062; anti-calbindin, 1:2000, mouse, Sigma, C9848; anti-GLAST, 1:500, rabbit, Abcam, ab416s; anti-GLT-1, 1:500, rabbit, Abcam, ab41621; anti-GluA1, 1:500, rabbit, Sysy, 182003; anti-HA, 1:1000, mouse, Covance, MMS-101P; anti-Homer1, 1:1000, rabbit, Millipore, ABN37; anti-MAP2, 1:1000, chicken, Encor Bioscience, CPCA-MAP2). Sections were washed 4 times for 10 min each in PBS then incubated in secondary antibodies diluted in blocking buffer for 1 hr at RT (1:1000, Alexa 488 or 546, Invitrogen). Sections were washed as described previously then mounted onto positively-charged microscope slides and covered in DAPI-containing mounting media (Vectashield, Vector Labs). Serial confocal z-stack images (1.5 μm intervals for 40 μm at 1024 × 1024 resolution) were acquired using a Nikon confocal microscope (A1Rsi) with a 60x oil objective (PlanApo, NA1.4). All staining procedures and acquisition parameters were kept constant within each experiment. Images of cerebellum molecular layer were taken from the midpoint of lobule IV/V. Image backgrounds were normalized, and immunoreactive elements were analyzed with Nikon analysis software (object size range 0.25–4.0 μm<sup>2</sup>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Electrophysiology</title><p>Electrophysiological recordings from cerebellum were performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Caillard et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Llano et al., 1991</xref>). Mice at age P21-25 or P35-40 were anesthetized with isofurane and decapitated. Cerebella were rapidly extracted and transferred into ice-cold low-Ca2+ aCSF containing (in mM): 125 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 3 MgCl2, 0.1 CaCl2, 25 glucose, 1.25 NaH2PO4, 0.4 ascorbic acid, three myo-inositol, 2 Na-pyruvate, and 25 NaHCO3; pH was adjusted to 7.4 by continuous gassing with carbogen. Sagittal slices (250 µm) were sectioned from the vermis on a vibratome (Leica VT 1200S) and transferred to oxygenated aCSF at RT containing (in mM): 1 MgCl2, 2 CaCl2 instead of 3 MgCl2, 0.1 CaCl2 as described earlier. Slices were incubated for &gt;1 hr before recording. Purkinje cells were visually identified using infrared DIC imaging with a 40 × water immersion objective. Whole-cell recordings from Purkinje cells in cerebellar lobules IV/V (voltage-clamped at −70 mV) were performed at RT with borosilicate glass pipettes (2–3 MΩ) pulled with a vertical micropipette puller (PC-10, Narishige). Internal pipette solutions contained (in mM): for all EPSCs, 140 Cs-gluconate, 5 CsCl, 2 MgCl2, 0.5 EGTA, 2 Na-ATP, 0.5 Na-GTP (pH 7.3, adjusted with CsOH); for IPSCs, 145 CsCl, 2 MgCl2, 0.5 EGTA, 2 Na-ATP, 0.5 NaGTP (pH 7.3, adjusted with CsOH). For CF-EPSC and PF-EPSC recordings, the aCSF bath solution contained 50 µM picrotoxin and 10 µM APV; miniature EPSC recordings also included 1 µM TTX. For mIPSC recordings, the aCSF bath solution contained 10 µM CNQX, 10 µM APV and 1 µM TTX. Focal square pulse stimuli (duration 50 μs, amplitude 5–15 V or 200-600mA) were applied with a bipolar stimulation electrode (FHC, Bowdoinham, ME) connected to a Model 2100 Isolated Pulse Stimulator (A-M Systems, Inc) synchronized with the Clampfit 10 data acquisition software (Molecular Devices), with currents recorded by a Multiclamp 700B amplifier (Molecular Devices). Climbing fibers were stimulated in the granule cell layer around Purkinje cells (~100 µm) and identified by their characteristic all-or-none response and paired-pulse depression at a 50 ms inter-stimulus interval (ISI). The number of steps of climbing-fiber EPSCs was defined as the maximal number of climbing-fiber EPSC responses with different amplitudes recorded with different stimulus strengths at different stimulation sites in the granule cell layer. Parallel fibers were stimulated in the distal molecular layer (~200 μm from the target Purkinje cell) and identified by paired-pulse facilitation at 50 ms ISI. Only Purkinje cells with a series resistance &lt;12 MΩ (not compensated; monitored before and after experiments by applying 10 ms, −5 mV voltage pulses) were used for analyses. Amplitude and PPR of evoked EPSCs were averaged from 5 to 10 traces. mEPSCs and mIPSCs were thresholded at 5 pA and hand-picked and analyzed using Clampfit 10.7 (Molecular Devices). Whole-cell currents were recorded at 10 kHz and filtered with a Bessel filter at 4 kHz.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Data analyses and statistics</title><p>All data are shown as means ± SEM, with statistical significance (*p&lt;0.05, **p&lt;0.01, ***p&lt;0.001) determined by Student’s t-test, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), two-way ANOVA or Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) tests.

Latrophillins are a fascinating set of molecules, first identified as the target of a toxin (α-latrotoxin) and more recently demonstrated to have endogenous ligands. They are expressed throughout the nervous system and there has been considerable interest in defining their function over the past 20 years. It appears that one of the major stumbling blocks may be the partial redundancy of function when more than one of these proteins is expressed in a postsynaptic neuron. This is highlighted here and overcome with the use of conditional, double knockouts, a definitive and clear approach.</p><p>The work follows on recent work demonstrating remarkable synapse-specific effects of these molecules within the hippocampal network. In the present work, latrophilin-1 and latrophilin-2 are demonstrated to both be required for the parallel fibers contacting postsynaptic PCs, without affecting the climbing fiber synapses. This was most clearly demonstrated electrophysiologically, a result that was anatomically confirmed as a decrease in vGlut staining. The phenotype is most consistent with a change in synapse number, as there were no changes in release dynamics, and given the decrease in vGlut staining.</p><p>The experiments are clear and nicely presented. In general, the reviewers agree that the work is appropriate for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>, appealing to the broad readership of <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) There was discussion regarding anatomical data supporting a conclusion of altered excitatory synapse number. It is acknowledged that the specific geometry of the excitatory synapses being studied is challenging for approaches that have been used previously, including retrograde tracing. However, considerable weight is given to vGlut staining. Could the authors expand upon their existing argument with additional semi-quantitative anatomical probes (other antibodies to pre- or postsynaptic diagnostic proteins)? Alternatively, would it be possible apply basic biochemical assays for synaptic protein abundances? In essence, the electrophysiological phenotype is clear. Can the proposed anatomical correlate be strengthened for excitatory synapses?</p><p>2) Could the authors comment directly on the developmental progression of CRE expression in the cerebellum for the CRE-drivers used in this study? And, by extension, could this information be used to infer the function of Lphn2/3 in the different stages of synapse development (formation, maturation versus stability)? Comments in the Discussion would be sufficient.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.54443.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) There was discussion regarding anatomical data supporting a conclusion of altered excitatory synapse number.

In the experiment, we stained cerebellar sections from Lphn23 double cKO and littermate control mice for Homer1, a postsynaptic density protein, in addition to vGluT1 to label parallel-fiber presynaptic terminals and MAP2 to label neuronal dendrites. We quantified the density of Homer1 puncta on both primary Purkinje cell dendrites that primarily receive climbing-fiber synaptic inputs and distal tertiary dendrites that primarily receive parallel-fiber inputs. We found that the density of Homer1 puncta on primary Purkinje cell dendrites was unchanged by Lphn23 double-deletion but that the density of Homer1 puncta on distal tertiary Purkinje cell dendrites was significantly reduced after Lphn23 double-deletion from Purkinje cells (Figure 4—figure supplement 1B-C). The ~20% reduction in Homer1 puncta density at distal dendrites is consistent with the magnitude of the reduction in mEPSC frequency with rise times &gt; 2 ms that are primarily derived from parallel-fiber synapses. Homer1 puncta size and fluorescent intensity were unchanged by the Lphn23 double-deletion, but vGluT1 staining intensity at Homer1 puncta on distal dendrites was reduced in the Lphn23 double-deficient sections.</p><p>We believe this experiment provides additional anatomical support for the finding of reduced synapse number specifically at parallel-fiber inputs with Lphn23 double-deletion from Purkinje cells.</p><p>We have amended the Results to add the following statement:</p><p>“The two types of excitatory inputs onto Purkinje cells can be distinguished anatomically as parallel fibers form synapses onto secondary and tertiary dendrites while climbing-fibers form synapses onto primary dendrites that are closer to the Purkinje cell soma. In support of a reduction of parallel-fiber but not climbing-fiber synapse number, we stained Lphn2/3 double-deficient sections for Homer1 and found that Homer1 puncta density was reduced on distal tertiary dendrites but not primary dendrites of Purkinje cells (Figure 4—figure supplement 1).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Could the authors comment directly on the developmental progression of CRE expression in the cerebellum for the CRE-drivers used in this study?

While the current study does not distinguish between a role for Lphns in synapse formation versus synapse maintenance, excitatory synaptic transmission onto CA1 neurons of the hippocampus is similarly impaired by the Lphn3 deletion at P0 and P21, suggesting that Lphns may have a broad role in excitatory synapse maintenance.”</p><p>“Our findings do not preclude a role for Lphn3 in Bergmann glia earlier in development, as the deletion of Lphn3 studied here was initiated at P10, similar to the start of Cre expression in the L7-Cre mouse line.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
