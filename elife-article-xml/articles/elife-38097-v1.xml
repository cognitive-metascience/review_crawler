macromolecular motor that uses the proton gradient to generate ATP. Proper ATP synthase function requires a stator linking the catalytic and rotary portions of the complex. However, sequence-based searches fail to identify genes encoding stator subunits in apicomplexan parasites like <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> or the related organisms that cause malaria. Here, we identify 11 previously unknown subunits from the <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> ATP synthase, which lack homologs outside the phylum. Modeling suggests that two of them, ICAP2 and ICAP18, are distantly related to mammalian stator subunits. Our analysis shows that both proteins form part of the ATP synthase complex. Depletion of ICAP2 leads to aberrant mitochondrial morphology, decreased oxygen consumption, and disassembly of the complex, consistent with its role as an essential component of the <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> ATP synthase. Our findings highlight divergent features of the central metabolic machinery in apicomplexans, which may reveal new therapeutic opportunities.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic></kwd><kwd>ATP synthase</kwd><kwd>mitochondria</kwd><kwd>Apicomplexa</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1DP5OD017892</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lourido</surname><given-names>Sebastian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1R21AI123746</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lourido</surname><given-names>Sebastian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>K99AI137218</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Huet</surname><given-names>Diego</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A phylum-specific ATP synthase subunit is needed for proper mitochondrial function and stability of the complex in <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic>.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The ATP synthase is a highly conserved protein complex found in the plasma membrane of bacteria, the inner membrane of mitochondria, and the thylakoid membrane of chloroplasts. The complex consists of two functionally distinct portions: the hydrophilic F<sub>1</sub> and the membrane-bound F<sub>o</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Walker, 2013</xref>). The mechanism of this molecular motor is best understood for the mitochondrial ATP synthases of yeast and mammals. Within their mitochondria, the proton gradient generated by the electron transport chain (ETC) drives the rotation of a ring of <italic>c</italic> subunits in F<sub>o</sub> and of the attached central stalk within F<sub>1</sub>. This rotation causes the conformational changes in the α and β subunits of F<sub>1</sub> that mediate catalysis of ATP from ADP and inorganic phosphate (P<sub>i</sub>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jonckheere et al., 2012</xref>). The stator, also known as the lateral stalk, is an essential component of the ATP synthase because it counteracts the rotation of the α and β subunits, enabling ATP synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dickson et al., 2006</xref>). It is therefore surprising that despite general conservation of the central subunits, the lateral elements of protozoan ATP synthases are structurally diverse, and these organisms appear to lack homologs for the stator subunits of yeast and mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lapaille et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>The composition of the mitochondrial ATP synthase has mainly been determined from detailed studies of purified <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>Bos taurus</italic> mitochondria, both members of the eukaryotic clade Opisthokonta. In these two species, the architecture of the ATP synthase is virtually identical, and sequence analysis and proteomics have identified homology for nearly all of the subunits that constitute the mitochondrial ATP synthase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wittig and Schägger, 2008</xref>). In contrast, recent studies in different protozoan species have reported unique structural and functional features in their ATP synthases. Proteomic and biochemical studies have identified several potential stator subunits in <italic>Tetrahymena thermophila</italic> and <italic>Euglena gracilis</italic>, although none appear conserved among protists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Balabaskaran Nina et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Perez et al., 2014</xref>). Similarly, the ATP synthases of algae like <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic> and <italic>Polytomella</italic> spp. and kinetoplastids like <italic>Trypanosoma brucei</italic> lack canonical stator subunits but possess phylum-specific proteins that likely perform that function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Šubrtová et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">van Lis et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Apicomplexans comprise a large phylum of obligate intracellular eukaryotic parasites that infect animals and cause significant human mortality and morbidity. Comparative genomics suggests that there is extensive metabolic diversity within this phylum, reflecting the variety of life cycles and host environments the various species have adapted to. Several core subunits of the ATP synthase (α, β, γ, δ, ε, <italic>c</italic>, and oligomycin sensitivity-conferring protein (OSCP)) can be found in most apicomplexan genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Vaidya and Mather, 2009</xref>). However, within the <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> genus, drastic reductions in mitochondrial metabolism have coincided with preservation of only the α and β subunits in certain species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Makiuchi and Nozaki, 2014</xref>). Notably, the stator subunits and key components of the membrane-bound portion of this complex have not been identified in any apicomplexan species.</p><p>Reliance on mitochondrial metabolism can also vary over the course of a parasite’s life cycle. For instance, the rapidly replicating forms of <italic>T. gondii</italic> catabolize glucose via the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">MacRae et al., 2012</xref>), whereas slow replicating stages seem to lack a functional TCA cycle and rely on glycolysis of stored amylopectin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Denton et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Uboldi et al., 2015</xref>). A comparable metabolic shift seems to occur when <italic>T. gondii</italic> parasites egress from host cells and rely on oxidative phosphorylation for the majority of their ATP production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">MacRae et al., 2012</xref>). <italic>Plasmodium</italic> spp. increase their TCA cycle activity as they transition from the asexual blood stages to the sexual cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">MacRae et al., 2013</xref>). Consequently, deletion of the ATP synthase β subunit marginally affects blood stages but is essential for the sexual stages in the mosquito (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sturm et al., 2015</xref>). Together with pharmacological assays, these results confirm that the apicomplexan ATP synthase is active and essential in at least some life cycle stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Balabaskaran Nina et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sturm et al., 2015</xref>). Direct measurements of ATP synthase activity in <italic>T. gondii</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Vercesi et al., 1998</xref>) further suggest that these parasites must employ highly divergent stator subunits to form a functional enzyme.</p><p>To systematically examine gene function in <italic>T. gondii</italic>, our lab previously performed a CRISPR-based genome-wide screen that identified genes contributing to parasite fitness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sidik et al., 2016</xref>). Approximately 360 of these fitness-conferring genes were broadly conserved among apicomplexans, but not other eukaryotes, and most lacked functional annotation; we referred to them as indispensable conserved apicomplexan proteins (ICAPs). Of the 17 ICAPs we determined a subcellular localization for, eight localized to the mitochondrion. This preponderance of ICAPs in the mitochondrion motivated further investigation.</p><p>Using unbiased proteomic and cryptic-homology analyses, we show that two mitochondrial ICAPs—ICAP2 and ICAP18—share homology with the ATP synthase stator subunits of opisthokonts. We show that both proteins interact with known and novel components of the ATP synthase, consistent with their role as putative subunits of the complex. Conditional depletion of ICAP2 leads to aberrant mitochondrial morphology and the disassembly of the ATP synthase complex, consistent with its proposed role in the stator. Our study reveals new information regarding the unconventional apicomplexan stator and provides a perspective on the divergent nature of the ATP synthase in this important group of pathogens.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>An indispensable conserved apicomplexan protein shares structural homology with bovine and fungal ATP synthase <italic>b</italic> subunits</title><p>ICAP2 (TGME49_231410) was originally described in our <italic>T. gondii</italic> genome-wide screens as one of the eight indispensable conserved apicomplexan proteins (ICAPs) that localized to the mitochondrion of the parasite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sidik et al., 2016</xref>). These mitochondrial ICAPs lacked functional annotation, identifiable protein domains, or homology to sequences outside the apicomplexan phylum. We therefore used the protein function and structure prediction server HHPRED to search for homologs on the basis of profile hidden Markov models and secondary structure predictions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zimmermann et al., 2018</xref>). Intriguingly, ICAP2 was predicted to contain a region of potential homology to a stator component of a mammalian ATP synthase, the bovine <italic>b</italic> subunit (<italic>Bt</italic>ATPb; 97.8% probability), despite extremely low sequence identity between the two (~24%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Subcellular localization and topology predictions support the presence of a mitochondrial targeting signal on ICAP2 as well as two transmembrane domains, similar to <italic>Bt</italic>ATPb. Despite the similarities, ICAP2 was predicted to be nearly twice as long as <italic>Bt</italic>ATPb. Unexpectedly, the analysis also predicted the presence of a putative calcium-binding domain in the N-terminal portion of ICAP2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; 74.5% probability). ICAP2 homologs were present in most apicomplexan genomes with the exception of some <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> spp. and <italic>Gregarina niphandrodes</italic>, which lack most known ATP synthase subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Vaidya and Mather, 2009</xref>).

To assess the effect of ICAP2 on ATP synthase activity, we measured the basal mitochondrial oxygen consumption rate (mOCR) in isolated parasites, following different periods of ICAP2 depletion. The basal mOCR of the mutant cells was significantly reduced 72 hr after rapamycin treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>), indicating a reduction in ETC activity upon depletion of ICAP2. We simultaneously determined the extracellular acidification rate (ECAR), a measure of the parasite’s metabolic activity that may include extracellular acidification caused by extrusion of lactate, a final product of glycolysis, and/or activity of the parasite proton-pumping ATPase (accompanying manuscript by Seidi et al.). ECAR was unchanged upon ICAP2 knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>), suggesting that the defects we observed in mOCR are not caused by reduced parasite metabolic activity. The upper limit on mOCR imposed by proton transport through the ATP synthase can be relieved using carbonyl cyanide 4-(trifluoromethoxy)phenylhydrazone (FCCP), which acts as a mobile proton carrier that uncouples ETC function from ATP production. Treating cells with FCCP thereby allowed us to measure the maximum OCR from which we calculated the spare mOCR—the difference between basal mOCR (before FCCP addition) and maximum mOCR (after FCCP addition; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>).

To suppress glycolysis, we incubated extracellular parasites with 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG)—a competitive inhibitor of glycolysis. We further supplemented the media with glutamine or sufficient glucose to overcome 2-DG inhibition. ATP production was largely normal in strains lacking ICAP2 when glucose was used as the carbon source (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). However, knockdown of ICAP2 significantly reduced ATP production when the carbon source was glutamine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). As previously demonstrated, ATP production from glutamine is oligomycin sensitive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lin et al., 2011</xref>), and the remaining ATP generated from glutamine in knockdown parasites is likely the result of residual ATP synthase activity. These results demonstrate that ICAP2 is necessary for mitochondrial ATP production.</p><p>To determine whether ICAP2 plays a role in the stability of the ATP synthase complex—as would be expected of a stator subunit—we analyzed the abundance and migration of the β subunit using SDS and blue native (BN) polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (BN-PAGE). The relative abundance of the β subunit did not vary in response to ICAP2 knockdown, as determined by immunoblot of lysates resolved by SDS-PAGE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Immunoblots of the same lysates resolved by BN-PAGE showed the β subunit participates in a complex of approximately 900 kDa in untreated cells. However, upon ICAP2 depletion, the β subunit shifted to a much smaller complex, migrating at ~100 kDa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). A significant proportion of the total β subunit could be observed in this lower complex for the cKD as early as 24 hr after rapamycin treatment, and increasing thereafter. These observations are consistent with the dissolution of the ATP synthase complex upon loss of ICAP2, similar to what has been observed in yeast and mammalian mutants lacking stator subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">He et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kane et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Soubannier et al., 2002</xref>).

It has therefore been a long-standing conundrum that most apicomplexan genomes appear to code for only the core subunits of the ATP synthase but none of the stator subunits. Here, we propose that ICAP2 (TGME49_231410) and ICAP18 (TGME49_268830) fulfill the roles of the stator <italic>b</italic> and <italic>d</italic> subunits, respectively.

Immunocapture of these putative subunits showed that they stably interact with the ATP synthase complex, along with at least nine other proteins that are conserved among apicomplexans. Moreover, conditional knockdown of ICAP2 leads to abnormal mitochondrial morphology, slow replication, and parasite death. ICAP2 was also necessary for the activity of the ATP synthase, and its absence caused a reduction in oxygen consumption by the mitochondrion and disassembly of the complex. Our results reveal highly divergent aspects of the apicomplexan ATP synthase and demonstrate their importance for parasite viability.</p><p>We previously identified ICAP2 as one of eight novel mitochondrial proteins, which we localized because of their roles in parasite fitness, a lack of functional domains, and conservation among apicomplexans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sidik et al., 2016</xref>).

ATP synthase complexes in other protists are characterized by a combination of conserved and phylum-specific subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Balabaskaran Nina et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Šubrtová et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">van Lis et al., 2007</xref>). Our work demonstrates that distant homology searches can complement the molecular characterization of protein complexes in apicomplexans as in other divergent eukaryotes.</p><p>The length and extraneous domains present in ICAP2 make it a highly unusual <italic>b</italic> subunit, which has motivated the characterization we present. In particular, ICAP2 is nearly twice as long as its mammalian counterparts and appears to have an EF-like domain in its N terminus. EF domains bind cations like Ca<sup>2+</sup> or Mg<sup>2+</sup> and can act to modulate protein-protein interactions or enzymatic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kawasaki and Kretsinger, 2017</xref>). Mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake is known to regulate several metabolic processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">De Stefani et al., 2016</xref>), and the presence of an EF-like domain suggests that ATP synthase activity may be somehow coordinated with mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Treatment of <italic>T. gondii</italic> with the ATP synthase inhibitor oligomycin causes an immediate increase in cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Moreno and Zhong, 1996</xref>). Although this may simply reflect the use of ATP by the endoplasmic-reticulum Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATPase, it also suggests a need for strong coupling between ATP production and Ca<sup>2+</sup> sequestration. Divergent stator paralogs are expressed in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> testis and underlie tissue specific properties of the ATP synthase that impact mitochondrial morphology and activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sawyer et al., 2017</xref>). Having provided strong evidence for the role of ICAP2 in the ATP synthase, more work will be needed to characterize the structure of the complex and understand how its unusual features mediate the specific adaptations of apicomplexan mitochondria.</p><p>ICAP2 is one of 11 novel subunits we believe are part of the apicomplexan ATP synthase. Orthologs of all of these subunits are found exclusively among alveolates, although they are absent from the genomes of species with reduced mitochondrial pathways. Several <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> spp. (<italic>C. hominis</italic>, <italic>C. parvum</italic>, and <italic>C. ubiquitum</italic>) exhibit extreme reductions in the TCA cycle and electron transport chains, and concomitantly lack most of the known subunits of the ATP synthase along with the novel subunits we have identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liu et al., 2016</xref>). However, all <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> spp. retain the α and β subunits, which can convert ATP<sup>4-</sup> to ADP<sup>3-</sup>, fueling the generation of a membrane potential (Δψ) across the inner mitochondrial membrane through the action of the ADP/ATP carrier (AAC). A similar mechanism has been proposed for the F<sub>o</sub>-independent generation of Δψ in <italic>Trypanosoma brucei</italic> strains carrying mutations in the γ subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dean et al., 2013</xref>). Even in the absence of an ATP synthase, Δψ is needed for the import of proteins into the matrix of mitochondria and mitosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fox, 2012</xref>). Intriguingly, the genome of <italic>Gregarina niphandrodes</italic>, a divergent apicomplexan that infects beetles, lacks all of the mentioned ATP synthase subunits, including α and β along with homologs of the AAC (CryptoDB), and would require an alternative mechanism to generate Δψ if mitosomes are present and active in this organism.</p><p>We present the first direct evidence for the important role of the ATP synthase in <italic>T. gondii</italic> metabolism. Pharmacological and metabolomics approaches had previously demonstrated the presence of ATP synthase activity in <italic>T. gondii</italic> mitochondria and the importance of oxidative phosphorylation in supplying ATP to the parasite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">MacRae et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Vercesi et al., 1998</xref>). Consistent with these observations, depletion of ICAP2 reduces the rate of parasite replication and ultimately leads to a loss of parasite viability. This is in contrast to the mild effect of knocking out the β subunit in blood stages of <italic>P. berghei</italic>, although such mutants are subsequently impaired during the sexual stages of the life cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sturm et al., 2015</xref>). The variable impact of the ATP synthase on the various stages of different apicomplexans may reflect the ability of these parasites to adapt to the changing environmental conditions they encounter across their life cycles.</p><p>ICAP2 depletion appears to damage <italic>T. gondii</italic> mitochondria leading to fragmentation and loss of volume. In other eukaryotes, mitochondrial fission segregates damaged parts of the organelle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Youle and van der Bliek, 2012</xref>). Mitochondrial fragmentation has been previously observed in <italic>T. gondii</italic> in response to exogenous stresses, including starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ghosh et al., 2012</xref>) or monensin treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Charvat and Arrizabalaga, 2016</xref>). The effect of monensin was attributed to its uncoupling activity and to the induction of oxidative stress. Both effects could resemble defects in the ATP synthase like those predicted to result from loss of the stator; uncoupling would dissipate the Δψ used by the complex, and mutations in the F<sub>o</sub> subunits can lead to increased reactive oxygen species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baracca et al., 2007</xref>). <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> stator subunit mutants have punctate, rounded mitochondria that display an altered ultrastructure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bornhövd et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Weimann et al., 2008</xref>). These defects result from the involvement of the stator subunits in cristae formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cogliati et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wittig and Schägger, 2008</xref>) and the uncoupling of ATP hydrolysis from proton translocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Paul et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Soubannier et al., 2002</xref>). Although ICAP2-depleted mitochondria did not show the smooth concentric membranes seen in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> stator mutants, they did have fewer cristae than wild-type mitochondria. To further understand the effects that lead to mitochondrial fragmentation, it will be interesting to compare uncoupling mutations, like ICAP2 loss, to disruption of the catalytic or proton-transporting functions of the <italic>T. gondii</italic> ATP synthase.</p><p>Without a functioning ATP synthase, the ETC is presumably inhibited by a buildup of Δψ, which would normally be dissipated through the rotating F<sub>o</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mueller, 2000</xref>). We observed that the mOCR is reduced in ICAP2-depleted parasites and can be restored by the addition of a proton ionophore that dissipates Δψ. In the accompanying paper by Seidi, Muellner-Wong, and Rajendran, et al., disruption of a novel apicomplexan component of the ETC complex IV also reduced the mOCR, although this effect could not be reversed by proton ionophore treatment. This indicates a general ETC defect in the complex IV mutant distinct from that observed upon ICAP2 depletion. Notably, mutations in complex IV appear to have a milder effect on parasite viability and did not alter mitochondrial morphology. We also observed normal morphology upon ETC inhibition with atovaquone (a complex III inhibitor) and fragmented mitochondria following ATP synthase inhibition with oligomycin (data not shown).</p><p>The contribution of the mitochondrial ATP synthase to cellular ATP pools can be directly measured in <italic>T. gondii</italic> following repression of glycolysis by 2-DG and utilization of glutamine for oxidative phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lin et al., 2011</xref>). As expected, ICAP2-depletion severely compromised the production of ATP from glutamine, while its production from glycolysis remained largely unchanged. ICAP2 is therefore necessary for the proper function of the mitochondrial ATP synthase.</p><p>Together, these data indicate that the defects in mitochondrial morphology upon ICAP2 knockdown are not the result of general defects in the ETC, but rather a specific effect of ATP synthase impairment. In mammalian cells, inhibition of complexes I, III, or V (ATP synthase) resulted in distinct metabolic signatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2016</xref>). Similarly, in blood-stage malaria, it appears that the main purpose of the ETC is the regeneration of ubiquinone for pyrimidine biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Painter et al., 2007</xref>). Therefore, inhibiting oxidative phosphorylation at different steps is expected to have different consequences, which should be investigated further as we explore these pathways as therapeutic targets in apicomplexans.</p><p>Our work identifies novel and highly divergent features of the apicomplexan ATP synthase, including two proteins that we believe comprise the complex’s stator—ICAP2 and ICAP18. Previous studies had hypothesized the existence of a divergent stator in apicomplexans, and our observations confirm the presence and identity of such elements. We demonstrate the importance of these features by knocking down ICAP2, which leads to breakdown of the complex, defects in mitochondrial function and morphology, and loss of parasite viability. The conservation of these proteins in other apicomplexan species will also motivate their consideration as therapeutic targets. Future studies into the structure and function of these divergent features will help us understand their contributions to apicomplexan adaptation. Unlike most organisms, all of the ATP synthase subunits are encoded in the nuclear genome, making <italic>T. gondii</italic> a highly tractable organism to study the evolution of this important protein complex.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table

Finally, correct integration of the ICAP2-Ty cKD cassette into the ICAP2 locus was confirmed by sequencing, and parasites were isolated and subcloned by limiting dilution. For live microscopy experiments, the DiCre∆<italic>KU80</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andenmatten et al., 2013</xref>) and ICAP2-Ty cKD strains were transfected with pT8mycSOD2(SPTP)GFPmycHX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pino et al., 2007</xref>) and TubIMC1TdTomato-CAT plasmids. After their first lysis, dually fluorescent cells were FACS-sorted into 96-well plates to obtain single clones.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Immunofluorescence microscopy and immunoblotting</title><p>Intracellular parasites were fixed with 4% formaldehyde at 4°C for 15 min and permeabilized with 0.25% Triton X-100 in PBS for 8 min.

Rapamycin was removed after 2 hr, and parasites were allowed to grow for 24 or 48 hr. Vacuoles containing one or two parasites were imaged live using an Eclipse Ti microscope (Nikon) with an enclosure heated to 37°C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. For each vacuole, a z-stack of approximately 25 frames at 0.2 µm spacing between each slice was taken. The bottom and top slices were set so that the mitochondria were just slightly out of focus. The mitochondrial volume was calculated using MitoGraph as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Viana et al., 2015</xref>).

The low osmolarity fixative was used to dilute soluble cytosolic proteins and enhance the visualization of mitochondria. Samples were then rinsed extensively in cold dH<sub>2</sub>O prior to en bloc staining with 1% aqueous uranyl acetate (Ted Pella Inc.) at 4°C for 3 hr. Following several rinses in dH<sub>2</sub>O, samples were dehydrated in a graded series of ethanol and embedded in Eponate 12 resin (Ted Pella Inc.). Sections of 95 nm were cut with a Leica Ultracut UCT ultramicrotome (Leica Microsystems Inc.), stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate, and viewed on a JEOL 1200 EX transmission electron microscope (JEOL USA Inc.) equipped with an AMT 8-megapixel digital camera and AMT Image Capture Engine V602 software (Advanced Microscopy Techniques). For cristae enumeration, images were blinded and the mitochondrial area along with the corresponding number of cristae in each area were counted using FIJI. The images were subsequently un-blinded and the values for rapamycin-treated and vehicle were compared using a Mann-Whitney test.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Mass spectrometry</title><p>After each immunoprecipitation experiment, bands from the SDS-PAGE gels were excised, divided into ~2 mm squares and washed overnight in 50% methanol in water. These were washed once more with 47.5% methanol 5% acetic acid in water for 2 hr, dehydrated with acetonitrile, and dried in a speed-vac. Reduction and alkylation of disulfide bonds was carried out by the addition of 30 µl 10 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) in 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate (NH<sub>4</sub>HCO<sub>3</sub>) for 30 min. Samples were alkylated by removal of the DTT solution and addition of 100 mM iodoacetamide in 100 mM NH<sub>4</sub>HCO<sub>3</sub> for 30 min. Samples were sequentially washed with aliquots of acetonitrile, 100 mM NH<sub>4</sub>HCO<sub>3</sub>, and acetonitrile and dried in a speed-vac. The bands were enzymatically digested with 300 ng of sequencing-grade Trypsin (Promega, cat. no. V5111) in 50 mM NH<sub>4</sub>HCO<sub>3</sub> for 10 min on ice. Sufficient NH<sub>4</sub>HCO<sub>3</sub> was added to rehydrate the gel pieces. These were allowed to digest overnight at 37°C with gentle agitation. Peptides were extracted by gently agitating the gel bands 10 min with sequential 50 µl washes of 50 mM NH<sub>4</sub>HCO<sub>3</sub> and twice with 47.5% acetonitrile 5% formic acid in water. All extractions were pooled in a 0.5 ml conical autosampler vial. Organic solvent was removed and the volumes were reduced to 15 µl using a speed-vac. Samples were analyzed by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography using a Waters NanoAcquity in line with a ThermoFisher Orbitrap Elite mass spectrometer, in a nano-flow configuration. The mass spectrometer was operated in a top 10 data-dependent acquisition mode using a 240,000 FWHM m/z resolution in the Orbitrap and fragmentation in the linear ion trap.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Mass spectrometry data analysis</title><p>Peptide searches were performed with Mascot (Matrix Science) algorithms against the <italic>T. gondii</italic> protein database (version 11, ToxoDB.org) concatenated to a database of common contaminants (keratin, trypsin, etc).

Freshly egressed parasites filtered through 3 µm were washed twice in Seahorse XF base medium (Agilent Technologies) supplemented with 1 mM L-glutamine and 5 mM D-glucose, before re-suspension to 1.5 × 10<sup>7</sup> parasites per ml. 100 µl of the parasite suspensions were seeded into wells of a 96-well culture plate coated with 3.5 µg/cm<sup>2</sup> of CellTak cell adhesive (In Vitro Technologies, cat. no.

Parasites were kept at 37°C in ambient air until the start of experiment. Parasite oxygen consumption rates (OCR) and extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) were measured using an Agilent Seahorse XFe96 Analyzer. To determine the maximal OCR, parasites were treated with FCCP to a final concentration of 1 µM. To determine the non-mitochondrial OCR, parasites were treated with 10 µM antimycin A and 1 µM atovaquone. OCR measurements were acquired for 3 min at 6 min intervals across the course of the experiment. Results were compiled using the Wave Desktop program, and analysis of parasite OCR was performed using the R software environment. Linear mixed-effects models were fitted to the data, with error between plates and wells (i.e. between and within experiments) defined as the random effect, and the OCR measurements in the different parasite strains and the time after rapamycin treatment defined as the fixed effect. A minimum of 4 wells was used for background correction in each assay plate. Parasite mOCR was computed by subtracting the non-mitochondrial OCR measured following addition of antimycin A and atovaquone from the basal OCR. The spare capacity of the parasite ETC was computed by measuring the difference between basal mOCR and maximal mOCR (following the addition of FCCP).</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Measurement of cellular ATP concentration</title><p>Parental and ICAP2-Ty cKD parasites were grown in the presence or absence of 50 nM rapamycin for 2 hr, and subsequently cultured for 3 days before harvesting for the assay.

Cells were then resuspended in FluoroBrite DMEM (Thermo Fisher, cat. no. A1896701) supplemented with 1% IFS and Halt protease inhibitor (Thermo Fisher, cat. no.1862209), scraped and syringe-released. Freshly released parasites were centrifuged at 80 x <italic>g</italic> for 5 min to remove host cell debris, and the supernatant containing the parasites was removed and centrifuged at 400 x <italic>g</italic> for 10 min and resuspended in glucose- and glutamine-free DMEM (Sigma, cat. no.

Parasites were counted, washed once more in glucose- and glutamine-free DMEM, and resuspended at 6 × 10<sup>6</sup> parasites per ml. 50 µl aliquots of each strain were arrayed in a 96-well PCR plate, and 50 µl of the corresponding compounds diluted in glucose- and glutamine-free DMEM were added accordingly to each well. 2-DG (Sigma, cat. no. D6134) was used at 5 mM, glucose (Thermo Fisher, cat. no. 15023021) was used at 25 mM, glutamine (Sigma, cat. no. G8540) was used at 2 mM and oligomycin (EMD Milipore, cat. no. 495455) at 20 µM. Parasites were incubated with the respective treatments at 37°C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub> for an hour. To determine the initial ATP concentrations, control samples were immediately flash frozen and all other samples were flash frozen following incubation. To measure ATP concentration, 100 µl of CellTiter-Glo Reagent (Promega, cat. no. G7572) was added to the frozen samples, which were then allowed to thaw and equilibrate for 1 hr at room temperature. After equilibration, 100 µl from each well was transferred to a flat-bottom, black, 96-well plate. Luminescence was measured with an Envision microplate reader (Perkin-Elmer). For each strain and treatment, ATP levels were normalized to the initial ATP concentration.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Eric Spooner at the Whitehead Proteomics Core and Wandy Beatty at the Washington University Molecular Microbiology Imaging Facility for scientific services, L David Sibley for the ALD antibody, Peter Bradley for the F<sub>1</sub>β antibody, Dominique Soldati-Favre for the HSP70 antibody and the SOD2-GFP vector, and Markus Meissner for the DiCre∆<italic>KU80</italic> strain and the U1-tagging plasmid.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Dominique Soldati-Favre as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen Anna Akhmanova as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Martin Blume (Reviewer #2); Akhil Vaidya (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Mitochondrial ATP synthase complex sits at the center of energy economy of most eukaryotic organisms. This nanomotor has highly conserved subunit composition and is made up of two sectors, F<sub>1</sub>, consisting of the catalytic subunits, and F<sub>o</sub>, consisting of subunits that constitute proton channels that drive rotary motion. Previous studies have shown the presence of core subunits that make up the F<sub>1</sub> sector in many unicellular eukaryotes including most members of the phylum Apicomplexa. However, except for the <italic>c</italic> subunit, F<sub>o</sub> sector subunits could not be detected through bioinformatic approaches in many of these organisms. The manuscript by Huet et al. reports the discovery of several such &quot;missing&quot; subunits in <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> and conservation of these subunits in most apicomplexans and chromerids. These findings represent an important advance with implications for evolution of this central player in bioenergetics as well as for potential approaches to exploit the differences seen here to develop new therapeutic approaches. The work is carried out competently with a variety of approaches used to support their findings.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) A manuscript currently deposited at bioRxiv (Salunke et al.; https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/05/14/321620 (now published in PLOS Biology, Salunke et al., 2018)) also describes subunit composition of <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> ATP synthase complex. In this manuscript, the authors find 20 novel subunits in addition to the 7 previously known subunits. In contrast, Huet et al. report just 11 novel subunits. Salunke et al. manuscript list 10 of the 11 subunits that Huet et al. report, which is quite reassuring, but the absence of 10 subunits listed by Salunke et al. in Huet et al. list is disconcerting. Huet et al. use an elaborate filtering approach to eliminate a large number of proteins detected through LC-MS/MS. The question thus arises as to whether the 10 additional subunits seen by Salunke et al. were filtered out by Huet et al. or that these were not detected in the first place. One possible reason for the discrepancy could be the tagged subunit used by the authors to pull down the complex for LC-MS/MS analysis: Huet et al. used the <italic>b</italic> subunit (present at 1:1 stoichiometry) whereas Salunke et al. used the β subunit (present at 3:1 stoichiometry). (Action to take: specify more clearly the stringency criteria applied to your analysis.)</p><p>2) The authors do not provide direct biochemical evidence for the proposed roles of ICAP2/18 in a functional ATP synthase complex. As proxy, oxygen consumption is measured in an ICAP2 knockdown mutant. This provides only an indirect measure as ATP synthase does not reduce oxygen. Further the seahorse data supporting this are incompletely reported as bar graphs.</p><p>Glycolytic and mitochondrial contributions to ATP production in extracellular tachyzoites was characterized before (Lin et al., 2011) and mitochondria were found to contribute a small but quantifiable fraction to cellular ATP. The assay and conditions used in that paper glucose-free, 2-DG and glutamine supplemented should enable a more direct measurement of ATP in the ICAP2 knockdown mutant. (Action to take: to be addressed experimentally.)</p><p>3) The authors are missing an important opportunity to point out implications of their findings in reference to the evolution of the apparent monophyletic clade Alveolata. The absence of the ATP synthase subunits they have found in Toxoplasma from the ciliates (and vice versa, i.e. ciliate ATP synthase subunits are absent in other alveolates) suggests almost a complete replacement of ATP synthase subunits at the branch point separating ciliates from the rest of the alveolate clade. Indeed, authors should include dinoflagellates in their comparative analysis (they actually have these &quot;missing&quot; subunits with orthology to <italic>Toxoplasma</italic>, as pointed out by Salunke et al.). The chromoalveolate hypothesis has suggested monophyletic origin of all organisms possessing secondary red algal plastid and implying that ciliates may have lost their plastids. There are other studies that argue against this, and thus the present study provides further evidence against chromoalveolate hypothesis. One possibility is that the novel ATP synthase subunits shared by apicomplexans, chromerids (and dinoflagellates) may have originated from the nuclearly encoded genes of the secondary endosymbiont that targeted them to its mitochondrion, which now having been lost, got incorporated in the host nucleus for its own mitochondrion. (Action to take: extend the Discussion section.)</p><p>4) Importantly, the <italic>a</italic> subunit of the F<sub>o</sub> sector forms in combination with the <italic>c</italic> subunit, the proton channel that causes the rotation. The authors have detected a putative subunit <italic>a</italic>, but do not provide a detailed description of its structural features. It would be important to point out conserved features of this subunit that would form the channel, especially a conserved arginine residue that is critical for proton translocation.

In light of the recent publication, we have addressed the discrepancy between the two studies by including a new column in Supplementary file 1 indicating the name of each candidate protein according to the Salunke et al. paper. While our mass spectrometry analysis did detect all twenty ASAPs identified by Salunke et al., we excluded ten of them on the basis of lack of conservation between apicomplexan species. Our criteria are explicitly stated in the Results section under “A novel array of proteins is associated with the <italic>T. gondii</italic> ATP synthase” and within Supplementary file 1. We have also modified the Discussion section to include the following statement:</p><p>“During the revision of this manuscript, a similar set of proteins was identified as part of a proteomic analysis of the purified <italic>T. gondii</italic> ATP synthase complex (Salunke, Mourier, Banerjee, Pain, and Shanmugam, 2018). In addition to the novel subunits we described, the authors describe ten additional subunits, which our proteomic analysis identified, but we excluded on the basis of lack of conservation in either <italic>C. muris, P. falciparum</italic> or <italic>C. velia</italic> (Supplementary file 1). The novel subunits we propose may be closer to the core set of ATP synthase subunits present in alveolates; however, further studies will be needed to elucidate the function of most novel subunits regardless of their degree of conservation.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors do not provide direct biochemical evidence for the proposed roles of ICAP2/18 in a functional ATP synthase complex.

(2011) and used 2-DG, glucose, glutamine and oligomycin to measure the contribution of glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation on ATP production by the cKD. The outcome of these experiments is shown in the new Figure 6C and demonstrates the importance of ICAP2 for ATP production from glutamine via oxidative phosphorylation. The Results section and Discussion section have been modified accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors are missing an important opportunity to point out implications of their findings in reference to the evolution of the apparent monophyletic clade Alveolata. The absence of the ATP synthase subunits they have found in Toxoplasma from the ciliates (and vice versa, i.e. ciliate ATP synthase subunits are absent in other alveolates) suggests almost a complete replacement of ATP synthase subunits at the branch point separating ciliates from the rest of the alveolate clade. Indeed, authors should include dinoflagellates in their comparative analysis (they actually have these &quot;missing&quot; subunits with orthology to Toxo, as pointed out by Salunke et al.). The chromoalveolate hypothesis has suggested monophyletic origin of all organisms possessing secondary red algal plastid and implying that ciliates may have lost their plastids. There are other studies that argue against this, and thus the present study provides further evidence against chromoalveolate hypothesis.

(Action to take: extend the Discussion section.)</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewers’ comments and have now included <italic>Perkinsus</italic> and <italic>Symbiodinium</italic> in our comparative analysis of ICAP2 and ICAP18. Figure 1—figure supplement 1 and Figure 2—figure supplement 1 have been modified accordingly and we now mention “other alveolates” in addition to apicomplexans and chromerids in discussing the conservation of these subunits. Although related subunits can be found outside the Apicomplexa, their conservation is incomplete and we can neither prove nor disprove the chromalveolate hypothesis on the basis of our findings. While ICAP2 and ICAP18 homologs can be found in dinoflagellates and perkinsids, we have not been able to find them in ciliates or outside of alveolates. In particular, the absence of these subunits in red algal genomes precludes us from drawing conclusions about their possible origin from the secondary endosymbiont, as the reviewers propose.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Importantly, the a subunit of the F<sub>o</sub> sector forms in combination with the c subunit, the proton channel that causes the rotation. The authors have detected a putative subunit a, but do not provide a detailed description of its structural features. It would be important to point out conserved features of this subunit that would form the channel, especially a conserved arginine residue that is critical for proton translocation. (Action to take: extend the Discussion section.)</p></disp-quote><p>We have modified Figure 3 to include a diagram of the ATP synthase indicating the predicted position of the putative stator and <italic>a</italic> subunits. In addition, we have included an alignment of the putative <italic>a</italic> subunit in Figure 3—figure supplement 2 that indicates the position of the conserved arginine, and we have extended the Discussion section accordingly:</p><p>“In opisthokonts, the <italic>a</italic> subunit is a multi-span membrane protein with a conserved arginine residue critical for its function (Mitome et al., 2010). Topology predictions of the putative <italic>a</italic> subunit suggest the presence of three TM domains and an arginine residue that is conserved in apicomplexans and other alveolates (Figure 3—figure supplement 2).”</p></body></sub-article></article>
