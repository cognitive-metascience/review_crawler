To survive in the low oxygen environment of their hosts, these parasites use unusual anaerobic metabolism — this requires rhodoquinone (RQ), an electron carrier that is made by very few animal species. Crucially RQ is not made or used by any parasitic hosts and RQ synthesis is thus an ideal target for anthelmintics. However, little is known about how RQ is made and no drugs are known to block RQ synthesis. <italic>C. elegans</italic> makes RQ and can use RQ-dependent metabolic pathways — here, we use <italic>C. elegans</italic> genetics to show that tryptophan degradation via the kynurenine pathway is required to generate the key amine-containing precursors for RQ synthesis. We show that <italic>C. elegans</italic> requires RQ for survival in hypoxic conditions and, finally, we establish a high throughput assay for drugs that block RQ-dependent metabolism. This may drive the development of a new class of anthelmintic drugs. This study is a key first step in understanding how RQ is made in parasitic helminths.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.48165.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Parasitic worms infect more than a billion people worldwide, using a range of tricks to survive inside the human body. Some species can live for weeks inside the gut, a place with almost no oxygen. Yet exactly how they manage this is remains unclear.</p><p>Scientists know that parasitic worms have an unusual way of making chemical energy when oxygen levels drop. Like human cells, worm cells use a series of molecular complexes called the electron transport chain. As electrons pass along the chain, they drive the production of chemical energy. Normally, oxygen sits at the end of the chain to receive the electrons. But, when there is no oxygen, almost all animals stop using the electron transport chain. A few animals can continue to use it by using other molecules to receive the final electrons instead of oxygen. To do that, they need a special electron carrier and, in worms, this electron carrier is rhodoquinone.</p><p>Human cells do not use rhodoquinone, making it a prime target for drug design. If a drug could block rhodoquinone production, it might be able to stop worms surviving in the human intestines without harming the patient’s own cells. Yet, even though the scientific community has known about rhodoquinone for more than 50 years, it remains unclear how worms make this molecule.</p><p>To find out, Del Borrello et al. examined the laboratory worm <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>. This worm is not a parasite, but it does make rhodoquinone. Del Borrello et al. developed a new way to study rhodoquinone production by blocking the normal route of the electron transport chain with cyanide. This causes the worms to switch to using rhodoquinone and is cheaper than raising the worms in low oxygen, making it easier to conduct high-throughput screening. A combination of chemistry and information from other species made it possible to identify candidate genes responsible for the production of rhodoquinone. Worms with faults in these genes revealed the key building blocks of rhodoquinone, and the early steps in its production. Removing any one of the genes made it harder for the worms to survive without oxygen.</p><p>Although there are already effective drugs that kill parasitic worms, resistance is growing. A better understanding of rhodoquinone could lead to a new class of drugs to help control this major problem in global health. A drug that blocks any one of the production steps of rhodoquinone might be a future candidate for a new anti-parasitic worm therapy.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>anaerobic metabolism</kwd><kwd>rhodoquinone</kwd><kwd>parasitic helminth</kwd><kwd>global health</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>501584</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fraser</surname><given-names>Andrew G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Parasitic helminths infect over a billion humans and use unusual anaerobic metabolism that needs a rare electron carrier, Rhodoquinone (RQ), whose synthesis requires the kynurenine pathway of tryptophan degradation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Soil-transmitted Helminths (STHs) are major human pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">WHO Expert Committee on the Control of Schistosomiasis, 2002</xref>). Over a billion humans are infected with an STH — the roundworm <italic>Ascaris lumbricoides,</italic> the whipworm <italic>Trichuris trichuria</italic>, and the hookworm <italic>Necator americanus</italic> account for most of these infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">WHO Expert Committee on the Control of Schistosomiasis, 2002</xref>). STHs are transmitted from human to human via the soil where eggs from human faeces develop into infective stages which then enter new hosts (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brooker et al., 2006</xref>). On infection, STHs encounter a very different environment and require multiple strategies to be able to survive. One of the major changes is the availability of oxygen. While there is abundant oxygen outside their hosts, in many host tissues there is little available oxygen — this is especially true in the intestine where oxygen levels drop steeply to near anoxia in the lumen (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Espey, 2013</xref>). To survive in these hypoxic conditions, parasites must switch from aerobic respiration to anaerobic respiration; crucially, the anaerobic metabolic pathways that STHs depend on are unusual and are not used in any host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Van Hellemond et al., 1995</xref>). Inhibiting these anaerobic pathways is therefore a possible way to kill the parasites while leaving the host unaffected.</p><p>During aerobic respiration in helminths, the great majority of ATP is made in the mitochondrion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tielens, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tielens et al., 1984</xref>). Electrons enter the Electron Transport Chain (ETC) either at Complex I or via several quinone-coupled dehydrogenases (QDHs from here on). These QDHs include Succinate Dehydrogenase (Complex II) and Electron-Transferring Flavoprotein Dehydrogenase (ETFDH) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Komuniecki et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ma et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rioux and Komuniecki, 1984</xref>). The electrons entering the ETC are first transferred to the lipid soluble electron carrier ubiquinone (UQ) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Crane et al., 1957</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mitchell, 1975</xref>). From UQ, they are ultimately carried to Complex III then IV where they are finally transferred onto oxygen as the terminal electron acceptor (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). Electron transport is coupled to proton pumping into the inner membrane space of the mitochondrion — this establishes a proton gradient which is used to power the F0F1-ATP synthase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mitchell, 1961</xref>). When there is insufficient oxygen to accept electrons at Complex IV, or when inhibitors of Complex IV such as cyanide are present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Antonini et al., 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nicholls et al., 1972</xref>), almost all animals stop using the ETC and rely on anaerobic glycolysis to make ATP, generating lactate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Isom et al., 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Meyerhof, 1927</xref>). STHs, however, have evolved a different solution that allow them to survive months in the hypoxic host environment. Electrons still enter the ETC at Complex I, Complex I still pumps protons to generate the proton motive force (PMF), and ATP is still made by the F0F1ATPase, powered by the PMF. However, rather than the electrons passing through the ETC to oxygen as the terminal electron acceptor, they exit the ETC immediately downstream of Complex I onto a number of alternative terminal electron acceptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>) (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hochachka and Mustafa, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Müller et al., 2012</xref>). This transfer of the electrons out of the ETC and onto alternative electron acceptors requires the quinone-coupled dehydrogenases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kita, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ma et al., 1993</xref>). Under aerobic conditions these QDHs act as entry points to the ETC, transferring electrons from their substrates to UQ. Crucially, the reactions catalysed by these QDHs are reversed in anaerobic conditions — they now act as reductases transferring electrons out of the ETC and onto their products. For example, Complex II acts as a succinate dehydrogenase in aerobic conditions, generating fumarate; in anaerobic conditions, it reduces fumarate generating succinate as a terminal electron sink (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kmetec and Bueding, 1961</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sato et al., 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Saz and Vidrine, 1959</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Van Hellemond et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Takamiya et al., 1999</xref>). In this way, an entry of electrons into the ETC from a variety of electron donors in aerobic conditions is reversed to provide an exit from the ETC onto a variety of electron acceptors in anaerobic conditions.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.48165.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Anaerobic metabolism in helminths requires Rhodoquinone (RQ).</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Electron flow in the Electron Transport Chain (ETC) under aerobic conditions. Electrons enter the ETC either via Complex I or via a number of Quinone-coupled Dehydrogenases (QDH; cyan). These complexes transfer electrons to Ubiquinone (red circle ‘UQ’) which shuttles them to Complex III. They exit the ETC at Complex IV where they are transferred to oxygen as the terminal electron acceptor. Proton pumping is coupled to electron transport and is carried out by Complexes I, III and IV. Electron flow is shown in red and proton pumping in green. (<bold>b</bold>) Electron flow in the Electron Transport Chain (ETC) under anaerobic conditions. Electrons still enter the ETC at Complex I which transfers electrons to RQ (cyan circle ‘RQ’). RQ shuttles electrons to the QDHs which now operate as reductases, allowing electrons to exit the ETC and onto a diverse set of terminal electron acceptors. Complex I is the sole proton pump in this truncated ETC. (<bold>c</bold>) Schematic of Complex II activity under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Under aerobic conditions, Complex II acts as a succinate dehydrogenase, transferring electrons from succinate onto UQ. Under anaerobic conditions, Complex II operates in the reverse direction acting as a fumarate reductase, accepting electrons from RQ and transferring them to succinate as the terminal electron sink.

RQ and UQ are highly related molecules — the sole difference is the presence of an amine group on the quinone ring of RQ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). This changes the biophysical properties of the quinone ring: while UQ can accept electrons from the QDHs as they flow into the ETC under aerobic conditions, UQ cannot carry electrons of the correct electropotential to drive the reverse reactions in anaerobic conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fioravanti and Kim, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sato et al., 1972</xref>). RQ can carry such electrons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fioravanti and Kim, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sato et al., 1972</xref>), however, and the ability of STHs to drive their unusual anaerobic metabolism in their hosts is absolutely dependent on RQ. The single amine group that differs between UQ and RQ thus affects the health of over a billion humans.</p><p>RQ is found in very few animal species — only helminths, molluscs and annelids are known to make RQ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allen, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fioravanti and Kim, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sato and Ozawa, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Takamiya et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Van Hellemond et al., 1995</xref>). Since no host animals make RQ, inhibiting RQ synthesis or RQ use is a potentially powerful way to target parasites inside their host. Currently however little is known about RQ synthesis. The most mature studies have focused on the purple Proteobacterium <italic>R.rubrum</italic>, where RQ appears to derive from UQ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brajcich et al., 2010</xref>). RQ synthesis in <italic>R.rubrum</italic> requires the gene <italic>rquA</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lonjers et al., 2012</xref>) which is the first and thus far only gene known to be required for RQ synthesis in any organism. The role of <italic>rquA</italic> was initially unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lonjers et al., 2012</xref>), but very recently it has emerged that it is capable of converting UQ to RQ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bernert et al., 2019</xref>). In animals, the situation is even more blank: nothing is known about which genes are required for RQ synthesis, there are no clear <italic>rquA</italic> orthologues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lonjers et al., 2012</xref>), and there are no drugs that are known to prevent RQ synthesis. This is partly because no tractable animal model has been established in which to study RQ synthesis and use.</p><p>Previous studies have shown that <italic>C. elegans</italic>, a free-living helminth, can make RQ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Takamiya et al., 1999</xref>) and that when <italic>C. elegans</italic> is exposed to hypoxic conditions it undergoes major metabolic changes that resemble those that occur in STHs when they are in the hypoxic environment of their hosts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Butler et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Föll et al., 1999</xref>). This suggested to us that we could establish <italic>C. elegans</italic> as a model for dissecting the pathway of RQ synthesis and for screening for drugs that block RQ synthesis or use. We confirm that <italic>C. elegans</italic> makes RQ and also that it uses RQ-dependent metabolism when unable to use oxygen as a terminal electron acceptor. We show that in <italic>C. elegans</italic> RQ synthesis requires the activity of the kynurenine pathway. This pathway is key for the metabolism of tryptophan and generating metabolites that include 3-hydroxyanthranilate (3 HA). Our data suggest that 3 HA (or a highly related molecule generated by the kynurenine pathway) is the amine-containing precursor for RQ and that it is the source of the critical amine group on the quinone ring of RQ. Thus in helminths the amine group is present from the start of the RQ biosynthetic pathway and is not added as a late step to UQ as is the case in bacteria. We also show that <italic>C. elegans</italic> requires RQ to survive under conditions where oxygen cannot be used as an electron acceptor for the ETC. This allowed us to establish a high throughput screening assay to identify compounds that block RQ synthesis or RQ use. This is the first study to show how RQ, an electron carrier that affects the life of over a billion humans, is made in helminths. This will help towards the development of a new class of drugs to treat these major human pathogens.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>C. elegans</italic> makes RQ and switches to RQ-dependent metabolism when exposed to potassium cyanide</title><p><italic>C. elegans</italic> is a non-parasitic helminth that is easily genetically tractable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brenner, 1974</xref>; reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jones et al., 2005</xref>) and can be used for efficient drug screens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Burns et al., 2015</xref>).

Parasitic helminths use RQ-dependent metabolism under low oxygen conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rioux and Komuniecki, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Saz and Lescure, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tielens et al., 1992</xref>) and previous studies showed that <italic>C. elegans</italic> shows similar metabolic shifts when exposed to hypoxic conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Butler et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Föll et al., 1999</xref>; ). If possible, however, we wanted to avoid the use of hypoxic chambers. While hypoxia chambers are highly accurate ways of controlling oxygen levels, they are also very expensive and cumbersome for large-scale drug screens. We therefore turned to chemical methods of inducing a hypoxic state. Potassium Cyanide (KCN) is a potent inhibitor of Complex IV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Antonini et al., 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nicholls et al., 1972</xref>) — KCN inhibits oxygen binding to Complex IV and KCN treatment thus mimics the effect of hypoxia on the ETC. We tested whether treatment with KCN could drive <italic>C. elegans</italic> to use anaerobic metabolism that is similar to the RQ-dependent metabolism used by STHs in their hosts. The classic hallmark of RQ-dependent anaerobic metabolism in helminths is the generation of high levels of succinate through the reversal of Complex II (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Butler et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Saz and Lescure, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tielens et al., 1992</xref>). If <italic>C. elegans</italic> can indeed use the same anaerobic metabolism as parasitic helminths, there should be a build-up of succinate following KCN treatment. Furthermore, this should be dependent on Complex I activity, since Complex I is the sole source of electrons that are carried by RQ to drive the fumarate reductase activity of Complex II (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). We found that when <italic>C. elegans</italic> are exposed to KCN, they build up high levels of succinate as expected and that inhibiting Complex I with rotenone prevents succinate build-up (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). We thus find that <italic>C. elegans</italic> makes RQ and that treatment of <italic>C. elegans</italic> with KCN causes them to switch to a metabolic state that resembles that of STHs in their host. <italic>C. elegans</italic> is thus an excellent model in which to dissect RQ synthesis and to screen for compounds that alter RQ-dependent metabolism.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>In <italic>C. elegans,</italic> RQ is synthesised from products of the kynurenine pathway and not from ubiquinone</title><p>RQ and UQ are highly related molecules — the sole difference is the presence of an amine group on the quinone ring of RQ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). A critical question for RQ synthesis is where this amine group comes from and how it is generated. The best-defined current model for RQ synthesis comes from experiments in the proteobacterium <italic>R.rubrum</italic>. At least in this prokaryote, RQ is thought to be made by a late addition of the critical amine group to an existing molecule of UQ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brajcich et al., 2010</xref>). UQ is thus an obligate precursor of RQ and RQ synthesis requires initial synthesis of UQ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). While this may be the case for <italic>R.rubrum</italic>, this is not the case in <italic>F.hepatica</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Van Hellemond et al., 1996</xref>) or <italic>C. elegans</italic>. The <italic>clk-1(qm30)</italic> strain has a loss-of-function mutation in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> COQ7 orthologue that is required for hydroxylation of 5-demethoxyubiquinone to 5-hydroxyubiquinone, a late step in UQ synthesis — there is no detectable UQ in <italic>clk-1(qm30)</italic> homozygous animals. However, a previous study showed that there does appear to be RQ in this strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jonassen et al., 2001</xref>). If there is no UQ, but there is RQ, then RQ is not derived from UQ, at least in helminths. The two models for RQ synthesis thus differ fundamentally — in one UQ is an obligate precursor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brajcich et al., 2010</xref>), in the other it is not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jonassen et al., 2001</xref>). Since this is a fundamental result, we wanted to confirm this before trying to dissect the pathway of RQ synthesis. We thus extracted and analysed quinones from either wild-type worms or <italic>clk-1(qm30)</italic> homozygous animals. We find that while there is no detectable UQ in <italic>clk-1(qm30)</italic> mutants, there is abundant RQ and indeed we find that RQ levels are essentially unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). We thus confirm that UQ is not an obligate precursor for RQ in <italic>C. elegans</italic>.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.48165.006</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>RQ in <italic>C. elegans</italic> does not derive from UQ but from Tryptophan metabolites.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Schematic showing possible routes for RQ synthesis. Current models for RQ synthesis are shown schematically in the top pathway: PHB is prenylated by COQ-2 at the start of the UQ synthesis pathway and RQ either derives from UQ or from a UQ precursor — the amine group is thus added at a late step. The lower pathway shows our proposed pathway. Rather than use PHB as the substrate for COQ-2, RQ synthesis starts with prenylation of 3-hydroxyanthranilate by COQ-2.

While this could in principle be the case, it is unlikely because amination of an aromatic ring is highly thermodynamically unfavourable (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Downing et al., 1997</xref>). We therefore investigated an alternative possibility — that the critical amine group of RQ is not added in a late step of RQ synthesis but instead is present from the outset.</p><p>A key initial step in UQ synthesis is the addition by COQ-2 of a polyprenyl tail to a <italic>p-</italic>hydroxybenzoate ring (PHB — also often called 4-hydroxybenzoate (4-HB)) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Momose and Rudney, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Trumpower et al., 1974</xref>). PHB has no amine group — however, <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> COQ2 is known to be able to use a variety of similar compounds as substrates for prenylation such as para-aminobenzoic acid and vanillic acid (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pierrel, 2017</xref>). Given the potential substrate flexibility of COQ-2, we hypothesised that RQ synthesis might start not with PHB but with a related molecule that contains an amine group already on the ring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref> for schematic). In particular, we noted that yeast COQ2 is tolerant of substituents at positions 5 and 6 of the PHB structure (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pierrel, 2017</xref>) suggesting that this might be feasible enzymatically. We considered different candidate molecules as amine-containing ring structures that might act as precursors for RQ and focussed on anthranilate and 3-hydroxyanthranilate (3 HA) as likely sources of the amine-containing ring in RQ. Anthranilate and 3 HA are made from the amino acid tryptophan via the kynurenine pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Heidelberger and Gullberg, 1948</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kotake, 1936</xref>) and <italic>kynu-1</italic> encodes the <italic>C. elegans</italic> kynureninase that is required for the generation of anthranilate and 3 HA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Babu, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bhat and Babu, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">van der Goot et al., 2012</xref>). We examined the quinones present in <italic>kynu-1(e1003)</italic> mutants that lack kynureninase and while UQ levels are normal in the <italic>kynu-1(e1003)</italic> mutant animals, there is no detectable RQ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>). This suggests that the amine group on RQ derives from anthranilate or 3 HA, or some closely related product of kynureninase. To determine whether the key precursor is anthranilate, 3 HA, or both, we examined quinones in the <italic>afmd-1(tm4547)</italic> and <italic>kmo-1(tm4529)</italic> mutant strains. These contain loss-of-function mutations in either <italic>afmd-1,</italic> which encodes a kynurenine formamidase, or in <italic>kmo-1</italic> which encodes a kynurenine 3-monoxygenase. Based on current models for the kynurenine pathway, <italic>afmd-1(tm4547)</italic> strain cannot make either anthranilate or 3 HA whereas the <italic>kmo-1(tm4529)</italic> can generate anthranilate but not 3 HA. We find that both strains have reduced RQ levels compared with N2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>) suggesting that the key precursor is 3 HA. Although the reduction in RQ levels in these two mutants is less severe than in the <italic>kynu-1(e1003)</italic> strain, we note that while <italic>kynu-1</italic> encodes the sole kynureninase in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> genome, there are paralogues of both <italic>afmd-1</italic> and <italic>kmo-1</italic> (<italic>afmd-2</italic> and <italic>kmo-2</italic> respectively) which may be functionally redundant. Furthermore, several of these enzymes act on multiple related substrates, which may permit additional routes of 3 HA synthesis that are not shown. If 3 HA is indeed the key precursor for RQ, it should be a substrate for the polyprenyltransferase COQ-2 — COQ-2 prenylates PHB in the first step of UQ synthesis and our model suggests it should prenylate 3 HA as the first step in RQ synthesis. Consistent with this, we identify a m/z peak corresponding to the predicted mass of prenylated 3 HA (Supp <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), but find no equivalent peak for prenylated anthranilate (data not shown). Both the genetic data and mass spec data thus show that RQ synthesis requires the kynurenine pathway to generate 3 HA and that 3 HA is a substrate for COQ-2.</p><p>As an additional confirmation that the amine group on RQ ultimately derives from tryptophan we tested whether a tryptophan-derived aromatic amino group is being incorporated into RQ. We fed <italic>C. elegans</italic> 15N-labelled bacteria for three generations either in the presence or absence of 14N tryptophan. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>, the sole source of any 14N incorporated into RQ is the 14N tryptophan. As expected, the RQ detected in animals fed with 15N bacteria alone is approximately all 15N labelled (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>). However, if 14N tryptophan was added while worms are feeding on the 15N-labelled bacteria,~50% of the RQ observed was 14N RQ — the sole source for this 14N was the added tryptophan (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>). We note that if we add 14N 3 HA instead of 14N Trp we also detect significant 14N RQ, but see no 14N RQ if 14N anthranilate is added, further confirming that 3 HA is the key RQ precursor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>). Taken together, our data suggest that RQ does not derive from UQ, and that 3 HA is the source of the amine group on the quinone ring of RQ. We propose that the pathway of RQ and UQ synthesis are largely the same — the key difference is the presence or absence of the amine group on the initial aromatic ring substrate for COQ-2.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.48165.008</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>The critical amine group on RQ derives from Tryptophan.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Schematic of kynurenine pathway. 3-hydroxyanthranilate (3 HA) derive from Tryptophan via the kynurenine pathway and this requires KYNU-1 activity.

To test this, we used the compound wact-11 — this is a Complex II inhibitor that binds to the quinone-binding pocket of Complex II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Burns et al., 2015</xref>). wact-11 is highly related to the anthelmintic flutolanil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Burns et al., 2015</xref>) and is highly selective for helminth Complex II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Burns et al., 2015</xref>). Complex II is critical for RQ-dependent anaerobic metabolism where it acts as a RQ-dependent fumarate reductase — inhibitors of Complex II would thus be expected to prevent survival in KCN. When worms are treated with wact-11 alone, we see no impact on worm movement over the time course of our assay. However, when worms are treated with both wact-11 and KCN, they can no longer survive long-term KCN exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d</xref>) indicating that this assay can allow discovery of drugs that block RQ-dependent anaerobic metabolism. Our assay should thus allow efficient screens for drugs that inhibit RQ synthesis or RQ utilization in vivo in a helminth under conditions where they require RQ, the first time this has been possible. The assay is image-based and quantitative and can be extremely high throughput when using rapid imaging platforms like the Phenalysys Parallux 2 (used to make the movies of recovery in <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>) which can measure the effect of 96 drugs on worm movement in under 5s. We note that not all drugs that kill <italic>C. elegans</italic> when in the presence of KCN (i.e. that would be hits in this assay) will affect RQ synthesis or RQ use and secondary screens will be required to further stratify the hits. Nonetheless, inhibitors of RQ synthesis or use can be discovered using this assay and we anticipate that this will yield novel compounds that may be effective anthelmintics.</p><p>Finally, we took advantage of a set of mutant worm strains that are resistant to wact-11 treatment. Mutations that result in resistance to wact-11 treatment cluster in the quinone binding pocket of Complex II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Burns et al., 2015</xref>) and we reasoned that some of these might not only prevent the binding of wact-11 but might fortuitously also disrupt the binding of RQ and thus affect the ability of worms to survive extended exposure to KCN. We tested a number of point mutants that affect wact-11 sensitivity and found that most mutants appear similar to wild-type worms in their ability to survive long term KCN exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a</xref> and data not shown).

We note that this mutation sits right above the modelled binding site for the rhodoquinone ring, whereas a neighbouring mutation that sits two turns of an alpha-helix further away (C78Y) has no effect.

It is absolutely required for the anaerobic metabolism used by parasitic helminths to survive in the hypoxic environment of the host gut where they can thrive for many months. The single amine group that differs between RQ and UQ is crucial for this — it allows RQ to carry electrons of the right electropotential to drive quinone-coupled dehydrogenases (QDHs) in reverse, acting as reductases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fioravanti and Kim, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sato et al., 1972</xref>). In aerobic conditions, QDHs carry electrons from a diverse set of electron donors and transfer them onto UQ and hence into the ETC; under anaerobic conditions, RQ carries electrons to the QDHs which then reduce a diverse set of electron sinks, providing an exit point for electrons from the ETC. The single amine group on the quinone ring of RQ allows parasites to carry out this unusual anaerobic metabolism and thus it affects the lives of over a billion humans. Despite the importance of RQ for human health, its synthesis has been elusive and no anthelmintics have been identified that affect RQ synthesis. Here, we used <italic>C. elegans</italic> genetics to identify the source of the key amine group on RQ, and to establish a pipeline for screening for new compounds that alter the ability of worms to make and use RQ.</p><p>The critical question in RQ synthesis is where the amine group on the quinone ring comes from and how it is added. Previous studies from bacteria suggested that RQ synthesis uses UQ as a precursor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brajcich et al., 2010</xref>) and that the amine group is added at a late stage in RQ synthesis. At least in bacteria, this seems to be the case — in <italic>R.rubrum</italic>, the gene <italic>rquA</italic> that is required for RQ synthesis encodes a methyltransferase that is related to the quinone methyltransferases UbiG/COQ3 and UbiE/COQ5 that act in UQ synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lonjers et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Stairs et al., 2018</xref>). Very recently, RquA has been shown to be able to catalyse the conversion of UQ to RQ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Buceta et al., 2019</xref>)— in bacteria, RQ synthesis thus requires UQ synthesis and the key amine group is a late stage addition. Here, however, we show that the mechanism of RQ synthesis in <italic>C. elegans</italic> is different. In <italic>C. elegans</italic> (and likely in helminths in general) RQ synthesis does not require UQ as a precursor and, crucially, the critical amine group on the quinone ring of RQ is not added at a late stage in the synthesis of RQ but is present from the initial steps of RQ synthesis. We show that the amine group likely comes from 3-hydroxyanthranilate (3 HA), which is generated by degradation of tryptophan via the kynurenine pathway. We also demonstrate that RQ synthesis requires the kynurenine pathway. We note that during revision of the manuscript, a second group also found that RQ synthesis requires the kynurenine pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Buceta et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, for the first time since its discovery in the early 1960s, we now have a key insight into how RQ is made in helminths and this has several implications for the search for novel anthelmintics that might affect RQ synthesis.</p><p>First, we do not believe that there are completely separate dedicated pathways for UQ and for RQ synthesis in helminths. Instead, we suggest that UQ and RQ have a largely shared synthesis pathway. A key difference in RQ and UQ synthesis is the use of different initial substrates for the polyprenyltransferase COQ-2. If PHB is used, the product will be UQ; if 3 HA (or possibly a related product of tryptophan metabolism) is used, the product will be RQ. This ‘different precursor, shared pathway’ model for RQ and UQ synthesis stands in contrast to the pathways used by bacteria to synthesise two other quinones, UQ and menaquinone (MK). Facultative anaerobic bacteria including non-pathogenic <italic>E. coli</italic> as well as major human pathogens like <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> make two quinones: UQ which is used as an electron carrier under aerobic conditions, and menaquinone (MK) (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Meganathan and Kwon, 2009</xref>), which acts as a carrier under anaerobic conditions. The synthesis pathways of UQ and MK are completely distinct and the genes involved are distinct (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Meganathan and Kwon, 2009</xref>). This separation of MK and UQ synthesis pathways has allowed the development of a number of promising compounds that act as specific inhibitors of MK synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kurosu et al., 2007</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Debnath et al., 2012</xref>; reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boersch et al., 2018</xref>). We suggest that there may be no analogous inhibitors for ‘the RQ synthesis pathway’ in helminths since there does not appear to be a dedicated RQ pathway analogous to the dedicated MK synthesis pathway. This also raises intriguing questions of regulation of quinone content in helminths. While in bacteria the switch from UQ (aerobic) to MK (anaerobic) occurs through the use of two entirely separate biosynthetic pathways, in helminths the switch from UQ (aerobic) to RQ (anaerobic) must occur via the entry of different substrates into a largely shared pathway. We currently have little insight into how that switch occurs or how it is regulated.</p><p>Second, the pathway we identify for RQ synthesis suggests novel targets for anthelmintics. The finding that the kynurenine pathway is the source of the key precursors for RQ synthesis suggests naively that helminth-specific inhibitors of the kynurenine pathway might act as potent anthelmintics. However, the human gut is likely to be a source of anthranilate and 3 HA from host metabolism or from the microbiome and inhibiting production of these molecules in the helminth itself might thus prove ineffective. A more likely target is COQ-2, the enzyme that prenylates the amine-containing 3 HA ring as the first step in RQ synthesis. While host and parasite COQ-2 are orthologous enzymes, they have different substrate specificity: the host only makes UQ and not RQ, whereas the parasite COQ-2 must be able to use not only PHB for UQ synthesis but also amine-containing precursors like 3 HA for RQ synthesis. The ability of helminth COQ-2 to use amine-containing substrates efficiently thus opens up the possibility of helminth-specific COQ-2 inhibitors, a potential avenue for new anthelmintics. We believe that the in vivo assay we describe here may help identify such drugs.</p><p>Our study also raises key new questions. One of the most intriguing to us is why RQ synthesis is so rare amongst animals. To date, only three groups of animals are known to make RQ: molluscs, annelids, and helminths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allen, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fioravanti and Kim, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sato and Ozawa, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Takamiya et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Van Hellemond et al., 1995</xref>). If RQ synthesis and UQ synthesis largely share a common pathway, why doesn’t every animal that makes UQ also make RQ? One possibility is that while some of the pathway for UQ and RQ synthesis is shared, RQ synthesis requires additional components that might only be present in RQ-synthesising species. For example, we note that while the UQ precursor PHB has a hydroxyl group at the four position, the RQ precursor 3 HA does not and this must be added by some as yet unknown enzyme. The other possibility is that key enzymes in the UQ and RQ synthesis pathway may have altered specificity in species that make RQ to allow them to use substrates containing an amine group for RQ synthesis as well as non-aminated substrates for UQ synthesis. Careful phylogenetic analysis may identify subtle sequence changes that could allow helminth enzymes to use amine-containing RQ precursors. Such molecular signatures that mark out RQ-utilising species have been found in proteins that bind both UQ and RQ — for example there are helminth-specific residues that lie around the quinone binding site in Complex II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Burns et al., 2015</xref>). It is clear that there is no simple answer yet for the finding that RQ is made by so few animals but that this will likely emerge as more of the RQ synthesis pathway is uncovered.</p><p>Finally, we note that several steps in the kynurenine pathway and in the ubiquinone synthesis pathway are catalysed by either monooxygenases or dioxygenases that require oxygen. These include TDO-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hayaishi et al., 1957</xref>) and KMO-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Detmer and Massey, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Entsch et al., 1976</xref>) in the kynurenine pathway and COQ-6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ozeir et al., 2015</xref>) and CLK-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Marbois and Clarke, 1996</xref>) in the UQ synthesis pathway. RQ synthesis thus appears to require the availability of oxygen for these enzymes, an unexpected result since RQ is preferentially required in anaerobic conditions and is the predominant quinone in helminths living under anaerobic conditions. How might these oxygen-requiring steps be carried out for RQ synthesis? It is possible that the helminth enzymes have evolved so that they can still operate under low oxygen conditions. Other oxygen-using proteins have evolved extremely high oxygen affinity in helminths — for example <italic>Ascaris</italic> haem is octameric and binds oxygen with ~25,000 times greater affinity than human haem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Minning et al., 1999</xref>). Alternatively, these same enzymatic steps might be carried out by other enzymes in lower oxygen conditions. In <italic>E. coli</italic>, for example, in aerobic conditions UbiB and UbiF carry out the same hydroxylation modifications to the quinone ring as <italic>C. elegans</italic> COQ-6 and CLK-1 and mutation of either gene results in a lack of mature UQ in these bacteria (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Meganathan and Kwon, 2009</xref>). However, under anaerobic conditions, <italic>ubiB</italic> and <italic>ubiF</italic> mutants make normal levels of UQ suggesting that other enzymes carry out these reactions in low oxygen conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alexander and Young, 1978</xref>). It is possible that there is an analogous set of enzymes that are required for RQ synthesis in low oxygen conditions — these would carry out similar reactions to COQ-6 and CLK-1 but without the requirement for oxygen. If they exist, they remain to be discovered.</p><p>There is thus still much to be discovered about the regulation and the precise pathway of RQ synthesis in helminths. The results presented here provide a firm starting point and the assay we describe for drugs that affect RQ-dependent metabolism may lead to the discovery and development of a new class of anthelmintic drugs. Since resistance to known classes of anthelmintics is widespread among livestock parasites like <italic>H.contortus</italic>, <italic>C.oncophora</italic> and <italic>A.suum</italic> and is rising in human populations (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sangster et al., 2018</xref>), this will prove critical in the control and treatment of these major pathogens.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Worm strains and maintenance</title><p>In addition to the traditional laboratory strain N2, here we include work using strains <italic>clk-1(qm30), kynu-1(e1003), sdhc-1(tr357),</italic> and <italic>sdhc-1(tr423).</italic> The two <italic>sdhc-1</italic> strains were provided by Dr. Peter Roy and all other strains were provided by the <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> Genetics Centre or by the Mitani group of the National Bioresources Project.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Identification of the pathway of Rhodoquinone biosynthesis in <italic>C. elegans</italic>&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Gisela Storz as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: William F (Bill) Martin (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>In this manuscript, Del Borrello et al. investigate the biosynthesis of rhodoquinone (RQ) in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. RQ is an electron carrier very similar in structure to coenzyme Q (CoQ, aka ubiquinone (UQ)), but that is found in very few animals. The fact that it exists in parasitic helminths, which require RQ for survival under low oxygen tension, makes the RQ pathway a potential target for therapeutics; however, the pathway of RQ biosynthesis is largely unknown. The authors confirm that RQ is made in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, and that it does not rely on the activity of clk-1 (coq7), the enzyme that performs the penultimate step of CoQ biosynthesis. The main contribution of this paper is that the RQ synthesis in <italic>C. elegans</italic> requires the gene kynu-1, which encodes an enzyme in the kynurenine pathway, which produces anthranilate from tryptophan. Overall, this well-written manuscript adds a solid new piece to our understanding of RQ biosynthesis, and sets up the potential to target the RQ pathway therapeutically. The reviewers were enthusiastic about the importance of the work, but found some of the claims overstated based on the data provided. As outlined below, if additional data are provided and/or some of the claims toned down (or better supported), this work would be suitable for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The clearest and most important conclusion from this paper is that kynureninase can produce an RQ precursor from tryptophan (presumably 3-Hydroxyanthranilic acid (3-HA), although this is not shown). This single finding, while interesting and important, is the sole basis of the claim that they have &quot;identified the pathway of RQ biosynthesis&quot; – a major overstatement, as is the title of the paper. That is, there is much left to work out before one can claim that the RQ pathway is known: The work does not show that 3-HA is the direct precursor, that known upstream (TDO2, AMFD-1) or downstream (where does the 4-hydroxyl come from?) enzymes in the kynurenine pathway are required, that the known CoQ enzymes (e.g., Coq3, 5, 6) are used, or that DMQ couldn't also be a source of RQ (they eliminated this as a possibility just by stating that it would be thermodynamically unfavorable, even though Figure 4 suggests that other routes to RQ are possible). There is simply no need for the authors to overstate their findings. The impact of the paper would be strengthened if any of the persistent gaps above were addressed.</p><p>2) At a minimum, the authors should provide additional evidence to shore up the claim that anthraniliate-derived 3-HA is the precursor used by Coq2. For example, it is possible that the amine group derived from tryptophan via the kynurenine pathway is incorporated into the tyrosine-derived CoQ precursor, 4-hydroxybenzoate. It seems that the authors' model is right, but this can be tested by inhibition of Hfd1, the enzyme that generates the CoQ precursor 4-hydroxybenzoate (4-HB) (Stefely et al. Nat Biotech 2016, Payet et al. Cell Chem Bio 2016), and by showing evidence of polyprenyl-hydroxyanthranilate formation using their same HPLC assays.</p><p>3) The model the authors propose is that 3-HA can be used by Coq2 because of its tolerance of substitutions at the 5 and 6 positions of 4-HB, which is a reasonable claim. However, the kynurenine pathway exists in many animals that don't have RQ. Why would this likewise not result in RQ formation, if this is the differentiating point, as seems to be claimed? In other words, what is special about helminths (and molluscs) that allows them to make RQ? The authors discuss this point and suggest that it might be a set of quinone methyltransferases that are present in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, all parasitic helminths that they have checked (i.e., other nematodes), as well as in molluscs and annelids. Since they are discussing &quot;helminths&quot; in this paper, it would be reasonable for them also to include flatworms (including F. hepatic and S. mansoni, both of which have been reported to make and use RQ – see below) in this analysis. Because flatworms, annelids, and molluscs represent a different assemblage of invertebrates than do nematodes, it would be interesting to consider whether they have come up with the same or different solutions for making RQ. The authors should consider moving their description of these results and the figure in which they are presented to the Results section instead of the Discussion.</p><p>4) The authors claim that drugs that abolish nematode survival in KCN provide a simple assay for drugs that specifically affect RQ- dependent metabolism. This system can indeed find such drugs, but there are many RQ-independent ways to kill nematodes during KCN treatment, so it is not specific. The authors even give an example: &quot;wact-11&quot; is a complex II inhibitor that kills nematodes during KCN treatment without changing RQ levels. Although blocking complex II is related to RQ function, it is hard to see how such an approach would be a promising way to treat helminth infections in humans (which also rely on complex II). For the screening method to be effective, it would need to be more RQ dependent, less dependent on general mitochondria health. Again, the claim here is too strong.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.48165.016</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The clearest and most important conclusion from this paper is that kynureninase can produce an RQ precursor from tryptophan (presumably 3-Hydroxyanthranilic acid (3-HA), although this is not shown).

We have toned down the claims at multiple positions starting with the title. We think that what we have shown is that RQ synthesis requires the kynurenine pathway (and state that throughout as the main finding rather than ‘Identification of the pathway for RQ synthesis’ as before) and focus largely on the conclusion that the key amine group on RQ does not come as a late addition in a reaction using UQ as an obligate precursor, rather it derives from 3HA.</p><p>We now provide additional data for this – we measure the RQ levels in afmd-1 and kmo-1 mutant worms and find a strong reduction in both cases. We note that the effect is less profound than in the kynu-1 mutant animals where RQ is essentially undetectable but also that there are paralogues afmd-2 and kmo-2 which may be partially redundant. We hope that this strengthens our paper and show these results now in an extra panel of Figure 3 We confirm our finding with kynu-1(e1003) mutant worms with a second allele of kynu-1 and also provide videos showing that survival in KCN requires kynu-1. We hope that taken together the reviewers agree that this strengthens the paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) At a minimum, the authors should provide additional evidence to shore up the claim that anthraniliate-derived 3-HA is the precursor used by Coq2.

This would therefore be a lengthy analysis and unlikely to yield a satisfying answer. We do however now provide mass-spec evidence for polyprenyl 3HA formation (Figure 3—figure supplement 1) and note that we cannot find any polyprenyl anthranilate, which I believe strongly supports the claim that 3HA is the substrate for COQ-2 for RQ synthesis. Does this seem reasonable to you as support for the model, along with the addition afmd-1 and kmo-1 RQ level data?</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The model the authors propose is that 3-HA can be used by Coq2 because of its tolerance of substitutions at the 5 and 6 positions of 4-HB, which is a reasonable claim.

We anticipate following the evolutionary signature of RQ synthesis more in the future, so hope to expand on these initial findings at that point and hope that this refocusing satisfies the reviewers. We note that we still mention this albeit more briefly in the Discussion section:</p><p>“One possibility is that while some of the pathway for UQ and RQ synthesis is shared, RQ synthesis requires additional components that might only be present in RQ-synthesising species. […] The other possibility is that key enzymes in the UQ and RQ synthesis pathway may have altered specificity in species that make RQ to allow them to use substrates containing an amine group for RQ synthesis as well as non-aminated substrates for UQ synthesis.”</p><p>We also do not claim any solution to this question and now state more clearly “It is clear that there is no simple answer yet for the finding that RQ is made by so few animals but that this will likely emerge as more of the RQ synthesis pathway is uncovered.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors claim that drugs that abolish nematode survival in KCN provide a simple assay for drugs that specifically affect RQ- dependent metabolism.

Again, the claim here is too strong.</p></disp-quote><p>I am not sure we fully agree with this. We claim that our assay allows us “to screen efficiently for drugs that affect RQ synthesis or RQ-dependent metabolism” and that our assay reports RQ-utilization. We do not claim that every drug that comes back from such a primary screen will do that – of course there will be other ways to kill worms that have been treated with KCN and this drug screen like all others will need secondary assays. Nonetheless drugs that affect RQ synthesis or that specifically block RQ docking to the quinone binding pockets of quinone-coupled dehydrogenases should work as anthelmintics and should emerge as hits from our screen. To support this we give the example of wact-11. The reviewers’ state that “Although blocking complex II is related to RQ function, it is hard to see how such an approach would be a promising way to treat helminth infections in humans (which also rely on complex II)” but seem to have missed that flutolanil (the example we choose) is exactly that – an anthelmintic that is a Complex II inhibitor.(“wact-11 is highly related to the anthelmintic flutolanil (Burns et al., 2015) and is highly selective for helminth Complex II (Burns et al., 2015). Complex II is critical for RQ-dependent anaerobic metabolism where it acts as a fumarate reductase inhibitors of Complex II might thus alter survival in KCN.”) It works because Complex II in helminths has diverged from human Complex II – many of the residues surrounding the quinone binding site in helminth Complex II are helminth-specific and this is thought to be due to the requirement for binding of both UQ and RQ to helminth Complex II whereas human Complex II only has to dock UQ. Why does flutolanil (or wact-11) kill <italic>C. elegans</italic> in the presence of KCN? It isn’t because of a general effect on ‘mitochondrial health’ (at least it has no phenotype in our assay conditions) but likely because it blocks the docking of RQ to Complex II and thus blocks the ability of Complex II to accept electrons from RQ and act as a fumarate reductase.</p><p>We now add a caveat: “We note that not all drugs that kill <italic>C. elegans</italic> when in the presence of KCN (i.e. that would be hits in our assay) will affect RQ synthesis or RQ use and secondary screens will be required to further stratify the hits. Nonetheless, inhibitors of RQ synthesis or use can be discovered using this assay and we anticipate that this will yield novel compounds that may be effective anthelmintics.” We hope this satisfies the reviewers.</p></body></sub-article></article>
