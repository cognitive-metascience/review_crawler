part, by arterial smooth muscle cells (myocytes). Several Transient Receptor Potential (TRP) channels are proposed to be expressed in arterial myocytes, but it is unclear if these proteins control physiological blood pressure and contribute to hypertension in vivo. We generated the first inducible, smooth muscle-specific knockout mice for a TRP channel, namely for PKD2 (TRPP1), to investigate arterial myocyte and blood pressure regulation by this protein. Using this model, we show that intravascular pressure and α<sub>1</sub>-adrenoceptors activate PKD2 channels in arterial myocytes of different systemic organs. PKD2 channel activation in arterial myocytes leads to an inward Na<sup>+</sup> current, membrane depolarization and vasoconstriction. Inducible, smooth muscle cell-specific PKD2 knockout lowers both physiological blood pressure and hypertension and prevents pathological arterial remodeling during hypertension. Thus, arterial myocyte PKD2 controls systemic blood pressure and targeting this TRP channel reduces high blood pressure.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>PKD2</kwd><kwd>blood pressure</kwd><kwd>hypertension</kwd><kwd>smooth muscle</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000968</institution-id><institution>American Heart Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>16SDG27460007</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bulley</surname><given-names>Simon</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000968</institution-id><institution>American Heart Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>16POST30960010</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hasan</surname><given-names>Raquibul</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000968</institution-id><institution>American Heart Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>15SDG22680019</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Leo</surname><given-names>M Dennis</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HL67061</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jaggar</surname><given-names>Jonathan H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HL133256</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jaggar</surname><given-names>Jonathan H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HL137745</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jaggar</surname><given-names>Jonathan H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Arterial myocyte PKD2 channels are activated by vasoconstrictor stimuli, which increases blood pressure, are upregulated during hypertension and cell-specific knockout in vivo reduces both physiological blood pressure and hypertension.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Systemic blood pressure is controlled by total peripheral resistance, which is determined by the diameter of small arteries and arterioles. Arterial smooth muscle cell (myocyte) contraction reduces luminal diameter, leading to an increase in systemic blood pressure, whereas relaxation results in vasodilation that decreases blood pressure. Membrane potential is a primary determinant of arterial contractility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Nelson et al., 1990</xref>). Depolarization activates myocyte voltage-dependent calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) channels (Ca<sub>V</sub>), leading to an increase in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> and vasoconstriction. In contrast, hyperpolarization reduces [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>, resulting in vasodilation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Nelson et al., 1990</xref>). In vitro studies have identified several different types of ion channel that regulate the membrane potential and contractility of arterial myocytes, but whether many of these ion channels regulate systemic blood pressure is unclear. Given that hypertension is associated with altered arterial contractility, myocyte ion channels that contribute to high blood pressure are also important to determine.</p><p>Transient Receptor Potential (TRP) channels constitute a family of ~28 proteins that are subdivided into six different classes, including polycystin (TRPP), canonical (TRPC), vanilloid (TRPV), ankyrin (TRPA), and melastatin (TRPM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Earley and Brayden, 2015</xref>). Experiments performed using cultured and non-cultured cells and whole arteries, which contain multiple different cell types, have suggested that approximately thirteen different TRP channels may be expressed in arterial myocytes, including PKD2 (also termed TRPP1), TRPC1, TRPC3-6, TRPV1-4, TRPA1, TRPM4 and TRPM8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Earley and Brayden, 2015</xref>). In many of these studies, TRP channel expression was reported in myocytes of vasculature that does not control systemic blood pressure, including conduit vessels, cerebral arteries, portal vein and pulmonary arteries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Earley and Brayden, 2015</xref>). Blood pressure measurements in constitutive, global TRPC6, TRPM4 and TRPV4 channel knockout mice produced inconsistent results or generated complex findings that were associated with compensatory mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Mathar et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dietrich et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Nishijima et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Earley et al., 2009</xref>). Thus, the contribution of arterial myocyte TRP channels to physiological systemic blood pressure and pathological changes in blood pressure are unclear. Also uncertain is whether TRP channel subtypes present in arterial myocytes of different organs are similarly regulated by physiological stimuli and if such modulation leads to the same functional outcome.</p><p>PKD2 is a six transmembrane domain protein with cytoplasmic N and C termini (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Shen et al., 2016</xref>). PKD2 is expressed in myocytes of rat and human cerebral arteries, mouse and human mesenteric arteries and in porcine whole aorta (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Griffin et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Torres et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Narayanan et al., 2013</xref>). RNAi-mediated knockdown of PKD2 inhibited pressure-induced vasoconstriction (myogenic tone) in cerebral arteries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Narayanan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Sharif-Naeini et al., 2009</xref>). In global, constitutive PKD2<sup>+/-</sup> mice, an increase in actin and myosin expression lead to larger phenylephrine-induced contractions in aorta and mesenteric arteries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Qian et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Du et al., 2010</xref>). It has also been proposed that arterial myocyte PKD2 channels inhibit myogenic tone in mesenteric arteries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Sharif-Naeini et al., 2009</xref>). Thus, in vitro studies have generated variable findings regarding physiological functions of arterial myocyte PKD2 channels.</p><p>Here, we generated an inducible, myocyte-specific PKD2 knockout mouse to investigate blood pressure regulation by this TRP channel. We show that inducible and cell-specific PKD2 channel knockout in myocytes reduces systemic blood pressure. We demonstrate that intravascular pressure and α<sub>1</sub>-adrenoceptor activation activate myocyte PKD2 channels in systemic arteries of different tissues, leading to an inward sodium current (I<sub>Na</sub>), membrane depolarization and vasoconstriction. We also show that PKD2 channels are upregulated during hypertension and that myocyte PKD2 knockout causes vasodilation, attenuates remodeling of the arterial wall and reduces high blood pressure during hypertension. In summary, our study indicates that PKD2 channels in systemic artery myocytes control physiological blood pressure and are upregulated during hypertension, contributing to the blood pressure elevation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Generation of tamoxifen-inducible smooth muscle-specific PKD2 knockout mice</title><p>Mice with <italic>loxP</italic> sites flanking exons 11 and 13 (<italic>Pkd2<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic>) of the <italic>Pkd2</italic> gene were crossed with tamoxifen-inducible <italic>Myh11-cre/ERT2</italic> mice, producing a <italic>Pkd2<sup>fl/fl</sup>:Myh11-cre/ERT2</italic> line.

Here, we generated an inducible, smooth muscle-specific knockout of a TRP channel, PKD2, to investigate blood pressure regulation by this protein. We show that tamoxifen-induced, smooth muscle-specific PKD2 knockout dilates resistance-size systemic arteries and reduces blood pressure. Data indicate that heterogeneous vasoconstrictor stimuli activate PKD2 channels in arterial myocytes of different tissues. PKD2 channel activation leads to a I<sub>Na</sub> in myocytes, which induces membrane depolarization and vasoconstriction. Furthermore, we show that hypertension is associated with an increase in plasma membrane-resident PKD2 channels. PKD2 channel knockout in myocytes of hypertensive mice caused vasodilation, prevented arterial remodeling and lowered systemic blood pressure. In summary, using an inducible, conditional knockout model we show that arterial myocyte PKD2 channels increase physiological systemic blood pressure. We also show that arterial myocyte PKD2 channels are upregulated during hypertension and genetic knockout reduces high blood pressure.</p><p>The regulation of blood pressure by arterial myocyte TRP proteins and involvement in hypertension are poorly understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Earley and Brayden, 2015</xref>). This lack of knowledge is due to several primary factors. First, it is unclear which TRP channel family members are expressed and functional in myocytes of resistance-size systemic arteries that control blood pressure. The identification of a TRP channel in blood vessels that do not regulate systemic blood pressure, such as aorta and cerebral arteries, does not necessarily indicate that the same protein is present in arteries that do control blood pressure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Earley and Brayden, 2015</xref>). Second, TRP channel expression has often been reported in myocytes that had undergone cell culture or in whole vasculature that contains many different cell types. These studies create uncertainty as to which TRP proteins are present specifically in contractile myocytes of resistance-size systemic arteries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Earley and Brayden, 2015</xref>). Third, the lack of specific modulators of individual TRP channel subfamily members has significantly hampered studies aimed at identifying in vitro and in vivo functions of these proteins. Fourth, TRP channels are expressed in many different cell types other than arterial myocytes. Blood pressure measurements in global, non-inducible TRP knockout mice generated contrasting results to those anticipated. Myocyte TRPM4 channel activation leads to vasoconstriction in isolated cerebral arteries, but global, constitutive knockout of TRPM4 elevated blood pressure in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Mathar et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Earley et al., 2004</xref>). Arterial myocyte TRPC6 channel activation contributes to myogenic tone in cerebral arteries, but global, constitutive TRPC6 knockout caused vasoconstriction and elevated blood pressure in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dietrich et al., 2005</xref>). TRPV4 channel activation in arterial myocytes leads to vasodilation in isolated vessels, but blood pressure in TRPV4<sup>-/-</sup> mice was the same or lower than controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Nishijima et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Earley et al., 2009</xref>). Alternative approaches, such as the inducible, cell-specific knockout model developed here, are valuable to advance knowledge of blood pressure regulation by arterial myocyte TRP channels.</p><p>Previous studies performed in vitro that investigated vasoregulation by PKD2 channels produced a variety of different findings. RNAi-mediated knockdown of PKD2 inhibited swelling-activated non-selective cation currents (I<sub>Cat</sub>) in rat cerebral artery myocytes and reduced myogenic tone in pressurized cerebral arteries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Narayanan et al., 2013</xref>). In contrast, PKD2 siRNA did not alter myogenic tone in mesenteric arteries of wild-type mice, but increased both stretch-activated cation currents and myogenic vasoconstriction in arteries of constitutive, myocyte PKD1 knockout mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Sharif-Naeini et al., 2009</xref>). From these results, the authors suggested that myocyte PKD2 channels inhibit mesenteric vasoconstriction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Sharif-Naeini et al., 2009</xref>). Global knockout of PKD2 is embryonic-lethal in mice due to cardiovascular and renal defects, prohibiting study of the loss of protein in all tissues on vascular function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wu et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boulter et al., 2001</xref>). In global PKD2<sup>+/-</sup> mice, an increase in actin and myosin expression lead to larger phenylephrine-induced contraction in aorta and mesenteric arteries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Qian et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Du et al., 2010</xref>). Here, using an inducible cell-specific knockout model, we show that swelling, a mechanical stimulus, activates PKD2 currents in myocytes of skeletal muscle arteries, whereas phenylephrine activates PKD2 currents in myocytes of mesenteric arteries. Regardless of the stimulus involved, PKD2 activation leads to a Na<sup>+</sup> current, membrane depolarization and vasoconstriction in both artery types. PKD2 appears to be the second TRP protein to have been described in in arterial myocytes of skeletal muscle arteries, TRPV1 being the other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kark et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Few studies have measured plasma membrane currents through either recombinant PKD2 channels or PKD2 channels expressed in native cell types. PKD2 channels have been observed at the cell surface, with evidence suggesting that PKD1 is required for PKD2 translocation, although the ability of PKD1 to perform this function has been questioned (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Shen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hanaoka et al., 2000</xref>). Here, using arterial biotinylation we show that ~85% of PKD2 protein is located in the plasma membrane in both mesenteric and hindlimb arteries, consistent with our previous data in cerebral arteries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Narayanan et al., 2013</xref>). PKD2 ion permeability has also been a matter of debate. Recombinant PKD2 was initially shown to both conduct Ca<sup>2+</sup> and to be inhibited by Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hanaoka et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cai et al., 2004</xref>). To increase surface-trafficking of recombinant PKD2, a recent study generated a chimera by replacing the pore of PKD2-L1, a related channel that readily traffics to the plasma membrane, with the PKD2 channel pore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Shen et al., 2016</xref>). This channel, which contained the PKD2 channel filter, generated outwardly-rectifying whole cell currents and was more selective for Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> than Ca<sup>2+</sup>, with Ca<sup>2+</sup> only able to permeate in an inward direction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Shen et al., 2016</xref>). We also show that PKD2 channels in hindlimb and mesenteric artery myocytes are outwardly rectifying and permeant to Na<sup>+</sup>. At physiological arterial potentials of ~−60 to −40 mV, PKD2 channel opening would produce an inward Na<sup>+</sup> current, leading to myocyte membrane depolarization and voltage-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> (Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2) channel activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jaggar et al., 2000</xref>). The ensuing increase in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration would stimulate vasoconstriction and an elevation in blood pressure, as observed here. PKD2 channel knockout abolishes the stimulus-induced inward Na<sup>+</sup> current, attenuating depolarization and vasoconstriction.</p><p>The splanchnic and skeletal muscle circulations account for up to 35 and 80 (during physical exertion) % of cardiac output, respectively. Changes in arterial contractility within these organs leads to significant modification of total peripheral resistance and systemic blood pressure. We demonstrate that myocyte PKD2 channels regulate contractility in both of these physiologically important circulations. Our data also show that distinct mechanical and chemical stimuli activate PKD2 channels in these arteries to produce vasoconstriction. Intravasulcar pressure stimulates vasoconstriction in resistance-size arteries from a wide variety of tissues. Mice lacking α<sub>1</sub>-adrenergic receptors are hypotensive and have reduced vasoconstrictor responses to phenylephrine in mesenteric arteries, highlighting the relevance of this pathway to blood pressure regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Tanoue et al., 2002</xref>). α<sub>1</sub>-adrenergic receptor activation is reported to stimulate vasoconstriction through the release of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores and the activation of voltage-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels and non-selective cation channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Utz et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Inoue and Kuriyama, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Eckert et al., 2000</xref>). We show that intravascular pressure stimulates PKD2 channels in myocytes of hindlimb arteries, whereas phenylephrine activates PKD2 channels in mesenteric artery myocytes. Stimulus-induced PKD2 channel activation in these arteries leads to vasoconstriction. Surprisingly, we found that myocyte PKD2 channels do not contribute to the myogenic response in mesenteric arteries or to phenylephrine-induced vasoconstriction in hindlimb arteries. Angiotensin II-induced vasoconstriction did not require myocyte PKD2 channels in either hindlimb or mesenteric arteries. These data indicate that stimuli which activate myocyte PKD2 channels are vascular bed-specific, strengthening the concept that the regulation and function of a protein is not homogeneous in the circulation and findings in myocytes of one arterial bed should not simply be translated to other vasculature.</p><p>Arteries of diverse organs are exposed to unique environments, including the range of intravascular pressures and the types and concentrations of vasoconstrictor and vasodilator stimuli that regulate contractility. Thus, it would be surprising if the molecular components of intracellular signaling pathways were identical in arterial myocytes of different organs. It was outside of the central aim of this study and beyond scope to determine the differential mechanisms by which pressure and adrenergic receptors activate PKD2 channels in arteries of different organs. Several possibilities exist. Pressure-induced vasoconstriction was described over 100 years ago and yet the mechanosensor, intracellular signal transduction pathways and the ion channels that produce this physiological response are still unresolved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bayliss, 1902</xref>). Candidates for the pressure mechanosensor include, one or more proteins that have been proposed in smooth muscle or non-smooth muscle cell types, proteins that have not yet been discovered, elements of the cytoskeleton, or ion channels that act alone, in series or in parallel with other proteins and may be homomultimeric or heteromultimeric proteins. Piezo1, angiotensin II type one receptors and GPR68 have been proposed to act as vascular mechanosensors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Li et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Xu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Schleifenbaum et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Blodow et al., 2014</xref>). Importantly, we show here that there is not a singular, homogeneous mechanism that mediates the myogenic response in all artery types, adding additional complexity to this question. It is possible that intravascular pressure mechanosensors are different in hindlimb and mesenteric artery myocytes. If this is the case, the mechanosensor protein(s) present in hindlimb artery myocytes activates PKD2 channels, whereas the mechanosensor(s) in mesenteric artery myocytes does not stimulate PKD2 and vice versa. The intracellular signaling pathways by which pressure and α<sub>1</sub>-adrenergic receptors activate PKD2 channels may also not be the same or may couple differently in myocytes of each artery type. Intracellular pathways that transduce the pressure signal to activate ion channels are not resolved, although G<sub>q11</sub>-coupled phospholipase C (PLC) activation is one candidate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kauffenstein et al., 2012</xref>). α<sub>1</sub>-adrenergic receptors also activate G<sub>q/11</sub>. Thus, if pressure and α<sub>1</sub>-adrenergic receptors both stimulate G<sub>q11</sub>, local or global proximity signaling to PKD2 channels may underlie differential signaling in each artery type. When considering the molecular identity of the channels that are involved, PKD2 can form both homotetramers and heteromultimers with other channels, including TRPC1 and TRPV4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hanaoka et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Köttgen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Zhang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bai et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">González-Perrett et al., 2001</xref>). Whether PKD2 forms homomers or heteromers with other TRP channels in arterial myocytes is unclear, but differential PKD2 channel tetramerization may also underlie the distinct activation of these proteins by pressure and α<sub>1</sub>-adrenergic receptors in hindlimb and mesenteric arteries. Other channels, including TRPC6, TRPM4 and ANO1 contribute to the myogenic tone in cerebral arteries, but their relationship to PKD2-mediated responses in mesenteric and hindlimb arteries is unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Welsh et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Earley et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bulley et al., 2012</xref>). Conceivably, other ion channels may signal in series to PKD2, with the proteins involved and the sequence of events differing in mesenteric and hindlimb artery myocytes. Given the large number of unresolved signaling elements and the possible permutations that would require study, it was beyond scope to determine the differential mechanisms by which pressure and adrenergic receptors activate PKD2 channels in arteries of different organs. Future studies should investigate these possibilities.</p><p>Having established that myocyte PKD2 channels regulate arterial contractility and systemic blood pressure, we investigated whether hypertension is associated with an alteration in PKD2 expression, surface protein and function. Total and surface PKD2 protein were both higher in mesenteric and hindlimb arteries of hypertensive mice than in normotensive controls, indicating upregulation. PKD2 protein was primarily located in the plasma membrane in arteries of normotensive and hypertensive mice demonstrating that the distribution of channels was unchanged. These data indicate that hypertension is associated with an increase in the amount of PKD2 protein, which traffics to the plasma membrane, thereby increasing surface channel number. Myocyte-specific PKD2 knockout reduced both phenylephrine-induced vasoconstriction and systemic blood pressure and prevented an increase in wall-to-lumen thickness in hypertensive mice. The angiotensin II-induced elevation in blood pressure was smaller in <italic>Pkd2</italic> smKO mice than in <italic>Pkd2<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> controls, supporting the concept that a higher abundance of surface PKD channels in arterial myocytes was associated with vasoconstriction. Our data demonstrate that myocyte PKD2 channels are upregulated during hypertension and that PKD2 targeting reduces vasoconstriction, blood pressure and arterial remodeling during hypertension, eliciting multi-modal benefits.</p><p>When considering our findings, a discussion of human diseases that are known to be associated with PKD2 is warranted. Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD) is the most prevalent monogenic human disease worldwide, affecting 1 in 1000 people. ADPKD occurs due to mutations in either PKD1 or PKD2 proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Torres et al., 2007</xref>). Currently, more than 275 human variants in PKD2 have been identified (Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease Mutation Database, Mayo Clinic; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pkdb.pkdcure.org">http://pkdb.pkdcure.org</ext-link>). ADPKD is characterized by the appearance of renal cysts, although a significant proportion of patients with apparently normal renal function develop hypertension prior to the development of cysts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Torres et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Valero et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Martinez-Vea et al., 2004</xref>). Here, we show that myocyte PKD2 knockout reduced systemic blood pressure, which is in apparent contrast to the blood pressure increase observed in ADPKD patients. There are several explanations for these differential findings. First, the effects of complete PKD2 abrogation, such as in the knockout studied here, and that of a PKD2 mutation found in an ADPKD patient, on arterial myocyte function may differ. Second, a global PKD2 mutation in an ADPKD patient will alter the function of all cell types in which PKD2 is expressed. Such widespread changes in the physiology of many different cell types could alter arterial myocyte contractility and blood pressure through a variety of mechanisms, leading to net vasoconstriction even if myocyte PKD2 function is also compromised. Third, in ADPKD patients PKD2 mutation is constitutive, whereas here we studied the effects of PKD2 knockout over a three week period in fully developed adult mice. A constitutive PKD2 mutation may modify vascular development and may have chronic effects on myocyte signaling that would not occur in our study. Fourth, the loss of PKD2 function in arterial myocytes of ADPKD patients may attenuate the blood pressure elevation that occurs due to the loss of PKD2 function in other cell types. Future studies should be designed to investigate the effects of PKD2 mutations that occur in ADPKD patients on vascular myocyte function and systemic blood pressure. Our demonstration that myocyte PKD2 channels regulate blood pressure is a step forward to better understanding the significance of this myocyte ion channel in cardiovascular physiology and disease.</p><p>In summary, we show that arterial myocyte PKD2 channels are activated by distinct stimuli in arteries of different tissues, increase systemic blood pressure, are upregulated during hypertension and genetic knockout in vivo leads to vasodilation and a reduction in both physiological and high blood pressure.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain <break/>background <break/>(<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Pkd2<sup>fl/fl</sup></td><td valign="top">John Hopkins <break/>PKD Core</td><td valign="top">PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20862291">20862291</ext-link></td><td valign="top">Mice with <italic>Pkd2</italic> gene flanked <break/>by loxP regions</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain <break/>background <break/>(<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>SMMHC-CreER<sup>T2</sup>Myh11-cre/ERT2</italic></td><td valign="top">Jackson Laboratories <break/></td><td valign="top">Stock # 019079 <break/>PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18084302">18084302</ext-link></td><td valign="top">Mice with tamoxifen-inducible <break/>Cre recombinase that is <break/>expressed under the <break/>smooth muscle myosin <break/>heavy polipeptide 11 <break/>(<italic>Myh11</italic>) promoter.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain <break/>background <break/>(<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Pkd2<sup>fl/fl</sup>:smCre<sup>+</sup></td><td valign="top">This paper</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Mouse line created in-house <break/>by mating Pkd2<sup>fl/fl</sup> with <break/>SMMHC-CreER<sup>T2</sup>.

Your article has been reviewed by three reviewers and the evaluation has been overseen by Kenton Swartz as the Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Alexander Chesler (Reviewer #1).</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Although all three reviewers were somewhat divergent in their overall enthusiasm for your work, after discussion the consensus was that the characterization of the PKD2 channel in the various cell types examined was incomplete and would require considerable additional experiments to provide compelling support for the core conclusions. In particular, all three reviewers felt that more experiments would be required to better explain the different results obtained in mesenteric and hind limb smooth muscle.<italic>eLife</italic> We would be willing to consider a new manuscript if you decide to undertake the suggested experiments and the results help to resolve the issues raised by the reviewers.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>The manuscript by Bulley and colleagues addresses the molecular mechanisms by systemic blood pressure is regulated. Specifically, they look at the role of the TRP channel PKD2 by examining mice where the channel is knocked out selectively from smooth muscle cells in adults.</p><p>As they correctly point out, there is much contradictory data about how pressure is sensed by cells in vasculature and the function of TRP channels. Here they chose to focus on PKD2 since previous studies established that it is expressed in myocytes, has been previously proposed to be a mechanosensor, and perturbing its function negatively affects myogenic tone.</p><p>Overall this is very straight solid and systematic study from a lab with a track record of probing the physiology of the vascular system. They make a convincing case that PKD2 is important for regulating blood pressure. As such, I have relatively minor comments:</p><p>1) The word &quot;control&quot; in the Title is far too strong an interpretation of their findings. While I agree that they help clarify PKD2's importance, the effects, although significant, highlight there clearly exist other equally important factors/mechanisms.</p><p>2) They place too much emphasis/value on the generation of mouse cross and the interpretation of their findings. While they are correct using an inducible strategy is a useful, and probably necessary approach, it is also fairly standard these days. Words like first and novel are not really appropriate and are distracting. Genotyping information does not require a figure and a fair amount of the descriptions should go into the Materials and methods section.</p><p>3) The most confusing part of the study is the differential effects of PKD2 deletion on hindlimb as compared to mesenteric arteries. This needs to be discussed and explained in greater detail.</p><p>4) How is PKD2 seemingly sensing pressure in one cell but not the other? Osmolarity is a poor proxy for pressure. Recordings using direct mechanical stimulation (Piezo-driven glass probes and/or pressure clamp recordings) should be done for both myocyte types.</p><p>5) Along this same line, are the same types of adrenergic receptors expressed in both types of myocytes? How do they explain the differential effects of PKD2 deletion on phenylephrine responses?</p><p>6) Furthermore, given they see differential effects between myocyte, where else is the SMMHC-CreERT2 expressed? Is Tamoxifen treatment equally efficient for knocking out PKD2 in all places?</p><p>7) It has become standard to show the individual data points for each bar graph so the reader can more fully appreciate the sample size, distribution and effect sizes.</p><p>8) Although they discuss TRP channels, they should also consider the roles of Piezo1 and Piezo2. Are these expressed in myocytes? Are they dysregulated after PKD2 deletion?</p><p>9) Similarly, GPCRs such as the angiotensin receptor and (very recently) GPR68 have been implicated in mechanosensing. Are these found in myocytes? Could PKD2 be functioning downstream? Some more discussion of what they think PKD2 is doing would be helpful.</p><p>10) The summary bar graphs as provided are insufficient to evaluate the sample size, distribution and effect sizes.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>This descriptive manuscript examines impact of smooth muscle-specific, genetic attenuation of the PKD2 gene- which encodes for the polcystin-2 ion channel- in the vascular system. Prior knowledge was limited to indiscriminate knockout of the gene in mouse models and generally focused on the renal system, where variants in PKD2 are associated with kidney cyst formation in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). The authors use invitro and in vivo techniques to explore the mechanism of this TRP channel's putative regulation of vascular tone in response to osmotic stretch and adrenergic stimuli. Using their mouse model, among other observations they observe that conditional PKD2 knock out animals are hypotensive but they also observe seemingly conflicting results regarding how the Polycystin-2 ion channel causes this phenotype. Although not stated, there appears to be no difference in the Polycystin-2 channels constitutive activity, but the channel activity is revealed using two different stimuli that is location dependent. On one hand, PKD2/polycystin-2 in the appears to be an osmosensitive cation channel in the hindlimb artery. On the other hand, the same channel is not osmosensitive but is activated by adrenergic stimuli in the mesenteric artery. But it's difficult to see how this basic TRP gating mechanism is lost from one location to the next, and together with the incomplete electrophysiology analysis, makes me wonder if the currents they attribute to PKD2 are the same channel in both places? Thus, the conclusions need to be strengthened with the following experiments.</p><p>1) Determine if a PKD2-dependent single channel conductance can be measured from the plasma membrane and compare them from the mesenteric and hindlimb smooth muscle cells.</p><p>2) Determine if the putative PKD2 currents are cation-selective from the mesenteric and hindlimb smooth muscle. The authors used symmetric NaCl or NaAsp solutions and conclude that this channel is Na-permeable or is &quot;cation-selective&quot; without demonstrating this, as either anion can permeate chloride channels in smooth muscle (PMID: 10087337). This is particularly important for the osmo-regulation experiments, as the 300-250mOs condition invariably causes an increasing in the ohmic leak currents and likely activates resident swell-activated Cl<sup>-</sup> channels.</p><p>3) The reversal potentials and voltage-dependence are variable between the electrophysiology recordings that report the putative PKD2 channel activity. Thus, uniform steady state analysis of the current should be per An example of this is Figure 4 —figure supplement 1and Figure 6—figure supplement 1. In Figure 6—figure supplement 1the reversal potential shifts from approximately -10 mV to +10 mV between the knockout and control currents (respectively), but it is zero millivolts experiments under the same conditions. Perhaps there are differences in the relative ion permeability of these cell membranes, that is variable from cell to cell, but cannot be considered a pure PKD2 current.</p><p>Whether hypertension in ADPKD is a primary vasculopathy secondary to mutations in the polycystin genes or perhaps, secondary to activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system by cyst expansion and intrarenal ischemia is unclear and thus is an intriguing question. However, it is important to point out that hypertension, not hypotension (as observed in their mouse) is associated with ADPKD in man. Thus, while the findings are descriptive of PKD2 regulation of vascular tone, it does little to enhance our understanding the disease complications associated with this channel.</p><p>The results from the bar graphs should be enumerated on an excel file.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>The mouse model is interesting and experiments employing it provide compelling evidence to support a role for smooth muscle PKD2 in blood pressure regulation. This facet of the current manuscript is novel and by far the best developed.</p><p>On the other hand, findings related to differential stimulus-sensitivity of PKD2 in hindlimb arteries (pressure-induced tone) and mesenteric arteries (PE-induced construction) are puzzling and leaves one hanging. There is an unsatisfying lack of a physiological rationale for this outcome. Which one is related to blood pressure regulation, or are both, and which one is more important? How would you prove this?</p><p>Having said that, the effects of smooth muscle PKD2 on blood pressure regulation are striking and convincing. The effects of smooth muscle deletion of PKD2 on pressure and PE-induced increases on blood vessel diameter are convincing. The effects on membrane current are incomplete and not convincing. In my view, the authors could turn this manuscript into a compelling study, without much experimentation, with a much more balanced and nuanced presentation. For example, stressing the importance and novelty of the role of smooth muscle PKD2 in blood pressure regulation, and using the effects on myogenic and PE-induced tone as possible connectors while discussing the uncertainties of the connections.</p><p>1) Introduction: The motivation and rationale for the study are not well-developed. For example, in the first paragraph, it is stated &quot;However the molecular identity of arterial myocyte ion channels that regulate blood pressure, and their mechanisms of modulation in vivo (are) poorly understood.&quot; This is not entirely true. L-type voltage-dependent calcium channels in vascular smooth muscle regulate blood pressure and are the targets of a major class of anti-hypertensive drugs. Furthermore, the &quot;in vivo&quot; modulation of any type of ion channel is not completely understood. The current study only sheds light on PKD2 modulation in vitro, and not in vivo.</p><p>2) Introduction and elsewhere: It is stated a number of times that the PKD2 knockout is in &quot;systemic artery myocytes&quot;. This not true; it is all smooth muscle (vascular and non-vascular). This should be made clear. Do the mice have any other defects?</p><p>3) Subsection “Swelling activates PKD2 channels in hindlimb artery myocytes”: Cell-swelling-based electrophysiology data are incomplete. The authors show that cell swelling stimulates a TRP-like current in hindlimb artery myocytes, consistent with the demonstration that PKD2 plays a role in a mechanosensitive response (pressure-induced constriction) in hindlimb arteries. Although they report that PKD2 is not involved in pressure-induced constriction in mesenteric arteries, whether swelling-induced TRP-like currents are absent or present in myocytes from these arteries is not tested.</p><p>4) It is unclear why isotonic Na<sup>+</sup> was used. A physiological solution could have been used, so that swelling-activated (Na+) current over physiological membrane potentials can be examined. Furthermore, a similar protocol was used by Welsh et al., 2002, with the conclusion that the cation current was through TRPC6 channels. This study should be discussed.</p><p>5) Results section: PE-based electrophysiology data are incomplete. The authors show that PE stimulates a TRP-like current in mesenteric artery myocytes, consistent with the demonstration that PE induces constriction of mesenteric arteries. The companion patch-clamp experiments (PE on hindlimb artery myocytes) are nowhere to be found. Since other TRP channels are present in these cells (at minimum, TRPM4, TRPC6 and TRPV4, according to their own presentation) and should be detectable under these conditions, this result is puzzling.</p><p>6) Not at all clear why PKD2 KO should have a dramatic effect on myogenic tone in hindlimb (and cerebral arteries) arteries, but no effect at all in mesenteric arteries. Seemingly inexplicable results are often the takeoff point for interesting scientific stories, but they are intellectually unsatisfying if left hanging, as they are here. Again, at first blush, it makes no sense that PKD2 KO would have a dramatic effect on PE effects in mesenteric arteries, but no effect in hindlimb arteries.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what now follows is the decision letter after the authors submitted for further consideration.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Arterial smooth muscle cell PKD2 (TRPP1) channels regulate systemic blood pressure&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

Please show traces for Gd for both conditions studied in Figure 4C and explicitly point out in the text what is shown in Figure 4C and D. Also, the graphs in Figures 4D and Figure 4—figure supplement 1B are confusing because only data for -100 and +100 are shown, yet they appear on a continuous x-axis labeled voltage. The x axis should be removed, and data plotted at bar graphs with conditions clearly labeled.</p><p>2) It appears that some of the changes made in revision were done hastily, as there are ambiguous statements and grammatical errors in the red text.

Arteries of diverse organs are exposed to unique environments, including range of intravascular pressures and the types and concentrations of vasoconstrictor and vasodilator stimuli that regulate contractility. It would be surprising if the molecular components of signaling pathways were identical in myocytes of different arteries, including those in the mesentery and hindlimb.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) How is PKD2 seemingly sensing pressure in one cell but not the other? Osmolarity is a poor proxy for pressure. Recordings using direct mechanical stimulation (Piezo-driven glass probes and/or pressure clamp recordings) should be done for both myocyte types.</p></disp-quote><p>The goal of our study was to test the hypothesis that an arterial myocyte TRP channel regulates systemic blood pressure. We show that vasoconstrictor stimuli activate PKD2 channels in arterial myocytes, leading to Na<sup>+</sup> influx, membrane depolarization, vasoconstriction and an elevation in blood pressure. It is not clear what the most appropriate stimulus is to apply to an isolated smooth muscle cell to simulate intravascular pressure in an artery where myocytes are positioned in cylindrical orientation. Cell swelling has been used as a standard method in many publications to stimulate mechanosensitive responses arterial myocytes. Swelling has been successfully demonstrated to activate currents, including non-selective cation and chloride currents, in myocytes. In these studies, the same channels activated by cell-swelling contributed to pressure-induced vasoconstriction, suggesting that osmolarity is a good proxy for pressure in isolated arterial myocytes. We used the same approach here and show that cell-swelling activates a Na<sup>+</sup> current in hindlimb artery myocytes of PKD2<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice but does not activate the same current in hindlimb artery myocytes of inducible, smooth muscle cell-specific PKD2 knockout mice. These results are supported by extensive data obtained using the best possible proxy for pressure, which is pressure itself, and show that pressure-induced depolarization and vasoconstriction in hindlimb arteries and perfusion pressure in intact hindlimb muscle are all attenuated in PKD2<sup>sm-/-</sup> mice. Furthermore, we show using telemetry that PKD2 knockout reduces systemic blood pressure in conscious mice. We consider that this combination of approaches strongly supports our conclusion that pressure stimulates PKD2 channels in arterial myocytes.</p><p>It is unclear what is the best approach to use to simulate the force produced by intravascular pressure in an intact artery when studying an isolated arterial myocyte situated in a patch-clamp chamber. It is not known whether applying suction to cell-attached patches or pressing piezo-driven glass probes onto isolated myocytes are better proxys for intravascular pressure than cell swelling. To attempt to determine whether an alternative method to cell swelling also stimulates PKD2 channels in arterial myocytes, we performed patch-pressure experiments, similarly to what we did previously for TMEM16A channels in cerebral artery myocytes<sup>1</sup>. We also used glass probes. We found that applying patch pressure did activate single non-selective cation channels in hindlimb artery myocytes of PKD2<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice, although this only occurred in a small percentage (3/30 = 10% ) of cell-attached patches. Given that the surface area of a cell-attached patch is ~1 µm<sup>2</sup> and that of an arterial myocyte is ~3141 µm<sup>2</sup> (assuming a 10 µm diameter cylinder that is 100 µm long), this low probability of obtaining channels within small membrane patches is not surprising. Because of the low probability of obtaining a patch containing channels, we would have to record from a very large number of patches (at least 100) to obtain sufficient data to analyze channel properties in PKD2<sup>fl/fl</sup> myocytes. We would then be required to record from a similarly large number (again at least 100) of PKD2<sup>sm-/-</sup> myocytes to determine whether the same pressure-activated single channel conductance is absent in the knockout, confirming that it is PKD2. We consider this amount of experimentation beyond the scope of the current study, particularly as we show that swelling-included Na<sup>+</sup> currents, pressure-induced depolarization, pressure-induced vasoconstriction, muscle perfusion pressure, and systemic blood pressure are all attenuated in myocytes, arteries, whole hindlimb and in vivo circulation of PKD2<sup>sm-/-</sup> mice. We also attempted to measure current regulation by piezo-driven glass probes, but encountered technical challenges related to the fact that we record from fresh-isolated, myocytes that do not strongly adhere to the glass coverslip in the patchclamp chamber. When we applied pressure to myocytes using a glass probe, the cells rolled, which is not unexpected given their cylindrical shape. This rolling will produce large variability in the amount of pressure applied to individual cells. While we consider that glass probes may be useful for future studies, there will be significant technical challenges that need to be overcome before such an approach can be used reproducibly for arterial myocytes. We consider that at present this is also beyond the scope of the current study. We trust that you consider the wide variety of cellular, whole artery, intact tissue and in vivo approaches we have used to support our conclusions that PKD2 channels contribute to pressure-induced vasoconstriction in hindlimb arteries. We also hope you recognize that major technical challenges exist with your request, making it beyond the scope of the current study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Along this same line, are the same types of adrenergic receptors expressed in both types of myocytes? How do they explain the differential effects of PKD2 deletion on phenylephrine responses?</p></disp-quote><p>We have performed new experiments and now show that adrenergic receptor subtypes 1A, 1B and 1D are similar in mesenteric and hindlimb arteries of PKD2<sup>fl/fl</sup> and PKD2<sup>sm-/-</sup> mice (new Figure 1—figure supplement 3). These data indicate that the differential effects of PKD2 knockout in each artery type cannot be explained by changes in the expression of adrenergic receptors.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Furthermore, given they see differential effects between myocyte, where else is the SMMHC-CreERT2 expressed? Is Tamoxifen treatment equally efficient for knocking out PKD2 in all places?</p></disp-quote><p>We have performed additional immunofluorescence and contractility experiments. We now demonstrate that PKD2 is present in hindlimb artery myocytes of PKD2<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice, but absent in hindlimb artery myocytes of PKD2<sup>sm-/-</sup> mice (new Figure 1D). These data compliment those provided in the first submission which showed that PKD2 is knocked out in mesenteric artery myocytes of PKD2<sup>sm-/-</sup> mice. We also now show that phenylephrine similarly constricts hindlimb arteries of PKD2<sup>fl/fl</sup> and PKD2<sup>sm-/-</sup> mice (new Figure 3—figure supplement 1C). These data provide additional support for our conclusion that α1 adrenergic receptors do not signal through PKD2 channels in myocytes of hindlimb arteries.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) It has become standard to show the individual data points for each bar graph so the reader can more fully appreciate the sample size, distribution and effect sizes.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and now show the individual data points on all bar graphs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Although they discuss TRP channels, they should also consider the roles of Piezo1 and Piezo2. Are these expressed in myocytes? Are they dysregulated after PKD2 deletion?</p></disp-quote><p>There is evidence for Piezo1 expression in arterial myocytes, although Piezo1 is not required for the myogenic response in caudal and cerebral arteries<sup>2</sup>. We have performed additional experiments and now show that Piezo1 protein is similar in mesenteric and hindlimb arteries of PKD2<sup>fl/fl</sup> and PKD2<sup>sm-/-</sup> mice (new Figure 1—figure supplement 3). These data suggest that the attenuated pressure induced vasoconstriction in PKD2<sup>sm-/-</sup> hindlimb arteries cannot be explained by changes in Piezo1 expression in myocytes. These new data and evidence for Piezo1 expression in arterial myocytes have now been discussed in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Similarly, GPCRs such as the angiotensin receptor and (very recently) GPR68 have been implicated in mechanosensing.

The measurements you suggest would aim to determine whether the single channel conductances of swelling-activated channels in hindlimb artery myocytes and phenylephrine-activated channels in mesenteric artery myocytes are similar or different. To be certain that single channels which are measured are PKD2, we would need to show that these specific single channel conductances are absent in PKD2<sup>sm-/-</sup> myocytes from each artery type. To attempt to directly address your question, we performed patch-pressure experiments in hindlimb artery myocytes using similar approaches to those we used to measure single TMEM16A channels in cerebral artery myocytes<sup>1</sup>. We found that negative pressure activated single non-selective channels in PKD2<sup>fl/fl</sup> myocytes, although this only occurred in a small percentage (in 3 out of 30 = 10% ) of cell-attached patches. Given that the plasma membrane surface area of a cell-attached patch is ~1 µm<sup>2</sup> and that of an arterial myocyte is ~3141 µm<sup>2</sup> (assuming a 10 µm diameter cylinder that is 100 µm long), the low probability of obtaining pressure-sensitive channels within individual patches is not surprising. However, this creates technical challenges with performing the experiments you suggested. Because of the low probability of obtaining pressure-sensitive channels in patches, we would have to record from a very large number of both hindlimb artery and mesenteric artery myocytes (~100 of each type) to obtain sufficient recordings to characterize channel properties. We would also need to record from an equally large number of hindlimb artery and mesenteric artery myocytes of PKD2<sup>sm-/-</sup> myocytes to determine whether the same single channel conductances are absent. Other challenges exist. PKD2 knockout only partially attenuated phenylephrine-induced vasoconstriction, indicating that PKD2 channel activation is only one mechanism activated by this vasoconstrictor. Phenylephrine is likely to activate several different ion channel types in myocytes through G<sub>q11</sub> and via the release of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>, which will stimulate Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated channels. Phenylephrine-induced simultaneous activation of multiple different ion channel types that have different conductances will make it difficult to identify individual openings of PKD2 channels. We consider this extensive identification of single channel conductances in hindlimb and mesenteric hindlimb artery myocytes of PKD2<sup>fl/fl</sup> and PKD2<sup>sm-/-</sup> myocytes from two different artery types that are activated by distinct stimuli to be well beyond the scope of the current study. We also believe that this information does not alter the principal conclusions of our paper that arterial myocyte PKD2 channels increase systemic blood pressure by activating Na<sup>+</sup> currents that induce membrane depolarization and vasoconstriction. Considering the large amount of work that would be involved, we consider that a future, focused study should compare the single channel properties of PKD2 channels in myocytes of different arterial beds.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Determine if the putative PKD2 currents are cation-selective from the mesenteric and hindlimb smooth muscle. The authors used symmetric NaCl or NaAsp solutions and conclude that this channel is Na-permeable or is &quot;cation-selective&quot; without demonstrating this, as either anion can permeate chloride channels in smooth muscle (PMID: 10087337). This is particularly important for the osmo-regulation experiments, as the 300-250mOs condition invariably causes an increasing in the ohmic leak currents and likely activates resident swell-activated Cl<sup>-</sup> channels.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, we have performed new experiments. We now show using cation substitution that cell swelling activates a Na<sup>+</sup> current in hindlimb artery myocytes and phenylephrine stimulates a Na<sup>+</sup> current in mesenteric artery myocytes (new Figure 4 and Figure 6). Current activation by these stimuli is absent in the same arterial myocytes of PKD2<sup>sm-/-</sup> mice. These data provide further support that swelling activates PKD2 channels in hindlimb artery myocytes and phenylephrine stimulates PKD2 channels in mesenteric artery myocytes, generating Na<sup>+</sup> currents. The inclusion of these new data made previous Figure 4F and 4G redundant, so they were removed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The reversal potentials and voltage-dependence are variable between the electrophysiology recordings that report the putative PKD2 channel activity. Thus, uniform steady state analysis of the current should be per An example of this is Figure 4 —figure supplement 1and Figure 6—figure supplement 1. In Figure 6—figure supplement 1the reversal potential shifts from approximately -10 mV to +10 mV between the knockout and control currents (respectively), but it is zero millivolts experiments under the same conditions. Perhaps there are differences in the relative ion permeability of these cell membranes, that is variable from cell to cell, but cannot be considered a pure PKD2 current.</p></disp-quote><p>Please refer to our response to your previous comment (#2) and see our new data where have performed Na<sup>+</sup> substitution experiments and report current reversal potentials (new Figure 4 and Figure 6). Mean reversal potentials in mesenteric and hindlimb artery myocytes of PKD2<sup>fl/fl</sup> and PKD2<sup>sm-/-</sup> mice are not different. Collectively, data show that PKD2 channel activation generates Na<sup>+</sup> currents in arterial myocytes that induce membrane depolarization, vasoconstriction and an increase in systemic blood pressure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Whether hypertension in ADPKD is a primary vasculopathy secondary to mutations in the polycystin genes or perhaps, secondary to activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system by cyst expansion and intrarenal ischemia is unclear and thus is an intriguing question. However, it is important to point out that hypertension, not hypotension (as observed in their mouse) is associated with ADPKD in man. Thus, while the findings are descriptive of PKD2 regulation of vascular tone, it does little to enhance our understanding the disease complications associated with this channel.</p></disp-quote><p>We have expanded the paragraph in the Discussion section to consider these points in more detail.</p><p>The goal of our study was to investigate blood pressure regulation by arterial myocyte PKD2 channels. One finding of our paper is that inducible, smooth muscle cell-specific PKD2 channel knockout reduces systemic blood pressure. Regarding disease complications associated with this channel, we show that PKD2 is upregulated in hypertension and that smooth muscle-specific knockout causes vasodilation and reduces arterial wall remodeling and hypertension. We respectfully disagree that or study does little to enhance our understanding of disease complications associated with this channel. It was not our objective to study ADPKD or pathological effects of ADPKD-associated PKD2 channel mutations in arterial myocytes. Our demonstration that myocyte PKD2 channels regulate blood pressure is a step forward to better understanding the significance of this myocyte ion channel in cardiovascular physiology and disease.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>As we discussed in the paper and as you point out, a constitutive and global PKD2 channel mutation is associated with hypertension in ADPKD patients. Here, we studied the effects of knocking out arterial myocyte PKD2 over an approximately three week time period in fully developed adult mice. There are many reasons for why an acute, myocyte-specific PKD2 knockout model and a constitutive and global PKD2 mutation have different effects on blood pressure. We refer you to our expanded Discussion section, where we have outlined these considerations in more detail. Briefly, these include differences that may occur when studying PKD2 mutations versus PKD2 knockout, global versus myocyte-specific effects, and the result of a constitutive mutation that is present since fertilization versus those of an acute (&lt;3 week) knockout in fully developed adults. Future studies should be designed to investigate the effects of PKD2 mutations that occur in ADPKD patients on vascular myocyte function and systemic blood pressure.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>[…] 1) Introduction: The motivation and rationale for the study are not well-developed. For example, in the first paragraph, it is stated &quot;However the molecular identity of arterial myocyte ion channels that regulate blood pressure, and their mechanisms of modulation in vivo (are) poorly understood.&quot; This is not entirely true. L-type voltage-dependent calcium channels in vascular smooth muscle regulate blood pressure and are the targets of a major class of anti-hypertensive drugs. Furthermore, the &quot;in vivo&quot; modulation of any type of ion channel is not completely understood. The current study only sheds light on PKD2 modulation in vitro, and not in vivo.</p> </disp-quote><p>We have modified this paragraph to better outline the rationale for the study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Introduction and elsewhere: It is stated a number of times that the PKD2 knockout is in &quot;systemic artery myocytes&quot;. This not true; it is all smooth muscle (vascular and non-vascular). This should be made clear. Do the mice have any other defects?</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, these statements have been modified to improve clarity. The mice do not have any obvious defects other than those described in the paper. Locomotion, cardiac function, plasma angiotensin II, aldosterone and ANP and plasma and urine electrolytes were all similar in PKD2<sup>fl/fl</sup> and PKD2<sup>sm-/-</sup> mice.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Subsection “Swelling activates PKD2 channels in hindlimb artery myocytes”: Cell-swelling-based electrophysiology data are incomplete. The authors show that cell swelling stimulates a TRP-like current in hindlimb artery myocytes, consistent with the demonstration that PKD2 plays a role in a mechanosensitive response (pressure-induced constriction) in hindlimb arteries. Although they report that PKD2 is not involved in pressure-induced constriction in mesenteric arteries, whether swelling-induced TRP-like currents are absent or present in myocytes from these arteries is not tested.</p></disp-quote><p>These data were provided in the first submission of the manuscript as supplemental figure 8. Due to figure rearrangement in the revised manuscript, these data are now shown as Figure 6—figure supplement 1. These results indicate that cell swelling activates a similar amplitude I<sub>Cat</sub> in mesenteric artery myocytes of PKD2<sup>fl/fl</sup> and PKD2<sup>sm-/-</sup> mice.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) It is unclear why isotonic Na<sup>+</sup> was used. A physiological solution could have been used, so that swelling-activated (Na+) current over physiological membrane potentials can be examined. Furthermore, a similar protocol was used by Welsh et al., 2002, with the conclusion that the cation current was through TRPC6 channels. This study should be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>The goal of the study was to investigate the regulation of blood pressure by PKD2 channels, which are non-selective cation channels. Isotonic Na<sup>+</sup> was used to isolate currents through TRP channels and to prevent currents through K<sup>+</sup> channels. We have performed additional patch-clamp experiments to measure the permeability of the swelling-activated current. These new data show that hypoosmolar solution activates a Na<sup>+</sup> current (new Figure 4). As suggested, we have discussed the Welsh study, which demonstrated that myocyte TRPC6 channels contribute to the myogenic response in cerebral arteries, a vascular bed that does not regulate systemic blood pressure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Results section: PE-based electrophysiology data are incomplete. The authors show that PE stimulates a TRP-like current in mesenteric artery myocytes, consistent with the demonstration that PE induces constriction of mesenteric arteries. The companion patch-clamp experiments (PE on hindlimb artery myocytes) are nowhere to be found. Since other TRP channels are present in these cells (at minimum, TRPM4, TRPC6 and TRPV4, according to their own presentation) and should be detectable under these conditions, this result is puzzling.</p></disp-quote><p>These data are now shown as Figure 4—figure supplement 1. They show that phenylephrine activates a similar amplitude I<sub>Cat</sub> in hindlimb artery myocytes of PKD2<sup>fl/fl</sup> and PKD2<sup>sm-/-</sup> mice. We have also performed additional new experiments and show that phenylephrine similarly constricts hindlimb arteries of PKD2<sup>fl/fl</sup> and PKD2<sup>sm-/-</sup> mice (new Figure 3—figure supplement 1C). These data provide additional support for our conclusion that α1-adrenergic receptors do not signal to PKD2 channels in myocytes of hindlimb arteries.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Not at all clear why PKD2 KO should have a dramatic effect on myogenic tone in hindlimb (and cerebral arteries) arteries, but no effect at all in mesenteric arteries. Seemingly inexplicable results are often the takeoff point for interesting scientific stories, but they are intellectually unsatisfying if left hanging, as they are here. Again, at first blush, it makes no sense that PKD2 KO would have a dramatic effect on PE effects in mesenteric arteries, but no effect in hindlimb arteries.</p></disp-quote><p>We have expanded the text and provide multiple explanations why unique stimuli may activate PKD2 channels in myocytes of different arteries. Arteries within different organs are exposed to unique environments, including diverse intravascular pressures and the types and concentrations of a wide range of vasoconstrictor and vasodilator stimuli. Arteries of different organs are not the same. Clear examples include cerebral, pulmonary and coronary arteries. It would be surprising if the molecular components of signaling pathways were identical in myocytes of different arteries. The goal of our study was to investigate blood pressure regulation by arterial myocyte PKD2 channels. We found using a knockout model that the same ion channel, PKD2, is activated by distinct vasoconstrictor stimuli in two different vascular beds. It was not a goal of our study to identify the differential signaling mechanisms involved in PKD2 activation in these different vascular beds. As you mention, we consider this finding to be a “takeoff point” for future studies and well beyond the scope of the current manuscript.</p><p>References</p><p>1.
