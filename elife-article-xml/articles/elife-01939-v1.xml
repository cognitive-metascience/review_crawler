form diversity in nature, bilaterian animals share common sets of developmental genes that display conserved expression patterns in the embryo. Among them are the Hox genes, which define different identities along the anterior–posterior axis. Hox proteins exert their function by interaction with TALE transcription factors. Hox and TALE members are also present in some but not all non-bilaterian phyla, raising the question of how Hox–TALE interactions evolved to provide positional information. By using proteins from unicellular and multicellular lineages, we showed that these networks emerged from an ancestral generic motif present in Hox and other related protein families. Interestingly, Hox-TALE networks experienced additional and extensive molecular innovations that were likely crucial for differentiating Hox functions along body plans. Together our results highlight how homeobox gene families evolved during eukaryote evolution to eventually constitute a major patterning system in Eumetazoans.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01939.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01939.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01939.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Any animal with a body that is symmetric about an imaginary line that runs from its head to its tail is known as a bilaterian. Humans and most animals are bilateral, whereas jellyfish and starfish are not. Bilateral symmetry can take many forms—as demonstrated by the differences between flies, frogs and humans—but all bilaterians express many of the same genes during development.</p><p>One of these groups of genes is known as the Hox family. The expression of specific Hox genes at specific times instructs cells in the developing embryo to adopt different fates according to their position along the anterior–posterior (head to tail) axis. The patterning function of Hox genes relies on the presence of two additional cofactors that belong to the so-called TALE family. Although both Hox and TALE proteins were present early on during animal evolution, it is unclear how and when the interactions between them first began to generate symmetrical body plans.</p><p>Now, Hudry et al. have provided insights into the origin of the Hox-TALE network by analysing the expression and molecular properties of Hox and TALE proteins from various multicellular and unicellular organisms. These experiments revealed that Hox and TALE proteins of the sea anemone <italic>Nematostella</italic>, which belongs to a group of animals called cnidarians that have radial rather than bilateral symmetry, interact with one another in a similar manner to the interactions seen in bilaterians.</p><p>Hudry et al. then showed that two <italic>Nematostella</italic> Hox genes were able to substitute for their bilaterian equivalents in fruit flies, and that a <italic>Nematostella</italic> TALE gene was able to take over neuronal functions of its equivalent in <italic>Xenopus</italic> frogs. This striking conservation of function between species suggests that Hox and TALE genes were already working together in the common ancestor of all bilaterian and cnidarian animals.</p><p>By contrast, TALE members from a unicellular amoeba were unable to interact with Hox proteins, suggesting that Hox–TALE interactions first emerged in multicellular animals. In addition to increasing our knowledge of highly conserved Hox signalling, these data provide insight into the molecular mechanisms that gave rise to the symmetrical body plan that has been adopted, and adapted, by the majority of animals since.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01939.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01939.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>Hox</kwd><kwd>TALE</kwd><kwd>evolution</kwd><kwd>network</kwd><kwd>transcription factor</kwd><kwd><italic>Nematostella vectensis</italic></kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Association pour la Recherche contre le Cancer</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hudry</surname><given-names>Bruno</given-names></name><name><surname>Thomas-Chollier</surname><given-names>Morgane</given-names></name><name><surname>Volovik</surname><given-names>Yael</given-names></name><name><surname>Duffraisse</surname><given-names>Marilyne</given-names></name><name><surname>Dard</surname><given-names>Amélie</given-names></name><name><surname>Frank</surname><given-names>Dale</given-names></name><name><surname>Technau</surname><given-names>Ulrich</given-names></name><name><surname>Merabet</surname><given-names>Samir</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Fondation pour la Recheche Medicale</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hudry</surname><given-names>Bruno</given-names></name><name><surname>Thomas-Chollier</surname><given-names>Morgane</given-names></name><name><surname>Volovik</surname><given-names>Yael</given-names></name><name><surname>Duffraisse</surname><given-names>Marilyne</given-names></name><name><surname>Dard</surname><given-names>Amélie</given-names></name><name><surname>Frank</surname><given-names>Dale</given-names></name><name><surname>Technau</surname><given-names>Ulrich</given-names></name><name><surname>Merabet</surname><given-names>Samir</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>EMBO short term fellow</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hudry</surname><given-names>Bruno</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Interactions between Hox and TALE genes, which generate bilaterally symmetrical body plans, originated in early multicellular animals.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>‘What is an animal?’ In 1993, Slack et al. proposed to define an animal by the zootype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Slack et al., 1993</xref>), a concept illustrating the strong conservation of embryonic expression profiles of developmental genes observed in different bilaterian phyla at that time. Since then, it was found that developmental genes could also display highly dissimilar expression patterns or even be absent in non-bilaterian lineages, showing that the genetic mechanisms underlying embryonic development are not universal.</p><p>One major class of developmental genes that was historically considered as highly conserved in the animal kingdom is the Hox genes. Hox genes are expressed along the anteroposterior axis of all bilaterian animals, providing positional information during embryogenesis. Given their important patterning roles, Hox genes are thought to have strongly contributed to morphological diversification of bilaterian organisms during evolution. Accordingly, numerous examples have shown that modifications in Hox genes number, expression, and/or activity could correlate to morphological variations across bilaterian lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Heffer and Pick, 2013</xref>).</p><p>The role of Hox genes suffers more ambiguity outside Bilateria, and in particular in the sister Cnidaria group. Cnidarians do contain Hox genes and have undergone a wide range of morphological radiation during evolution. However, Hox genes have neither a clear collinear nor conserved expression profile along the primary (oral–aboral) axis of the planula larva among different cnidarian lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Finnerty et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kamm et al., 2006</xref>), which renders their orthology status difficult to assign (specially for posterior/non-anterior cnidarian Hox genes). A role of Hox genes in axis patterning was proposed in the hydrozoan <italic>Eleutheria dichotoma</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jakob and Schierwater, 2007</xref>), but these results are limited by the fact that functional analyses were performed in medusa, a particular developmental stage that is not shared by all cnidarian species. The role of cnidarian Hox genes during early larval stages is, however, currently unclear.</p><p>Interestingly, Cnidaria is the only non-bilaterian phylum, which has a bona fide Hox repertoire, whereas others, including ctenophores, sponges, and placozoans, lack Hox genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). This raises the important question of how the Hox gene family acquired its crucial axial patterning functions during metazoan evolution. In Bilateria, Hox patterning functions rely on the presence of the PBC and Meis proteins, which are also present in non-bilaterian phyla (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). We thus assessed whether a Hox/PBC/Meis network could exist outside Bilateria, and if so whether or not it would rely on identical molecular rules as observed in Bilateria.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01939.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Phylogeny of Hox (ANTP superclass) and PBC/Meis (TALE superclass) proteins across eukaryote evolution.</title><p>Protein motifs required for Hox/PBC/Meis network are indicated when present: homeodomain (HD), hexapeptide (HX), PBC-A, and MEIS-A.

A question mark is indicated for Meis of <italic>Monosiga brevicollis</italic> because of incomplete sequence. The protein indicated in Placozoa is not coloured in blue since it is not a true Hox protein (see main text for details). Examples are provided for a representative species of each group. Members of PBC and Meis classes are called Pbx or Extradenticle (Exd) and Meis or Homothorax (Hth), respectively.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01939.003">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01939.003</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-01939-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig></p><p>Hox and PBC/Meis proteins belong to the ANTP (Antennapedia) and TALE (Three amino acids loop extension) class of homeodomain (HD)-containing TFs, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Saina et al., 2009</xref>). The Hox/PBC/Meis network relies on interactions between PBC and Meis proteins on one side, and on interactions between Hox and PBC proteins on the other side (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mann et al., 2009</xref>). Some posterior vertebrate Hox members do form dimeric complexes with Meis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Shen et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Williams et al., 2005</xref>), but these interactions constitute a vertebrate innovation rather than a general rule in Bilateria. Interactions between PBC and Meis occur through conserved regions localized upstream of the HD of both proteins (called PBC-A and MEIS-A domains) and which are thought to derive from a common ancestor domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Burglin, 1998</xref>). These interactions allow the nuclear translocation and stability of PBC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abu-Shaar et al., 1999</xref>). Interactions between Hox and PBC involve a short conserved motif in Hox proteins, called the hexapeptide (HX), which folds within the hydrophobic pocket formed in part by the extra-three residues of the HD of PBC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Merabet et al., 2009</xref>). This motif contains a conserved core sequence of four residues in all but AbdB-group Hox proteins, which retain a single tryptophan residue. Additional specific signatures can also be found in the HX of some paralog groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Merabet et al., 2009</xref>). Recent data showed that Hox proteins could also interact with PBC partners through other more specific motifs. These alternative interaction modes can be induced by the DNA-binding of the Meis partner, eventually leading to different three-dimensional conformations that could be important for paralog-specific functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Galant et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Merabet et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hudry et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>PBC and Meis representatives are found from unicellular Amoebozoa and Filasterea groups to metazoan lineages including Ctenophora and Placozoa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Sequence analysis shows that only one PBC or Meis representative is present, or that the protein does not contain the PBC-A or MEIS-A interaction domain in most of these lineages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1 fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplements 1 and 2</xref>). Interestingly, all protein features required for PBC/Meis partnership appeared concomitantly with the presence of Hox or Hox-like proteins in Metazoa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Of note, the representative species of Placozoa, <italic>Trichoplax adhaerens</italic> (<italic>Ta</italic>), contains a protein that was classified as a ProtoHox (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schierwater and Kuhn, 1998</xref>) or ParaHox (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mendivil Ramos et al., 2012</xref>) member (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). However, the absence of any HX motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schierwater and Kuhn, 1998</xref>) suggests that this protein could not interact with PBC/Meis, which is confirmed later (see last section of ‘Results’).</p><p>Protein sequence analysis indicates that a Hox/PBC/Meis network could first be present in Cnidaria. To test this hypothesis, we dissected the molecular properties underlying the formation of the Hox/PBC/Meis interaction network of the sea anemone <italic>Nematostella vectensis</italic> (<italic>Nv</italic>), a cnidarian species exhibiting an internal symmetry organized along oral–aboral (primary) and directive (secondary) body axes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). This analysis was performed in vitro and in vivo and completed by heterologous functional assays in vertebrate and invertebrate species. Since other members of the ANTP superclass are described to interact with PBC in Bilateria, we also searched for the molecular mechanisms that allowed the emergence of the Hox–TALE network during evolution of homeobox gene families.<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01939.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Hox and TALE members are co-expressed in the endoderm of the Nematostella embryo.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Genomic organisation of Hox genes in <italic>Nematostella vectensis</italic> (<italic>Nv</italic>) and <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> (<italic>Dm</italic>), two representative species of Cnidaria and Bilateria, respectively.

We predicted that these DNA-binding sites should be found in the promoter region of genes expressed in the endoderm, where Hox and TALE products are present together.

The choice of working with a limited number of genes was motivated by the fact that we did not find any significant enrichment of Hox/PBC/Meis binding sites in a genome-wide search, neither in <italic>Nematostella</italic> nor in other metazoan species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>).

These results highlight that the signal to noise ratio is too low when considering Hox/PBC/Meis binding sites in all non-coding regions, and that the space search needs to be restricted to observe a significant enrichment.</p><p>Our in silico analysis revealed a significant enrichment of Hox/Pbx binding sites in the promoter region of genes expressed in the endoderm compared to the ectoderm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,B</xref>, ‘Materials and methods’).

One idea would be to search for conserved regions within cnidarians, taking Nematostella as reference, but such an analysis was beyond the scope of this project, and the divergence time of available cnidarian genomes might not be adapted to this analysis. We attempted a related analysis by taking microsyntenic regions as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Irimia et al. (2012)</xref>.

The results, however, were highly dependent on the order of the Markov model. To circumvent this, we used randomized motifs as a control, allowing us to keep working on the real genomic sequences. We permuted the motif positions 100 times, allowing, removing the biological signal, while retaining the statistical properties of the PSSMs describing the motifs.

In contrast to the NK or extended-Hox families, most members of the Hox family have retained a HX motif. This motif is required for generic Hox/Pbx functions. The additional presence of Meis allows revealing specific Pbx interaction motifs (SPIMs), which could be important for distinguishing and/or diversifying the embryonic activities of each Hox paralog group member.

This motif is present in different ANTP subclasses, including NK, Hox/ParaHox and extended-Hox, specifically in Bilateria and Cnidaria. Different scenarios can be proposed for explaining the evolutionary history of the HX among different ANTP members. These scenarios are hypothetical and diverge according to the putative evolutionary history of the ANTP class homeobox genes. In one scenario, HX-containing NK, Hox and extended-Hox members could have emerged from a common HX-containing NK protein, which itself appeared from duplications of an ancestral HX-deficient NK cluster, at the basis of Eumetazoa (Bilateria+Cnidaria, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11A</xref>). Alternatively, it was recently proposed that Hox/ParaHox, NK and extended-Hox evolved before the origin of poriferans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mendivil Ramos et al., 2012</xref>), being already present in the last common ancestor of animals (Urmetazoa). In this scenario, we do not favour the hypothesis of independent acquisitions of the HX in the three homeobox gene families. Indeed, although the HX is a short motif, it is always located upstream and at a reasonable distance of the HD. This invariant position is probably critical to ensure interactions with PBC proteins. Moreover, the distance between the HX and the HD could have played important roles for the acquisition of new functions, as noticed in certain bilaterian Hox proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Prince et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Saadaoui et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, the HX could already have been present in the ProtoANTP protein of the Urmetazoa ancestor, being secondarily lost in Porifera, Ctenophora and Placozoa during evolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11B</xref>).<fig id="fig11" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01939.027</object-id><label>Figure 11.</label><caption><title>Evolution of molecular signatures underlying interaction networks with TALE proteins.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Model for the apparition of the HX in ANTP members of Cnidaria and Bilateria.

In this scenario, it is unlikely that the HX appeared after duplications of the ProtoANTP ancestor independently and at the same place in the ProtoHox, ProtoNK and ProtoExtended(e)Hox families. Thus, the HX motif was probably already present in the ProtoANTP ancestor. This motif was secondarily lost in ANTP members of Porifera, Placozoa and Ctenophora during evolution.

Homology between cnidarian and bilaterian axes is a long-standing and still controversial question. It was first proposed that the oral–aboral axis of <italic>Nematostella</italic> could be orthologous to the bilaterian AP axis, with an anterior-like (<italic>NvHoxA</italic>/<italic>anthox6</italic>) and central/posterior (<italic>NvHoxF</italic>/<italic>Anthox1</italic>) Hox gene being expressed at the oral or aboral tip respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Finnerty et al., 2004</xref>). This expression profile is however not conserved in other cnidarian species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kamm et al., 2006</xref>) and there is compelling evidence that the aboral pole could rather correspond to the anterior end of bilaterians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sinigaglia et al., 2013</xref>). Therefore, expression of <italic>Nv</italic>Hox genes along the primary body axis could correspond to individual morphogenetic and not positional patterning functions, as recently shown for <italic>NvHoxF</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sinigaglia et al., 2013</xref>). In this context, other HD-containing determinants could play important patterning roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">de Jong et al., 2006</xref>), as demonstrated for Six transcription factors in the early specification of the aboral pole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sinigaglia et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Along the same line, the directive axis of <italic>Nematostella</italic> was proposed to be homologous to the bilaterian DV axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Matus et al., 2006</xref>), but functional analyses revealed that DV patterning genes are also required in the endoderm and ectoderm along the primary axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Matus et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Saina et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Together, these observations highlight that patterning molecules can be used along different longitudinal axes during animal evolution, which renders difficult the comparison between Bilateria and Cnidaria.

We showed that more ancient TALE proteins, like those from the unicellular <italic>Acanthamoeba</italic> organism could neither interact between each other nor form complexes with Hox proteins. Heterologous interaction assays between <italic>Ac</italic>Meis and mouse Hox and PBC proteins further exemplified that the PBC/Meis partnership is critical for the formation of Hox–TALE networks. This partnership probably appeared with the PBC-A domain in PBC, and concomitantly with the HX motif during eukaryote evolution. Although the MEIS-A domain was more ancient, the Meis partner also clearly acquired additional protein features, allowing the formation and therefore diversifying the activity of Hox/PBC/Meis networks in Metazoa.</p><p>Interestingly, the HX is not only conserved in the Hox family but also in different NK and extended-Hox members. Still, the role and the importance of TALE partners in these additional networks might not be equivalent. We propose that apparition of Hox, NK and extended-Hox members was accompanied by functional sub-specialisations that could in part result from divergent molecular interaction properties with TALE cofactors. For example, only two NK sub-family members (Msx and Tlx) have retained a HX motif, suggesting that interaction between NK and TALE proteins is not a general rule. The same rationale applies to extended-Hox members. On the contrary, the HX is present in almost all Hox paralog groups, which coincides with a general requirement of TALE cofactors in Hox functions. In this context, the role of Meis for revealing additional and more specific Pbx interaction motifs (SPIMs) in Hox proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hudry et al., 2012</xref>) was also likely an ancestral feature of the Hox/TALE system for distinguishing functions between different Hox paralog members.</p><p>In conclusion, we propose that Hox-TALE networks constituted an ancestral regulatory module that was later on exploited for patterning functions in Bilateria. This network was effective as soon as different interaction modes could exist with duplicated Hox family members, allowing diversifying patterning functions along the body axis.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor and 3 reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and one of whom, David Ferrier, has agreed to reveal his identity.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission. </p><p>The comments below are a recombined text from the major comments provided by the three reviewers. All three support publication, but ask for some additional discussion and clarifications. This requires only modifications in the text, but no additional experiments. </p><p>The authors provide compelling functional evidence for a conservation of the Hox-TALE interaction network between Cnidaria and Bilateria. This is based on in vitro and vivo studies, including rescue constructs across taxa. They provide also negative evidence for some unclear homologs from lower taxa. The function of the Hox genes in cnidarians is a particularly contentious issue within the field and this manuscript represents an important new perspective on this debate, now supported with abundant new functional data. The detailed functional experiments performed here, involving two different <italic>Nematostella</italic> Hox genes clearly illustrate that this cnidarian has Hox (and Pbx and Meis) genes that function like the Hox genes of bilaterians, regardless of the difficulties of comparing the embryology and axial development of cnidarians relative to bilaterians. The variety in the modes of interaction between the Meis, Pbx and Hox proteins when the presence of a hexapeptide is varied is also of widespread interest, not just for the evolutionary implications highlighted in this manuscript, but also for the basic mechanistic implications for these transcription factors. </p><p>In conclusion, this paper provides some surprising results as to the functional conservation of Hox/PBC/Meis interactions. It tries to argue that the emergence of the HX motif in the superfamily has allowed a greater role for these proteins but it is difficult to see how the HX motif, as small as it is, could have evolved so many times. Yet, this represents a large amount of molecular and in vivo work that leads to the model that, by acquiring the ability to interact, the three protein classes have allowed the specification of positional information in animals. </p><p>There are, however, a few points that need additional discussion or a better placement in the relevant context: </p><p>1) The first difficulty relates to the orthology of Hox genes, or even their real nomenclature, which is difficult to assess in the absence of clustering and extensive sequence landmarks. However, the authors manage to define them as 'anterior' or more posterior. </p><p>2) The authors use BiFC extensively for defining protein–protein interactions, although it is not clear how specific these interactions might be. </p><p>3) The in silico search for mesodermal binding sites for Hox/Pbx (and Meis) is too biased and not terribly useful to show functional specificity. This only allows the definition of potential binding sites but the same data could have been obtained by using bona fide DNA sites. It is not clear what the authors are trying to say with these sites. </p><p>4) The more novel part of the paper concerns the extended Hox protein family, including NK proteins that also share an HX motif in higher animals. It is difficult to interpret the lack of direct interaction between Msx and PBC, likely due to the absence of an HX motif. However, the authors argue that the HX motif has appeared late in the superfamily of Hox proteins, but this is difficult to reconcile with the evolution of these families since this would imply that the HX domain has evolved independently in multiple proteins, after the duplication of the precursor Hox. </p><p>5) It seems that a bit more speculation would be warranted to place the work in context. For example, they do not touch the question of axis very much. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> they represent the aboral–oral axis of Cnidaria analogous to the anterior-posterior in bilateria. In the same figure they show evidence for asymmetry of Hox gene expression, along the directive axis, as it was also found by others. This would of course be in line with the enterocoel hypothesis and their short remark in the text would also support this. Hence, I would encourage them to add a paragraph on discussing axis homologies, although I do not expect that they can arrive at a final conclusion on this yet. Still, their work evidently contributes to this important question. </p><p>6) For the revisions, authors should revisit the question of which figures should be in the main text and which provide only supplementary information. </p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01939.030</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) The first difficulty relates to the orthology of Hox genes, or even their real nomenclature, which is difficult to assess in the absence of clustering and extensive sequence landmarks. However, the authors manage to define them as 'anterior' or more posterior</italic>.</p><p>We agree there is a real difficulty in defining the orthology of cnidarian Hox genes. What is undisputed is the presence of anterior Hox genes. The others (in our terminology <italic>NvHoxE/F</italic>) are more difficult to place, as discussed in the first part of the result section. Another difficulty is the terminology of cnidarian Hox genes, which changes depending on the species and/or the authors. To be less confusing for non-cnidarian specialists, we now started the result section by providing a precise definition of the terminology and the possible orthology of <italic>Nematostella</italic> Hox genes. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> was modified accordingly and now depicts the genomic organisation of <italic>Nematostella</italic> Hox genes with their corresponding groups of orthology. We also provided protein sequence alignments between <italic>Nematostella</italic> and <italic>Drosophila</italic> Hox proteins to better highlight the degree of conservation at the level of the HX- and HD-encompassing regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2– figure supplement 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2–figure supplement 4</xref>).</p><p><italic>2) The authors use BiFC extensively for defining protein–protein interactions, although it is not clear how specific these interactions might be</italic>.</p><p>Specificity of BiFC is a critical point, especially when considering that the complementary fragments of the fluorescent protein have a certain affinity, leading to a stabilization of the interactions between two candidate fusion proteins. Therefore it is important to have negative controls in hands, to confirm that BiFC signals are relevant of real protein–protein interactions in vivo. We already described all suitable negative controls in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, mammalian cells and chick embryos (Hudry et al., BMC Biology 2011; Hudry et al., PLOS Biology 2012). These negative controls were repeated in our experiments with <italic>Nematostella</italic> fusion proteins. In particular, we showed that each individual sub-fragment of the Venus protein could not interact with the complementary fragment fused to <italic>Nv</italic>Pbx or <italic>Nv</italic>Meis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). This is now more clearly stated in the Result section: “No BiFC was obtained between a fusion construct and the complementary isolated VC or VN fragment, highlighting that the interaction between <italic>Nv</italic>Pbx and <italic>Nv</italic>Meis fusion proteins was not artificially induced by the inherent affinity of the VN and VC fragments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>)”. Along the same line we provided evidence that BiFC cannot occur in conditions where Hox-PBC interactions are abolished (with the DNA-binding deficient form of <italic>Nv</italic>Pbx: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>).</p><p><italic>3) The in silico search for mesodermal binding sites for Hox/Pbx (and Meis) is too biased and not terribly useful to show functional specificity. This only allows the definition of potential binding sites but the same data could have been obtained by using bona fide DNA sites. It is not clear what the authors are trying to say with these sites</italic>.</p><p>We have now described more precisely the logic behind the search for <italic>Nematostella</italic> Hox/TALE binding sites in the genome: “Our band shift assays were performed on consensus binding sites previously defined with bilaterian Hox and TALE proteins. To know whether such sites could be used in the context of <italic>Nematostella</italic> development, we searched for their presence in the <italic>Nematostella</italic> genome.”</p><p><italic>4) The more novel part of the paper concerns the extended Hox protein family, including NK proteins that also share an HX motif in higher animals. It is difficult to interpret the lack of direct interaction between Msx and PBC, likely due to the absence of an HX motif. However, the authors argue that the HX motif has appeared late in the superfamily of Hox proteins, but this is difficult to reconcile with the evolution of these families since this would imply that the HX domain has evolved independently in multiple proteins, after the duplication of the precursor Hox</italic>.</p><p>This comment can be addressed with the minor comments from Reviewer 2. He/she proposes the exact opposite: “In the context of the discussion, I wonder whether it really is so difficult to imagine that the hexapeptide evolved independently in distinct ANTP subclasses? It is, after all, a short sequence in which a high degree of variability can be seen amongst gene families and between taxa. In some instances it seems to effectively be just a single Tryptophan (W) residue. One scenario might be that once a hexapeptide–TALE interaction is established in one family then the hexapeptide-interacting aspect of the TALE protein is established and is retained whilst the hexapeptide evolves in other ANTP subclasses? This scenario is the compliment of the differential loss scenario described by the authors, in terms of explaining the patchy distribution of hexapeptide domains across the ANTP class.”</p><p>Here we presented two possible scenarios, taking into account the phylogeny history of ANTP class genes. In both models, we postulated that the HX was present in a common ancestor of Hox, NK and extended-Hox members. We did not argue that the HX appeared late in Hox proteins. We agree with Reviewer 2 that given the short size of the HX, this motif could have appeared independently in multiple times during evolution. However, we have to consider that this motif is always located at a precise position in all ANTP subclass members (upstream of the HD), which is probably important to ensure interactions with PBC members. Along the same line, the distance between the HX and the HD may also have played important roles in the acquisition of new functions, as noticed in certain bilaterian Hox proteins. For all these reasons, it is difficult to imagine that the invariant position of the HX could result from independent acquisitions during metazoan evolution. We tried to better emphasize this point in the corresponding discussion part.</p><p><italic>5) It seems that a bit more speculation would be warranted to place the work in context.

Still, their work evidently contributes to this important question</italic>.</p><p>We chose not to extrapolate too much with our results on the longstanding and heavy debate of the homologous comparison between bilaterian and cnidarian longitudinal axes. We have now discussed this point in more detail, providing references illustrating the controversy for both the primary and secondary axes of cnidarians. We concluded on the fact that patterning molecules (Hox, BMPs, etc) could simply be used along different longitudinal axes in different species. What is important is the existence of a patterning system that could be co-opted during evolution: “Together these observations highlight that patterning molecules can be used along different longitudinal axes during animal evolution, which renders difficult the comparison between Bilateria and Cnidaria. Here we propose that the ancestral molecular cues underlying the Hox patterning system along the cnidarian directive axis could have been recruited for AP patterning in Bilateria.”</p><p><italic>6) For the revisions, authors should revisit the question of which figures should be in the main text and which provide only supplementary information</italic>.</p><p>We have changed the previous supplementary figures 9 and 11-13 into <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7 fig9">Figures 7 and 9</xref>, respectively.
