The killing strategy of neutrophils involves the ingestion of pathogens into the phagosome, accompanied by the production of a diverse set of so-called reactive oxygen species (ROS), including superoxide anions (O<sub>2</sub><bold><sup>⋅</sup></bold><sup>-</sup>), hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) and hypochlorous acid (HOCl) in a process known as the respiratory burst (recently reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Mortaz et al., 2018</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Thomas, 2017</xref>).</p><p>HOCl, a major inflammatory ROS, is produced from hydrogen peroxide and chloride ions by the heme enzyme myeloperoxidase (MPO) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Furtmüller et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">van Dalen et al., 1997</xref>). The antimicrobial properties of HOCl are well documented and numerous reports have provided strong evidence for severe damage to bacterial components within the neutrophil phagosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chapman et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Rosen et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Degrossoli et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>A particularly important target of HOCl are proteins. In proteins, HOCl exposure typically leads to side chain modification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Clark et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Beck-Speier et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Heinecke, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Domigan et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Sivey et al., 2013</xref>), fragmentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Vissers and Winterbourn, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hawkins and Davies, 1998</xref>), misfolding/aggregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hazell et al., 1994</xref>) or intermolecular di-tyrosine cross-linking, a hallmark of HOCl-oxidized proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Heinecke et al., 1993</xref>). This often leads to their aggregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Müller et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chapman et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Winter et al., 2008</xref>). Consequently, various mechanisms to counter the accumulation of these misfolded proteins under HOCl stress exist in bacteria. These are mediated by chaperones that are activated by HOCl, the very same reactive species they protect against. One of the first protective proteins to be noticed was Hsp33, which gets reversibly activated by HOCl through oxidation of four critical cysteine residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Winter et al., 2008</xref>). This is not surprising, as cysteine thiols together with methionine residues react rapidly with HOCl (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Storkey et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Arnhold et al., 1991</xref>). More recently, we found that <italic>E. coli</italic> RidA, a member of the highly conserved, but functionally diverse YjgF/YER057c/UK114 protein family, also undergoes HOCl-based conversion into a chaperone holdase. This chaperone was highly active as protector of proteins from HOCl-induced aggregation. However, in this case, instead of cysteine oxidation, <italic>N</italic>-chlorination of basic amino acids was the mechanism of its activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Müller et al., 2014</xref>), although reactivity of HOCl with side chains of lysine and arginine is four to seven orders of magnitude lower than that of cysteine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Pattison and Davies, 2001</xref>). But much like cysteine oxidation, <italic>N</italic>-chlorination is a reversible oxidative modification that can be removed by cellular antioxidants such as ascorbate, glutathione or thioredoxin and thus can switch the holdase function of RidA off (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Müller et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Chesney et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Peskin and Winterbourn, 2001</xref>).</p><p>Similar observations were made more recently with <italic>E. coli</italic> CnoX (YbbN) that, when activated via <italic>N</italic>-chlorination, binds to and prevents a variety of substrates from aggregation and being irreversible oxidized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Goemans et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>While HOCl is highly bactericidal, generation of HOCl by immune cells is not without risk to the human body itself (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Pechous, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Thieblemont et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Klebanoff, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Davies, 2011</xref>). During inflammatory processes, up to 30% of total cellular MPO is secreted by neutrophils into extracellular surroundings via degranulation, leakage during phagocytosis, or by association with NETs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Parker et al., 2012</xref>). Neutrophils, accumulated in the interstitial fluid of inflamed tissues, have been reported to generate HOCl at concentrations of up to 25–50 mM/hr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Summers et al., 2008</xref>). It is thus not surprising that HOCl can also drastically increase the activity of the extracellular chaperone α<sub>2</sub>-macroglobulin (α<sub>2</sub>M) in human blood plasma to counteract the aggregation of host proteins under hypochlorous acid stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Wyatt et al., 2014</xref>). However, the underlying molecular mechanism of HOCl-mediated conversion of this plasma protein is still unclear.</p><p>And while neutrophils produce high amounts of HOCl, it does not accumulate at those levels, as it reacts instantly with diverse biological molecules including proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hawkins et al., 2003</xref>), DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Prütz, 1996</xref>), cholesterol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Carr et al., 1996</xref>) and lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Winterbourn et al., 1992</xref>). But due to their high abundance in blood and interstitial fluid, human serum albumin (HSA) and other plasma proteins are considered the major targets of HOCl-mediated damage and as such constitute the main sink for HOCl in the vicinity of inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Shao et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Peng et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Colombo et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Himmelfarb and McMonagle, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Fogh-Andersen et al., 1995</xref>). The resulting products of the reaction of plasma proteins with hypochlorous acid, known as advanced oxidation protein products (AOPPs), have, therefore, been employed as in vivo markers of chronic inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Witko-Sarsat et al., 1996</xref>). Accumulation of AOPPs has been first discovered in patients with chronic kidney disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Witko-Sarsat et al., 1996</xref>) and later also found in a variety of other inflammatory diseases, for example cardiovascular disease, neurodegenerative disorders, rheumatoid arthritis and some cancers (recently reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aratani, 2018</xref>).</p><p>To date, a number of studies have been carried out to elucidate the role of AOPPs in inflammatory processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Colombo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Liu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Descamps-Latscha et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Witko-Sarsat et al., 2003</xref>). Accumulating experimental evidence supports a critical contribution of AOPPs to the progression of inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Liu et al., 2006</xref>). HOCl-modified HSA accumulates in inflammatory diseases and was found to act as proinflammatory mediator by increasing oxidative stress and inflammation through stimulation of leukocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Witko-Sarsat et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Gorudko, 2014</xref>).</p><p>Based on these findings, we hypothesized that reversible <italic>N</italic>-chlorination in response to HOCl-stress could be the principal chemical modification contributing to the observed physiological properties of AOPPs. Furthermore, as we observed in previous studies that the HSA homologue bovine serum albumin (BSA) could be transformed into a chaperone-like holdase by HOCl-treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Müller et al., 2014</xref>), we speculated that <italic>N</italic>-chlorination serves as general rather than specific mechanism to transform certain proteins into a chaperone-like state.</p><p>Here, we study the effects of reversible <italic>N</italic>-chlorination on the function of human plasma proteins. We show that, upon <italic>N</italic>-chlorination, not only α<sub>2</sub>M, but all plasma fractions tested, exhibit chaperone-like activity and as such could prevent the HOCl-induced formation of protein aggregates at the site of inflammation. Moreover, exposure to HOCl at concentrations present in chronically inflamed tissues turned the majority of plasma proteins into efficient activators of neutrophil-like cells. Previous studies revealed that HOCl-treated HSA can stimulate leukocytes to produce more ROS during inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Gorudko, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Witko-Sarsat et al., 1998</xref>). Now we find that reversible <italic>N</italic>-chlorination is the main chemical modification that mediates the activation of NADPH oxidase-dependent ROS generation by immune cells by AOPPs. Finally, we show that HOCl-modified HSA is a pro-survival factor for immune cells and protects neutrophils from cell death by highly immunogenic antigens.</p><p>Our data strongly suggest that in vivo reversible <italic>N</italic>-chlorination of human plasma proteins not only converts them into effective chaperone-like holdases but is also the principal mechanism that turns these proteins into mediators of the innate immune system.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>HOCl-treated human serum prevents protein aggregation</title><p>In previous experiments, we showed that the bacterial protein RidA is transformed into a competent holdase-type chaperone upon treatment with HOCl or <italic>N</italic>-chloramine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Müller et al., 2014</xref>). In control experiments, we discovered that bovine serum albumin also shows increased chaperone activity in response to HOCl (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Müller et al., 2014</xref>). Since HOCl can be present in a physio-pathological context, most notably in the vicinity of inflammation, we wanted to test if human serum proteins can also be transformed into holdase-type chaperones through HOCl-treatment. Thus, we performed aggregation assays using chemically denatured citrate synthase and untreated and HOCl-treated human serum. Human serum was incubated with an estimated 10-fold molar excess of HOCl for 10 min at 30°C, a concentration that was sufficient to fully activate or markedly improve the chaperone function of RidA and BSA, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Müller et al., 2014</xref>). When chemically denatured citrate synthase was diluted into denaturant-free buffer, it formed aggregates that can be monitored by increased light scattering of the solution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). This aggregation of citrate synthase was not prevented by the addition of untreated human serum. However, when pre-incubated with a 10-fold molar excess of HOCl, serum significantly decreased aggregate formation. This suggested to us, that at least some serum proteins could be transformed to a holdase-type chaperone by <italic>N</italic>-chlorination in a mechanism similar to RidA. Because <italic>N</italic>-chlorination can be reduced by certain antioxidants, we used ascorbate to re-reduce HOCl-treated serum. Ascorbate is a mild antioxidant, which typically does not reduce native or HOCl-induced disulfide bonds. This ascorbate-treated serum lost its capability to bind denatured citrate synthase, suggesting an <italic>N-</italic>chlorination-based mechanism.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.47395.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>HOCl-treated human serum decreases protein aggregation.</title><p>Human serum, when treated with a 10-fold molar excess of HOCl (Human serum <sub>10xHOCl</sub>), significantly decreases aggregation of chemically denatured citrate synthase as measured by light scattering at 360 nm. Reduction of HOCl-treated human serum with a 50-fold molar excess of the antioxidant ascorbate (Human serum <sub>10xHOCl/Asc</sub>) reverses this chaperone-like conversion of the serum.

Previously, we showed that its bovine homologue bovine serum albumin (BSA) exhibits increased chaperone activity upon treatment with HOCl (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Müller et al., 2014</xref>). We therefore suspected that HSA could be a major contributor to the observed decrease in protein aggregate formation in the presence of HOCl-treated serum. To test whether HSA gains chaperone function upon exposure to HOCl, HSA at a final concentration of 1 mM was treated with a 10-fold molar excess of HOCl for 10 min at 30°C. An HOCl concentration of at least 10 mM has been shown to be required for the generation of significant quantities of the so-called advanced oxidation protein products (AOPPs) in plasma, associated with a number of inflammatory diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Witko-Sarsat et al., 1996</xref>). The localized concentration of HOCl generated by accumulated neutrophils in the interstitium of chronically inflamed tissues, however, can be much higher and reach values of 25–50 mM/hr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Summers et al., 2008</xref>). To mimic a state of chronic inflammation, HSA was thus also incubated in the presence of a 50-fold molar excess of HOCl corresponding to concentrations ranging from 5 mM to 50 mM, depending on the protein concentration used. The typical interstitial concentration of HSA is assumed to be around 0.3 mM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Smith and Staples, 1982</xref>), bringing a 50-fold molar excess to 15 mM, a concentration that could reasonably be expected to be reached at confined sites of inflammation based on the propensity of neutrophils to generate HOCl (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Foote et al., 1983</xref>). HSA treated in these ways significantly reduced the aggregation of citrate synthase, showing that HSA acts as a potent chaperone in serum upon modification by HOCl (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a-d</xref>). The chaperone activity of HSA was much higher upon exposure to a 50-fold molar excess of HOCl when compared to a 10-fold molar excess, suggesting a dose-dependent activation of the HSA chaperone function by HOCl. H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, another major oxidant generated by neutrophils, and a substrate for myeloperoxidase, did not convert HSA into a chaperone-like holdase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e,f</xref>). The chaperone activity of HSA was not dependent on the substrate protein: HOCl-treated HSA also prevented the aggregation of IlvA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). In contrast to bacterial RidA and Hsp33 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Müller et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Winter et al., 2008</xref>), full activation of the chaperone function of HSA seems to require a higher oxidation/chlorination level of the protein.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.47395.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Conversion of serum albumin into a potent chaperone upon HOCl exposure is based on reversible <italic>N</italic>-chlorination of its basic amino acids.</title><p>(<bold>a, b</bold>) Serum albumin in different concentrations, when treated with a 10- or 50-fold molar excess of HOCl (HSA <sub>10xHOCl</sub> and HSA <sub>50xHOCl</sub>, respectively), significantly decreases aggregation of chemically denatured citrate synthase as measured by light scattering at 360 nm.

Such irreversibly misfolded plasma proteins could principally act as chaperones and bind to and prevent the aggregation of other unfolding substrates through hydrophobic interactions with the newly exposed hydrophobic protein surfaces.</p><p>However, based on the observation that the chaperone activity of serum albumin increased in a dose-dependent manner with the quantity of HOCl added, we asked whether the activation of HSA chaperone function upon treatment with a 10- or 50-fold molar excess of HOCl could be mediated by reversible <italic>N</italic>-chlorination instead. We have found this mechanism of action in the bacterial protein RidA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Müller et al., 2014</xref>). We thus exposed HOCl-treated HSA to a 50-fold molar excess of the antioxidant ascorbate, which specifically removes <italic>N</italic>-chlorination.

Methionine, another known reducing agent for <italic>N-</italic>chloramines showed a similar effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>).

Because ascorbate could, in theory, also reduce certain transient thiol modifications such as sulfenylation or sulfenylchlorides, and because HSA contains a single non-disulfide-bound cysteine that could potentially undergo those modifications, we wanted to corroborate our hypothesis further. Thus, we blocked free amino groups of lysine and nitrogens in the guanidino-moiety of arginine residues in HSA via selective methylation. Exposure of methylated HSA to 10- or 50-fold molar excess of HOCl did not convert HSA into a chaperone, suggesting that activation of the HSA chaperone function indeed requires chlorination of its basic amino acids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2i,j</xref>). Analysis of HSA treated with HOCl and different reductants on reducing and non-reducing SDS gels did not reveal formation of an HSA dimer linked by an intermolecular disulfide bond nor did it show evidence that ascorbate or methionine was able to reduce HSA’s intrinsic disulfides, whereas DTT reduction led to an observable migration shift (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Decreased amino group content of HSA upon HOCl treatment is accompanied by an increased overall hydrophobicity of the protein</title><p>Our combined data strongly suggested that the chaperone function of HSA is activated by chlorination of its basic amino acids. HSA in its secreted form possesses 59 primary amines in the form of sidechains of lysine, which could act as targets for chlorination by HOCl. There are an additional 24 arginine residues, which contain a guanidino group, as well as 16 histidines and one tryptophane, which contain nitrogen in an aromatic ring system, and one amino group at the N-terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Temple et al., 2006</xref>), which could potentially be chlorinated as well. To exclude that simply the presence of these <italic>N</italic>-chlorinated species affects our light-scattering assay, we performed a chaperone assay in the presence of a comparable amount of taurine <italic>N</italic>-chloramine as a control. This had no effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>). To investigate the extent to which HOCl decreases the total amount of accessible, non-modified amino groups in HSA, we analyzed the free amino group content before and after HOCl-treatment using fluorescamine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Udenfriend et al., 1972</xref>). Evidently, exposure to HOCl resulted in some loss of free amino groups. Amino group content of HSA decreased by approximately 10% after treatment with a 10-fold molar excess of HOCl (HSA <sub>10xHOCl</sub>) and by 40% upon exposure to a 50-fold molar excess of HOCl (HSA <sub>50xHOCl</sub>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a,b</xref>). Reduction of both chlorinated HSA samples with ascorbate resulted in a full recovery of accessible amino groups with concomitant loss of chaperone activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2g,h</xref>).

Pretreatment with the broad-spectrum pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK did not significantly affect Ag85B-induced cell death, suggesting that Ag85B exerts its lethal effect through a caspase-independent mechanism. To test whether the toxicity of Ag85B depends on its uptake by the immune cells, we pretreated the cells with cytochalasin D, an inhibitor of phagocytosis, prior to the addition of Ag85B. Reduction of the cells’ phagocytic capacity resulted in markedly improved cell survival in the presence of Ag85B. This phenomenon is illustrated by a shift of the cells from Q3 to Q4 on the Annexin V-FITC/PI plot with concomitant reduction of necrotic cells. Remarkably, pretreatment with HOCl-modified HSA, added at a 155-fold molar excess over Ag85B, completely prevented cell death upon addition of Ag85B. In contrast, native HSA had almost no effect on Ag85B-induced cell death. We thus speculated that HOCl-treated HSA could rescue immune cells from Ag85B-induced cell death by preventing or strongly reducing its uptake, rather than by boosting PI3K/Akt signaling. In support of this conclusion, Z-VAD-FMK, but not HOCl-treated HSA was able to significantly reduce staurosporine-induced apoptosis. Instead, when combined with staurosporine, HOCl-modified HSA triggered necrosis with the majority of the cells being Annexin V and PI positive.</p></sec><sec id="s2-11"><title>HOCl-treated serum albumin effectively binds Ag85B and reduces its uptake by neutrophil-like cells</title><p>Prompted by the finding that HOCl-treated HSA can act as a chaperone being highly effective at preventing protein aggregation, we asked whether <italic>N</italic>-chlorinated HSA can also bind to Ag85B and thus prevent its uptake by immune cells.

These proteins are highly effective at preventing formation of potentially toxic protein aggregates in vitro. The role of plasma proteins in inflamed tissue thus goes beyond that of a passive sink for HOCl.</p><p>Since exposure to high HOCl concentrations can lead to oxidative, irreversible protein unfolding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Heinecke et al., 1993</xref>), one might speculate that the observed chaperone activity of such unfolded plasma proteins could simply be the result of an increased affinity to other unfolded proteins. Here, we provide direct evidence that HOCl-mediated conversion of plasma proteins into potent chaperones depends primarily on reversible chlorination of their basic amino acids. Along this line, treatment of HSA with HOCl led to dose-dependent reduction of the accessible amino group content accompanied by an increase in <italic>N</italic>-chloramine content and surface hydrophobicity, providing an obvious explanation for the increased affinity to unfolding proteins of <italic>N</italic>-chlorinated plasma proteins. Since <italic>N</italic>-chlorination does not irreversibly alter the structural and functional properties of a protein, this reversible post-translational modification provides a new strategy to recruit new chaperone-like proteins on demand in response to HOCl-stress in order to minimize self-damage associated with the formation of protein aggregates during inflammation.</p><p>In recent years, other roles for HOCl-modified plasma proteins and lipoproteins in inflammatory processes have also been described. For example, HOCl-oxidized low-density lipoproteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kopprasch et al., 1998</xref>), as well as HOCl-modified HSA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Gorudko, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Witko-Sarsat et al., 1998</xref>) have been shown to elicit various polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMNL) responses such as the NADPH-dependent generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), degranulation or shape change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Gorudko, 2014</xref>), but the mechanism for the HOCl-mediated functional conversion into a potent activator of human PMNLs remained unclear.</p><p>As <italic>N</italic>-chlorination was the principal chemical modification responsible for the plasma protein’s switch to a chaperone-like holdase, we hypothesized that it could also be the reason for the activation of immune cells. To mimic an in vivo situation, where plasma proteins are located in immediate vicinity to accumulated neutrophils in inflamed tissue, we exposed several plasma fractions to HOCl at pathophysiological concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Summers et al., 2008</xref>) and investigated the effect of the resulting products on ROS production by neutrophil-like cells. Remarkably, we found that not only the main plasma protein HSA, but the majority of plasma fractions tested, when treated with a sufficient amount of HOCl, were able to elicit a significant immune response, as shown by the increased generation of ROS by the immune cells. This effect was not seen upon re-reduction of the HOCl-modified proteins or prior methylation of their basic amino acids, strongly supporting an <italic>N</italic>-chlorination based mechanism as well. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study which demonstrates that reversible HOCl-mediated <italic>N</italic>-chlorination is the principal mechanism of turning plasma proteins into critical modulators of the innate immune response.</p><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Gorudko (2014)</xref> reported that the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor wortmannin inhibited the stimulating effect of HOCl-modified HSA on immune cells. The same was true in our model system: the immunomodulatory action of both HOCl-modified HSA and immunoglobulin G could be fully inhibited or strongly attenuated by wortmannin. PI3K and its downstream effectors, such as the serine/threonine kinase Akt, are indeed considered to play a key role in the regulation of the neutrophil NADPH oxidase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kennedy and DeLeo, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hawkins et al., 2007</xref>). Since the PKC inhibitor Gö 6983 showed only little effect on HSA <sub>50xHOCl</sub>- and IgG <sub>150xHOCl</sub>-mediated NADPH oxidase activation, we thus propose that these proteins stimulate the neutrophil respiratory burst predominantly via PI3K-dependent signaling pathways. However, further studies are needed to investigate the exact mechanism by which these proteins trigger PI3K signaling. A possible scenario might be, that <italic>N</italic>-chlorination confers higher affinity to a membrane scavenger receptor allowing the binding of HOCl-modified HSA. In support of this theory, it has been reported that <italic>N</italic>-chlorinated, but not native HSA can irreversibly bind to and block the major high-density lipoprotein receptor, scavenger receptor class B, type 1 (SR-BI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Binder et al., 2013</xref>). It is therefore tempting to speculate that <italic>N</italic>-chlorination could also increase the affinity of IgG to Fc gamma receptors (FcγRs).</p><p>The PI3K/Akt pathway is also considered an anti-apoptotic pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Zhuang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chang et al., 2003</xref>). Thus, it was tempting to hypothesize that HOCl-modified HSA may play a role as a pro-survival molecule during inflammation. Remarkably, we found that HOCl-modified HSA indeed enhances survival of neutrophils in the presence of the highly immunogenic mycobacterial protein antigen Ag85B, however, not in the presence of staurosporine, a broad-spectrum protein kinase inhibitor that induces apoptosis in various cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chae et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Zhang et al., 2004</xref>). Looking for a mechanism by which HOCl-modified HSA is able to rescue immune cells from Ag85B-induced cell death, we found that it can effectively bind to and strongly decrease the phagocytosis of Ag85B. Internalization of Ag85B by the cells proved to be the direct cause of cell death and could also be prevented by other inhibitors of phagocytosis.</p><p>Neutrophils are typically short-lived, but their apoptosis can be delayed both by microbial products and by various proinflammatory stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lee et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Colotta et al., 1992</xref>). In this study, we describe HOCl-modified HSA as a novel pro-inflammatory mediator, which can promote cell survival by binding to highly immunogenic foreign antigens and reducing their phagocytosis at sites of bacterial infection. A similar phenomenon was observed in other studies, where HOCl-modified HSA was shown to bind and neutralize proteins from HIV and West Nile virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Vossmann et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Speth et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>The immunomodulatory effects of <italic>N-</italic>chlorinated plasma proteins found in this and previous studies constitute a double-edged sword. Although stimulation of neutrophil respiratory burst and enhanced neutrophil survival may be beneficial for pathogen elimination at the initial stage of infection, it can eventually perpetuate a positive feedback loop and contribute to the development and progression of chronic inflammation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). Secretion of HOCl and other oxidants by permanently activated neutrophils leads not only to the destruction of neighboring, healthy cells resulting in tissue injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Pechous, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Weiss, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Margaroli et al., 2019</xref>), but generates more <italic>N</italic>-chlorinated plasma proteins. Similarly, the pro-survival effect of <italic>N</italic>-chlorinated HSA is not only positive, as cell death and the subsequent recognition of dying neutrophils by macrophages has a critical function in the resolution of the inflammatory response and is strictly required to protect the surrounding tissue and prevent pathological sequelae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Erwig and Henson, 2007</xref>). Were all these properties of AOPPs dependent on the numerous irreversible modifications reportedly caused by HOCl exposure, this could lead to a spreading out-of-control immune reaction. The presence of antioxidants such as ascorbate and glutathione in plasma, both of which can reduce <italic>N</italic>-chlorination, provide a mechanism to contain the immune reaction at the site of inflammation. While these antioxidants are probably quickly depleted in the direct vicinity of an acute inflammation, they could inactivate <italic>N</italic>-chlorinated plasma proteins that escape the site of inflammation, if present in sufficient quantity. Indeed, depletion of these antioxidants is often associated with chronic inflammation and other diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bonham et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Ruan et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Huijskens et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Rose et al., 2012</xref>) and antioxidant therapy such as high-dose intravenous vitamin C treatment leads to decrease of inflammation markers such as CRP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Mikirova et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Carr and Cook, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Block et al., 2009</xref>).

For the construction of a monochloramine standard curve, taurine monochloramine was diluted in 1x PBS to a final concentration of 10, 20, 30 and 40 μM. Subsequently, 1 mL of these dilutions was rapidly mixed with 250 μL developing reagent composed of 2 mM 3,3’,5,5’-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis) and 100 μM sodium iodide (Sigma-Aldrich) in 400 mM acetate buffer, pH 5.4, containing 10% (v/v) dimethylformamide (Sigma-Aldrich).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Satyajit Rath as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Tony Kettle (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript reports on the role of HOCl-modification of HSA and other plasma proteins and the potential role of the resulting N-chlorinated materials as chaperones that can prevent the aggregation of other proteins, act as survival signaling molecules for activated neutrophils and also as stimulators of neutrophil oxidant production. The paper is very interesting, with potentially important findings.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The major concern is the concentration of HOCl used to treat the proteins investigated. The authors use very high levels of HOCl – up to 50 mM, and justify these levels referring to Summers et al., 2008. However, we did not find definitive information in this paper for concentrations of &gt; 15 mM in plasma and at sites of inflammation. Furthermore the levels quoted, are for the concentration of HOCl generated over a long period, rather than a bolus addition as used here. Thus, 50 mM seems extreme and may be misleading. It is questionable that at sites of inflammation, oxygen supply could be maintained to fuel HOCl production. Rather, it is likely that at such rates of HOCl production, sites of inflammation would become rapidly anaerobic.</p><p>At the doses used in the current study, there will be high levels of chlorination of tyrosine residues in human serum albumin (Kettle FEBS Letters 1996). These levels are well above what is found in proteins in lavage fluid from children with cystic fibrosis, which have the highest reported levels of 3-chlorotyrosine. Thus the authors should justify the doses of HOCl used and use a more extensive dose range with respect to test the proposed functions of chlorinated proteins.</p><p>2. Also relating to the dose of HOCl used, is that the levels of chloramines on the proteins are likely to be very high.

This conclusion is based, in part, on the fact that serum proteins lose their chaperone activity following treatment with ascorbate, an antioxidant that &quot;typically does not reduce native or HOC-induced disulfide bond&quot;. However, this is not shown directly. And no reference is provided to support that &quot;the antioxidant ascorbate specifically removes N-chlorination&quot;. The authors also base their conclusions on the fact that methylation of basic residues prevents the HOCl-induced activation. However, given the importance that N-chlorination plays in this paper, direct evidence must be provided, for instance using mass-spectrometry to identify the N-chlorinated residues and to show the reversibility of this modification by ascorbate.</p><p>What is the evidence that it does not reduce HOCl-induced disulfide bonds?</p><p>8) The authors assume that ascorbate and Met remove all the chloramines formed, but do not measure this.

The authors use very high levels of HOCl – up to 50 mM, and justify these levels referring to Summers et al., 2008. However, we did not find definitive information in this paper for concentrations of &gt; 15 mM in plasma and at sites of inflammation. Furthermore the levels quoted, are for the concentration of HOCl generated over a long period, rather than a bolus addition as used here. Thus, 50 mM seems extreme and may be misleading. It is questionable that at sites of inflammation, oxygen supply could be maintained to fuel HOCl production. Rather, it is likely that at such rates of HOCl production, sites of inflammation would become rapidly anaerobic.</p><p>At the doses used in the current study, there will be high levels of chlorination of tyrosine residues in human serum albumin (Kettle FEBS Letters 1996). These levels are well above what is found in proteins in lavage fluid from children with cystic fibrosis, which have the highest reported levels of 3-chlorotyrosine. Thus the authors should justify the doses of HOCl used and use a more extensive dose range with respect to test the proposed functions of chlorinated proteins.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for their comment. We now tested a more extensive dose range with concentrations suggested by the reviewers. At concentrations of 0.3 mM HSA (as they are expected in the interstitial space) and 15 mM HOCl concentration, we still saw full activation. The same is true for even lower concentrations of HSA and HOCl, as long as the molar excess of HOCl is between 10- to 50-fold. As HSA, by sheer abundance, is probably a major sink for HOCl, we would like to propose that these experiments mimic an inflammatory situation where the presence of a large number of neutrophils would lead to high local HOCl concentrations in a confined space. Without significant circulation in this space and thus no appreciable exchange of serum proteins, over time the serum proteins such as HSA could be exposed to these HOCl concentrations. This new data is now presented in Figure 2A and B and subsection “Albumin, the major protein component of serum, shows HOCl-induced chaperone-like activity” We hope this satisfies the reviewers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Also relating to the dose of HOCl used, is that the levels of chloramines on the proteins are likely to be very high. However, these have not been measured in the current work and that is a clear weakness. The authors should measure the concentration of protein chloramines formed when proteins are treated with HOCl (see Dypbukt et al., 2005).</p></disp-quote><p>Although we indirectly determined N-chlorination by determining the reversible loss of amino groups using a fluorescamine assay (see Figure 3A and B), we have now determined the chloramines directly using the assay described by Dypbukt et al. These results have been added to Figure 3C and D and the first paragraph of the subsection “Decreased amino group content of HSA upon HOCl treatment is accompanied by an increased overall hydrophobicity of the protein”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Given the likely high concentration of protein chloramines in this study, it is possible that chloramine reactivity is responsible for the observed effects. Therefore, the authors should use taurine chloramine as a control to establish whether the effects they observe are due to protein chloramines or simply just chloramines.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now performed the requested control experiments. Neither TauNCl nor TauNCl<sub>2</sub> at concentrations corresponding up to the maximum number of potentially reversible N-chlorination sites in HSA had any influence on the chaperone or immune cell activation assay. These results are now briefly mentioned in the first paragraph of the subsection “Decreased amino group content of HSA upon HOCl treatment is accompanied by an increased overall hydrophobicity of the protein” and in the fifth paragraph of the subsection “Activation of neutrophil-like cells by HOCl-treated serum albumin is based on reversible N-chlorination”, and have been added to Figure 2—figure supplement 4 and Figure 4—figure supplement 3, but we are perfectly happy to add them to the main manuscript, if the reviewers or editors deem it appropriate.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) With respect to the chaperone activity of chlorinated proteins, it would be prudent to use another method for following protein aggregation since it is possible that chloramine reactivity affects light scattering in ways other than preventing aggregation of proteins.</p></disp-quote><p>With the control experiments using TauNCl mentioned above, we now show that chloramine reactivity does not affect our light scattering experiments. We hope that satisfies the reviewers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) With respect to the stimulation of oxidant production by neutrophil-like cells, it is possible that the observed effects are due to the reactivity of added chloramines with the probes used to measure oxidant production. Therefore, in every instance the authors should use taurine chloramine as a control to demonstrate that minimal signal is coming from the reaction of chloramine with their probe.</p></disp-quote><p>We had already tested this possibility by adding HSA<sub>HOCl</sub> as a chloramine directly to Lucigenin in the absence of cells (Figure 4B). We mentioned this in the Results section and showed that H<sub>2</sub>DCF-DA, another probe often used in such experiments, indeed reacts with HSA<sub>HOCl</sub> in the supplements (now Figure 4 —figure supplement 2). To further clarify, we now also refer to the above mentioned TauNCl control experiment in the fifth paragraph of the subsection “Activation of neutrophil-like cells by HOCl-treated serum albumin is based on reversible N-chlorination”,.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) To demonstrate that protein chloramines activate the NADPH oxidase in cells, in every case, controls should be performed whereby cells are treated with DPI, superoxide dismutase, catalase, or superoxide dismutase and catalase. These controls should establish whether oxidation of the probe results from activation of the NADPH oxidase and subsequent production of superoxide and hydrogen peroxide.</p></disp-quote><p>We already did the suggested experiment in the presence of DPI (see Figure 7), but we now also do the control experiments in the presence of SOD, catalase, and both SOD and catalase. The experiments show the expected results and are now presented in Figure 7—figure supplement 1 and mentioned in the fourth paragraph of the subsection “Activation of NADPH oxidase by N-chlorinated serum albumin and immunoglobulin G occurs predominantly via PI3K-dependent signaling pathways”. As above, we are perfectly happy to add the figures to the main manuscript, if the reviewers or editors deem it appropriate.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Another major concern is that the authors fail to unambiguously demonstrate that HOCl turns serum proteins into chaperones via the N-chlorination of positively charged residues. This conclusion is based, in part, on the fact that serum proteins lose their chaperone activity following treatment with ascorbate, an antioxidant that &quot;typically does not reduce native or HOC-induced disulfide bond&quot;. However, this is not shown directly. And no reference is provided to support that &quot;the antioxidant ascorbate specifically removes N-chlorination&quot;. The authors also base their conclusions on the fact that methylation of basic residues prevents the HOCl-induced activation. However, given the importance that N-chlorination plays in this paper, direct evidence must be provided, for instance using mass-spectrometry to identify the N-chlorinated residues and to show the reversibility of this modification by ascorbate. What is the evidence that it does not reduce HOCl-induced disulfide bonds?</p></disp-quote><p>Full-length MS with such large proteins is not feasible in our lab. HSA is particularly challenging, as it contains a number of different modifications and thus does not easily resolve into a “single” peak, as e.g. the much smaller RidA does. MS of peptides is complicated by the instability of the modification in question (standard proteolytic digestion protocols typically include DTT as a reducing agent) and the fact that Arg and Lys are modified, both amino acids recognized and required for trypsin cleavage, the most commonly used protease in MS. We are currently working on an MS labeling approach, but we feel that this goes beyond the scope of this manuscript. The effects that these modifications have, are reversible by ascorbate (Figures 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), can be prevented by prior methylation of amino groups (Figures 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), elevate the hydrophobicity of the protein (Figure 3), we now show that they are additionally reversible by methionine (Figure 3, Figure 2—figure supplement 2), we now show that HOCl-treated HSA indeed contains N-chloramines (Figure 3C, D), we additionally demonstrate that no appreciable amount of intermolecular disulfides is formed between the sole accessible thiol and that DTT reduces intermolecular disulfides, while ascorbate does not under the conditions we used in our experiments (Figure 2—figure supplement 3). Unless the reviewers give us a specific hypothesis that we could test against, we cannot come up with any modification other than N-chlorination of positively charged residues that could explain the observed effects. Our new results are mentioned throughout the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) The authors assume that ascorbate and Met remove all the chloramines formed, but do not measure this. Chloramines are relatively easy to quantify, so it is not clear why this has not been done (see for example the work of Hawkins with proteins, and also plasma). A decomposed chloramine control should also be examined (in addition to the reduced control) as the decomposed species (carbonyls etc.) may also have effects.</p></disp-quote><p>We now performed the suggested experiment and determined the amount of chloramines in HSA after treatment with HOCl and after reduction with ascorbate (see above). We hope this convinces the reviewers that indeed almost all chloramines are removed by ascorbate. We feel that testing effects of decomposition species is beyond the scope of our study. However, we think that our data shows, that decomposition species are either not formed at significant amounts in HSA under the conditions tested (as suggested by the data in Figure 3C and D: full restoration of amino groups by ascorbate reduction, no detectable chloramines left), or, if they are formed and we misinterpret the data, they do not play a role in the physiological effects observed: both chaperone activity and immune cell activation are reversed by ascorbate (Figures 1, 4). Decomposition products should not be reverted by ascorbate, and if they were present and/or had an effect, we should see activity, but we do not.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) It would also be interesting to include more control experiments, for instance to show that exposing albumin or other plasma proteins to oxidants such as H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> does not mimic treatment with HOCl, and to show that the N-chlorinated proteins work as chaperones for at least a second substrate (and not only with citrate synthase).</p></disp-quote><p>We have now tested hydrogen peroxide, it does not mimic HOCl treatment (Figure 2E and F). We had already tested chaperone activity with Ag85B (Figure 9A and B), but we now also include IlvA, another substrate that works in chaperone assays (Müller et al., 2014) (Figure 2—figure supplement 1). We mention these new results in the subsection” Albumin, the major protein component of serum, shows HOCl-induced chaperone-like activity”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10)The authors assume that ascorbate only removes N-chlorinated species on the HOCl-modified proteins. Other transients such as sulfenyl chlorides and sulfenic acids, which are also formed by HOCl, are also reactive with ascorbate.</p></disp-quote><p>While sulfenyl chlorides and sulfenic acids could react with ascorbate, we do not think that this is the case in our experiments for several reasons: both of those modifications are highly unstable and it is not likely that they would exist for as long as our experiments last. Additionally, in HSA, with which we performed most of the experiments, there is only one cysteine available that could potentially form such a modification (all other cysteines are engaged in structural disulfides), however, to see meaningful effects, we need a certain molar excess of HOCl. Furthermore, N-methylation would not prevent these modifications from happening and we should still see activation of the proteins by HOCl. We however now discuss this possibility in the subsection “Methylation of basic amino acid residues in serum albumin inhibits HOCl-induced activation of its chaperone function”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) There are likely to be significant modifications of other residues such as disulfides, Trp and Tyr residues on the modified proteins. Some of the species may also give rise to reducible species (e.g. N-Cl species formed at the indolyl nitrogen of Trp).</p></disp-quote><p>As the reviewers point out, most of these modifications are irreversible. We do not argue that they do not exist, we just argue that they are mostly irrelevant: reduction by ascorbate removes the effects pointing clearly to a reversible modification. We do not observe appreciable amounts of other hypothetically reversible modifications such as disulfide bonds on a non-reducing gel (Figure 2—figure supplement 3). We now discuss that Nitrogen-Heteroatoms in the organic ring systems of Trp and His could potentially be chlorinated as well (subsection “Decreased amino group content of HSA upon HOCl treatment is accompanied by an increased overall hydrophobicity of the protein”). However, in case of tryptophan, reactions with HOCl seem to favor the C3 or C7 position in the ring and not the nitrogen (Fu et al. 2006, “Specific Sequence Motifs Direct the Oxygenation and Chlorination of Tryptophan by Myeloperoxidase” Biochemistry 45(12): 3961-3971, Dong et al. 2005 “The structure of tryptophan 7-halogenase (PrnA) suggests a mechanism for regioselective chlorination” Science 309 (5744): 2216-2219). Both His and Trp are present in much lower abundance in HSA.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) Regarding the experimental part on neutrophils: why were the experiments not carried out on fresh neutrophils from blood? Alternatively, but less ideal would be testing different myeloid cell lines to show that the effect is not specific of the PLB-985 cell line.</p></disp-quote><p>We currently do not have an ethics vote on experiments with human specimens. However, these experiments have essentially been done in other studies (although without providing a mechanism for the observations), which we mention in our Introduction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13) The method used to generate the methylated proteins is not referenced or validated, and there is no assessment of the extent of modification of the basic residues present on the proteins. This is essential information, as is evidence that only Lys and Arg are affected.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for pointing out our oversight. We now provide the reference (Rypniewski et al., 1993) in the subsection “Methylation of proteins”. Protein N-Methylation is a method widely used in crystallography in order to be able to crystallize challenging proteins. There are commercial kits based on this methodology. As such, selective methylation was often verified in crystallographic studies based on the X-ray structure. We hope this convinces the reviewers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>14) A final major issue is that the statistical analyses are inappropriate: Student's t-tests as used here are not suited for multiple comparisons.</p></disp-quote><p>We want to clarify that we only apply the t-test to compare two groups in each instance (the two groups bracketed in the bar graphs). This was not done post-hoc but very much hypothesis driven (i.e. we did not randomly perform experiments and then performed t-tests over all groups and then cherry-picked “significant” results). As an example, Figure 4C: as we assumed that N-chlorination is the modification causing the effects, we expected that ascorbate reduction would reverse the effects, so we performed a t-test comparing groups “HSA <sub>50xHOCl</sub>” and “HSA <sub>50xHOCl/Asc</sub>”. As prior methylation of basic amino acids should have the same effect as ascorbate reduction, we did not compare the two groups “HSA <sub>50xHOCl/Asc</sub>” and “HSA <sub>Met/50xHOCl</sub>”. Thus, we feel our use of the t-test is appropriate and others concur: Rothmann 1990, “No adjustments are needed for multiple comparisons.” Epidemiology 1(1): 43-46. We hope this satisfies the reviewers. Using a large part of the scientific literature as our guide, we found that our use of the t-test is very much customary, thus we currently do not justify it in the manuscript, however, we are happy to add a justification (e.g. above mentioned reference) to the manuscript, if the reviewers or editors deem it necessary.</p></body></sub-article></article>
