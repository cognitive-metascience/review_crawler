Twelve subunits of the portal protein define a tunnel, through which DNA is translocated into the capsid. It is unknown how the portal protein functions as a gatekeeper, preventing DNA slippage, whilst allowing its passage into the capsid, and how these processes are controlled. A cryo-EM structure of the portal protein of thermostable virus P23-45, determined in situ in its procapsid-bound state, indicates a mechanism that naturally safeguards the virus against genome loss. This occurs via an inversion of the conformation of the loops that define the constriction in the central tunnel, accompanied by a hydrophilic–hydrophobic switch. The structure also shows how translocation of DNA into the capsid could be modulated by a changing mode of protein–protein interactions between portal and capsid, across a symmetry-mismatched interface.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>portal protein</kwd><kwd>virus assembly</kwd><kwd>DNA packaging</kwd><kwd>cryo-EM</kwd><kwd>bacteriophage</kwd><kwd>symmetry mismatch</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Virus</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>103460</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bayfield</surname><given-names>Oliver W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>206377</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Antson</surname><given-names>Alfred A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000069</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Intramural Research Program</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Steven</surname><given-names>Alasdair C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>103460</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bayfield</surname><given-names>Oliver W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Structure of the portal protein of a thermostable virus, determined in its capsid-bound state, reveals a molecular mechanism that prevents DNA slippage during genome packaging.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Tailed bacteriophages constitute the majority of viruses in the biosphere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bergh et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Michaud et al., 2018</xref>) and are a significant component of the human microbiome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Shkoporov and Hill, 2019</xref>). During assembly, these viruses translocate their genomic double-stranded DNA through a portal protein that occupies a single vertex of an icosahedral capsid. A similar mechanism is employed by the evolutionarily related herpesviruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">McElwee et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Trus et al., 2004</xref>). Structural information about the portal protein is important not only for deducing the mechanism of capsid assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2011</xref>), but also for understanding molecular events associated with genome translocation into preformed capsids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Mao et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Sun et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Sun et al., 2008</xref>), and genome ejection during infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Wu et al., 2016</xref>). Although structures of isolated portal proteins, without the native capsid environment, have been determined to near-atomic resolution by X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Lebedev et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lokareddy et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Simpson et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Sun et al., 2015</xref>), a number of observations concerning these structures have yet to be rationalised in the context of the portal’s many functional roles, including: the variable diameter of the central tunnel and flexibility of tunnel loops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Lebedev et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Simpson et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Sun et al., 2015</xref>); the symmetry mismatch between the portal and capsid vertex (12-fold versus 5-fold) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Simpson et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Sun et al., 2008</xref>); and the portal’s role in DNA translocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Harvey, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ray et al., 2010</xref>). The influence of the properties of the internal tunnel, and how these can be modulated by external factors to coordinate DNA translocation, remains unclear. Cryo-EM studies on mesophilic herpesviruses characterised the shape of the portal protein tunnel in the mature virion and showed how DNA can be locked inside (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Liu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">McElwee et al., 2018</xref>). However, there are no detailed structural data on portal proteins in situ for unexpanded capsids, primed for DNA packaging. Moreover, it has proven difficult to derive accurate models for tunnel loops of the portal protein, such as in the case of tailed bacteriophage φ29, where the flexible nature of the tunnel loops prevented their observation in a crystal structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Simpson et al., 2000</xref>) and also in cryo-EM structures of the procapsid and mature capsid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Xu et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>To gain knowledge about the structure of the dynamic DNA tunnel, we utilised a thermostable bacteriophage, P23-45. Thermophilic viruses must package their genomes under extreme temperature, imposing additional challenges compared to their mesophilic counterparts. This <italic>Thermus thermophilus</italic> bacteriophage is one of the few viruses for which conditions for packaging DNA into capsids in vitro have been established, and where isolated empty capsids were demonstrated to be competent at packaging DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bayfield et al., 2019</xref>). Previous cryo-EM reconstructions of procapsids (unexpanded) and mature capsids (expanded), in which icosahedral symmetry was imposed, have revealed the extent of conformational changes that the major capsid proteins undergo upon capsid maturation. During the transition, the capacity of the capsid nearly doubles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bayfield et al., 2019</xref>). In this study, the structure of the portal protein in situ, and analysis of the reconstruction of the unexpanded procapsid without imposing icosahedral symmetry, reveal substantive conformational differences in the structure of the portal protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bayfield et al., 2019</xref>). The most remarkable difference, induced in situ, is an inversion in the conformation of tunnel loops of the portal protein. The tunnel loop inversion ‘switches’ the surface properties at the tunnel’s constriction from hydrophobic to hydrophilic and creates a wider opening. These observations indicate that the capsid shell plays a role in defining the conformation and properties of the portal protein, modulating DNA translocation into capsid.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Structure of the in situ procapsid portal</title><p>P23-45 procapsids were purified from lysates of infected <italic>Thermus thermophilus</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The procedures used for cryo-EM data collection and computing the icosahedrally averaged reconstruction were described earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bayfield et al., 2019</xref>). The in situ structure of the portal protein within the procapsid was determined by localised reconstruction of portal-containing vertices to a resolution of 3.7 Å by averaging around the 12-fold symmetric axis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ilca et al., 2015</xref>). The portal protein oligomer is a ring of 12 subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>), with each subunit folded into Crown, Wing, Stem, Clip, and Tunnel loop domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Most amino acid side-chains were clearly resolved in the map (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), enabling construction of an accurate atomic model (PDB 6QJT). Comparison with the crystal structure of the portal protein from the closely related phage G20c (PDB 6IBG, 99.3% sequence identity) reveals several significant structural differences: notably, in the positions of the Crown and Wing domains and in the conformation of the tunnel loops (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>). In the in situ structure, the C-terminal Crown domain (residues 377–436) is shifted upwards away from the main body by <italic>∼</italic>5 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>), and twisted by <italic>∼</italic>13° around the central axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>). The Wing domain pivots <italic>∼</italic>8° downwards, towards the Clip (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>). Although the two portal proteins compared are from different phages, they have closely related sequences. The most conservative substitution, I328V, is located in the tunnel, and two additional conservative substitutions, S189N and S367G, are located at the outer surface of the Wing in residues with solvent-exposed side chains. Such mutations are unlikely to bring about the observed differences in conformation.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Structure of the portal protein in situ.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Cryo-electron micrograph of P23- 45 procapsids, scale bar 50 nm.

Although the first residue with a defined conformation points towards the interior of the capsid in P23-45, it cannot be ruled out that the flexible N-terminal segment folds back and contributes to portal-capsid interactions.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Portal–capsid interactions</title><p>The portal–capsid interface is spacious, with only relatively small surface areas of the portal’s, within the Wing and Clip domains, engaged in interactions with the capsid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref>). Fitting of the C12-symmetrised portal reconstruction, presented here, into the asymmetric procapsid reconstruction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bayfield et al., 2019</xref>), reveals the details of the portal-capsid interactions at this symmetry-mismatched interface. In the asymmetric reconstruction of the procapsid, the portal protein appears 12-fold symmetric (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bayfield et al., 2019</xref>). Residues 185–189 (β-hairpin loop) of the portal Wing are involved in interactions with the capsid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). These loops may pivot downwards to make closer contact with the capsid inner wall, in select chains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B,C</xref>). Such adjustments in specific subunits of the portal protein would not be resolved in a symmetrically averaged structure; however, the bridging regions observed between the capsid and the portal in the asymmetric procapsid reconstruction suggests local deviations from C12 symmetry are possible. The portal Wing (β-hairpin loop) is in close proximity to residues 24–30 and 337–340 of the major capsid protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Interactions of the portal Clip likely involve portal protein residues 263–275 (α-helix and adjacent loop within the Clip domain) interacting with the major capsid protein residues 119–127 and 357–358 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). In common with φ29 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Simpson et al., 2000</xref>), portal-capsid interactions are mediated by residues of both polar and hydrophobic characters. The portal–capsid symmetry mismatch means that only select portal chains make contact with the capsid: these are chains A-C-(E/F)-H-J at the Wing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>), and chains C-E-(G/H)-J-L at the Clip (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>).</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Portal–capsid interactions.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Sections through the capsid reconstruction perpendicular to the portal tunnel axis, at three different heights as denoted on (<bold>C</bold>) by dashed lines.

Whereas the <italic>∼</italic>22 Å-wide hydrophilic tunnel observed in situ would allow the passage of B-form and potentially even the wider A-form DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Harvey, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ray et al., 2010</xref>) into the capsid, the more restrictive tunnel diameter of <italic>∼</italic>14 Å observed in the crystal structure requires the tunnel loops to protrude towards the DNA grooves, involving changes in the tunnel loop conformations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Lebedev et al., 2007</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Mechanism preventing DNA slippage during translocation</title><p>Based on structural observations, we propose the following mechanism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). At the start of a packaging cycle, the Crown is protruding towards capsid and hence the tunnel is open for DNA translocation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) and its internal surface is hydrophilic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). As shown for the φ29 system, DNA is expected to be translocated in bursts followed by dwell intervals, serving to reset the motor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chistol et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Moffitt et al., 2009</xref>). When the packaging driving force is removed, as when the motor is resetting to bind ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Feiss and Rao, 2012</xref>), or when the motor fully detaches in preparation for tail docking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cuervo et al., 2019</xref>), the risk of the genome leaking from the capsid increases. This risk is highest when the pressure inside the head is at its greatest, when the head becomes fuller. In this instance, the portal tunnel can act to negate this risk, constricting to prevent DNA from slipping out (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). In this scenario, the tunnel loops engage with DNA to prevent its slippage, in a manner analogous to a ratchet. This would be caused by the downward movement of the Crown, pushing on the tunnel loops. Such a mechanism is consistent with variation in the length of packaging dwell periods, which become longer as the capsid fills, as observed for the φ29 system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chistol et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Liu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Moffitt et al., 2009</xref>), and with the arresting DNA slippage, as observed in ‘single molecule’ experiments for T4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ordyan et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>As a result of this synergy in the movement of portal Crown domain and tunnel loops, the closed state could be induced more readily by a higher internal pressure pushing on the Crown domain, which builds as the capsid fills with DNA, or by the occasional slippage of DNA which could interact transiently with the Crown (‘snagging’). The role of the tunnel loops in engaging with the DNA, particularly during the late stages of packaging, is supported by the observations that tunnel loop deletions allow DNA to escape from the capsid in phages φ29 and T4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Grimes et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Padilla-Sanchez et al., 2014</xref>). Overall, this describes a packaging mechanism that is naturally safeguarded against genome loss by the portal protein. When fully packaged, DNA can be held in place by the constricted tunnel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Liu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">McElwee et al., 2018</xref>) and by tail factors that completely block DNA exit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cuervo et al., 2019</xref>). During infection and DNA ejection, bacterial cell surface binding is likely able to influence the conformation of the phage tail and consequently the portal protein, inducing a more open conformation needed for DNA escape. Due to the nature of portal-capsid interactions and the attendant symmetry mismatch, discussed below, the portal ratcheting mechanism could be active, regardless of the capsid expansion state.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>The portal’s high order of symmetry reconciles a symmetry mismatch</title><p>The C12-symmetric portal is accommodated in a C5-symmetric penton cavity at one capsid vertex, despite the attendant symmetry mismatch. Comparison of the C12 portal reconstruction presented here with the asymmetric procapsid reconstruction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bayfield et al., 2019</xref>), reveals how this is achieved. The <italic>∼</italic>8<italic><sup>◦</sup></italic> rotational adjustment of the Wing position, bringing it closer to the capsid wall, may assist in forming close portal–capsid contacts, whereas the portal’s Clip external diameter is already well matched to the aperture of the capsid’s penton hole (i.e. the space vacated if one complete penton is removed), so that close interactions can be made. However, the symmetry mismatch creates a problem in that the same pairs of interacting residues at the portal–capsid interface are not consistently aligned around all subunits, and could be offset by as much as <italic>∼</italic>2 nm in the case of P23-45. This misalignment occurs both at the portal Wing and at the Clip, where the portal and capsid make contact in the asymmetric capsid reconstruction. The sparsity of connected portal–capsid regions indicates that the total surface area of interaction is small, and the residues involved in such interactions are hence also restricted in number and positioning.</p><p>The high order of symmetry of the portal helps to mitigate these problems. Its 12-fold symmetry is advantageous in that regions of the portal which can interact with the capsid are repeated at a correspondingly high frequency, which reduces the distance between the mismatched interacting residues. The remaining distance can easily be closed by pivoting of flexible loops towards the capsid, such as at the β-hairpin loops of the portal Wing (residues 185–189). These loops are in equivalent positions in φ29 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Xu et al., 2019</xref>). As a result, only minimal, localised deviations from ideal C12 symmetry are needed to make interactions with the capsid. The portal can therefore utilise the same few residues to interact around its circumference, which contrasts with the situation that would exist if the portal possessed C6, C3, or other lower symmetries matching that of tail components. The symmetry mismatch of the interaction is a general feature amongst all tailed bacteriophages and related viruses, including herpesviruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Liu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">McElwee et al., 2018</xref>). In the case of bacteriophage φ29 prohead (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Mao et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Xu et al., 2019</xref>), one of the structural roles of the pRNA appears to be equivalent to that of the capsid protein P-domain, in interacting with the outside of the portal Clip, with the φ29 capsid protein P-domain, instead making contact with an N-terminal segment of the portal protein.</p><p>At the interface between the portal and capsid vertex, with respective C12 and C5 symmetries, interactions will repeat with a periodicity of 360<italic><sup>◦</sup></italic>/60 = 6<italic><sup>◦</sup></italic>, as similarly suggested by Hendrix prior to the determination of portal structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hendrix, 1978</xref>). Rotation of the portal with respect to the capsid by only 6<italic><sup>◦</sup></italic> would therefore create an equivalent global register, with rotations less than 6<italic><sup>◦</sup></italic> generating non-superposable registers of the whole capsid particle (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">Video 3</xref>). Different portal–capsid registers will have different energies of interaction, and hence equivalent angular registers are expected to be energetically equivalent. A comparable symmetry mismatch is observed between the portal and internal core of bacteriophage T7 (C12 <italic>versus</italic> C8) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cerritelli et al., 2003</xref>), where the mismatched interactions may facilitate the detachment of core proteins. As neither detachment of the portal nor its rotation with respect to the capsid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baumann et al., 2006</xref>), appear to play a role in capsid maturation, the effect of symmetry mismatch in the capsid vertex is to permit flexibility at the portal–capsid interface, allowing the portal and capsid to undergo independent conformational changes, whilst ensuring stable interaction of the portal protein with the tail.</p><media id="video3" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-55517-video3.mp4"><label>Video 3.</label><caption><title>Portal–capsid registers.</title><p>One-degree step change in portal register (inner 12-fold circle) with respect to capsid vertex (outer 5-fold circle), beginning with ‘0°’.

Interaction between the portal and the capsid shell alters the relative positions of domains, in particular the Wing and Crown, and causes remodelling in the tunnel loops that define the most constricted part of the axial tunnel. The unique conformation of the portal in situ demonstrates that the capsid plays a role determining portal conformation, allowing DNA to pass through the tunnel, whilst the portal has the ability to modulate packaging activity and slippage by switching its tunnel properties so that it can engage and disengage with DNA. Whilst portal proteins across other double-stranded DNA viruses (with a terminase motor) may deviate from the classical domain arrangement observed in P23-45, all such viruses face the same basic challenge of safeguarding against genome loss. With regards to portal-capsid interactions, the adoption of 12-fold symmetry by the portal, rather than a symmetry matching that of the capsid vertex, is likely a consequence of the independent evolution of head and tail assemblies, which has selected the matching of symmetries between the portal (12-fold) and the tail (6-fold). This study posits that the problem of mismatched portal–capsid interactions is resolved by the large number of subunits constituting the portal protein, which minimises distances between interacting regions across a spacious interface.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cryo-EM data processing and model building</title><p>From 38,044 extracted particles used in the reconstruction of the unexpanded icosahedral capsid (EMD-4447) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bayfield et al., 2019</xref>), subparticles centred on each vertex were extracted from each capsid particle, and aligned on the z-axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ilca et al., 2015</xref>).

transparency, eLife publishes the most substantive revision requests and the accompanying author responses.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Cryo-EM structure in situ reveals a molecular switch that safeguards virus against genome loss&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by four peer reviewers, including Edward H Egelman as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by John Kuriyan as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Paul J. Jardine (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors report the near-atomic resolution structure of the P23-45 phage procapsid portal complex and focus on changes in the portal in situ compared to the isolated portal, and describe the interactions between the portal oligomer and the capsid vertex.</p><p>The results are thoughtfully interpreted, using careful language, and related well to the existing literature. In particular, the report of a rearrangement of the tunnel loops and the consequences of the 5-12 symmetry mismatch between portal and head shell common to all tailed phages suggest a mechanistic role of the former in DNA retention during and after packaging, and an explanation of tolerance for the latter. Overall, this manuscript will add nicely to the field when published, providing new interpretations of the role and organisation of the components discussed and presenting new, testable ideas of their function during assembly and maturation. Although a phage-focused work, the universality of these systems and the applicability of these observations to other high- and mixed-symmetry assemblages merit publication at this level.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Subsection “The portal’s high order of symmetry reconciles a symmetry mismatch”, first paragraph. The few references to an asymmetric reconstruction are very confusing. The asymmetric reconstruction appears to refer to something in the Bayfield et al., 2019 paper that was never really discussed in that paper. It is shown in Figure 5B in the PNAS paper, and remarkably not discussed in the text of that paper. So the C12 reconstruction in the present manuscript is being compared with a totally asymmetric reconstruction in the PNAS paper, and this needs clarification.</p><p>2) The authors should point out that the portal crystal structure used here, PDB 6IBG, is not that of phage P23-45 but instead of the closely-related phage G20c (see Bayfield et al., 2019). While this may have little consequence on the structural interpretation since the two portal proteins are 99.3% identical in sequence, it is not explained that different phage portals are being compared. It may also be worth pointing out on the structure where the 0.7% amino acids are located that are different between the P23-45 cryo-EM structure and the G20c crystal structure, and what the changes might indicate.</p><p>3) There is also a lack of clarity on the implications of the portal state. The new structure is the in situ procapsid portal, but the crystal structure is not only from another phage but it is assembly-naïve – i.e., it is purified and self-assembled (as far as can be understood from Bayfield et al., 2019). The presence of a constriction implies that it represents a closed state, which presumably resembles that involved in packaging to prevent leakage of DNA. However, the dynamics presented at the start of the Discussion are that capsid assembly switches the free closed portal into the open form due to capsid-portal interactions. The closure of the portal against the internal pressure of the packaged DNA during dwell times of the packaging motor is supposed to be induced by the DNA itself, acting much as a ratchet (an analogy not used here, perhaps out of fashion?). However, what of further changes in capsid-portal interactions following capsid expansion, and if the portal is then closed against the high DNA pressure in the mature capsid, what opens it again (still in the mature capsid) to release the DNA? This is beyond the scope of the experimental results, but given the previous work by the same group that includes lower resolution asymmetric cryo-EM structures of procapsid and expanded capsids, it seems a natural area for informed speculation.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.55517.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Subsection “The portal’s high order of symmetry reconciles a symmetry mismatch”, first paragraph.

This has now been reintroduced in the Discussion to aid in describing the proposed mechanism.</p><p>The reviewer raises important points concerning (a) the role of the expanded capsid state and its influence on the portal’s conformation, and (b) the DNA ejection mechanism and how a closed state can permit DNA exit during infection.</p><p>Concerning point (a), we expect the portal-capsid interactions at the Wing of the portal to be similar in the expanded state, whilst those at the Stem/Clip of the portal should differ in order to allow the tail to bind there. Given that DNA packaging can proceed in both unexpanded and expanded capsid states, we propose the portal’s influence on this process, and its ratcheting effect, to be similar in both states. We (and others) have observed the expanded state to be slightly superior than the procapsid state at protecting DNA in packaging assays. This suggests the expanded state is at least no worse in its ability to package and to prevent slippage. This notion is further supported by the symmetry mismatch and hence the expected lack of preferred portal-capsid orientation, as we allude to in the Discussion. The portal’s ratcheting mechanism can exist, regardless of the expansion state, and the capsid’s motions can be considered separately from those of the portal. This is consistent with such a mechanism existing in the phi29 system, where expansion is not really a feature, but the need to prevent slippage still exists. To address this issue, we have added the following sentence in the Discussion that links the ratcheting mechanism to the expansion state and in turn the portal-capsid interactions:</p><p>“Due to the nature of portal-capsid interactions and the attendant symmetry mismatch, discussed below, the portal ratcheting mechanism could be active, regardless of the capsid expansion state.”</p><p>Regarding point (b), DNA must indeed be allowed to now slip, fully, from the capsid, switching from a closed state in the mature virion. We expect the infection process, specifically the binding of tail factors to the bacterial cell surface, to bring about changes in the portal <italic>via</italic> its interaction with the tail, that allow the tunnel to recover an open conformation. This state may be observed only transiently, during the process of DNA ejection. A sentence has been added in the Discussion to address this important question.</p><p>“During infection and DNA ejection, bacterial cell surface binding is likely able to influence the conformation of the phage tail and consequently the portal protein, inducing a more open conformation needed for DNA escape.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
