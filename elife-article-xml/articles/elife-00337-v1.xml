that simultaneously permit and limit individual variation. We show that during the development of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> central nervous system, mutual inhibition among groups of neighboring postmitotic neurons during development regulates the robustness of axon target choice in a nondeterministic neuronal circuit. Specifically, neighboring postmitotic neurons communicate through Notch signaling during axonal targeting, to ensure balanced alternative axon target choices without a corresponding change in cell fate. Loss of Notch in postmitotic neurons modulates an axon's target choice. However, because neighboring axons respond by choosing the complementary target, the stereotyped connectivity pattern is preserved. In contrast, loss of Notch in clones of neighboring postmitotic neurons results in erroneous coinnervation by multiple axons. Our observations establish mutual inhibition of axonal target choice as a robustness mechanism for brain wiring and unveil a novel cell fate independent function for canonical Notch signaling.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00337.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00337.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00337.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The brains of all members of a species are similar, but not identical, and these differences are partly responsible for the range of behaviors displayed by individuals.

However, it has the evolutionary disadvantage of limiting individual variability, and thus efficient adaptation to environmental change. Furthermore, a strictly deterministic coupling has the significant developmental disadvantage of limiting cellular plasticity in response to inevitable genetic and epigenetic variability within the developing brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Muotri et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">2010</xref>). The latter point is particularly critical in neuronal lineages that are intrinsically variable in cell number.</p><p>Notch signaling is a highly conserved crucial regulator of early nervous system development. The most well-established function for Notch signaling in neural development is the selection of neural progenitor cells through a process termed mutual or lateral inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Artavanis-Tsakonas et al., 1999</xref>). In lateral inhibition, a group of equivalent neuroepithelial cells that initially express roughly the same Notch activity are eventually segregated in two groups defined by expression and activity levels of the receptor Notch and its membrane-bound ligand Delta. Due to cell–cell communication among overlapping clusters of adjacent cells, small differences in Notch expression level are amplified. As a consequence, the majority of cells within these clusters express high Notch activity levels, whereas a minority of cells express low Notch activity. These cells then go on to differentiate as neuronal progenitors. A second important function for Notch signaling is the establishment of alternate binary cell fates of sibling neurons. In contrast to lateral inhibition, this function requires the asymmetric inheritance of the Notch antagonist Numb by one of the two sibling neurons in a terminal cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Guo et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Spana and Doe, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Knoblich, 1997</xref>). It has been proposed that early binary cell fate specification via Notch-Delta signaling results in alternative axon targeting. In the fly visual system, the R7 and R8 photoreceptors, which independently require Notch activity to be specified, make alternative axonal target choices that appear to be consequences of their different fates. Indeed, their canonical fate marker transcription factors Prospero and Senseless, respectively, are required for this differential targeting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Morey et al., 2008</xref>). In the olfactory system of <italic>Drosophila</italic>, sibling neurons target their axon to different central nervous system (CNS) glomeruli due to differential cell fate specification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Endo et al., 2007</xref>). A recent elegant extension of this work shows that chromatin modification of Notch targets by the Hamlet protein further diversifies cell fate and axonal targeting in olfactory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Endo et al., 2012</xref>). Interestingly, in this work, the effects were not restricted to sibling neurons, but extended to neighboring non-sibling neurons, and the corresponding effects on axonal targeting were not strictly binary nor fully penetrant leading to speculation that Notch activity might have probabilistic effects on axonal targeting downstream of cell fate specification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Schmucker and Hassan, 2012</xref>). Finally, an extensive analysis of CNS neurons in the fly olfactory circuit shows that there are more diverse wiring morphologies than can be accounted for by the number of cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chou et al., 2010</xref>), suggesting that post-fate mechanisms may be crucial in wiring the <italic>Drosophila</italic> CNS. What these post-fate mechanisms are, and how they buffer intrinsic variability to generate stereotyped wiring patterns, is unknown.</p><p>Here we show that the dorsal cluster neurons (DCNs), a group of bilateral commissural higher order neurons in the visual system of <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hassan et al., 2000</xref>) are intrinsically variable in number within and between individuals, yet generate a highly stereotyped wiring diagram. We combine high resolution quantitative anatomical analyses, computational modeling, and genetic dissection to show that Notch-mediated mutual inhibition acts late in development on postmitotic neurons to bias axonal target choice. Finally, we show that this mechanism ensures the reproducibility of the DCN connectivity pattern.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>DCN medulla axons are derived from subclusters of neighboring DCNs</title><p>DCNs are produced from a single embryonic neuroblast, and all express the same cell fate markers, namely the Atonal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hassan et al., 2000</xref>) and Acj6 (see below) transcription factors. All postmitotic DCNs are efficiently labeled with the <italic>ato-Gal4</italic> driver starting at the third instar larval (L3) stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). DCNs innervate two regions of the optic lobes, the lobula and the medulla. This binary axon target choice is a result of three distinct steps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Srahna et al., 2006</xref>). First, in late third instar larvae DCN axons grow en masse toward the developing medulla neuropil attracted by a Wnt5 signal. Second, at 25–50 hr after puparium formation (APF), most DCN axons begin to retract back to the lobula neuropil, likely in response to a repulsive fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A′–A″</xref> ). Wnt and FGF have opposing effects on Jun N-terminal Kinase (JNK) activity, which is both necessary and sufficient for DCN axon growth. Third, a small subset of regularly spaced axons resist the repulsive signal, by an unknown mechanism, and remain in the medulla (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A′′′</xref> ). These observations hint that the pattern of DCN axons may arise by a sorting mechanism that generates two mutually exclusive DCN axon target choices: lobula vs medulla (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B″</xref>).<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00337.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Development of the DCN wiring pattern.</title><p>The development of the DCN cluster during various time points.

Briefly, DCNs were labeled with GFP, driven by <italic>ato-Gal4</italic>, and imaged. Each DCN soma and axon were assigned 3D coordinates and analyzed with the ‘clusterdata' function in MATLAB (see the ‘Materials and methods' section for imaging and DCN profile details). These analyses reveal a number of interesting features. First, all DCNs express the same cell fate markers, Atonal and Acj6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–B′</xref>), as detected by antibody staining, already at L3 prior to initiating axon outgrowth towards the optic lobes. Second, although there are on average 38 DCNs producing a highly stereotyped pattern of 12 spaced axons in the medulla (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), the DCN lineage itself is not fixed. The number of neurons varies (35–43 neurons) not only between different individuals but also between the right and left sides of the same individual (r = −0.148; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Furthermore, there is no correlation between the number of neurons in a cluster and the number of medulla axons it projects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, top graph).

DCNs are born in a ventral to dorsal order (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Zheng et al., 2006</xref>), and each DCN establishes one ipsilateral dendritic arbor and one contralateral axonal arbor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Srahna et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Nicolai et al., 2010</xref>). Using the flip-out technique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Wong et al., 2002</xref>), we labeled single DCNs with membrane-bound GFP and visualized them in the background of the entire cluster labeled with LacZ. We found that medulla targeting neurons are located all along the dorsal–ventral (D-V) and proximal–distal axes of the cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E–G</xref>). Thus, there is no correlation between birth order and medulla vs lobula targeting, confirming earlier observations that sibling DCN clones generated using the MARCM technique can target the medulla, the lobula, or one each (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Zheng et al., 2006</xref>). Interestingly, however, the D-V position of an axon is directly and very highly correlated (r = 0.964) with the D-V position of its soma within the cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, bottom graph) such that the most dorsal neuron gives rise to the most dorsal axon and so on (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). Because most DCNs at any given D-V position innervate the lobula and a few innervate the medulla, D-V positional information does not directly instruct lobula vs medulla target choice.</p><p>We wondered whether cell–cell interactions might offer insight into the mechanism underlying the generation of a stereotyped medulla innervation pattern, despite variability in neuronal number. To this end, DCN soma were labeled with LacZ and their axons with CD8-GFP. Next, each neuron and each medulla axon were assigned their three-dimensional (3D) Cartesian coordinates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>) to determine the distances between DCN cell bodies, and between each two adjacent medulla axons (see ‘Materials and methods'). These analyses reveal two features. First, DCN soma show a few sparse cells at the dorsal and ventral extremities and a majority of cells densely packed medially (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C,D</xref>). Second, DCN medulla axons are more dense dorsally and ventrally, but more sparse medially (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Therefore, there is an inverse correlation between cell density and interaxonal distance along the D-V axis in the medulla: four to eight medial DCN soma provide one medulla axon, whereas only one to two DCN soma target one axon to the medulla dorsally and ventrally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). It is crucial to note that this inverse relationship between soma density and medulla axon density is conserved in response to changes in cluster shape (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>), yet the overall wiring pattern is preserved, strongly suggesting that DCNs use a dedicated mechanism to ensure the accuracy of the stereotyped medulla innervation pattern.<fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00337.006</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Quantitative analysis of the DCN soma and axon.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A typical DCN axonal pattern showing GFP-labeled neurites (green) and LacZ labeled soma (red).

One hypothesis to explain these observations stipulates the following: DCNs operate as several small overlapping subclusters in which all neurons within a certain distance of each other compete to provide one medulla axon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). In this model, neurons with fewer neighbors, as often seen dorsally and especially ventrally, target the medulla with higher probability. Conversely, densely clustered neurons, as seen medially, target the medulla with lower probability, and thus fewer axons.

In contrast, E(spl)-CD2 levels are very low in DCNs at L3 (data not shown) suggesting that Notch signaling is not active in postmitotic DCNs prior to pupariation.

We used the ato-Gal4 driver to inhibit Notch and Delta specifically in postmitotic DCNs during adult brain development. It is critical to note that during adult brain development, ato-Gal4 is only active in DCNs postmitotically and after their axons begin to grow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hassan et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Srahna et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Zheng et al., 2006</xref>). Postmitotic, DCN-specific inhibition of Notch or its ligands Delta and Serrate (Ser) leads to two phenotypes. First, we observe clustered axons at several D-V positions, particularly medially, as opposed to isolated single axons seen under control conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D–F′,l</xref>) causing a significant decrease in axon–axon distances in the medulla (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5K</xref>). Second, we observe a significant increase in the number of axons targeting the medulla (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5L</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>), indicating that axon clustering is the result of neighboring axons erroneously making similar target choices. These data quantitatively mirror the phenotypes predicted by computational modeling of mutual inhibition among DCNs. Importantly, loss of Notch function alters neither the number (38.13 ± 2 SD vs 37.12 ± 3.1 SD, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4</xref>) nor the expression of DCN fate markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s5">Figure 5—figure supplement 5</xref>). RNAi knockdown of Neur, a positive regulator of Delta and Ser activity, causes clustered axons and a significant increase of medulla axons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G,L</xref>). Finally, postmitotic and DCN-specific RNAi knockdown of the canonical Notch pathway nuclear effector proteins Suppressor of Hairless (Su(H)) and Mastermind (Mam) also result in axon clustering and a corresponding increase in medulla axon number (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H–J′,M</xref>). Altogether, these data support the notion that DCNs require Notch-mediated mutual inhibitory interactions to make accurate medulla vs lobula axon target choices.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Notch antagonizes JNK activity via Pak inhibition</title><p>Previous work has shown that high JNK activity is required for DCN axons to resist retraction and innervate the medulla. We hypothesized that N and JNK might interact negatively in neurons as described in <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos and mammalian cell culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Zecchini et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chu et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">MacKenzie et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Mateos et al., 2007</xref>). Furthermore, it has been proposed that downregulation of the axon guidance molecule p21 activated kinease1 (Pak1) via canonical N signaling attenuates JNK activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Mateos et al., 2007</xref>), making <italic>Drosophila</italic> Pak an attractive target candidate in our system. Indeed, we find that gain of Pak function, by expression of the constitutively active Pak using <italic>ato-Gal4</italic>, phenocopies Notch inhibition resulting in a significant increase and clustering of medulla axons, while knockdown of Pak levels reduces the number of medulla innervations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–D</xref>). Next, we examined the DCN medulla targeting pattern under conditions of inhibition of both N and JNK, which have opposite effects on medulla targeting. Simultaneous downregulation of JNK and N activities, using dominant negative transgenes driven by <italic>ato-Gal4</italic>, results in a phenotype similar to JNK inhibition alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). This supports the notion that N activity antagonizes JNK signaling. Simultaneous reduction of both Notch activity and Pak levels, using Pak RNAi, results in a phenotype indistinguishable from Pak reduction alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>), supporting the notion that Pak acts downstream of Notch. Finally, DCN-specific gain of Pak and loss of JNK activity shows a reduced number of medulla axons, resembling loss of JNK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). These data support a model whereby N reduces JNK activity via inhibition of Pak function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). To test this model further, we asked if gain of Notch function affects JNK activity and Pak expression levels. To this end, we expressed the constitutively active intracellular domain of Notch (NICD) in DCNs and examined the levels of JNK reporter construct <italic>puckered-LacZ</italic> (<italic>puc-LacZ</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Reed et al., 2001</xref>).

Next, we transfected the <italic>Drosophila</italic> neuronal cell line DmBG2-c3 with NICD and assayed the effects on Pak and phospho-JNK (active JNK) levels. This resulted in a significant decrease in both Pak and pJNK levels, consistent with our in vivo observations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>). Together, these data suggest that Notch activity sets the baseline JNK activity threshold which distinguishes medulla-targeting from lobula-targeting neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>).<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00337.016</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p>Notch signaling attenuates JNK activity via Pak (<bold>A–C′</bold>) loss of Notch signaling as well as constitutive Pak activation result in clustered axons.

To determine more precisely the timing of Notch requirement, we took advantage of the dominant nature of loss of Notch function and a temperature sensitive Notch mutant allele (Notch<sup>ts</sup>). Flies were raised at either the permissive (18°C) or restrictive temperature (28°C) between 0 and 96 hr APF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A,B</xref>). Reduction of Notch activity at the restrictive temperature results in clusters of neighboring axons in the medulla and a significant increase in the number of medulla axons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A–E</xref>). Next, we raised flies at the permissive temperature and shifted them to the restrictive temperature for 24 hr intervals at different APF stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A,B</xref>). Decreasing Notch activity only alters axon target choice between 24 and 60 hr APF, but neither before nor after (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B,E</xref>). Importantly, inhibition of Notch function specifically within the DCNs only during pupal development, using a combination of ato-Gal4 and a temperature-sensitive Gal80 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">McGuire et al., 2003</xref>), results in a very similar phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E′</xref>). Finally, gain of Notch function via DCN-specific expression of NICD or Su(H) strongly reduces the number of medulla axons found in the adult brain, but, importantly, does not inhibit their initial outgrowth into the medulla (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F–J</xref>), confirming that canonical Notch signaling specifically regulates the ability of axons to remain in the medulla after initial targeting. Altogether, these data mean that Notch signaling is required within the DCNs specifically to segregate axon target choice at pupal stage between 24 and 60 hr APF, but neither before nor after.<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00337.017</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><p>Notch acts specifically during the axon sorting phase to regulate DCN axon targeting.

We generated two types of clones: clones in which Notch activity is inhibited only in postmitotic DCNs specifically after L3 using dominant negative Notch, and Notch-null clones in which Notch is completely absent from single cells from the time they are born. We found that whereas only 24% of the control clones target the medulla, approximately 60% of all Notch mutant clones—both null and DN—do so, with the most pronounced effect occurring medially (p&lt;0.001 null, p&lt;0.001 DN, Fisher's exact test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B–D</xref>). In contrast, as expected, medial Delta mutant clones favor targeting the lobula (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B′</xref>) with little or no effect on dorsal or ventral clones (data not shown). Therefore, Notch signaling levels autonomously regulate the axon target choice of individual DCNs. These data validate the first prediction of the mutual inhibition hypothesis.</p><p>To test the second prediction, we labeled the entire DCN pattern with the red fluorescent protein Cherry and generated single GFP-labeled Notch mutant cells in that background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>). Analysis of the number, clustering, and spatial pattern of medulla axons in these clones show that the Notch mutant axon remains correctly spaced and the overall number and pattern of axons in the medulla is indistinguishable from control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E′,F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>). Next, we analyzed 23 axon–axon distances representing 12 individual mutant clones and compared them to the distances observed in controls. We found that 87% (20/23) of the mutant axons are within the normal range, as expected if neighboring control neurons innervate the lobula (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8G</xref>). Crucially, the biased medulla innervation caused by loss of Notch activity does not alter the D-V positional relationship between neuronal soma and axon; dorsal neurons still project dorsally, medial neurons project medially, and ventral neurons project ventrally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>A mutual inhibition mechanism of axonal target choice ensures accuracy of neuronal connectivity</title><p>To test the third prediction, we designed a novel genetic combination to create adjacent cell clones independently of birth order. To this end, we generated flies in which Notch activity can be stochastically manipulated in sets of ‘green' (GFP-positive) postmitotic DCNs, while their ‘red' (Cherry-positive) neighbors remain wild type (see ‘Materials and methods' for genotype details) in order to inhibit Notch function during axonal targeting in potentially interacting DCN subclusters. As controls, subsets of adjacent wild-type DCNs were labeled with GFP without inhibition of Notch activity. Of 20 control clones, 18 (90%) gave rise to normal medulla innervation patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8H–H″</xref>) with no effect on the number of medulla axons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8J</xref>). In two clones (10%), we observed one example of two adject axons each. In contrast, when Notch is stochastically inactivated in subsets of postmitotic DCNs, two types of phenotypes are observed. First, in 55% of all clones (24/44), the overall pattern remains normal, even though the mutant axons themselves target the medulla. Second, in 45% of the clones (20/44), in addition to mutant axons targeting the medulla (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8I′</xref>, white arrows), axon clustering is observed (p=0.0094 Fisher's exact test). Furthermore, the number of medulla axons is significantly increased, and the axon–axon distances within these clones is drastically reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8I–K</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s3">Figure 8—figure supplement 3</xref>), suggesting that in these cases interacting neurons of one subcluster have been targeted by the stochastic inhibition of Notch. These data validate the third prediction and strongly support the idea of Notch-mediated interactions among neighboring cells.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Previously, two deterministic models have been proposed to explain the requirement for Notch signaling in brain connectivity. First, binary sibling neuron fate specification by Notch—as opposed to mutual inhibition—has been proposed as a mechanism of fate-dependent targeting of sensory axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Endo et al., 2007</xref>). Notch has also been suggested to act as an axon guidance molecule via a noncanonical pathway in fly embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Crowner et al., 2003</xref>). We show that higher order CNS neurons utilize mutual inhibition via Notch signaling to establish a robust wiring map. However, in contrast to the classical process of mutual inhibition, which specifies early progenitor cell fate, we demonstrate that mutual inhibition is reused in postmitotic DCN neurons. Three arguments support this interpretation. First, the decision to target the medulla neuropil of single cell Notch null mutant clone is probabilistic (∼60%) rather than absolute (100%) as would be expected for cell fate specification. Second, the requirement for Notch signaling in establishing the wiring diagram is restricted to 24–60 hr APF, and third, Notch signaling affects neither the lineage size nor the expression of different cell fate markers in the DCNs early in development. It should be noted that medulla vs lobula axon target choice can be viewed as a form of sub-fate choice. The important discovery here is that this ‘sub-fate' is not a cell-autonomous translation of birth order instructions, but is rather subject to regulation by the choices of neighboring cells. In that sense, it extends the timing and plasticity of the phase during which neurons can be said to acquire their ‘fate'.</p><p>Here, we report lateral inhibition as a novel mechanism for brain wiring. It is likely that the inhibitory interactions are taking place between the neuronal cell bodies, especially given the requirement for the nuclear factors Su(H) and Mam and the effects on the E(spl) transcriptional reporter. However, interactions between axons prior to or shortly after their defasciculation within the medulla cannot be formally ruled out. Axonal target choice resulting from mutual inhibition by neighboring postmitotic neurons is interesting, not only as a novel function for Notch signaling but also as an additional layer of regulation that complements, but is independent of, traditional axon guidance cues. While it may be sensible for sensory neurons to couple fate to targeting so that the same sensory information is carried by the same type of neuron in different animals, it is reasonable to speculate that a degree of circuit-level plasticity is a more useful strategy in higher order brain centers, where meaningful information is likely to be encoded at the network level and not by single cells. It would be interesting to test if other patterns of alternative target choices by similar neurons, such as retinal projections into the midbrain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brown et al., 2000</xref>), mammalian ocular dominance columns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Crowley and Katz, 2002</xref>), or the wiring variability of <italic>Drosophila</italic> olfactory interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chou et al., 2010</xref>) utilize similar mechanisms. Finally, given the inevitable and significant genetic and environmental variability in the real world, it seems rather intuitive that a mechanism that ensures the reproducibility of the connectivity pattern of an entire circuit, would be evolutionarily favored over a mechanisms that would risk the population connectivity pattern in favor of attempting to generate the same connectivity of precisely the same cell.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Fly genetics</title><p>Flies were raised at 25°C or 28°C, except for temporal Notch activity experiments for which flies were raised at 18°C and shifted to 28°C during pupation for a specific time window of either 24 hr or until eclosion.

Images such as single or merged figures were created using Photoshop. For ease of viewing, images were rotated so that the DCN cluster is located on the top left corner of every image.

We assumed that 10% in case of a reduced Notch activity level will reflect the in vivo condition best (in vivo 18.4 ± 2.22 SD vs in silico 17.29 ± 3.96 SD) since Notch<sup>DN</sup> transgene for example is a strong repressor of Notch activity. We also tested in silico downregulation of Notch to 30%, and this results in approximately 20.33 ± 6.91 SD medulla axons. Given that Notch<sup>DN</sup> is a strong repressor of Notch function, 10% was chosen to simulate an in vivo loss of Notch function. Additionally, a noise term of 0–1% was introduced to the initial settings of Notch and Delta signaling.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Detection of adjacent DCN soma</title><p>To determine the trans-Delta expression level of each DCN soma, all adjacent cells needed to be identified. Since <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Collier et al. (1996)</xref> used cells arranged in a hexagonal lattice, each cell had at most six adjacent cells, thus creating a subcluster of maximal seven cells. The DCN cluster consists of ∼40 DCN soma, which are arranged in three dimensions. To divide the DCN cluster in subclusters of an average size of seven cells, Euclidean 3D distances between DCN soma were examined. DCNs were split into subclusters of about seven cells when we applied an Euclidean 3D distance of 0.17 [nad] (=normalized arbritrary distance) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). Additionally, this also resulted in approximately 12 medulla axons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Computational simulation</title><p>To solve the differential equations described above, the Runge–Kutta (2, 3) formula was used for a timespan of 1000 time steps. During each timestep, each DCN soma was updated in its Notch and Delta expression level in three steps. First, ‘trans-Delta' expression was determined. For this, Delta expression of adjacent DCN soma was detected using 0.17 [nad] as an Euclidean distance.</p><p>Second, Notch activity level of a given DCN was updated based on the average Delta expression in adjacent cells. Finally, Delta expression of a given DCN is recalculated based on Notch activity in that cell. These calculations were performed for each DCN soma and repeated a 1000 times.</p><p>After solving the different equations, the final Notch expression level of each cell was analyzed. For each subcluster, the DCN soma with the lowest Notch activity was determined since these DCN soma will project its axon toward the medulla. Under wild-type conditions, each subcluster has on average only one DCN soma with the lowest Notch activity, whereas under loss of Notch signaling, multiple DCN soma are predicted to have equally low Notch activity levels. Matlab Version 7.6.0.324 (R2008a) was used for computational simulations and predictions.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Application of the mathematical model</title><p>The mathematical model is applied to analyze different aspects of the DCNs. First, the mathematical model should predict under control and loss of Notch activity condition the number of medulla axons to a certain degree. For this purpose, 16 different in vivo DCN clusters with their normalized 3D coordinates were taken as input for the mathematical model. These 16 DCN clusters were simulated a 1000 times. From these resulting 1600 data points, the average number of medulla axons, the standard deviation, and the standard error of the mean were calculated. Second, to analyze the final Notch activity pattern within an in vivo DCN cluster simulating either the control or loss of Notch condition, a single DCN cluster was applied to the mathematical model and presented in a 3D chart using different colors to symbolize lobula vs medulla DCN neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,B</xref>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Gerald M Rubin for providing the unpublished LexAop-Flp lines, Utpal Banerjee for E(spl)-CD2 flies, Francois Schweisguth for Delta and <italic>neur</italic> RNAi flies, Jürgen Knoblich for the Numb antibodies, the Bloomington Stock Center and VDRC for <italic>Drosophila</italic> Stocks.

Your article has been evaluated by a Senior editor and 3 reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments based on the reviewers' reports.</p><p>Langen et al describe a developmental mechanism of neural wiring in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> visual system in which antagonistic interactions, via Notch signaling, in post-mitotic neurons, define distinct axon target choices within a lineage of apparently identical neurons. This is an interesting finding, which is globally well supported by the data, and which reveals a novel non-deterministic strategy by which reproducible nervous system connectivity is achieved.</p><p>The paper investigates how a single cluster of ∼38 neurons generated from a single neuroblast, and apparently molecularly identical, can still manage to have dramatically different projection patterns. The Dorsal Cluster Neurons (DCN) can either project to the medulla or to the lobula.</p><p>Very careful quantification of the projections and cell bodies indicates that there is extensive variability in the number of DCN produced from the unique neuroblast, as well as variability in the number of clusters along the dorso-ventral axis, but surprisingly a light level of stereotypy in the total number of neurons that project to the medulla.</p><p>The investigators explain how this is possible through a re-utilization of the same pathway used in lateral inhibition during the formation of embryonic neuroblasts, also in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. This is surprising as this Notch pathway acts as a lateral inhibitor only in the early steps of neurogenesis during embryogenesis, while we are dealing here with post-embryonic neurogenesis. One would have therefore expected a mode of lateral interactions mediated by asymmetric division of cells and asymmetric distribution of Numb, as in bristle precursor cells. The authors therefore show that, from each of the clusters of DCNs, only a fixed number of neurons, inversely proportional to the size of the cluster, choose to target the medulla rather than the lobula. Therefore, we are dealing with an embryonic type of Notch function rather then a post-embryonic mode.</p><p>Points to address:</p><p>* The authors argue repeatedly that the Notch choice is independent of the fate of the two populations of cells. However, this is far from being demonstrated as only two molecular markers are shown to be identical (Acj6 and Ato). It would take a lot more work to demonstrate that these are one type of neuron with different projection patterns. In fact, it is highly likely that the two cell populations are different from one another since they project differently, target different neurons, and might have different neurotransmitters. How can the authors be sure that there are not in fact two subsets of DCN neurons and that Notch functions classically in fate determination? This should be discussed.</p><p>* The authors address when Notch is required, but it is unclear where Notch functions and this could be clarified either with new data or at least in the Discussion. Is the Delta/Notch signaling functioning in the axons themselves (is Notch detectable in this compartment), or within the soma as implied indirectly by the relationship established early in the manuscript between DCN soma clustering and axonal target choice?</p><p>* The modeling is nice and does not detract from the quality of the paper. However, it is not necessary to use equations to predict that loss of Notch will lead to an increase in the proportion of medulla projecting neurons. Anyone who knows Notch would have predicted this.</p><p>* One reason for nature choosing to use the lateral inhibition system of the embryonic neurogenesis rather than the N on/N off Numb-biased choice might simply be the goal to achieve: in one case, a few neuroepithelial cells in the embryo decide to become neuroblasts while the majority remains epithelial (a case similar to the DCNs where the majority of neurons retracts to the lamina). In contrast, the Numb-mediated Notch function leads to 50-50 neurons A vs neuron B. In both cases, the neurons are different and it is likely that it is the same thing for DCN. Because the choice is made late, the common “master control” transcription factors establishing the lineage remain on late. But it is likely that a profiling of medulla vs lobula DCN neurons would lead to significant profile differences.</p><p>* Figure 8 contains several issues: for example, Figure 8h, it would be more illustrative to show an example in which a similar number of axons are labelled with GFP as in Figure 8i, because they claim that in the experimental condition the mutant (green) axons innervate the medulla, unlike the case in the control; but, because the control they show labels all the axons in green, it makes it difficult to appreciate the result, and prove that the effect is not solely due to the genetic flip-out manipulation in the neurons, but rather specifically due to the lack of Notch.</p><p>Figure 8i shows a cluster of one mutant (green) and one wild-type (red) axon, which is counter to their model that wild type axons compensate for the presence of mutant axons by restricting to the lobula – what is the explanation for this? Figure 8k: the distances between adjacent axons should be calculated for all axons and not only for GFP positive axons.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00337.023</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>* The authors argue repeatedly that the Notch choice is independent of the fate of the two populations of cells.

Even if the two DCN subpopulations were somehow intrinsically different, this difference is still subject to post-mitotic regulation by lateral inhibition, which is the important point here. Nonetheless to address the reviewers' valid concern, we have now added the following paragraph to the Discussion:</p><p>“It should be noted that medulla vs. lobula axon target choice can be viewed as a form of sub-fate choice. The important discovery here is that this “sub-fate” is not a cell-autonomous translation of birth order instructions, but is rather subject to regulation by the choices of neighboring cells. In that sense, it extends the timing and plasticity of the phase during which neurons can be said to acquire their “fate”.</p><p><italic>* The authors address when Notch is required, but it is unclear where Notch functions and this could be clarified either with new data or at least in the Discussion. Is the Delta/Notch signaling functioning in the axons themselves (is Notch detectable in this compartment), or within the soma as implied indirectly by the relationship established early in the manuscript between DCN soma clustering and axonal target choice</italic>?</p><p>We believe the requirement for nuclear factors makes it very likely that the competition is occurring between cell bodies. However, the reviewers are correct in that there is no formal way to genetically dissect the function in the axon from the function in the cell body. We have therefore added this text to the Discussion:</p><p>“It is likely that the inhibitory interactions are taking place between the neuronal cell bodies, especially given the requirement for the nuclear factors Su(H) and Mam and the effects on the E(spl) transcriptional reporter. However, interactions between axons prior to, or shortly after their defasiculation within the medulla cannot be formally ruled out.”</p><p><italic>* The modeling is nice and does not detract from the quality of the paper. However, it is not necessary to use equations to predict that loss of Notch will lead to an increase in the proportion of medulla projecting neurons. Anyone who knows Notch would have predicted this</italic>.</p><p>We do not agree with the reviewers on this point. First, it was far from intuitive that the existing model we used would have worked well in a 3D irregularly shaped cellular cluster. Second, this model had never been previously tested in Notch loss of function conditions. Third, and most importantly, the modeling does not merely predict an increase of medulla axon number, it does so quantitatively and with accurate spatial information. Thus, we believe the model is an important extension of the quantitative aspects of the biology reported in this paper.</p><p><italic>* One reason for nature choosing to use the lateral inhibition system of the embryonic neurogenesis rather than the N on/N off Numb-biased choice might simply be the goal to achieve: in one case, a few neuroepithelial cells in the embryo decide to become neuroblasts while the majority remains epithelial (a case similar to the DCNs where the majority of neurons retracts to the lamina).

Because the choice is made late, the common “master control” transcription factors establishing the lineage remain on late. But it is likely that a profiling of medulla vs lobula DCN neurons would lead to significant profile differences</italic>.</p><p>A minor objection to the phrase “nature choosing” not withstanding, we essentially agree with the reviewers and this is the entire point of our paper. Lateral inhibition in this context is acting as a mechanism of developmental plasticity, allowing for at least one aspect of terminal fate choice to be open to competition and selection. In terms of the profiling likely to show intrinsic differences between medulla and lobula targeting neurons, this is highly likely to be the case. However, what is important is to ask whether such differences are consequent to Notch activity during axon target sorting. If they are, that would suggest that such molecular differences emerge only after that competition between cells is initiated. This would indeed be a very exciting project to pursue in the future when molecular profiling can be done on small cell populations in the fly brain. At any rate, we have now added the following paragraph to the Discussion:</p><p>“It should be noted that medulla vs. lobula axon target choice can be viewed as a form of sub-fate choice. The important discovery here is that this “sub-fate” is not a cell-autonomous translation of birth order instructions, but is rather subject to regulation by the choices of neighboring cells.

We count approximately 15 GFP positive cells in each panel.</p><p><italic>Figure 8i shows a cluster of one mutant (green) and one wild-type (red) axon, which is counter to their model that wild type axons compensate for the presence of mutant axons by restricting to the lobula – what is the explanation for this</italic>?</p><p>We do not agree with this comment. When lateral inhibition breaks down, axon target choice defaults to the intrinsic levels of JNK activity, which now are no longer subject to differential regulation by Notch. Since JNK activity is deterministic to DCN axon target choice (Srahna et al., 2006), both wild type and Notch mutant axons may have similarly high levels of JNK activity and may target the medulla.</p><p><italic>Figure 8k: the distances between adjacent axons should be calculated for all axons and not only for GFP positive axons</italic>.</p><p>Given that cells outside a mutated subcluster are not affected, it is not clear to us why axonal distances in these normal cells should be taken onto account. In both WT and Notch mutant cases we quantified only the distances within the GFP clones, which we believe is the relevant measurement to make.</p></body></sub-article></article>
