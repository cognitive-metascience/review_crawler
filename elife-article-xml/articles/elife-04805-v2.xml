This prioritization is achieved through the regulation of phytohormonal signaling networks. However, it remains unknown how this prioritization affects resistance against non-target herbivores. In this study, we identify <italic>WRKY70</italic> as a specific herbivore-induced, mitogen-activated protein kinase-regulated rice transcription factor that physically interacts with W-box motifs and prioritizes defence over growth by positively regulating jasmonic acid (JA) and negatively regulating gibberellin (GA) biosynthesis upon attack by the chewing herbivore <italic>Chilo suppressalis</italic>. WRKY70-dependent JA biosynthesis is required for proteinase inhibitor activation and resistance against <italic>C. suppressalis</italic>. In contrast, WRKY70 induction increases plant susceptibility against the rice brown planthopper <italic>Nilaparvata lugens</italic>. Experiments with GA-deficient rice lines identify WRKY70-dependent GA signaling as the causal factor in <italic>N. lugens</italic> susceptibility. Our study shows that prioritizing defence over growth leads to a significant resistance trade-off with important implications for the evolution and agricultural exploitation of plant immunity.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04805.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04805.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04805.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Many different animals feed on plants, including almost half of all known insect species. Some herbivores—like caterpillars for example—feed by chewing. Others, such as aphids and planthoppers, use syringe-like mouthparts to pierce plants and then feed on the fluids within.</p><p>To minimize the damage caused by these herbivores, plants activate specific defenses upon attack, including proteins that can inhibit the insect's digestive enzymes. The inhibitors are effective against chewing herbivores but seem to have little or no effect on some insects that feed by the ‘pierce-and-suck’ method.</p><p>Investing in defense requires energy, and so plants attacked by herbivores actively slow their growth to meet this demand. Plants achieve this trade-off by changing the levels of different plant hormones. These hormones can control the expression of thousands of genes and have widespread effects throughout the plant. However, little is known about how prioritizing defense overgrowth in response to an attack by one herbivore affects the plant's ability to defend itself against other herbivores.</p><p>Transcription factors are proteins that control which genes inside a cell are active or inactive. Li et al. searched for a transcription factor in rice plants that was specifically triggered in response to an attack by the caterpillars of a moth called the rice striped stem borer. This search identified a protein called WRKY70 as a transcription factor that prioritizes defense overgrowth. WRKY70 achieves this by increasing the levels of a defensive plant hormone (called jasmonic acid) while reducing the levels of a growth hormone (called gibberellin). Further experiments show that the increase in jasmonic acid production is required to activate the enzyme inhibitors and for resistance against these caterpillars.</p><p>Li et al. then found that increased WRKY70 activity makes rice plants more susceptible to attack by a second herbivore, a piercing-sucking insect called the rice brown planthopper. Further experiments revealed that this is due to the reduced levels of gibberillin. These findings show that while prioritizing defense overgrowth is effective against some insect herbivores, it comes with a cost as it makes the plants more susceptible to attack by other herbivores. This trade-off has important implications for both the evolution of plant immunity, and efforts to exploit plant immunity to help protect crops from herbivore attack.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04805.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04805.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>rice</kwd><kwd>plant defense</kwd><kwd>plant growth</kwd><kwd>plant hormone</kwd><kwd>jasmonic acid</kwd><kwd>gibberellin</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002855</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>National Basic Research Program of China (2010CB126200)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lou</surname><given-names>Yonggen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31330065</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lou</surname><given-names>Yonggen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Earmarked Fund for China Agriculture Research System</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CARS-01-21</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lou</surname><given-names>Yonggen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000780</institution-id><institution>European Commission (EC)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FP7-PEOPLE-2013-CIG- 629134</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Erb</surname><given-names>Matthias</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerische Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>155781</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Erb</surname><given-names>Matthias</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A chewing herbivore induced WRKY transcription factor induces jasmonate-dependent defences and supresses gibbererellin-dependent growth, the latter of which renders rice plants more susceptible to secondary infestation by a piercing-sucking herbivore.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Plants have developed effective defensive systems to minimize herbivore damage. They can specifically perceive attackers and respond to them by activating defence-related signaling pathways, including mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades and hormone signaling, leading to the induction of numerous defence-related genes and defence compounds as well as plant resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wu and Baldwin, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bonaventure et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Erb et al., 2012</xref>). Jasmonic acid (JA)-, salicylic acid (SA)-, and ethylene (ET)-mediated signaling play a central role in induced resistance to herbivores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Qi et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>The induction of defences commonly co-occurs with a reduction of plant growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Heinrich et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Attaran et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Huot et al., 2014</xref>). Through silencing defence-related genes, a direct negative link between defence and growth was demonstrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zavala and Baldwin, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Meldau et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yang et al., 2012</xref>), suggesting that plants actively prioritize defence over growth. Defence prioritization and the associated growth trade-offs are regulated by crosstalk between plant hormones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Schwachtje et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Stanton et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Huot et al., 2014</xref>). DELLA proteins for instance, which typically suppress gibberellin (GA) signaling, can physically interact with the JA pathway repressor JAZ proteins, thereby resulting in mutual suppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hou et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yang et al., 2012</xref>). Furthermore, SA has been reported to inhibit the expression of TIR1/ABF F-box genes, thereby leading to stabilization of AUX/IAA repressor proteins and decreasing auxin signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wang et al., 2007</xref>). Conversely, auxin signaling can reduce SA biosynthesis and thereby render plants more susceptible to pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Robert–Seilaniantz et al., 2011</xref>). Compared to the impact of defence-related hormones, little is known about the impact of growth-related hormones on herbivore resistance and potential resistance trade-offs that may emanate from prioritizing defence over growth through hormonal regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yang et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Transcription factors (TFs) play a potentially important role in herbivore-induced plant reconfiguration and defence prioritization, as they regulate the expression of responses up and downstream of hormonal signaling pathways and thereby influence early and late signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Reymond et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dombrecht et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Skibbe et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kaur et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zhou et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Schweizer et al., 2013</xref>). The best-studied TFs involved in plant–insect interactions are MYCs, WRKYs, MYBs, and ERFs. AtMYC2 in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, for example, was reported to act downstream of JA and to regulate JA-dependent herbivore resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dombrecht et al., 2007</xref>). Moreover, MYC2, MYC3, and MYC4 were shown to regulate the production of toxic glucosinolates via a direct transcriptional activation of glucosinolate biosynthesis genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Schweizer et al., 2013</xref>). In <italic>Nicotiana attenuata,</italic> a R2R3-type MYB TF (<italic>NaMYB8</italic>) was found to modulate the accumulation of phenylpropanoid–polyamine conjugates, which are essential for defence against herbivores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kaur et al., 2010</xref>). In rice, an EAR-motif-containing ERF TF (<italic>OsERF3</italic>) functions as an early component upstream of MAPK signaling and modulates JA, SA, ET, and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> levels as well as plant resistance to rice herbivores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lu et al., 2011</xref>). Also, several WRKYs, such as rice OsWRKY89, wheat TaWRKY53, <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> AtWRKY72, and tomato SIWRKY70 and SIWRKY72, have been directly associated with defence against herbivores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wang et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bhattarai et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Van Eck et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Atamian et al., 2012</xref>). NaWRKY3 and NaWRKY6 in <italic>N. attenuata</italic> have been shown to modulate elicited JA and JA-Ile/-Leu levels and thus mediate herbivory-induced defence responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Skibbe et al., 2008</xref>). Identifying and manipulating TFs that are involved in defence prioritization would make it possible to assess the biological impact of herbivore-induced growth suppression. Yet, to date, such an approach has not been taken. Consequently, our understanding of the consequences of defence prioritization for plant resistance has remained limited.</p><p>To dissect the signaling network that underlies growth defence trade-offs in rice, we identified OsWRKY70, an herbivory-induced Group I-type WRKY TF from rice, and elucidated its role in herbivore-induced defence prioritization. Through the use of in vivo and in vitro protein assays, molecular characterization and the creation of transgenic OsWRKY70 silenced and overexpressing plants combined with insect bioassays and a variety of phytohormone analyses, we evaluate the resistance benefits and trade-offs of defence prioritization against different herbivores and thereby reveal a new cost of defence prioritization.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>OsWRKY70 is an herbivory-induced, nucleus-localized, auto-regulated W-box transcriptional activator</title><p>Using suppressive subtractive hybridization (SSH), we screened rice plants for herbivory-induced TFs.

The full-length cDNA of the cloned <italic>OsWRKY</italic>, including an open reading frame (ORF) of 1719 bp, was obtained by reverse transcription PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Blast analysis showed that the sequence was 100% identical to the previously identified <italic>OsWRKY70</italic> (TIGR ID Os05g39720). OsWRKY70 has two WRKY domains and belongs to group I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rushton et al., 2010</xref>). Phylogenetic analysis of group I-type WRKYs from different species revealed that OsWRKY70 has two homologs in rice, OsWRKY24 and OsWRKY53, which share 53% and 51% amino acid sequence identity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).

The DNA-binding specificity was confirmed in a competition experiment using a 250-fold excess of the unlabeled probe BS65 as a competitor, for which no binding complexes were detected. When the W-box in BS65 was mutated from TTGACC to TCCTAC (mBS65), the binding complexes also disappeared. These results indicated that the recombinant OsWRKY70 protein specifically binds to the conserved W-box in the synthesized probe. To investigate whether OsWRKY70 has transcriptional activation activity, we fused the full-length <italic>OsWRKY70</italic> ORF in-frame to the GAL4 DNA-binding domain of the pGBKT7 vector and transformed it into yeast. The yeast transformed with pGBKT7 or pGBKT7-OsWRKY70 was plated on SD medium (−Trp) containing X-α-gal. After 12 hr at 30°C, the pGBKT7-OsWRKY70 transformant yeast colonies turned blue. In contrast, the pGBKT7 empty transformant yeast colonies remained white (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). OsWRKY70 is therefore likely functioning as a transcriptional activator in the yeast system. We found that the promoter region of WRKY70 contains four W-boxes, three reverse W-boxes (AGTCAA at −82 to −77, AGTCAA at −56 to −51, and GGTCAA at −49 to −44), and one forward W-box (TTGACC at −62 to −57), upstream of the transcription start site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>). To investigate if WRKY70 regulates its own expression, we first performed an EMSA assay by using the minimal promoter region of WRKY70 (86 bp upstream of transcription start site) as a probe. WRKY70-His can bind to this fragment, while adding 250-fold unlabeled probe resulted in no WRKY70-DNA complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Using WRKY70 promoter:<italic>GUS</italic> as a reporter and 35S: <italic>WRKY70-GFP</italic>, 35S:<italic>GFP</italic> as effectors expressed transiently in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic>, we found that WRKY70-GFP significantly increased the GUS activities compared to GFP alone, suggesting that WRKY70 can self-activate its transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>OsWRKY70 physically interacts with and is regulated by OsMPK3 and OsMPK6</title><p>MAPK proteins can specifically recognize the D domain found in some group I-type WRKYs and specifically phosphorylate the Ser residues of Group I SP clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ishihama et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mao et al., 2011</xref>). The D domain is a cluster of basic residues upstream of the LxL motif ([K/R]1–2-x2–6-[L/I]-x-[L/I]) and has been reported in some WRKYs to play an important role in determining the selectivity of interacting MAPKs and phosphorylation patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ishihama et al., 2011</xref>). OsWRKY70 has four SP clusters in the N-terminal region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) but has no D domains. We hypothesized that the D domain-deficient OsWRKY70 may nevertheless interact with the MAPKs, OsMPK3 and OsMPK6, the homologs of AtMPK3 and AtMPK6 in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and WIPK and SIPK in <italic>Nicotiana tabacum</italic>, respectively, all of which are involved in plant defence responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lu et al., 2011</xref>). We used a GST pull-down assay to analyse the interaction between OsWRKY70 and OsMPK3 or OsMPK6 in vitro. OsWRKY70-His was pulled down strongly by GST-MPK3 and mildly by GST-MPK6, suggesting that OsWRKY70 can interact with both OsMPK3 and OsMPK6, with the OsWRKY70–OsMPK3 interaction being more efficient than the OsWRKY70–OsMPK6 interaction in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). In vivo, we used a bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assay to confirm the interaction. Fluorescence was observed when nYFP-OsWRKY70 was co-injected with OsMPK3-cYFP or OsMPK6-cYFP, and the signals were in the nuclear compartment according to 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) staining. No fluorescence was observed when nYFP-OsWRKY70 was co-expressed with unfused cYFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Taken together, these results strongly suggest that OsMPK3 and OsMPK6 physically interact with OsWRKY70. In a next step, we investigated if OsWRKY70 is phosphorylated by OsMPK3 or OsMPK6. We used OsMKK4<sup>DD</sup>, a constitutively active form of OsMKK4, to activate recombinant OsMPK3 and OsMPK6 and then exposed them to OsWRKY70. The result showed that OsWRKY70 can be phosphorylated by both OsMPK3 and OsMPK6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Moreover, an EMSA assay revealed that phosphorylation did not alter the W-box-binding activity of OsWRKY70 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). We also investigated if phosphorylation enhances the transactivation activity of OsWRKY70 using <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> as a transient expression system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Li et al., 2014</xref>). As the constitutive expression of OsMKK4<sup>DD</sup> induces HR-like cell death in tobacco plants, we used an estradiol-inducible system of OsMKK4<sup>DD</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ishihama et al., 2011</xref>). Given that OsWRKY70 can auto-activate its promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C</xref>), we used WRKY70 promoter:<italic>GUS</italic> as a reporter and 35S:<italic>WRKY70-GFP</italic>, 35S:<italic>OsMPK3-YFP</italic>, 35S:<italic>OsMPK6-YFP</italic> as effectors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>).

These results show that phosphorylation of OsWRKY70 can increase transactivation activity, but not W-box binding activity, of OsWRKY70.<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04805.006</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Interactions between OsWRKY70 and OsMPK3/6.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Mean transcript levels (+SE, n = 5) of <italic>OsWRKY70</italic> in transgenic lines with silencing of OsMPK3 (irMPK3 lines, irMPK3-53, and irMPK3-183) or OsMPK6 (irMPK<italic>6</italic> lines, irMPK6-1, and irMPK6-2) after infested by SSB for 1 hr.

The accumulation of ethylene was similar in the irWRKY70 lines and WT plants, but the levels were significantly elevated in hemi-oeWRKY70 lines after SSB infestation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Consistent with this result, transcript levels of the ethylene biosynthesis gene <italic>OsACS2</italic> were similar in irWRKY70 and WT plants when infested by SSB, but were much higher in the induced hemi-oeWRKY70 lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>).

Isochorismate synthase (ICS) is a key enzyme in plant SA biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wu and Baldwin, 2010</xref>).

Taken together, these experiments demonstrate that OsWRKY70 positively regulates SSB-induced JA- and ET levels but negatively regulates SA levels. To explore the notion that OsWRKY70 may be an upstream regulator of the JA and ET pathways, we investigated the expression of <italic>OsWRKY70</italic> in transgenic plants with impaired JA and ET signaling.

Thus, we investigated the influence of OsWRKY70 on TrypPI activity and SSB performance.

When irWRKY70 lines and WT plants were exposed to a BPH colony, adult females preferred feeding on the WT rather than the irWRKY70 lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A,B</xref>). Similarly, BPH adult females laid more eggs on WT plants than irWRKY70 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A,B</xref>, inserts). In accordance with these findings, BPH adult females were found more often on hemi-oeWRKY70 lines than on WT plants and laid more eggs on the former than on the latter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C,D</xref>). Moreover, BPH nymphs fed on the irWRKY70 lines had lower survival rates than those fed on WT plants; in contrast, BPH nymphs fed on the hemi-oeWRKY70 lines had higher survival rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E,F</xref>), showing that OsWRKY70 negatively regulates rice BPH resistance. Based on the signaling profiles showing that OsWRKY70 negatively regulates GAs, we hypothesized that the down regulation of GAs may be responsible for the enhanced susceptibility to BPH. We therefore conducted a series of experiments to explore the influence of OsWRKY70 dependent GA on BPH.

This indirect additional cost of defence may lead to the evolution of divergent, herbivore-community dependent plant resistance strategies in nature and may significantly constrain efforts to breed herbivore-resistant plants. It has been well documented that there are trade-offs between plant growth and defence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zavala and Baldwin, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Meldau et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yang et al., 2012</xref>). Resource availability, competition, plant ontogeny, and herbivory can influence the allocation of resources to growth and defence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Stamp, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boege and Marquis, 2005</xref>). In nature, defence prioritization is complicated by the fact that plants are often attacked simultaneously by multiple herbivore species, which have different sensitivities to various defence strategies, leading to resistance trade-offs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Stam et al., 2014</xref>). For example, leaf-chewing caterpillars were found to perform better on <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> plants that are attacked by phloem-sucking aphids and <italic>vice versa</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Soler et al., 2012</xref>). Given that herbivory is an important driving force for the evolution of plant defence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agrawal et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Züst et al., 2012</xref>), understanding growth/defence and resistance trade-offs is important to predict and understand selection patterns in nature. Our study reveals that growth/defence and resistance trade-offs can emanate from the same mechanistic basis. From a plant's perspective, this suggests that reducing growth to support defence is even more costly than previously anticipated. From an agricultural point of view, this result indicates that it may be problematic to breed resistant varieties that rely on induced defence, as these plants may suffer from both a depression in growth and increased susceptibility to non-target herbivores.</p><p>The discovery and manipulation of a TF that directly regulates defence prioritization allows us to draw a detailed picture of the mechanisms that underlie defence prioritization in rice. OsWRKY70 is rapidly induced following mechanical wounding and SSB feeding, but not following attack by a piercing sucking herbivore. Despite a lacking D-domain, OsWRKY70 interacts with and is regulated by two MAP-kinases, OsMPK3 and OsMPK6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). It has been well documented that Group I-type WRKY TFs can be phosphorylated by MAPKs and that the SP clusters are the phosphorylating sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mao et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ishihama and Yoshioka, 2012</xref>). We found that both OsMPK3 and OsMPK6 phosphorylate OsWRKY70, which in turn increased the transactivation activity of OsWRKY70 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Moreover, OsWRKY70 can auto-regulate itself (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Given that autoregulation and cross-regulation are common features of WRKY action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ishihama and Yoshioka, 2012</xref>), OsWRKY70 transcript levels are likely reduced in OsMPK3 and 6 silenced lines because of the reduction in phosphorylated WRKY70 and other WRKYs, which decreases WRKY activity and thereby reduce OsWRKY70 transcript levels. Phytohormones on the other hand do not regulate OsWRKY70. Combined with its capacity to bind to W-box sequences and to act as transcriptional activator, this places OsWRKY70 at the interface between early recognition and signaling and hormonal regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rushton et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wu and Baldwin, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Erb et al., 2012</xref>). Indeed, silencing and over-expression of <italic>OsWRKY70</italic> demonstrates its central role in regulating defence and growth through JA, ET, SA, and GA signaling, which enables OsWRKY70 to reduce plant growth and increases defence upon herbivore attack. In other plant systems, WRKYs have also been reported to play important roles in the regulation of transcriptional reprogramming associated with plant growth, development, and stress responses at different levels, including upstream and downstream of protein kinases and hormones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rushton et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ishihama et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mao et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zheng et al., 2013</xref>). NaWRKY3 and NaWRKY6, the homologs of OsWRKY70 in <italic>N. attenuata</italic>, for instance, have been reported to function downstream of NaSIPK and NaWIPK and upstream of JA biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Skibbe et al., 2008</xref>). In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, AtWRKY33, the homolog of OsWRKY70 is phosphorylated by AtMPK3/MPK6 and can affect ET synthesis by directly binding promoter region of <italic>ACS2</italic> and <italic>ACS6</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Li et al., 2012</xref>). Another rice WRKY, OsWRKY24 has been reported to repress GA signaling in rice aleurone cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhang et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>OsWRKY70 may regulate phytohormone signaling via two, not mutually exclusive routes. First, it may directly bind to genes that are involved in hormone biosynthesis and signaling. Consistent with this hypothesis, OsWRKY70 positively modulated the transcript levels of the JA- and ET-synthesis genes <italic>OsHI-LOX</italic>, <italic>OsAOS2</italic>, and <italic>OsACS2</italic>, and negatively regulated the transcripts of the SA- and GA-biosynthesis genes <italic>OsICS1</italic> and <italic>OsGA20ox7</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5B,C,E,G</xref>). The existence of W-box or W-box like motifs in the promoters of these genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>) provides additional indirect evidence for their interaction with OsWRKY70. Second, OsWRKY may regulate growth and defence through indirect hormonal cross-talk. It has been reported that the JA-signaling pathway is connected to the GA-signaling pathway through COI1-JAZ1-DELLA-PIF complexes, resulting in mutual suppression. The activation of JA signaling inhibits GA-mediated plant growth, whereas the activation of the GA pathway inhibits JA-mediated plant defence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yang et al., 2012</xref>). Moreover, JA was found to inhibit GA biosynthesis via an unknown mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Heinrich et al., 2013</xref>), and the GA-GID1-DELLA complex was found to positively regulate the production of SA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Navarro et al., 2008</xref>). Thus, the observed phytohormone levels and associated phenotypes in the transgenic OsWRKY70 lines might be at least in part due to antagonistic and synergistic phytohormone crosstalk. It has also been reported that the absence of JA signaling enhances the sensitivity of plants to GAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yang et al., 2012</xref>). In our experiments, the promotion of JA signaling in oeWRKY70 lines did not decrease the sensitivity of plants to GA<sub>3</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). Moreover, the dwarf phenotype of oeWRKY70 lines was completely restored by exogenous GA<sub>3</sub> at low concentrations of 0.01 μM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). This suggests that the dwarf phenotype of oeWRKY70 lines is directly related to the low level of GAs and that the sensitivity of plants to GAs may be influenced by other <italic>OsWRKY70</italic>-mediated factors other than JA. Interestingly, irWRKY70 lines showed similar growth phenotypes to WT plants, indicating that GA levels are unlikely to be altered in irWRKY70 lines. This suggests an involvement of other factors, such as the homologs of OsWRKY70, OsWRKY24, and OsWRKY53, in the biosynthesis of GAs. Overall, the combination of direct regulation and indirect phytohormone crosstalk may explain how a single TF can act as a node in multiple signaling processes and integrate growth and defence responses.</p><p>Our experiments do not only connect OsWRKY70 with phytohormone signaling, but also illustrate how hormonal signaling affects resistance responses against different herbivores. In rice, it is well documented that TrypPIs are an effective JA-dependent defence against chewing herbivores, including SSB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhou et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lu et al., 2011</xref>). Here, we found that OsWRKY70 positively mediated the production of elicited JA and TrypPIs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7A</xref>), which subsequently modulated resistance in rice to SSB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B–D</xref>). Moreover, JA complementation of irWRKY70 lines, which had lower herbivore-elicited JA levels, completely restored TrypPI activity and SSB resistance compared to equally treated WT plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E,F</xref>). These data suggest that OsWRKY70-mediated resistance in rice to SSB is mainly due to its effect on the JA-signaling pathway. On the other hand, little is known so far about the role of GA in herbivore resistance against piercing-sucking insects. We found that GA<sub>3</sub> application restored BPH resistance in hemi-oeWRKY70 mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D–F</xref>). Moreover, the GA-deficient mutant <italic>sd-1</italic> improved the performance of BPH, whereas the GA-excessive mutant <italic>eui</italic> decreased BPH performance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A–C</xref>). These data demonstrate that the GA-signaling pathway plays an important role in modulating resistance in rice to BPH in addition to its regulation of plant growth. GA-modulated BPH resistance in rice may occur via two mechanisms. One is that GA directly regulates the BPH defence response. It has been reported that GA can positively modulate the pathogen-related <italic>PBZ1</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tanaka et al., 2006</xref>) and cell modification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yang et al., 2008</xref>). The rigidity of the cell wall is important for resistance to BPH phloem-feeding. Moreover, GA can directly elicit the plant growth, which may enhance the tolerance of rice to BPH. Another possibility is that GA indirectly regulates BPH resistance by eliciting SA and ROS pathways, both of which have been reported to be involved in resistance of rice to BPH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhou et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lu et al., 2011</xref>), via GA-GID1-DELLA complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Navarro et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alonso-Ramírez et al., 2009</xref>). Thus far, several other elements of the rice defense signaling cascade, including JA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhou et al., 2009</xref>), OsERF3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lu et al., 2011</xref>), and ethylene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lu et al., 2014</xref>) have also been shown to have similar divergent effects on SSB and BPH, suggesting distinct resistance strategies of rice plants against these two herbivores. The main reason for the divergent signaling, response and resistance to the two herbivores might be their different feeding habits. Resistance mechanisms against phloem-feeders are well documented to differ substantially from mechanisms against chewing herbivores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bostock, 2005</xref>).</p><p>In summary, our experiments provide evidence for a key role of OsWRKY70 in defence prioritization and illustrate that reducing growth via GA signaling opens the door to secondary infection by non-target herbivores. When attacked by a chewing herbivore such as SSB, rice plants will recognize signals derived from the herbivore and activate OsMPK3 and OsMPK6. The activated OsMPK3 and OsMPK6 then elicit OsWRKY70, which subsequently activates the JA- and ET-signaling pathways, resulting in the production of defence compounds such as TrypPIs and an increase in plant resistance. Simultaneously, the activation of OsWRKY70 decreases the production of GAs, which inhibits plant growth and thus prioritizes defence overgrowth and leads to increased susceptibility to BPH. Through these results, our study illustrates that the transcriptional modulation of hormonal networks allows plants to mount an appropriate defence program. At the same time, however, prioritizing defence over growth leads to significant resistance trade-offs, which may constrain plant resistance breeding and favor the evolution of herbivore-specific responses in plants.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plant growth and insects</title><p>The following rice genotypes were used in the present study: (i) Xiushui 11 WT plants and the corresponding transgenic lines irWRKY70, hemi-oeWRKY70 (see below), as-<italic>lox</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhou et al., 2009</xref>), as-<italic>acs</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lu et al., 2011</xref>), irMPK3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wang et al., 2013</xref>), irMPK6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) and (ii) Zhonghua 11 (ZH11) WT plants and the corresponding GA mutants <italic>sd-1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Spielmeyer et al., 2002</xref>) and <italic>eui</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zhu et al., 2006</xref>).

Your full submission has been evaluated by Deputy Editor Detlef Weigel, a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and two peer reviewers. The decision was reached after discussions between the reviewers. Based on our discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>The agreement was that the work is interesting, but does not represent a sufficiently major advance, as the molecular mechanisms underlying some of your key observations remain unclear. For example, it would have been important to demonstrate what the consequences of the observed physical interaction of OsWRKY70 with MAPK3/6 are. One would expect that, similar to what has been found for the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> orthologue AtWRKY33, this interaction results in enhanced phosphorylation. But if this were the case, what would be the consequence of this phosphorlyation event: enhanced binding of OsWRKY33 to the W-box, degradation of OsWRKY70, or some other effect.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This manuscript focuses on the function of the rice gene OsWRK70 in regulating plant defense and growth. OsWRK70 is a homolog of the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> AtWRKY33 and <italic>Nicotiana attenuata</italic> NaWRKY3 and NaWRKY6 genes, which have previously been shown to function early in plant defense. The methodology seems correct and the conclusions do not go beyond what is shown by the data.</p><p>Specific comments:</p><p>1) In the current study, the authors present a number of findings: (1) OsWRK70 expression is increased by SSB feeding, but not jasmonate, salicylate, or ethylene; (2) OsWRK70 is localized to the nucleus, where it activates gene expression by binding to W-box motifs and physically interacts with OsMPK3 and OsMPK6, which are also required for up-regulating OsWRK70 transcription; (3) several approaches show that OsWRK70 positively regulates plant defense via JA and negatively regulates plant growth via GA; (4) high levels of OsWRK70 limit SSB growth but improve BPH growth. These findings are consistent with functions that have been reported previously for the corresponding <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> (AtWRKY33) and <italic>Nicotiana attenuata</italic> (NaWRKY3 and NaWRKY6) genes, as well as with earlier publications showing negative interactions between jasmonate and gibberellin signaling. Prior to the current manuscript, no publication has put these findings together in such a specific manner to illustrate a tradeoff in plant defense and growth based on a single transcription factor. Nevertheless, the manuscript as a whole seems more incremental than ground-breaking.</p><p>2) The section on regulation of OsWRK70 by OsMPK3 and OsMPK6 has some missing links. Although binding to OsWRK70 is demonstrated, the authors do not show that OsWRK70 is phosphorylated. I had expected some sort of demonstration that OsMPK3 and/or OsMPK6 modify OsWRK70 activity. However, the main phenotype that is demonstrated is reduced OsWRK70 transcription in lines with expression-silenced OsMPK3 and OsMPK6. Does this mean that OsWRK70 up-regulates its own transcription after binding to OsMPK3 and OsMPK6? Does the OsWRK70 have a W-box motif? Or do the authors have some other explanation for the transcriptional up-regulation.</p><p>3) Based on the authors' results, there seems to be a positive interaction between GA-mediated BPH defense and growth, i.e. stronger defense equals more growth and vice versa. This seems to run counter to the overall hypothesis of a trade-off between plant defense and growth. I realize that this is a bit peripheral to the main theme of the manuscript, but perhaps the authors can comment on this in the Discussion. Why is the rice BPH interaction so different from the rice-SSB interaction?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The paper reports on the role of a rice transcription factor, OsWRKY70, in modulating resistance/susceptibility towards the chewing herbivore <italic>C. suppressalis</italic> (rice striped stem borer SSB) and the rice brown plant hopper <italic>N. lugens</italic> (BPH). The presented data imply that OsWRKY70, which is induced upon SSB challenge but not by BPH, positively regulates JA/ET levels, and functions upstream of JA and ET signaling. Using two independent RNAi knock-down and OsWRKY70 overexpressor (OE) lines each, the authors show that OsWRKY70 positively regulates resistance to SSB but negatively affects resistance to BPH. The authors demonstrate that OsWRKY70 physically interacts with OsMPK3 and OsMPK6, and that silencing of these MAP kinases results in decreased levels of OsWRKY70 transcript. OsWRKY70-mediated SSB resistance very likely occurs via increased JA-dependent trypsin protease inhibitor activities. OsWRKY70 also appears to be a negative regulator of GA biosynthesis since OsWRKY70 OE lines show significantly lower GA levels when compared to wildtype plants. The negative regulation of BPH resistance by OsWRKY70 appears to be through GA signaling.</p><p>Overall the paper contains interesting results and the experiments in most cases appear to be properly performed and documented. However there are several issues that need to be addressed. My major concern however, is that several key aspects of the paper rely mainly on data obtained by gross overexpression of the OsWRKY70 transcription factor. These plants (even the hemizygous lines used in the study) show strong pleiotropic affects. Thus, how valid some of uncovered molecular mechanisms are under normal physiological conditions remains an open question.</p><p>Specific points:</p><p>1) As a general comment I feel that the authors should replace the abbreviations often used in the different figures to make it easier for the reader to follow the story. For example: In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> the silencing lines for MPK6 are designated as irMPK6-1 and irMPK6-2 but similar lines for MPK3 are designated P3i-53 and P3i-183. Suggestion: replace this by irMPK3-53 and irMPK3-183.</p><p>The OsWRKY70 silencing lines are designated ir7 and ir8, whereas the hemizygous OsWRKY70 overexpressor lines are designated hemi-oe8 and hemi-oe17 in various figures. I would suggest obvious names such as irWRLY70-7, irWRKY70-8, oeWRKY70-8, and oeWRKY70-17.</p><p>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>. The pull-down data concerning interaction of OsWRKY70 with OsMPK6 is not convincing. Considering that the GST-MPK6 protein is larger than the GST-MPK3 protein on the Coomassie stained gel, I do not find the weak band detected by the anti-WRKY70 antibody for GST-MPK6 on the western blot to be convincing particularly as it appears to be of the same size as the GST-MPK3 band. This needs improvement.</p><p>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>. The gel is of very poor quality and needs to be improved. Detection of the shifted band is very weak and is also still somewhat observed when the mutated probe (OsWRKY70 + mBS65) is used. Moreover, the EMSA experiments are not described in Materials and methods.</p><p>4) I do not feel that the transcriptional profiling data actually adds much to the paper. These experiments were performed using the OsWRKY70 overexpressor plants not infested with the herbivore. Thus, only a few genes were identified whose expression was solely dependent on OsWRKY70. It is not clear to me why SSB-induced WT plants, and OsWRKY70 overexpressor plants induced by SSB were not included. Indeed, nearly none of the genes further analyzed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) in later parts of the paper <italic>(OsHI-LOX, OsAOS2, OsACS2, OsWRKY24, OsWRKY53</italic>) were detected (see Table 1 and 2). Are any of the identified differentially expressed genes depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref> altered in their expression upon SSB infestation?</p><p>5) Were GA levels in the RNAi lines tested? Are GA levels higher than WT in such plants?</p><p>6) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>: Not all W-box elements highlighted are true functional elements. The W-box is not merely defined by the core TGAC sequence shown.</p><p>7) There is substantial variation for the WT values in the experiments depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E and F</xref>. For example in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref> BPH survival rates on WT decline from 100% to 60% within 12 days in this set of experiments (that include the overexpressors), but only decline from 100% to 85% in the experiments shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref> (that include the RNAi lines). Why is this? Are these types of experiments highly variable and if so, how confident can one be about such results?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04805.021</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>Based on your comments, we decided to perform a series of additional experiments to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of WRK70 regulation in rice.

Also, negative interactions between jasmonate and gibberellin signaling via COI1-JAZ1-DELLA-PIF complexes have been documented. The strength of our paper is the combination of mechanistic depth with biological relevance. On a mechanistic level, we show for the first time that a WRKY transcription factor directly regulates GA-JA crosstalk. On a biological level, we demonstrate that this regulation is responsible for growth defense trade-offs. Furthermore, we demonstrate that prioritizing defense over growth against one herbivore also leads to an additional cost by reducing resistance against another herbivore. In our opinion, this is not an incremental finding, but a new mechanism for defense trade-offs in plants which has important implications for the evolution and agricultural exploitation of induced resistance.</p><p><italic>2) The section on regulation of OsWRK70 by OsMPK3 and OsMPK6 has some missing links.

Or do the authors have some other explanation for the transcriptional up-regulation</italic>.</p><p>We appreciate this comment. It has been well documented that Group I-type WRKY TFs can be phosphorylated by MAPKs and that the SP clusters are the phosphorylating sites (Ishihama et al., 2012; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mao et al., 2011</xref>). Like <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> NbWRKY8, <italic>Arabiodpsis</italic> AtWRKY33 and rice OsWRKY53, OsWRKY70 also has SP clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Here, we observed that OsWRKY70 is phosphorylated by OsMAPK3 and OsMAPK6 via their physical interactions, and this phosphorylation enhances the thansactivation activity of OsWRKY70 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Moreover, OsWRKY70 contains W-boxes in its promoter region and OsWRKY70 can auto-regulate its expression by binding its own promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Therefore, OsWRKY70 transcript levels are likely reduced in OsMAPK3 and 6 silenced lines because of the reduction in phosphorylated WRKY70 and other WRKYs, which decreases WRKY activity and thereby reduces OsWRKY70 transcript levels.</p><p><italic>3) Based on the authors' results, there seems to be a positive interaction between GA-mediated BPH defense and growth, i.e. stronger defense equals more growth and vice versa.

To overcome this problem, we used three different strategies. First, we used hemizygous OsWRKY70 overexpressing lines, which show a much weaker growth phenotype. Second, we created both OsWRKY70 overexpressing and silenced lines. The silenced lines did not show any growth phenotype and therefore do not suffer from any growth-related limitations. Third, we have performed hormonal complementation assays to demonstrate the causal relation between OsWRKY70 dependent signaling and herbivore resistance. Together, we are confident that the reported mechanisms and effects of OsWRKY are robust and valid.</p><p><italic>Specific points</italic>:</p><p><italic>1) As a general comment I feel that the authors should replace the abbreviations often used in the different figures to make it easier for the reader to follow the story.

Thus, the data is important to understand the motivation for many of the follow-up experiments.
