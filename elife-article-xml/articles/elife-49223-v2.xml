Consequently, its polyubiquitination activity in complex with the RING-finger ubiquitin ligase TRAF6 and the downstream NF-κB inflammatory response is silenced. The precise role of deamidation in silencing the UBC13/TRAF6 complex is unknown. We report that deamidation inhibits the interaction between UBC13 and TRAF6 RING-domain (TRAF6<sup>RING</sup>) by perturbing both the native and transient interactions. Deamidation creates a new intramolecular salt-bridge in UBC13 that competes with a critical intermolecular salt-bridge at the native UBC13/TRAF6<sup>RING</sup> interface. Moreover, the salt-bridge competition prevents transient interactions necessary to form a typical UBC13/RING complex. Repulsion between E100 and the negatively charged surface of RING also prevents transient interactions in the UBC13/RING complex. Our findings highlight a mechanism wherein a post-translational modification perturbs the conformation and stability of transient complexes to inhibit protein-protein association.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p><italic>Shigella</italic> is a highly infectious group of bacteria that attack the human digestive tract, causing severe and often deadly diarrhoea, especially in children. There is currently no vaccine to protect against the disease, and some strains are also now resistant to antibiotics. People get infected by eating or drinking contaminated foods and water.

Normally, infected cells send out chemical signals that act like a call for help, attracting specialised immune cells to clear the infection.

The human pathogenic bacteria <italic>Shigella flexneri</italic> inactivates the host inflammatory Nf-κB signaling, responsible for inducing inflammatory cytokine responses during pathogen invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sanada et al., 2012</xref>). In the early events of interleukin-dependent activation of Nf-κB signaling, the Ub-conjugating enzyme UBC13, and the Ub-ligase TRAF6 function together to synthesize both unanchored polyubiquitin chains, and anchored polyubiquitin chains on TRAF6 and its substrate NEMO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen, 2005</xref>). These chains serve as a scaffold to bring together TAK1/2 and IKK kinases, eventually leading to phosphorylation and activation of the IKK kinases, IκB degradation and nuclear translocation of transcription factor Nf-κB. To inactivate Nf-κB signaling, <italic>Shigella flexneri</italic> secretes a Type III effector called OspI, which functions as a deamidase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sanada et al., 2012</xref>). OspI specifically targets a glutamine residue in UBC13 and converts it to glutamate (Q100E). Ubiquitination reactions of TRAF6 either with UBC13 in the presence of OspI or with mutant Q100E-UBC13 (dUBC13) show a significant drop in polyubiquitination activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sanada et al., 2012</xref>). However, the mechanism underlying inhibition of polyubiquitination by deamidation of UBC13 remains unclear.</p><p>Ubiquitination is a eukaryotic post-translational modification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Komander and Rape, 2012</xref>), wherein the last glycine residue in the C-terminal tail of Ubiquitin (Ub) is activated and covalently attached to a substrate lysine residue. Ubiquitination involves three steps: an initial activation and thioester conjugation by the Ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1), followed by the thioester conjugation to the Ubiquitin-conjugating (E2) enzymes, and a final step in which the Ub is covalently attached to the substrate amino group. The last step is typically catalyzed by a class of Ubiquitin ligases (E3), which contain either a RING (Really Interesting New Gene)-finger domain, U-box domain or HECT domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Metzger et al., 2012</xref>). The RING-finger/U-box domain stabilizes a catalytic-closed conformation of the flexible E2 ~Ub species and drastically enhances the rate of Ub conjugation to substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dou et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Plechanovová et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pruneda et al., 2012</xref>). The E2 UBC13 functions with several RING-finger E3s like TRAF6 to synthesize K63-linked poly-Ub chains that function to activate DNA repair or immune response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fukushima et al., 2007</xref>). Apart from the E3s, UBC13 also binds a co-factor MMS2, which does not activate UBC13 but maintains the linkage specificity of the poly-Ub chains synthesized by UBC13 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Branigan et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we have investigated the mechanisms underlying the inactivation of UBC13 upon deamidation using NMR spectroscopy, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, and in-vitro ubiquitination assays. We report that deamidation weakens the non-covalent interaction of UBC13 with RING-finger domain of TRAF6 (TRAF6<sup>RING</sup>), without perturbing UBC13 structure or the intrinsic enzymatic activity of UBC13. However, the underlying cause of reduced interaction is nonintuitive since Q100 is in the vicinity of UBC13/TRAF6<sup>RING</sup> interface but does not form any contact with the TRAF6<sup>RING</sup>. Further studies showed that deamidation disrupts the interaction between UBC13 and TRAF6<sup>RING</sup> by three mechanisms: i) A new intramolecular R14/E100 salt-bridge appears in dUBC13, which competes with a critical intermolecular salt-bridge in the native complex, ii) the salt-bridge competition also perturbs the UBC13/TRAF6<sup>RING</sup> transient complexes to inhibit association, and iii) transient repulsion between the negatively charged E100 and the negatively charged interface of TRAF6<sup>RING</sup> reduces association between UBC13 and TRAF6<sup>RING</sup>. The effect of each mechanism on the binding was confirmed by binding studies using appropriate substitutions in either UBC13 or TRAF6<sup>RING</sup>. The impact of deamidation on transient interactions was also observed using another RING domain from RNF38, indicating that the mechanism could be ubiquitous for UBC13/RING complexes. Our study highlights that deamidation of residues that do not directly participate in the E2/E3 interaction but are close to the interface can effectively modulate the interaction by perturbing the native and transient intermolecular contacts. The mechanism of regulating protein-protein transient interactions by post-translational modifications could be at play in other quintessential signaling pathways.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Deamidation abolishes the interaction between UBC13 and TRAF6<sup>RING</sup></title><p>Two different constructs of TRAF6 was used in this study.

Perturbations due to the altered chemical environment upon ligand binding induce changes in the chemical shift of the backbone amide resonances. The chemical shift perturbations (CSP) plotted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> shows that the significant perturbations in UBC13 occur in the α1-helix, and the loop between α<sub>3-10</sub> and α2-helix, which is the canonical UBC13 interface in the complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G and H</xref>). The resonance shifts can be plotted against the ligand: protein concentration, and fit to yield the dissociation constant (K<sub>d</sub>) of interaction.

The absence of major CSPs in the rest of dUBC13 indicated that deamidation did not change the fold of UBC13. Moreover, analysis of the backbone and C<sub>β</sub> chemical shifts in dUBC13 confirmed that the secondary structure was unperturbed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>).

A rough estimate of the K<sub>d</sub> was obtained by comparing the CSPs at the UBC13 interface at the same protein: ligand concentration between UBC13 and dUBC13, which suggested the K<sub>d</sub> of 6.34 (±2.6) mM. If the reduced affinity is precisely due to the negative charge at residue 100, then substitution of Q100 with a neutral amino acid should not affect the affinity of the complex.

However, when Q100 was substituted with another acidic residue aspartate (D), the affinity dropped significantly (Kd ~4.6 (±1.8)) mM, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>), confirming that substitution at Q100 with a negatively charged residue inhibited the interaction between UBC13 and TRAF6<sup>RING</sup>.

The new salt-bridge involving R14 and E100 in dUBC13 was further investigated by NMR. <sup>15</sup>N-edited HSQCs of the Arginine Nε-Hε groups were collected for both UBC13 and dUBC13, which showed shifted resonances for the arginine sidechains (R7, R14, and R102) around residue E100, indicating that these sidechain conformations are perturbed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Unfortunately, the <sup>1</sup>Hη atoms are invisible in the NMR spectra due to chemical exchange with the solvent at physiological pH, and millisecond timescale rotations around the Cζ-Nη/Cζ-Nε bonds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Hence, detection of arginine sidechain-mediated interactions (hydrogen bonds and salt-bridges) through <sup>1</sup>Hη atoms is difficult.

A typical RING domain from the E3 RNF38 (RNF38<sup>RING</sup>, aa: 387–465) was chosen to study the effect of UBC13 deamidation in such cases. RNF38<sup>RING</sup> can activate UBC13 to synthesize polyubiquitin chains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>).

Fitting of peak shifts against ligand: protein ratio yielded the K<sub>d</sub> to be 0.25 mM, which corresponds to a 6-fold drop in affinity.

The K<sub>d</sub> of R14A-UBC13/RNF38<sup>RING</sup> showed a 2.5-fold increase and reduced binding energy by 0.6 kcal/mol. Since the effect of R14A substitution on the native complex is 0.2 kcal/mol, the effect on the transient complex is 0.4 kcal/mol. Deamidation reduces the binding energy by 1.1 kcal/mol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9I</xref>). Given the salt-bridge competition reduces binding energy by 0.6 kcal/mol, the repulsive effect of E100 on the transient complex is 0.5 kcal/mol.

TRAF6<sup>RING</sup> could effectively discharge Ub from UBC13 ~ Ub, but not from dUBC13 ~ Ub (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10D,G,H</xref>). Similarly, RNF38<sup>RING</sup> could discharge Ub from UBC13 ~ Ub but not from dUBC13 ~ Ub (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10E,I,J</xref>). When the concentration of the RNF38<sup>RING</sup> was increased by five-fold to compensate for the reduced affinity of dUBC13/RING complex, the rate of Ub discharge improved, which confirmed that the cause of the inefficient discharge is the reduced affinity of dUBC13/RING interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10K and F</xref>).</p><p>The lysine of the acceptor Ub at the growing end of a poly-Ub chain (either unanchored or anchored on a substrate), attacks the E2 ~Ub active site to transfer the donor Ub. The kinetics of single-round di-Ubiquitin (Ub<sub>2</sub>) synthesis was monitored to investigate if the deamidation of UBC13 affects the activity of UBC13 and its interaction with acceptor lysine at the active site. Here the lysine of the acceptor Ub mimics the acceptor lysine of growing poly-Ub chain. UBC13 (or dUBC13) was conjugated with donor K63A-Ub. Then Mms2, RNF38<sup>RING</sup> and acceptor D77-Ub was added in the reaction mix, which was then monitored over time to detect the synthesis of Ub<sub>2</sub>. The rate of Ub<sub>2</sub> synthesis was rapid for UBC13 but slow for dUBC13 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10L</xref>). Kinetic analysis indicated that the reaction rate for the dUBC13/RING complex is similar to the rate of UBC13 in the absence of RING (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10M</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s2">Figure 10—figure supplement 2</xref>), indicating that the catalytic effect of RING is absent in the dUBC13/RING complex. A comparison of the kinetic parameters between UBC13 and dUBC13 indicated that deamidation does not significantly affect the Km of the substrate, but drastically affects the Kcat of the reaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10N</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s2">Figure 10—figure supplement 2</xref>). This confirms that the area around the active site is not perturbed by deamidation, as was observed by NMR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Furthermore, in the absence of a RING domain, the Kcat of UBC13 and dUBC13 is similar, confirming that the catalytic activity of UBC13 is unaffected upon deamidation, similar to the observation of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>. However, unlike UBC13, the Kcat of dUBC13 does not increase in the presence of RING, confirming that RING domains fail to bind and activate the dUBC13 ~Ub conjugate.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Protein deamidation can have significant functional consequences for innate immune signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zhao et al., 2016</xref>), which justifies its emergence as a powerful tool employed by pathogenic bacteria to suppress the immune response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Washington et al., 2013</xref>). However, little is known about the molecular mechanism underlying deactivation of immune signaling by deamidation. The <italic>Shigella</italic> flexneri effector OspI suppresses the inflammatory response (NF-κB pathway) via deamidation of UBC13 at Q100. By an unknown mechanism, deamidation of Q100 to E100 inhibits the synthesis of K63-linked polyubiquitin chains by the UBC13/TRAF6 complex, preventing the downstream activation of NF-κB pathway. Q100 is present at the vicinity of UBC13/TRAF6 interface but does not form direct contact with TRAF6. We report that deamidation neither alters the fold nor the enzymatic activity of UBC13. NMR and kinetics studies indicate that deamidation does not alter the active site of UBC13. Instead, it reduces the interaction between UBC13 and RING domains to diminish the catalytic effect of the RING. The interaction with TRAF6 is inhibited because E100 in dUBC13 competes with an intermolecular R14/E69 salt-bridge at the dUBC13/TRAF6<sup>RING</sup> interface to form an intramolecular salt-bridge, which destabilizes the native complex. The new intramolecular salt-bridge also inhibits the long-range transient interactions formed by R14 with TRAF6<sup>RING</sup>. In addition, repulsive interactions between E100 and the negatively charged interface of TRAF6<sup>RING</sup> destabilize the transient complexes. Cumulatively, these mechanisms reduced the binding energy between UBC13 and TRAF6<sup>RING</sup> by 1.69 kcal/mol. Consequently, its efficiency in activating the UBC13 ~Ub conjugate drops by 6-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10F</xref>). The effect of deamidation is also manifested in another UBC13/RING complex. Deamidation reduced the rate of Ub-discharge and the rate of Ub<sub>2</sub> synthesis by several folds in the UBC13/RNF38<sup>RING</sup> complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10F and N</xref>). These results provide first insights into the molecular mechanism behind the inactivation of the Ubiquitin pathway by bacterial deamidation.</p><p>For several E3s like RNF38, the RING domain can function as a monomer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Buetow et al., 2015</xref>). For others like TRAF6, the RING domains function as dimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Middleton et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yin et al., 2009</xref>). Since deamidation perturbed the binding of UBC13 to both TRAF6 and RNF38, it is likely that deamidation inactivates UBC13 for both homo/hetero-dimeric RING-E3s. In dimeric RINGs like TRAF6, the proximal RING interacts with one unit of UBC13 ~ Ub, and the distal RING interacts with the donor Ub of another UBC13 ~ Ub. Additionally, for TRAF6 dimer, the first zinc-finger following the RING domain of one protomer also interacts with the donor Ub of the UBC13 ~ Ub bound to another protomer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Middleton et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s3">Figure 10—figure supplement 3</xref>). However, the binding between UBC13 and TRAF6<sup>RING</sup> is independent of dimerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yin et al., 2009</xref>), indicating that binding between UBC13 and proximal RING is primary. Indeed, deamidation inhibited the binding of UBC13 to both TRAF6<sup>RING</sup> and to the longer dimeric TRAF6<sup>RZ3</sup>, confirming that secondary interactions between Ub/RING or Ub/zinc-finger cannot compensate for the loss of primary E2/RING interaction.</p><p>Though the interface of a protein complex has numerous interacting residues, a few hotspot residues contribute significantly to the binding energy than the rest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Moreira et al., 2007</xref>). Hotspot prediction algorithms reported R14 to be a hotspot at the UBC13/TRAF6<sup>RING</sup> interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Meireles et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zhu and Mitchell, 2011</xref>). Analysis of all the UBC13/RING (or U-box) structures shows that intermolecular salt-bridges involving R14 are present in several of the UBC13/RING complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref>). Binding studies by isothermal titration calorimetry measured that R14A substitution reduced the binding energy of UBC13/ZNRF1<sup>RING</sup> complex by ~1.2 kcal mol<sup>−1</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Behera et al., 2018</xref>). Similarly, our NMR titrations measured that R14A substitution reduced the binding energy by ~1.4 kcal mol<sup>−1</sup> in the UBC13/TRAF6<sup>RING</sup> complex. Altogether, R14 appears to be a hotspot at the UBC13/TRAF6<sup>RING</sup> interface. Deamidation of UBC13 disrupts the salt-bridge between R14 and E69 due to competition from E100, which destabilizes the UBC13/TRAF6<sup>RING</sup> complex. Recently, the salt-bridge competition or ‘theft’ mechanism was observed in the binding switch of Raf Kinase Inhibitory Protein (RKIP) to either Raf-1 or GPCR-kinase 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Skinner et al., 2017</xref>). Phosphorylation of S153 in RKIP created a new salt-bridge between pS153 and K157, which disrupted the pre-existing salt-bridges involving K157 and resulted in the local unfolding of RKIP. The unfolding inhibited binding of RKIP to Raf-1 but promoted its binding to GPCR-kinase 2. Unlike RKIP, deamidation does not alter the local fold of UBC13. While intramolecular salt-bridges compete within RKIP, the competition is between an intermolecular and intramolecular salt-bridge in UBC13.</p><p>Besides the hotspots, electrostatic substitutions at the vicinity of the interface can considerably increase protein-protein association and affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Selzer et al., 2000</xref>). Such substitutions would shift the equilibrium between native and transient complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Volkov et al., 2010</xref>). The proper conformation of transient complexes is vital for two proteins to form a stable, productive complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Schilder and Ubbink, 2013</xref>). How PTMs affect native protein-protein interactions observed in the ground state structure of the complex is well appreciated. However, little is known about how PTMs can affect higher energy transient complexes. PTMs like phosphorylation, eliminylation, and deamidation can change the surface electrostatics of a protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ribet and Cossart, 2010</xref>) to modulate the conformation and population of transient complexes significantly. By a combination of all-atom simulations and experimental data, this study provides molecular details of how PTMs can modulate transient protein-protein association to inhibit interaction. In the dUBC13/RNF38 complex, deamidation majorly alters transient association. Nonetheless, this causes a 10-fold drop in the catalytic activity of the complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10N</xref>), indicating that modifying the transient protein-protein association can severely affect function.</p><p>The fate of the polyubiquitinated substrate depends on the linkage specificity of the conjugated polyubiquitin chain, which in turn depends on the specificity of the E2/E3 interaction. Rationally designed E2/E3 interactions can change the fate and function of cellular proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">van Wijk et al., 2009</xref>). Hence, the interfacial contacts that determine E2/E3 specificities are a subject of intense research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Christensen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Soss et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">van Wijk et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">van Wijk et al., 2012</xref>).

This work provides evidence that transient interactions have an equally significant role in E2/E3 interaction and function. Rational design strategies will improve significantly by incorporating transient E2/E3 interactions.</p><p>In several cases, the native interactions cannot explain the functional implications of PTMs. This study introduces a new approach to understand the functional role of PTMs by considering their transient interactions. For example, spontaneous deamidation (non-enzymatic) is rampant in age-onset diseases, including neurodegenerative and ocular diseases. Deamidation of amylin accelerates its aggregation and amyloid formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dunkelberger et al., 2012</xref>). Crystallins deamidate with age, which promotes its aggregation to trigger cataract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pande et al., 2015</xref>). Crystallin surfaces are highly charged, and possibly deamidation alters their charge distribution to promote non-native association leading to aggregation. However, the sites of deamidation on crystallins do not provide a clear mechanism of the process.

detailed analysis of how hydrolysis of a single amino acid by a pathogenic enzyme can inactivate a ubiquitin E3 ligase. A particular strength of the manuscript is its integration of NMR structural analysis, computational modeling, and well performed enzymatic experiments. This paper stands out for its mechanistic biochemical rigor in explaining how an infectious organism can attenuate the inflammatory response to promote its ability to survive in a human host.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Deamidation disrupts native and transient contacts to weaken the interaction between UBC13 and RING-finger E3 ligases&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by four peer reviewers, including Lew E Kay as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Philip Cole as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>All reviewers were impressed with the breadth of the biophysics that was brought to the problem, but several felt that a number of the claims were not sufficiently rigorously supported by the data. In addition, it was felt that the paper was lengthy and very detailed, to the point that it might not receive the interest from the readership that it deserves. In a suitably revised version we ask that the points raised below be adequately addressed, in particular, ensuring that individual claims are clearly supported by associated data.</p><p>Major points:</p><p>1) In addition to examining the UBC13/TRAF complex they also look at a second interaction involving UBC13/RNF38. The attribute the lack of a 'E69' in RNF38 to indicating that the loss of observed catalysis upon deamidation in this system is due to perturbation of transient complexes. We think more justification of this statement is required. For example, the corresponding Arg that would normally participate in the inter-molecular contact in this case would now be 'free'. Cant this influence the bound complex as well? If this Arg could form an intra-interaction (like R14-E100 in the TRAF complex) then this would 'sequester' the Arg which otherwise (in the Q100 protein) might be available at the interface in the fully bound complex. So we could certainly imagine changes to the final complex as well.</p><p>2) The data quite convincingly show a defect caused by replacement of Q100 with an acidic side-chain, and of a mutation in the nearby Arg14. The work is comprehensive and considers both direct effects of mutations and indirect effects of competition for salt bridges. The present study goes to great lengths to provide a physical explanation for the defects caused by mutations. The quality of the work is high, but we feel that the detailed and focused nature of the study will primarily be of interest to specialists who study effects of charge mutations on protein-protein interactions. With this in mind the authors are asked to provide a revised copy that is more cogent so that the general readership can obtain a better appreciation of the work.</p><p>3) In general, the methodology is adequate for the purpose of the calculations presented, but the authors should provide more statistical analysis to support the significance of their results. Failing which, some of the conclusions are overstated: &quot;The repulsive interaction destabilized the complex […] and triggered its dissociation. The R14/E100 intramolecular salt-bridge formed soon after dissociation, which would prevent further transient association between R14 and TRAF6 residues.&quot; These conclusions are overstated as the authors have not quantified the strength of either salt bridge, the observations of transient contacts are anecdotal (only one window was analyzed in Figure 6), and causality is not established. Similar comments apply to the data shown in Figure 8.</p><p>&quot;The intramolecular salt-bridge is dominant and effectively outcompetes the intermolecular salt bridge (Figure 5E).&quot; But Figure 5E only shows that, in one of many simulations, the former replaces the latter at sufficiently long intermolecular distances. In addition, Figure 4D shows that the intermolecular salt bridge is more populated than the intramolecular one in the complex, which argues against the &quot;dominance&quot; of the latter. &quot;Transient complex theory&quot; calculations using the TransComp server are mentioned but not described. They should be described in Materials and methods in enough detail that they can be reproduced by competent researchers.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.49223.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>All reviewers were impressed with the breadth of the biophysics that was brought to the problem, but several felt that a number of the claims were not sufficiently rigorously supported by the data.

To address this point, we have purified the <sup>13</sup>C,<sup>15</sup>N-labeled labeled RNF38<sup>RING</sup> and assigned the chemical shifts of backbone N, HN, Cα, and C’ atoms. Then, we carried out NMR titrations to map the binding interface of RNF38<sup>RING</sup> in the UBC13/RNF38<sup>RING</sup> complex. Combining this new data with the UBC13 interface mapped earlier, we calculated NMR-data driven docked structure of the UBC13/RNF38<sup>RING</sup> complex by the software HADDOCK.</p><p>In this complex, we find that R14 makes a van der Waals interaction with M417 of RNF38<sup>RING</sup>. However, this contact is no more a ‘hot-spot’ contact. To mimic the sequestration of R14, we made R14A substitution in the structure, which disrupted the R14/M147 native contact. The binding energy calculations of native complex suggested that R14A substitution, i.e., disruption of the R14 native contact, changes the binding energy of the complex by only 0.2 kcal/mol. In contrast, the dissociation constants measured by NMR indicate a change of binding energy by 1.1 kcal/mol upon deamidation and 0.6 kcal/mol upon R14A substitution (Table 9I). Hence, apart from the R14 native contact, the R14 transient contacts also have a 0.4kcal/mol energy contribution to the binding. Deamidation induced salt-bridge sequestration will hamper both these interactions.</p><p>The new experiments and analysis are now mentioned in Figure 9—figure supplement 2 and in the text in subsection “The effect of deamidation on transient interactions persist in the UBC13/RNF38RING complex”. Details of the structure calculation of the UBC13/RNF38<sup>RING</sup> complex is added to the Materials and methods.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The data quite convincingly show a defect caused by replacement of Q100 with an acidic side-chain, and of a mutation in the nearby Arg14.

We have now condensed the text by moving technical details to Figure captions and Materials and methods. The text is changed in several places to explain the implications of analysis and appeal to the general readership.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) In general, the methodology is adequate for the purpose of the calculations presented, but the authors should provide more statistical analysis to support the significance of their results. Failing which, some of the conclusions are overstated: &quot;The repulsive interaction destabilized the complex […] and triggered its dissociation. The R14/E100 intramolecular salt-bridge formed soon after dissociation, which would prevent further transient association between R14 and TRAF6 residues.&quot; These conclusions are overstated as the authors have not quantified the strength of either salt bridge, the observations of transient contacts are anecdotal (only one window was analyzed in Figure 6), and causality is not established.</p></disp-quote><p>To provide statistics and strength of salt-bridges, we have now provided salt-bridge occupancies for the conventional MD (Table S1), SMD (Table S4), US window (Table S5) and unbiased MD (Table S6) trajectories in Supplementary File 1. Table S1 shows that the strength of intramolecular salt-bridge drops from 99% to 40% upon deamidation, and the new intermolecular salt-bridge strength ~30%, suggesting that the two salt-bridges can compete. The salt-bridge occupancies during dissociation in SMD also confirmed that the two salt-bridges compete (Tables S4). The salt-bridge occupancies in the native window of US simulations also showed that the intramolecular salt-bridge occupancy drops from 100% to 37% upon deamidation, whereas the intermolecular salt-bridge occupancy in 55% (Table S5). Where native complexes were observed in unbiased association simulations, the intermolecular salt-bridge occupancy reduced from 34% to 1%, and the intermolecular salt-bridge occupancy was 86%. Altogether, the salt-bridge occupancies in multiple MD simulation techniques strongly suggest that the two salt-bridges compete.</p><p>To address the comment regarding Figure 6, the E100/TRAF6 Coulombic Interaction Energy were analyzed at multiple US windows from 2.7- 3.1 nm (Figure 6—figure supplement 1A). The native window is at 2.7 nm, and the Coulombic Interaction Energy values are zero beyond 3.1 nm. Hence, US windows beyond 3.1 nm were not considered. The analysis showed that repulsive interactions (+ve Coulombic Interaction Energy values) are consistently observed between E100 and TRAF6<sup>RING</sup>.</p><p>Taking multiple US windows between 2.7 nm and 3.1 nm (apart from the native 2.7 nm window shown in Figure 3 and the 3.0 nm window shown in Figure 6), we also show that the deamidated complex is unstable with unfavorable Coulombic interaction energies (Figure 6—figure supplement 1B-E). Hence, the analysis of multiple US windows confirms the presence of repulsive transient interactions between E100 and TRAF6<sup>RING</sup> and the instability of the deamidated complex. The new MD analysis is added as Figure 6—figure supplement 1 and discussed in subsection “Repulsive interactions between E100 and TRAF6RING destabilize the transient complex”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Similar comments apply to the data shown in Figure 8.</p></disp-quote><p>For the high-affinity complexes, the probability of capturing native complexes in unbiased association simulations are higher. However, for low-affinity E2/RING complexes, we typically observe few trajectories which capture the native complex, making the statistical analysis difficult. However, for the trajectories corresponding to the native complexes shown in Figure 8, we now have provided the salt-bridge occupancies in Table S6. Here, the intermolecular salt-bridge occupancy reduced from 34% to 1%, and the intermolecular salt-bridge occupancy was 86%, indicating the salt-bridge competition. We have changed the text and figure legends to reflect that the unbiased association events are observations and do not imply causality.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>&quot;The intramolecular salt-bridge is dominant and effectively outcompetes the intermolecular salt bridge (Figure 5E).&quot; But Figure 5E only shows that, in one of many simulations, the former replaces the latter at sufficiently long intermolecular distances.</p></disp-quote><p>In Figure 5E, the intramolecular replaces the intermolecular at 3 ns, whereas the complex starts to dissociate at 5 ns as shown by the force-profile in Figure 4A. Hence, the intermolecular distance is small.</p><p>We agree that the intermolecular salt-bridge may not dominate but effectively competes with the intramolecular salt-bridge. The sentence in the discussion is deleted. We have changed the sentence on to reflect this:</p><p>“However, in this trajectory of the dUBC13 complex trajectory, the intermolecular salt-bridge disrupted early, and the intramolecular salt-bridge formed simultaneously (Figure 5D-5F). Collectively, the SMD suggested that R14/E69 formed a critical interfacial salt-bridge, and as the molecules start to dissociate, the R14/E69 and R14/E100 salt-bridges compete. The competition may contribute to the reduced stability of dUBC13 complex.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition, Figure 4D shows that the intermolecular salt bridge is more populated than the intramolecular one in the complex, which argues against the &quot;dominance&quot; of the latter.</p></disp-quote><p>We want to show that as the TRAF6 starts dissociating, the intermolecular salt-bridge competes. This was unclear in the previous version. Hence, we have reanalyzed Figure 4D for the duration of 5 ns – 15 ns. At 5 ns, TRAF6 begins to dissociate, and the intermolecular salt-bridge persists for a maximum of 15 ns. The new analysis shows that the two salt-bridges compete during this period (Figure 4D). The occupancies of the salt-bridges during this period is now provided as a table (Table S4). A sentence is also added to explain this:</p><p>“As the TRAF6<sup>RING</sup> starts to dissociate, the R14/E100 salt-bridge competes with the R14/E69 salt-bridge and reduces its stability (Figure 4D, Figure 4—figure supplement 1, 2).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>&quot;Transient complex theory&quot; calculations using the TransComp server are mentioned but not described. They should be described in Materials and methods in enough detail that they can be reproduced by competent researchers.</p></disp-quote><p>The transient complex theory calculations are now described in Materials and methods in detail.</p></body></sub-article></article>
