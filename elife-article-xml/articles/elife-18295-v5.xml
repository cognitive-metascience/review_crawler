Even though, there has been no evidence of Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, the larval lymph gland with its Hedgehog dependent progenitors served as an invertebrate model of progenitor biology. Employing lineage-tracing analyses, we have now identified <italic>Notch</italic> expressing HSCs in the first instar larval lymph gland. Our studies clearly establish the hierarchical relationship between <italic>Notch</italic> expressing HSCs and the previously described <italic>Domeless</italic> expressing progenitors. These HSCs require Decapentapelagic (Dpp) signal from the hematopoietic niche for their maintenance in an identical manner to vertebrate aorta-gonadal-mesonephros (AGM) HSCs. Thus, this study not only extends the conservation across these divergent taxa, but also provides a new model that can be exploited to gain better insight into the AGM related Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs).</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18295.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Blood cells perform many important roles in animals, including transporting oxygen around the body and defending against invading microbes. There are many similarities between how blood cells develop in vertebrate animals, such as humans, and in fruit flies. Therefore, researchers often use fruit flies as models to study how vertebrates make new blood cells. Fruit fly larvae produce new blood cells in the lymph gland from “progenitor” cells that show several similarities to the stem cells that make blood cells in vertebrates, known as Hematopoietic Stem Cells (or HSCs for short). The progenitor cells grow and divide and subsequently develop into mature blood cells.</p><p>The fate of the progenitor cells depend on signals produced from an adjoining group of specialized cells that serve as its niche. For example, a signal protein called Hedgehog delivered from the niche maintains the progenitor cells. On the other hand, HSCs in vertebrates rely on another signal protein called BMP to maintain them. Although the progenitor cells present in the lymph gland are believed to behave like vertebrate stem cells, it is not clear whether fruit flies also have groups of HSCs.</p><p>Dey et al. studied the fates of cells in the lymph glands of fruit fly larvae. The experiments reveal a new group of cells in the lymph gland that behave like vertebrate stem cells and give rise to progenitor cells. Since the newly discovered cells also depend on a niche for their maintenance, Dey et al. named them HSCs. Further experiments show that, like HSCs in vertebrates, the fruit fly HSCs use Dpp (the fruit fly equivalent of BMP) as a niche signal.</p><p>The next challenge is to use fruit fly HSCs as models to study how the blood develops in vertebrates, and how this is altered in individuals with blood disorders.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>hematopoiesis</kwd><kwd>dpp</kwd><kwd>HSC</kwd><kwd>Drosophila</kwd><kwd>notch</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Wellcome Trust DBT Alliance</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>500124/Z09/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mandal</surname><given-names>Lolitika</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Indian Institute of Science Education and Research Mohali</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dey</surname><given-names>Nidhi Sharma</given-names></name><name><surname>Ramesh</surname><given-names>Parvathy</given-names></name><name><surname>Chugh</surname><given-names>Mayank</given-names></name><name><surname>Mandal</surname><given-names>Sudip</given-names></name><name><surname>Mandal</surname><given-names>Lolitika</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Identification of Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in the genetically amenable organism <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> paves the path to address HSC biology, both in normal and pathophysiological conditions.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Studies in the last decade have established <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> as a wonderful <italic>in vivo</italic> model to gather insights into several aspects of stem cell biology.

The onset of definitive hematopoiesis in <italic>Drosophila</italic> occurs in a defined multi-lobed larval organ, the lymph gland. The first or the primary lobe of the lymph gland houses a bunch of stem -like progenitor cells in its central region forming the medullary zone (MZ). These multi-potent progenitor cells can give rise to all blood cell lineages which populate the outer periphery of the gland, referred as the cortical zone, CZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jung et al., 2005</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

We first used a dual <italic>Fucci</italic> construct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Zielke et al., 2014</xref>) that has two different probes that can clearly distinguish between G1, S and G2 phases of cell cycle. The first probe uses E2F moiety fused to GFP that is efficiently degraded by Cdt2 during S phase of cell cycle and is thereby able to identify G1, G2 and M phases. The second probe uses a CycB moiety fused to mRFP and is susceptible to degradation by APC/C during G1 phase, thereby clearly identifying cells in S, G2, and M phase. Thus essentially, cells from anaphase to the G1/S transition are green, S phase are red while cells in G2 and early mitosis are yellow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>).

Interestingly, the <italic>dome</italic> cells were not lineage traced for <italic>Notch</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C&quot;–C'&quot;</xref>), validating that indeed at this time point, none of the <italic>Notch</italic> expressing cells have undergone cell division. However, on analyzing 15 hr AEH three different cell types were observed. As before, the first type of cells expressed <italic>Notch</italic> (red and green thus yellow, stars) but lacked <italic>domeless</italic> (magenta) expression. The number of these cells was now reduced to 3 (stars, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D–D'&quot;'</xref>). We have previously showed that cell division in <italic>Notch</italic> expressing cells starts from 13 hr onwards (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I–I&quot;</xref>, N and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1G</xref>). Interestingly, the second cell type observed was <italic>Notch</italic> lineage traced and <italic>dome</italic> positive (magenta) which also validated that indeed cell division has happened during this time. This group thus was the clonal expansion of <italic>Notch</italic> expressing cells that have now turned on <italic>domeless</italic> expression. In addition, we also detected few cells that were not <italic>Notch</italic> lineage traced but expressed <italic>dome</italic> (magenta: arrowheads). This group we believe, arose from the <italic>dome</italic> expressing cells that co-existed with <italic>Notch </italic>cells during the time of lineage tracing.</p><p>The numbers of <italic>Notch</italic> expressing cells were further reduced by 18 hr AEH (stars) with a concomitant increase of Notch lineage traced <italic>dome</italic> expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E–E'&quot;'</xref>), clearly supporting our previous conclusion (arrows indicate cells that have low levels of Notch but have now up regulated <italic>dome</italic> expression). Remarkably, at 30 hr AEH the lymph gland was substantially populated by <italic>dome</italic> (magenta) expressing cells that were lineage traced for <italic>Notch</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F–F'&quot;</xref>). Quite interestingly, none of the <italic>Notch</italic> (red: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>) expressing cells were seen from this time onwards, undoubtedly strengthening the fact that <italic>Notch</italic> positive cells eventually become <italic>dome</italic> positive cells. When this genotype was analyzed at late third instar (following the same regime of lineage tracing as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), this transient labeling of the <italic>Notch</italic> positive cells only during first instar resulted in labeling of almost all cells of the lymph gland including <italic>dome</italic> expressing progenitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G–G'&quot;</xref>, also see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C–C&quot;</xref>).</p><p>Put together, the above results clearly establish the hierarchical relationship of <italic>dome</italic> positive cells with respect to <italic>Notch</italic> positive cells.</p><p>We further endorsed the above finding by transient-lineage tracing of <italic>dome</italic> and <italic>tepIV</italic> expressing progenitors, following the same scheme that was employed for <italic>Notch</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). In case of <italic>N</italic>-<italic>Gal4,</italic> the transient activation of the lineage-tracing construct led to substantial labeling of the lymph gland (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B–B&quot;</xref>and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C–C'</xref>) including the <italic>dome</italic> positive and Cubitus interuptus<sup>+</sup> (Ci<sup>+</sup>) hemocyte progenitors. Compared to this, activation of the lineage-tracing cassette with <italic>dome-Gal4</italic> within the same short window resulted in generation of extremely restricted clonal expansion of <italic>dome</italic> expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D–D&quot;</xref>). This clearly showed that not enough multi-potent progenitors were born at that time to render labeling of the entire gland and that the potency of <italic>Notch</italic> expressing cells are higher than the <italic>dome</italic> positive ones. This was further validated by Ci expression (a specific marker for progenitors) that marked a large population of progenitors that were not lineage traced (Ci: red; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D–D&quot;</xref>). Using <italic>tepIV-Gal4,</italic> another independent driver for hemocyte progenitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1E–E'</xref>), a result akin to transient <italic>domeless</italic> activation was obtained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1F–H</xref>).</p><p>In contrast, the few multi-potent <italic>Notch</italic> expressing cells present at time had the potential to substantially label the almost entire lymph gland including <italic>domeless</italic> and Ci expressing progenitors.</p><p>In order to complement the lineage tracing experiment and provide a functional correlation, we induced genetic ablation of <italic>Notch</italic> expressing cells. This was achieved by the activation of <italic>reaper</italic> (<italic>rpr</italic>, pro-apoptotic gene) specifically in the HSCs by <italic>Notch-Gal4</italic>. As Notch is required in several development processes, we encountered early lethality on activation of <italic>rpr</italic>. A narrow window of four hours activation of <italic>reaper</italic> post emergence of larvae yielded few individuals that were not lethal at late third instar stage. To assay, if Notch expressing cells were successfully ablated, <italic>dome-MESO-LacZ</italic> was brought in the background of <italic>N-Gal4</italic>. On restricted activation of <italic>UAS-rpr</italic>, few individuals of every batch were analyzed at first instar stages to ensure that the lymph gland contain only <italic>dome-MESO-LacZ</italic> and no Notch expressing cells, confirming a successful ablation (Compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). The siblings of the batch that had only <italic>dome</italic> expressing progenitors in the first instar lymph gland and made it to third instar stage, were analyzed.

Quantitative analyses revealed a 5-fold reduction in the total size of the lymph gland (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). Moreover, the ratio of area of progenitor cell population versus the total lymph gland area had dropped by more than 2 fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>) indicating that by killing the Notch expressing founder cells, the reserve population of progenitors arising from them were also eliminated.

This was a clear indication that these cells are not immature, but rather are in a differentiated state. We then speculated if this Lamin C positive early niche was in some way regulating the HSCs. This prompted us to look for unique paracrine signals that could maintain the newly identified <italic>Notch</italic> expressing cells at this stage.</p><p>We found <italic>STAT-GFP</italic> expression in both the HSCs and PSC from early first instar while its ligand reported by <italic>upd3-GFP</italic> initiated in only two PSC cells around 18 hr AEH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Wingless, another paracrine signal however, was present throughout the lymph gland from early first instar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Hypothesizing that the spatial expression pattern of a maintenance factor should be limited to one population rather than covering both HSCs and PSC, we continued our search for a unique signal.</p><p>Dpp signaling, a key player in various stem cell scenario was examined next. Using an antibody against pMad (transcriptional activator of Dpp signaling), we could see enrichment of pMad expression in the Notch positive HSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D–D&quot;</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1C–C<bold>''</bold></xref> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Affolter and Basler, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Raftery et al., 1995</xref>). Simultaneous detection of Antp (<italic>antp-Gal4, UAS-mCD8RFP</italic>) and pMad (<italic>Mad-GFP</italic>) demonstrated insignificant levels of Mad in the first instar PSC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>), further implicating the possibility of PSC being the source of Dpp. To address this ,we generated a fly line that harbours the notch reporter <italic>E(spl)mβ-CD2</italic> in the background of <italic>antp-Gal4, UAS-GFP</italic> and used this to downregulate Dpp signaling from the PSC by expressing <italic>UAS-dppRNAi</italic> and study its effect if any, on HSCs by visualizing the expression of <italic>E(spl)mβ-CD2</italic>. As evident from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F,F' and G,G'</xref>, expressing <italic>UAS-dpp RNAi</italic> completely abolished <italic>E(spl)mβ-CD2</italic> expression, suggesting a premature loss of Notch positive HSCs.</p><p>We next assayed the long term effect of the loss of these founder cells on the mature lymph gland. Using <italic>Gal80<sup>ts</sup></italic> to restrict the <italic>Gal4</italic> activity and thereby the loss of Dpp only in a narrow window (stage 16 of embryogenesis to 18 hr AEH), we observed a 3 fold decrease in the size of the lymph gland when compared to the controls (Compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H</xref> with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7I</xref>). We reasoned that if Dpp is indeed the signal from the niche, attenuation of downstream transcription factor Mad (Mothers against Dpp) in the receiving cell should elicit an analogous response. Consistent with our rationale, we found that downregulation of Mad expression specifically from the <italic>Notch</italic> positive cells, also abolished the <italic>E(spl)mβ-CD2</italic> expression in first instar larval lymph gland (Compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7J,J'</xref> with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7K,K'</xref>). This eventually resulted in significant reduction in the size of late third instar larval lymph gland (Compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7L</xref> with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7M</xref>). We further analyzed the distinct nuclear size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1R</xref>) of the first row of cells near the dorsal vessel of the above genotypes at first instar stage. Quantitative analyses of the nuclear size exhibited a significant reduction when compared to the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1D</xref>), validating the loss of <italic>Notch</italic> positive HSCs.</p><p>Thus, loss of Dpp from the PSC or Mad from the HSC during first instar affects the sustenance of the founder cells. This in turn majorly reduces the progenitor reserve, which affects the overall size of the lymph gland at later stages, a phenotype analogous to genetic ablation of HSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). This is also in tune with our previous observation that demonstrated that the Notch negative cells residing in the first instar larval lymph gland, also end up in populating the mature lymph gland (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C–E''and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>).</xref></p><p>We further confirmed the RNAi knockdown results using various mutant allelic combinations of <italic>dpp</italic>, <italic>tkv</italic> (<italic>thickveins</italic>, Dpp receptor) and <italic>Mad</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7N–Q</xref>).

Interestingly, in all the above mutant genotypes, although the relative size of the lymph gland was small, it had both cortical zone (P1:Nimrod marks the differentiated cells) and medullary zone (Ci: Cubitus interuptus marks the progenitor cells) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H,I,L,M–Q</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1E–J</xref>). It was compelling to observe that the expression of E(spl)<italic>mβ-CD2</italic> in the CZ (co-localizes with <italic>Hml-GFP</italic>, a differentiated hemocyte marker; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1K–K&quot;</xref>) was not affected in Mad loss of function condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1L</xref>).</p><p>Previously, it has been shown that Dpp signaling is directly involved in cardiogenic mesoderm formation and thereby indirectly in lymph gland generation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mandal et al., 2004</xref>). Another study revealed that Dpp signaling is required in the third instar larvae to regulate the size of PSC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Pennetier et al., 2012</xref>). Here in this current study, we effectively demonstrate that Dpp signaling is also a requisite during the first instar larvae to sustain and maintain the HSCs existing at that time without affecting the niche. Quantitative analysis revealed that although the niche number got affected in <italic>dpp</italic> mutants, the loss of Dpp in the first 18 hr AEH, however, affected the HSCs only (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1M</xref>) as the niche cell numbers in this case was comparable to wild type. Thus﻿ ﻿ctivation of this pathway leads to nuclear translocation of Mad (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7S</xref>) in the <italic>E(spl)mβ-CD2</italic> HSCs, which in turn maintains them. Dpp signaling has never been implicated in non-autonomous control over any other cell type in the lymph gland directly. Our study highlights this aspect of Dpp signaling in the homeostasis of the larval lymph gland. In this context, it is worth noting that both male and female germline stem cells in <italic>Drosophila</italic> also employ Dpp pathway for their maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Xie and Spradling, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kawase et al., 2004</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our substantial understanding of definitive hematopoiesis in <italic>Drosophila</italic> is largely restricted to embryonic and third instar larval stages of the lymph gland. Here, in this study, we have ventured into the early first instar larval lymph gland and discovered the founders of the considerably well studied prohemocytes that populate the MZ. These HSCs express several molecular markers, which are commonly associated with hematopoietic stem cells in vertebrates namely Notch, STAT, Homothorax and BMP transcription factor Mad (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Koch et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Stine and Matunis, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Argiropoulos et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Unnisa et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Varnum-Finney et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Burns et al., 2005</xref>). Anatomical analysis of the HSCs unravels its close association with dorsal vessel (DV), an equivalent of larval heart. This is in tune with previous observation in zebra fish and mouse, where it has been established that HSCs reside primarily in the vascular and/or perivascular niches during embryonic and fetal development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kiel and Morrison, 2008</xref>). Together, these results highlight the conserved anatomical location preferred for HSC formation across divergent taxa.</p><p>Like any other stem cell population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hsu and Fuchs, 2012</xref>), the HSCs in the first instar larval lymph gland are also niche dependent. They rely on Dpp signaling from the previously identified hematopoietic niche/PSC. Our genetic analyses clearly demonstrate that attenuation of Dpp signaling affects HSCs maintenance in the early lymph gland. This reflects a great degree of similarity to the vertebrate AGM related HSCs that express BMP4 receptor and require BMP4 signaling as the niche signal from the neighboring mesenchyme for their maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Durand et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Drevon and Jaffredo, 2014</xref>). It has been demonstrated that both the vertebrate AGM and <italic>Drosophila</italic> cardiogenic mesoderm are specified by identical signals and house blood cell precursors originating from hemangioblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mandal et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Choi et al., 1998</xref>). It is interesting to note that the site of HSC genesis: the lymph gland, itself arises from cardiogenic mesoderm, a region analogous to vertebrate AGM.</p><p>In vertebrates, Hematopoietic Stem Cells (HSCs) undertake a long journey that involves multiple sites like yolk sac, the AGM region, the placenta and the fetal liver for their maturation and expansion finally colonizing into bone marrow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mikkola and Orkin, 2006</xref>). Strikingly, the blood precursors present in the lymph gland upon expansion actually home into the adult hematopoietic hub, a simpler version of the bone marrow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ghosh et al., 2015</xref>). However, in contrast to vertebrate system, in case of <italic>Drosophila</italic>, the larval lymph gland serves as the only organ involved for maturation and expansion of hemocytes before the final seeding happens into the hematopoietic hub of adult. We believe that since the entire process of genesis, expansion and lineage commitment happens within the lymph gland, the HSCs, unlike mammals, in this case are transient. Our temporal analysis reveal that that the <italic>Notch</italic> expressing HSCs can be observed in the first instar lymph gland only for the first 20 hr of development. During this time frame they divide and give birth to <italic>domeless</italic> expressing blood cell progenitors. Thus, it can be considered that the requirement of HSCs in the lymph gland is to establish a stockpile of undifferentiated progenitors that in turn generates differentiated blood cells for the immediate requirement of larval development and subsequently to support the upcoming events of metamorphosis and adult hematopoiesis.</p><p>With the identification of the HSCs in the early larval lymph gland, the current study not only extends the range of conservation shared between the two divergent taxa but also provides a new model of <italic>Drosophila</italic> lymph gland development that is more similar to earlier events of HSC genesis, maintenance and migration in mammalian hematopoiesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A–B</xref>).</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18295.024</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Significant parallels in HSC development in Mammalian and <italic>Drosophila</italic> hematopoiesis.</title><p>Models depicting similarities in the development of HSCs from the mammalian AGM (<bold>A</bold>) and <italic>D. melanogaster’</italic>s cardiogenic mesoderm (<bold>B</bold>; redrawn from (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mandal et al., 2004</xref>). The cardiogenic mesoderm in <italic>Drosophila</italic> is analogous to the developing AGM of vertebrate and is nourished by identical signals. In vertebrates, a subset of AGM-derived cells has been proposed to constitute hemangioblasts (HB), which produce HSCs and endothelial cells. These HSCs also require BMP4 signaling from the AGM mesenchyme (AGM MC) for its maintenance. Likewise in flies, a seeding HB has been proposed to give rise to a subpopulation of cardioblasts and lymph gland primordia. Lymph gland progenitors are thus derived from few HSCs that also require niche-derived Dpp signaling for their maintenance.

Extensive studies employing mammalian HSCs have addressed several aspects of HSC biology that include but are not limited to their developmental origin, molecular mechanisms regulating their cycling, viability and lineage commitment of HSCs as well as several issues related to hematopoietic abnormalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ciau-Uitz et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dzierzak and Speck, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Babovic and Eaves, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Eaves, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Golub and Cumano, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kim et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Méndez-Ferrer et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mikkola and Orkin, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Nakano et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Orkin and Zon, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Tavian et al., 2010</xref>). One of the aspects that has drawn much attention is to understand the mechanisms regulating self-renewal of early HSCs as it holds promise in developing measures for early HSCs expansion. Due to technical limitations and rarity of AGM HSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Medvinsky et al., 2011</xref>), we still have little understanding about the nature of division that the cells undergo. Employing this amenable invertebrate model, we can now gather insights into such a process and boost our understanding of mechanism of early HSC expansion.</p><p>Several enthralling cell biological queries have emerged out of this current study. For instance, presence of Trio, a unique rho/rac1 dependent GEF in both HSCs and in the cells of PSC/niche, paves the foundation to explore the role of this unique GEF in AGM HSC development. Previous studies have highlighted the role of the mammalian Guanidine Exchange Factor (GEF) in yolk sac and fetal liver hematopoiesis as well as in homing of HSCs into the bone marrow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ghiaur et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Satyanarayana et al., 2010</xref>). But what role it might execute in AGM related HSCs has not been addressed.</p><p>Another important outcome of this study is the observation of the early expression of Notch in the HSCs that lie adjacent to the anterior aorta. Employing advanced genetic tools available in flies, it might be possible in future to genetically dissect the role of Notch in combination with other signaling molecules in the process that distinguishes between arterial and hematopoietic fate during development. Furthermore, identification of Dpp as the signaling molecule from the niche that is critical for HSC maintenance, in conjunction with the previously known role of the Hh signaling in maintenance of the progenitor cells of the medullary zone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mandal et al., 2007</xref>), indicates that lymph gland can be employed as a great model to understand temporal role of these two different morphogens in regulating early hematopoiesis.</p><p>The identification of HSCs in <italic>Drosophila,</italic> thus, brings about a paradigm shift in our understanding of <italic>Drosophila</italic> hematopoiesis. Given the significant conservation in the early HSC development with vertebrates, the outcome of this study holds the promise of opening new avenues to better understand developmental hematopoiesis. This has a far-reaching implication spilling into stem cell based therapies, wherein it is imperative to know how tissue specific stem cells are specified in development. Furthermore, the transcriptional networks controlling HSC fate during mammalian embryonic development are highly complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Robin and Durand, 2010</xref>). In this direction, the fly model can step in to identify and elucidate not only normal development but also several uncharacterized early pathological events linked with embryonic HSC related disorders.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Genetics</title><p>All embryo collections were done for 4 hr on mixed fruit juice-agar-sugar medium with a little fresh yeast paste onto them. 1 hr larval batches were synchronized upon hatching and transferred on standard cornmeal/yeast/sugar medium to obtain a synchronized larval population.

GTRACE</italic> in a <italic>Gal4</italic> dependent manner not only marks the current or the real time expression of the gene driving the <italic>Gal4</italic> with a RFP but also independently marks all the cells arising from the same gene lineage with a GFP. To initiate lineage tracing, FLP recombinase upon being activated in a <italic>Gal4</italic> dependent manner, flips out FRT-flanked transcriptional termination cassette between <italic>Ubi-p63E</italic> promoter and EGFP construct. This brings EGFP directly under the <italic>Ubi-p63E</italic> promoter thereby perpetuating all the progeny cells arising thereafter with EGFP.</p><p>A <italic>UAS-G-TRACE/cyo</italic> stock was crossed to <italic>N-Gal4</italic> both in the absence or presence of a <italic>tub-Gal80ts</italic> temperature sensitive transgene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">McGuire et al., 2003</xref>) to allow temporal activation of the <italic>Gal4</italic>.

For estimating hierarchical relationship between <italic>dome</italic> and <italic>Notch</italic>, <italic>dome-MESO-EBF2</italic> was brought in combination with <italic>N-Gal4</italic> and shifted following the same regime as earlier.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Dpp dependent Hematopoietic Stem Cells give rise to Hh dependent blood progenitors in larval lymph gland of <italic>Drosophila</italic>&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been favorably evaluated by K VijayRaghavan (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Yukiko M Yamashita (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary of review:</p><p>In this study, Dey at al., describe the presence of previously unreported multi-potent stem cells of hemocytes in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> first instar larval lymph gland. Although past studies have shown the presence of progenitors, the presence of &quot;hematopoietic stem cells&quot; (HSCs) in <italic>Drosophila</italic> has not yet been fully established. The authors use cell specific markers and morphometric measurements to determine the presence of a unique cell type in proximity to the dorsal vessel of the first instar larvae. These cells express high levels of serpent (srp), a pan-blood cell marker, but lack a prohemocytes marker, domeless (dom). Using a candidate approach they discover that these cells are found 8 hours after egg hatching (AEH), are larger than prohemocytes and express high levels of Notch. They are initially slow cycling and eventually enter mitosis 13 hours AEH. They complete division by 18 hours AEH to give rise to progenitors of the larval lymph gland, which eventually express Dome. The authors further establish that the posterior signaling center (PSC) of the lymph gland acts as the HSC niche and provide Dpp signaling for the maintenance of these cells. Loss of Dpp signaling, results in the failure of HSC self-renewal and in the formation of small lymph glands. Altogether, these results indicate the presence of HSCs in the first 20 hours of larval development that establishes a reservoir of hemocyte progenitors required for adult hematopoiesis.</p><p>This is an important study as the authors characterize a novel stem cell population and identify a signaling pathway in the niche that maintains these cells. They carry out beautiful lineage tracing experiments that show the existence of HSCs and the cells they give rise to.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Several points were raised that have to be addressed prior to publication. The reviewers agreed that they only involve relatively straightforward revision experiment(s) and text editing. Thus, we would like to invite you to submit a revised version. Requested revisions are outlined below.</p><p>1) Lineage tracing experiments: in order to show the multipotency, the clones should be induced at low frequency and ideally at single cell level, and then show that a single labeled HSC can expand and differentiate into different cells in this lineage. In complementary, these potential HSCs could be genetically ablated and show no progenies arising from them. Along the same line, in Figure 5, the authors made a strong statement that those N-expressing cells are founder cells for those Dome-expressing cells. However, some of the later stage Dome-expressing cells also come from N-negative cells. It is OK that more than one founder cell exists. But in order to complement the tracing experiments, more convincing evidence would be ablation of those N-positive cells lead to significant decrease of Dome-cells, similar to the experiments in Figure 6. If these experiments are proven to be technically challenging, please elaborate on this point in the response letter.</p><p>2) The overall characterization of co-expression vs. mutually exclusive patterns in Figure 1 should be done with co-labeling. If the figure only has one staining, it is hard to make such a claim, such as in Figure 1C, 1E-G, H, etc.</p><p>3) They state that HSC expresses STAT: this is somewhat puzzling given that the progenitor cells are Dome-positive: the upstream receptor for STAT. What is the relationship between Dome+ cells and STAT+ cells? (if they are distinct cell types as inferred by authors, then Dome+ cells are not transducing STAT signaling? And how STAT+ cells can become STAT+ without expressing Dome?)</p><p>4) The authors report that the Notch expressing cells in the earlier time points are bigger in size, than the neighboring cells. And these cells diminish over time. However, the data presented to support this is not convincing. The Notch expressing cells in Figure 1M look much bigger than the ones in Figure 1N (1M scale bar is missing). Do these cells diminish in size over time? Are they bigger in 8h time point when compared to 13h. A quantitative analysis of the Notch expressing cell size over time should address this concern.</p><p>5) Dome-meso-lacZ positive cells in Figure 1B&quot; also have different level of lacZ, any explanation for that? Also, it seems that Dome-meso-lacZ and dome-Gal4: UAS-GFP do not have totally overlapping signal in Figure 1—figure supplement 1C-C&quot;, why?</p><p>Additional points:</p><p>Other comments have been raised regarding the clarity of the manuscript. Although these are not about the scientific contents of the manuscript, we recommend that these points are addressed prior to publication.</p><p>1) The manuscript can be improved by editing. Please try to increase the clarity of the manuscript to appeal to a broader readership of <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>2) The figures and figure description need work, as there are some panels that are hard to decipher. Examples are:</p><p>The figure panels are not necessarily in temporal order e.g. Figure 6 B-C.</p><p>Also the Figure 4A-B' lettering is not aligned. Figure 1Q is not necessary and can be mentioned in the text?</p><p>Figure 1B and Figure 1—figure supplement 1A-A' show the same data and should not be repeated.</p><p>The scale bars between Figure 2—figure supplement 2A and Figure 2—figure supplement 2B are not the same. But they seem to be of the same magnification?</p><p>In Figure 6C a co-stain of LaminC with Dot/Antp would better ascertain their identity as PSC niche cells.</p><p>Figure 6D-D&quot; and Figure 6—figure supplement 1C-C&quot; are repetition of the same data, with the latter not being mentioned in the text.</p><p>3) A little more information on Odd expression will help a broad audience understand this better.</p><p>4) Does DPP affect size of the niche itself? They should monitor the niche size to see if the effects are direct or indirect. Also, how will Dpp/TKV overexpression effect the HSC population?</p><p>5) Notch staining should be included in Figure 6E to show the range of niche-to-stem cell signaling in this system. Are the &quot;bigger&quot; high-level Notch expressing cells closer to the PSC?</p><p>6) The dual FUCCI system is easier to interpret in distinguishing between the cell cycle phases than the Geminin FUCCI reporter. The supplemental data that shows the dual reporter could be moved to the main figure. Also in Figure 2—figure supplement 1F, the authors distinguish between G2 and M phase cells using Dual FUCCI system. This seems inappropriate, as both phases would have a &quot;yellow&quot; nuclear stain. They can address this by staining for PH3 in the dual FUCCI system. The graph distinguishes these two cell cycle phases but the reporter does not. Did they do a PH3 in this system as well? It is not shown.</p><p>7) Figure 2: the term &quot;label retaining cell&quot; is confusing. What the data show in this figure is actually histone label is simply diluted as N+ cells undergo division. Of course, before it is completely diluted, the labels are 'retained', but it is not because these cells are quiescent stem cell population, as is normally inferred from the term 'label retaining cell'. I suggest to edit the text around here to simply convey the point that 'transient-labeling of nucleus by histoneH2B-GFP allowed to monitor these cells' proliferation status'. The following FUCCI data are also along the same time – they are not quiescent and cycling.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18295.026</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>[…]</italic></p><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>Several points were raised that have to be addressed prior to publication. The reviewers agreed that they only involve relatively straightforward revision experiment(s) and text editing. Thus, we would like to invite you to submit a revised version. Requested revisions are outlined below.</italic> </p><p><italic>1) Lineage tracing experiments: in order to show the multipotency, the clones should be induced at low frequency and ideally at single cell level, and then show that a single labeled HSC can expand and differentiate into different cells in this lineage.</italic> </p><p>We do agree with the reviewer that it is more appropriate to induce clones at low frequency to establish the multipotent nature of the Notch expressing cells.</p><p>In this context, we want to draw the attention of the reviewer that we had already induced clones at single and double cell level and have shown that they do indeed expand and differentiate into different cell types including the progenitors. These results are illustrated in Figure 3F-G and discussed in the text (subsection “The Notch expressing cells in the first instar lymph gland are multi-potent stem cells”, fourth paragraph) in the revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>In complementary, these potential HSCs could be genetically ablated and show no progenies arising from them. Along the same line, in Figure 5, the authors made a strong statement that those N-expressing cells are founder cells for those Dome-expressing cells. However, some of the later stage Dome-expressing cells also come from N-negative cells. It is OK that more than one founder cell exists. But in order to complement the tracing experiments, more convincing evidence would be ablation of those N-positive cells lead to significant decrease of Dome-cells, similar to the experiments in Figure 6. If these experiments are proven to be technically challenging, please elaborate on this point in the response letter.</italic></p><p>This is a wonderful suggestion that would serve as a functional correlate of the results of our lineage tracing experiments.</p><p>We have now induced genetic ablation of Notch expressing cells. This was achieved by the activation of Reaper (rpr, pro-apoptotic gene) specifically in the HSCs by Notch-Gal4. To start with, this turned out to be a very challenging experiment. Since Notch regulates diverse early developmental events, upon driving <italic>UAS-rpr</italic> by <italic>Notch-Gal4</italic> we encountered early lethality. However, after several trials we were successful in narrowing down the activation window for reaper to four hours post emergence of larvae. This strategy yielded few individuals that were lethal at late third instar stage.</p><p>To ensure successful ablation of Notch expressing cells, <italic>dome-MESO-LacZ</italic> was brought inthe background of <italic>Notch-Gal4</italic>. On restricted activation of <italic>UAS-rpr</italic>, few individuals of every batch were analyzed at first instar stages to ensure that the lymph gland contains only <italic>dome-MESO-LacZ</italic> and no Notch expressing cells thereby confirming a successful ablation (please compare Figure 6A with Figure 6C). The siblings of the batch that had only <italic>dome-MESO-LacZ</italic> expressing cells in the first instar larval lymph gland and made to third instar stage were analyzed. We found that genetic ablation of Notch expressing cells causes a massive reduction in the lymph gland size at third instar (please compare Figure 6B with Figure 6D). Quantitative analyses revealed that an average 5-fold reduction in the total size of the lymph gland (Figure 6E). Moreover, the ratio of area of progenitor cell population versus the total lymph gland area got reduced by more than 2 fold (Figure 6F) indicating that by killing the Notch expressing founder cells, the reserve population of progenitors arising from them were also eliminated. This in turn resulted in a massive reduction in the total lymph gland size that now houses the clonal expansion of those Dome expressing (but not Notch) progenitors that coexisted with the Notch positive HSCs.</p><p>We sincerely thank the reviewer for his/her suggestion. We can conclude that the <italic>Notch</italic> positive cells are the multi-potent founder cells or the HSCs. This experiment has indeed enriched and strengthened our manuscript to a great extent.</p><p><italic>2) The overall characterization of co-expression vs. mutually exclusive patterns in Figure 1 should be done with co-labeling. If the figure only has one staining, it is hard to make such a claim, such as in Figure 1C, 1E-G, H, etc.</italic> </p><p>In our manuscript, panels in Figure 1 and Figure 1—figure supplement 1 were so arranged that the later complement the former.</p><p>For instance:</p><p>A) Figure 1C (demonstrating dot expression in the HSCs) is supported by Figure 1—figure supplement 1D where we show dot expression with Antennapedia marking the PSC/niche.</p><p>B) Figure 1D and Figure 1—figure supplement 1E provide two independent examples of first larval instar lymph gland showing the expression of dot with dome-MesoLacZ. These co-expression patterns demonstrate that the cells with high levels of Dot expression and those with dome-MesoLacZ expression are mutually exclusive.</p><p>C) Although only Notch expression is shown in Figure 1E, the Figure 1—figure supplement 1G shows both Notch and Antp expression demonstrating the absence of Notch from the niche cells.</p><p>Following the reviewer’s suggestion, we have now included Figure 1E’ that has Notch and dome double staining that clearly shows that they are mutually exclusive cell types.</p><p>D) Likewise Figure 1F demonstrates the expression of Su(H)lacZ (reporter of Notch activity) in the HSCs and Figure 1—figure supplement 1H-H<bold>&quot;</bold> show that the Su(H)lacZ cells are also positive for Notch-GFP expression.</p><p><italic>3) They state that HSC expresses STAT: this is somewhat puzzling given that the progenitor cells are Dome-positive: the upstream receptor for STAT. What is the relationship between Dome+ cells and STAT+ cells? (if they are distinct cell types as inferred by authors, then Dome+ cells are not transducing STAT signaling? And how STAT+ cells can become STAT+ without expressing Dome?)</italic> </p><p>We believe that the STAT signaling in larval lymph gland does not follow the canonical pathway. Several instances can be cited in this context.</p><p>For example, it has been demonstrated that the PSC/niche cells express STAT but they never express Dome. Interestingly, lineage tracing of dome population in developing larval lymph gland never marked PSC/niche cells (Jung et al., 2005).</p><p>More recently, STAT pathway has been implicated in maintaining the quiescence state of hematopoietic progenitors (Mondal et al., 2011). Interestingly, in this study also STAT signaling is elicited in the cortical cone (CZ) of the lymph gland that never expresses Dome.</p><p><italic>4) The authors report that the Notch expressing cells in the earlier time points are bigger in size, than the neighboring cells. And these cells diminish over time. However, the data presented to support this is not convincing. The Notch expressing cells in Figure 1M look much bigger than the ones in Figure 1N (1M scale bar is missing). Do these cells diminish in size over time? Are they bigger in 8h time point when compared to 13h. A quantitative analysis of the Notch expressing cell size over time should address this concern.</italic> </p><p>Thanks for drawing our attention. Since the size of the lymph gland at 18h is relatively bigger than that of 13hrs, the 18h lymph gland was photographed in a different magnification. The scale bars in both the figures reflect this difference. We are extremely sorry for not including the scale bar for Figure 1M in the previous version that lead to this confusion!</p><p>Following the suggestion of the reviewer, we have done a quantitative analysis of the cell size of Notch expressing cells over time and found that their size remains more or less unaltered.</p><p>As evident from the graph shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>, we did not observe any significant change in the size of Notch expressing cells at 13h (p=0.842025521, n=14) or 18h (p=0.35903873, n=14) AEH with respect to those at 8h.</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-18295-resp-fig1-v5.tif"/></fig><p><italic>5) Dome-meso-lacZ positive cells in Figure 1B&quot; also have different level of lacZ, any explanation for that?</italic> </p><p>We speculate that this variation is an outcome of differential accumulation of β-galactosidase in these cells.</p><p><italic>Also, it seems that Dome-meso-lacZ and dome-Gal4: UAS-GFP do not have totally overlapping signal in Figure 1—figure supplement 1C-C&quot;, why?</italic> </p><p>Dome-meso-LacZ enhancer is a complete mesodermal specific reporter of JAK/STAT activation that mimics the expression of endogenous <italic>dome</italic> (Hombria et al., 2005). Although in third instar it co-localizes with Dome Gal4 UASGFP expression, but our study shows that it can sense JAK/STAT activity much earlier than the <italic>Dome-Gal4</italic> construct. We believe this may be due to its specificity as a mesodermal reporter. Moreover, the delay can also be attributed to the synthesis of Gal4 and subsequent activation of GFP. This becomes evident at the point of initiation of a gene expression where an enhancer might respond earlier than a Gal4 based reporter.</p><p><italic>Additional points:</italic> </p><p><italic>Other comments have been raised regarding the clarity of the manuscript. Although these are not about the scientific contents of the manuscript, we recommend that these points are addressed prior to publication.</italic> </p><p><italic>1) The manuscript can be improved by editing. Please try to increase the clarity of the manuscript to appeal to a broader readership of eLife.</italic> </p><p>Following the suggestion of the reviewer we have tried our best to improve the manuscript and are open to any suggestion from the editors to make it more lucid.</p><p><italic>2) The figures and figure description need work, as there are some panels that are hard to decipher. Examples are:</italic> </p><p><italic>The figure panels are not necessarily in temporal order e.g. Figure 6 B-C.</italic></p><p><italic>Also the Figure 4A-B' lettering is not aligned.</italic> </p><p>Our apologies for this kind of error! We have taken care of these issues in the revised version.</p><p><italic>Figure 1Q is not necessary and can be mentioned in the text?</italic> </p><p>As suggested, we have removed the figure and mentioned the observation in the text (subsection “The novel cell population is transient and expresses several molecular markers”, fourth paragraph).</p><p><italic>Figure 1B and Figure 1—figure supplement 1A-A' show the same data and should not be repeated.</italic> </p><p>In the revised version we have removed Figure 1—figure supplement 1A-A'.</p><p><italic>The scale bars between Figure 2—figure supplement 2A and Figure 2—figure supplement 2B are not the same. But they seem to be of the same magnification?</italic> </p><p>We are extremely sorry for this error. Thanks for pointing it out. They are of indeed of same magnification. We have corrected the error in the revised version.</p><p><italic>In Figure 6C a co-stain of LaminC with Dot/Antp would better ascertain their identity as PSC niche cells.</italic> </p><p>We have included a costaining of Lamin C and Antp for 8h and 18h after egg hatching in the revised version. Current Panel is Figure 7B-C''.</p><p><italic>Figure 6D-D&quot; and Figure 6—figure supplement 1C-C&quot; are repetition of the same data, with the latter not being mentioned in the text.</italic> </p><p>We have now mentioned this in the revised manuscript (subsection “Dpp signal from the PSC maintains the self-renewal of HSCs”, fourth paragraph).</p><p><italic>3) A little more information on Odd expression will help a broad audience understand this better.</italic> </p><p>We have now included the required information in the revised version (subsection “Notch expressing multi-potent cells are the founder cell for progenitors of the larval lymph gland”, second paragraph).</p><p><italic>4) Does DPP affect size of the niche itself? They should monitor the niche size to see if the effects are direct or indirect. Also, how will Dpp/TKV overexpression effect the HSC population?</italic> </p><p>Thanks for raising this point. Performing the analyses as suggested by the reviewer indeed reveals the direct effect of Dpp on the maintenance of HSCs.</p><p>Previous studies have demonstrated that <italic>dpp</italic> loss from the niche causes increment in niche cell numbers (Pennetier et al. 2012) at third instar stage of development. Similarly, when we analyzed third instar larval lymph glands, we also observed that the niche number gets affected in dpp heteroallelic condition. However, in this current study, we effectively demonstrate that loss of dpp, specifically in the first 18h AEH, affects the number of HSCs without having any obvious effect on the number of niche cells (Figure 7—figure supplement 1M).These results clearly establish that in the first instar larvae Dpp signaling from the niche (PSC) is essential for the sustenance of the HSCs. We have now included these results in the revised manuscript (subsection “Dpp signal from the PSC maintains the self-renewal of HSCs”, last paragraph).</p><p>We faced technical difficulties in overexpressing <italic>dpp</italic> within the niche as it resulted in larval lethality. This prevented us to assay the effect of dpp overexpression on HSC population. Even a pulse of dpp activation during HSC lifetime (0-18h AEH) resulted in early second instar lethality.</p><p><italic>5) Notch staining should be included in Figure 6E to show the range of niche-to-stem cell signaling in this system. Are the &quot;bigger&quot; high-level Notch expressing cells closer to the PSC?</italic> </p><p>Two examples are already included in the panel: current Figure 7F and 7J.</p><p>Following reviewers suggestion, we analyzed about 50 first instar lymph gland from Enhancer of split. We did not find samples which endorsed that bigger high level Notch expressing cells are in close proximity to the PSC.</p><p><italic>6) The dual FUCCI system is easier to interpret in distinguishing between the cell cycle phases than the Geminin FUCCI reporter. The supplemental data that shows the dual reporter could be moved to the main figure.</italic> </p><p>We have now rearranged the figures according to the reviewer’s suggestions in the revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>Also in Figure 2—figure supplement 1F, the authors distinguish between G2 and M phase cells using Dual FUCCI system. This seems inappropriate, as both phases would have a &quot;yellow&quot; nuclear stain. They can address this by staining for PH3 in the dual FUCCI system. The graph distinguishes these two cell cycle phases but the reporter does not. Did they do a PH3 in this system as well? It is not shown.</italic> </p><p>Thanks for bringing it forth. We had actually done PH3 labeling on dual FUCCI which is reflected in the graph. We have now included three representative pictures of three different time points in the revised version (Figure 2K-M).</p><p><italic>7) Figure 2: the term &quot;label retaining cell&quot; is confusing. What the data show in this figure is actually histone label is simply diluted as N+ cells undergo division. Of course, before it is completely diluted, the labels are 'retained', but it is not because these cells are quiescent stem cell population, as is normally inferred from the term 'label retaining cell'. I suggest to edit the text around here to simply convey the point that 'transient-labeling of nucleus by histoneH2B-GFP allowed to monitor these cells' proliferation status'. The following FUCCI data are also along the same time – they are not quiescent and cycling.</italic> </p><p>We have taken care to resolve this confusion. The term &quot;label retaining cell&quot; has been removed and we have followed the suggestion of reviewer while interpreting the results (subsection “Notch expressing cells in the first instar lymph gland undergo asynchronous 188 division from 13 AEH”, first two paragraphs).</p></body></sub-article></article>
