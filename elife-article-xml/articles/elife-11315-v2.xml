Cohesin contains a heterodimeric ATP-binding Cassette (ABC) ATPase comprised of Smc1 and Smc3 ATPase active sites. These ATPases are required for cohesin to bind DNA. Cohesin’s DNA binding activity is also promoted by the Eco1 acetyltransferase and inhibited by Wpl1. Recently we showed that after cohesin stably binds DNA, a second step is required for DNA tethering. This second step is also controlled by Eco1 acetylation. Here, we use genetic and biochemical analyses to show that this second DNA tethering step is regulated by cohesin ATPase. Furthermore, our results also suggest that Eco1 promotes cohesion by modulating the ATPase cycle of DNA-bound cohesin in a state that is permissive for DNA tethering and refractory to Wpl1 inhibition.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.11315.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.11315.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11315.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The bulk of the genetic material in cells from yeast to humans is organized into chromosomes. These chromosomes must be duplicated and the copies need to be segregated every time cells divide. Cohesin is a protein complex that helps to organize the structure of chromosomes by tethering together two regions of DNA, either within a chromosome or between chromosomes. Problems with cohesin have been linked to cancer and birth defects, but it is not clear how cohesin binds DNA and how it makes a tether between two DNA regions. It is also unclear how cohesin’s activity is coordinated with the series of events that allow cells to divide (known as the cell cycle).</p><p>Cohesin has two active sites that can break down molecules of ATP. Previous research had suggested that these active sites (called ATPases) controlled cohesin’s activity by regulating whether or not it could bind to DNA. However, Çamdere et al. now reveal that cohesin’s ATPases do not simply provide an ‘on/off switch’ for DNA binding. The experiments, which involved a combination of genetic, cell biology and biochemical techniques in budding yeast, instead revealed that one of cohesin’s ATPases regulates structural rearrangements in cohesin that is already bound to DNA. These structural rearrangements fine-tune the complex’s ability to tether two regions of DNA.</p><p>Further experiments then revealed that two cohesin regulators (namely Eco1 and Wpl1) altered this ATPase active site to control cohesin’s DNA tethering and DNA binding activities. These findings provide a molecular explanation for how these regulators control cohesin’s activity to make sure that the chromosomes have the correct structure during cell division.</p><p>The next challenge is to identify the structural changes in cohesin that are triggered by cohesin’s two ATPases and to understand how these structural changes promote DNA binding followed by DNA tethering.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.11315.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.11315.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>cohesin</kwd><kwd>structural maintenance of chromosomes</kwd><kwd>ABC-binding cassette</kwd><kwd>chromatin</kwd><kwd>ATPase</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>S. pombe</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM092813</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Koshland</surname><given-names>Douglas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001021</institution-id><institution>Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DRG-2137-12</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Çamdere</surname><given-names>Gamze</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A critical second step in DNA tethering by cohesin occurs after its stable binding to DNA, and this second step is modulated by the Smc3 ATPase active site in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Multi-subunit protein complexes called Structural Maintenance of Chromosomes (SMC) mediate most aspects of higher-order chromosome organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hirano, 2006</xref>). Cohesin is an SMC complex that was first identified as being essential for sister chromatid cohesion, the process of holding together the sister chromatids from their synthesis in S phase until their segregation in anaphase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Guacci et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Michaelis et al., 1997</xref>). Cohesin is also involved in mitotic condensation, meiotic chromosome condensation and structure, post-replicative DNA repair, and transcriptional regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Onn et al., 2008</xref>). Cohesin performs these different functions by tethering together two regions of DNA, either within a single DNA molecule (condensation and regulation of gene expression) or between two DNA molecules (sister chromatid cohesion and DNA repair). How cohesin-mediated DNA tethering is regulated is one of the critical unanswered questions in the field.</p><p>The process of sister chromatid cohesion involves the binding of cohesin to chromosomes prior to DNA synthesis, and the subsequent tethering of sister chromatids by the DNA-bound cohesin to generate cohesion during S phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Onn et al., 2008</xref>). Cohesin appears to topologically entrap DNA through its ring-like architecture that results from the assembly of its four core subunits, Smc1, Smc3, Mcd1/Scc1, and Scc3/Irr1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Nasmyth and Haering, 2009</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Cohesin’s loading onto DNA is controlled by its ATP Binding Cassette (ABC) ATPase domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arumugam et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Heidinger-Pauli et al., 2010b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Murayama and Uhlmann, 2014</xref>). Cohesin’s ATPase domain is composed of two ATPase active sites each containing four conserved motifs: Walker A, Walker B, signature motif, and D-loop. The Smc1 ATPase active site is a hybrid site containing the Walker A and Walker B motif﻿s encoded by Smc1, and the D-loop and signature motifs encoded by Smc3. Likewise, the Smc3 ATPase active site contains the Smc3-encoded Walker A and Walker B motifs, and Smc1-encoded D-loop and signature motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arumugam et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Haering et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hopfner et al., 2000</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> inset). Characterization of mutations that block ATP binding (Walker A) or hydrolysis (Walker B) suggest that ATP binding and hydrolysis by both ATPases are necessary for the DNA binding of cohesin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arumugam et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Heidinger-Pauli et al., 2010b</xref>). Cohesin’s ATPase activity is also stimulated by the Scc2/Scc4 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Murayama and Uhlmann, 2014</xref>), which is required for the DNA binding of cohesin in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ciosk et al., 2000</xref>). These observations led to the hypothesis that Scc2/Scc4 complex stimulates ATP hydrolysis to open the cohesin ring and allow the entry of DNA. Subsequent ATP binding closes the ring, entrapping the DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arumugam et al., 2003</xref>). Presumably, in order for cohesin to remain stably bound to DNA, its ATPase activity would have to be suppressed to prevent ring reopening and DNA escape. However, the ATPase activity of cohesin in its stable DNA-bound form had never been determined.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11315.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Stable DNA binding does not suppress ATPase activity of cohesin.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Cartoon representation of the cohesin complex.

Wpl1 is thought to destabilize cohesin binding to DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kueng et al., 2006</xref>). Wpl1 is antagonized by the Eco1 acetyl-transferase through its acetylation of lysines 112 and 113 of Smc3. The key evidence supporting this view is that the deletion of <italic>WPL1 (wpl1</italic>∆) suppresses the inviability of cells lacking <italic>ECO1 (eco1</italic>∆) or expressing acetyl null alleles of Smc3 (<italic>smc3-K112R, K113R</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Rolef Ben-Shahar et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sutani et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Unal et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Recent evidence suggests that Eco1 acetylation promotes cohesion by additional mechanisms besides stabilizing cohesin binding to DNA. First, while <italic>eco1</italic>∆ <italic>wpl1</italic>∆ cells are viable and have stable cohesin-DNA interaction, they have cohesion defects as severe as mutants of <italic>ECO1</italic> or cohesin subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Guacci and Koshland, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rowland et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sutani et al., 2009</xref>). Second, other mutations identified in cohesin and its regulators demonstrate that stable binding of cohesin to DNA is not sufficient for cohesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Eng et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Guacci et al., 2015</xref>). Together, these data strongly argue that cohesion is a two-step process: First, cohesin associates with DNA in a stable form. Then, cohesin undergoes a second transition to tether sister chromatids together. This transition could entail conformational changes involving oligomerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Eng et al., 2015</xref>), or the activation of a second, independent DNA binding activity through rearrangements of the coiled coils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Soh et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>How is cohesin-mediated DNA tethering regulated? One hypothesis is that Eco1-mediated acetylation of Smc3 regulates this second, post-DNA binding step by modulating the cohesin ATPase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Guacci et al., 2015</xref>). This hypothesis appears to contradict the finding that Walker A and Walker B mutations in either cohesin ATPase blocks DNA binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arumugam et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Heidinger-Pauli et al., 2010b</xref>). However, this observation does not preclude a specialized role for the Smc3 ATPase active site in regulating DNA tethering after DNA binding. Indeed, the acetylated K112 and K113 residues in Smc3 are proximal to the Smc3 ATPase active site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gligoris et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Haering et al., 2004</xref>). Moreover, a recently identified suppressor mutation located near the Smc3 ATPase active site bypasses the requirement for Smc3 acetylation in cohesion establishment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Guacci et al., 2015</xref>). Led by these observations, we reconsider the role of the ATPase domain of cohesin as a potential regulator of the second, post-DNA binding step of cohesion establishment.</p><p>Here, we present in vitro and in vivo evidence that the ATPase domain of cohesin plays a role after the initial stable DNA binding of cohesin. We provide evidence suggesting that the Smc1 ATPase active site is involved only in regulating DNA binding, whereas the Smc3 ATPase active site functions in DNA tethering as well as DNA binding. We characterize an Smc3 ATPase active site mutant in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> that bypasses the requirement for Eco1 acetylation in cohesion generation, and uncouples the level of ATPase activity from cohesin’s DNA binding and tethering activities. We propose that cohesin’s ATPase has two distinct functions in regulating DNA binding and subsequent DNA tethering. We suggest that Eco1 promotes cohesion by slowing or trapping the ATPase cycle of DNA-bound cohesin to promote a conformation that is permissive for DNA tethering and refractory to Wpl1 inhibition.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Cohesin that is stably bound to DNA retains its ATPase activity</title><p>Earlier models suggest that cohesin’s ATPase head domain is only involved in the initial DNA binding step, and that ATP hydrolysis releases the DNA from cohesin. These models predict that stably DNA-bound cohesin should not show ATPase activity. However, recent literature suggests that Eco1 might promote cohesion by regulating the cohesin ATPase after the stable DNA binding of cohesin. If ATPase activity is required to regulate this second step of cohesion establishment, we should be able to observe ATPase activity for purified cohesin-DNA complexes. To test this possibility, we purified <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe c</italic>ohesin and loader complexes as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Murayama and Uhlmann, 2014</xref>). Purified cohesin showed basal ATPase activity that was stimulated by the presence of the loader complex and DNA, and abolished by a Walker A mutation in Smc3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), similar to published results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Murayama and Uhlmann, 2014</xref>). Cohesin binding to chromosomes in vivo is enriched at centromeres and at cohesion-associated regions (CARs) along the chromosome arms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Laloraya et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Onn et al., 2008</xref>), and is highly salt resistant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ciosk et al., 2000</xref>). To purify stable cohesin-DNA complexes that are physiologically relevant, we assembled cohesin on DNA molecules that contained <italic>CARC1</italic> sequence and were coupled by both ends to dynabeads. Cohesin and its loader were incubated with DNA-beads under low salt conditions (25 mM KCl, 25 mM NaCl). The cohesin-DNA bead mix was washed with high salt (500 mM KCl) to remove any free cohesin or cohesin not stably bound to DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The cohesin that remained bound to the DNA-beads was then eluted and quantified by Coomassie staining or Western blots. In the presence of the loader, 20% of the input cohesin was bound to DNA-beads after the high salt wash (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>). In the absence of the loader, 2-fold less cohesin bound to DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Cohesin did not bind to beads that lack DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). In addition, this stable population of cohesin on DNA-beads could be eluted from the beads by either a restriction enzyme digest or a DNase treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). These results suggest that cohesin bound specifically to the DNA that was coupled to beads, and did so in a salt-resistant and loader-inducible manner. These DNA binding features recapitulated the properties of stable cohesin-DNA complexes assembled in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ciosk et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>To address whether stably DNA-bound cohesin was an active ATPase, we next assessed whether cohesin in our purified, stable cohesin-DNA complexes (CD-B, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) retained its ATPase activity. DNA-beads were incubated with cohesin and loader, then washed with high salt buffer to remove free and unstably bound cohesin, as described above. Cohesin-DNA beads (CD-B) were then resuspended in buffer containing ATP to measure ATPase activity of CD-B, compared to basal and loader/DNA-stimulated activities of cohesin. No ATPase activity was detected when cohesin was omitted from the reaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). As shown before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Murayama and Uhlmann, 2014</xref>), cohesin’s basal ATPase activity (sample 2) was stimulated about 3-fold by the presence of loader and DNA (sample 4), but only subtly increased by DNA alone (sample 3, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Our purified cohesin-DNA complexes on beads (CD-B, sample 5) showed about 4-fold increased ATPase activity compared to the basal activity of equal amounts of cohesin (sample 2, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E,F</xref>). Furthermore, the ATPase activity of CD-B was at least as high, if not higher, as the activity of equal concentrations of loader/DNA-stimulated cohesin in solution, where additional rounds of cohesin loading were possible (sample 4 compared to sample 5, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E,F</xref>).</p><p>The ATPase activity in the fraction containing purified cohesin-DNA complexes might have been derived from DNA-free cohesin that had dissociated from DNA-beads. To test this possibility, a parallel sample of CD-B was treated similarly to the ATPase assay to assess the amount of cohesin that remained bound to DNA through the course of the ATPase experiment. DNA-beads were separated from the supernatant after the 30-minute incubation with ATP and the amount of cohesin in each fraction was visualized by SDS-PAGE. Very little, if any, cohesin was found in the supernatant at the end of the incubation, suggesting that most of the ATPase activity was derived from cohesin bound to the DNA-beads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Even in the presence of excess competitor DNA in solution, cohesin remained stably bound to the DNA-beads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). Thus in vitro, cohesin can have robust ATPase activity while remaining stably bound to DNA.</p><p>In our preparations of purified cohesin-DNA complexes, a small amount of the loader complex was also present, due to the ability of the loader complex to bind DNA. Given that the loader complex stimulates cohesin’s ATPase activity in the presence of DNA, it was possible that the ATPase activity in our purified cohesin-DNA complexes depended upon the presence of the loader complex. To test this possibility, we repeated these experiments but omitted the loader from the binding reaction. Under these conditions, a smaller percentage of cohesin could be assembled on DNA in a salt-resistant manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). Cohesin in these purified cohesin-DNA complexes that have no co-purifying loader complex also retained ATPase activity equivalent to that seen in the mixture of cohesin and DNA in solution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). Thus, the persistence of ATPase activity in stable cohesin-DNA complexes was not dependent upon the loader. The presence of cohesin’s ATPase activity in the stable cohesin-DNA complex is consistent with a regulatory role for cohesin ATPase in cohesion establishment in vivo after cohesin stably binds to DNA.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Mutations proximal to the Smc3 ATPase active site bypass the requirement for Eco1 in cohesion establishment</title><p>Cohesin exhibited robust ATPase activity after stably binding DNA, which encouraged us to re-examine the in vivo role of cohesin ATPases and Eco1 in cohesin function. Cohesin-DNA complexes in <italic>eco1</italic>∆ <italic>wpl1</italic>∆ cells are stably bound to DNA but fail to establish cohesion, indicating a post-DNA binding step is required for cohesion. We postulated that this failure to generate cohesion was due to a misregulation of the cohesin ATPase active sites. If so, a subset of mutations altering the Smc1 or Smc3 ATPase active sites might mimic the state of the ATPase upon Eco1 acetylation, and thereby might suppress the cohesion defect of <italic>eco1</italic>∆ <italic>wpl1</italic>∆ cells.</p><p>To identify such suppressors, we exploited the fact that <italic>eco1</italic>∆ <italic>wpl1</italic>∆ cells remain viable in the absence of cohesion because of an unusual feature of budding yeast cell cycle that gives rise to a cohesin-independent mechanism of sister chromatid segregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Guacci and Koshland, 2012</xref>). The reliance of <italic>eco1</italic>∆ <italic>wpl1</italic>∆ cells on this cohesin-independent segregation makes them sensitive to the microtubule depolymerizing drug benomyl. A screen for suppressors of the benomyl sensitivity of <italic>eco1</italic>∆ <italic>wpl1</italic>∆ cells should identify a subset of mutations that restore cohesion and the cohesin-dependent benomyl-resistant mechanism of segregation. Indeed, we recently reported one such benomyl-resistant suppressor allele, <italic>smc3-D1189H</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Guacci et al., 2015</xref>), that restored cohesion. <italic>smc3-D1189H</italic> is located in the ATPase head domain, near the Smc3 ATPase active site. Due to this restoration of cohesion to <italic>eco1</italic>∆ <italic>wpl1</italic>∆ cells, we termed this mutation a cohesion activator mutation.</p><p>Here, we present two new <italic>SMC1</italic> alleles from our screen<italic>, smc1-D1164E</italic> and <italic>smc1-Y1128C</italic>. Re-introduction of these mutations into the parent <italic>eco1</italic>∆ <italic>wpl1</italic>∆background generated benomyl-resistance identical to the initial suppressor <italic>eco1∆ wpl1∆</italic> isolates and close to the resistance of wild type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), demonstrating their causal role for this phenotype. The <italic>SMC1</italic> suppressor mutations are even more proximal to the Smc3 ATPase active site than <italic>smc3-D1189H</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). <italic>smc1-Y1128C</italic> is adjacent to the signature motif, which is thought to modulate ATP binding, but this residue is not conserved. <italic>smc1-D1164E</italic> alters the invariant aspartate that is part of the conserved D-loop motif found in ABC and SMC ATPases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).

Wild type cells had robust cohesion as shown by few M phase cells with two GFP spots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). <italic>eco1</italic>∆ <italic>wpl1</italic>∆ cells exhibited a severe cohesion defect (more than 60% of cells had two GFP spots), which was reduced by half by the <italic>smc1-D1164E</italic> suppressor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

These results indicated that (1) <italic>smc1-D1164E</italic> promotes cohesion establishment in the <italic>eco1∆ wpl1∆</italic>, albeit incompletely, and (2) once cohesion is formed in <italic>smc1-D1164E eco1</italic>∆ <italic>wpl1</italic>∆ cells, it is maintained. <italic>smc1-D1164E</italic> also partially restored cohesion establishment in <italic>eco1</italic>∆ <italic>wpl1</italic>∆ cells at the <italic>CEN</italic>-distal locus, <italic>LYS4</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>).

To test this prediction, we performed chromosome immunoprecipitation (ChIP) to compare cohesin binding to chromosomes in <italic>eco1</italic>∆ <italic>wpl1</italic>∆ cells containing <italic>SMC1</italic> or <italic>smc1-D1164E</italic> allele. Cohesin subunits colocalize on chromosomes, making the analysis of any cohesin subunit a surrogate for cohesin binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Glynn et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Heidinger-Pauli et al., 2010a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lengronne et al., 2004</xref>).

This similarity in chromosomal binding indicates that cohesion restoration in <italic>eco1</italic>∆ <italic>wpl1</italic>∆ cells by the <italic>smc1-D1164E</italic> allele was not due to an altered level of cohesin binding to chromosomes, but instead was due to a change in cohesin function at a post-DNA binding step.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title><italic>smc1-D1164E</italic> has constitutive but reduced cohesion independent of Eco1 and Wpl1</title><p>The restoration of cohesion in <italic>smc1-D1164E eco1</italic>∆ <italic>wpl1</italic>∆ cells indicated that the <italic>smc1-D1164E</italic> could bypass one or more aspects of cohesion regulation normally imposed by Eco1 and Wpl1. To understand better how <italic>smc1-D1164E,</italic> and by inference the Smc3 ATPase active site, interfaced with cohesin regulators, we examined its impact on the phenotypes of <italic>wpl1</italic>∆ and <italic>eco1</italic>∆single mutants. In a <italic>wpl1</italic>∆ background, <italic>SMC1</italic>and <italic>smc1-D1164E</italic> alleles had similar viability and the same moderate cohesion defect characteristic of <italic>wpl1</italic>∆ mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5</xref>). The <italic>smc1-D1164E</italic> allele suppressed the essential <italic>ECO1</italic> function, as <italic>smc1-D1164E eco1</italic>∆ cells showed good viability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s6">Figure 3—figure supplement 6</xref>). <italic>smc1-D1164E eco1</italic>∆ cells showed a 35% cohesion defect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s6">Figure 3—figure supplement 6</xref>), which was greatly reduced compared to 65-70% cohesion defect that was observed previously for <italic>eco1</italic> mutant cells or cells lacking both Eco1 and Wpl1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Guacci et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sutani et al., 2009</xref>). Taken together, these results suggest that <italic>smc1-D1164E</italic> restored cohesion by phenocopying both Eco1’s antagonism of Wpl1 and its ability to promote stably DNA-bound cohesin to tether sister chromatids.</p><p>The partial restoration of cohesion in <italic>smc1-D1164E eco1</italic>∆ <italic>wpl1</italic>∆ cells could reflect the inability of <italic>smc1-D1164E</italic> to fully compensate for the loss of Eco1 or Wpl1. Alternatively, it might reflect an inherent cost of uncoupling cohesin from its regulators. To differentiate between these possibilities, we characterized the <italic>smc1-D1164E</italic> allele when both <italic>ECO1</italic> and <italic>WPL1</italic> were present. In plasmid shuffle assays (Materials and methods), the viability of cells containing the <italic>smc1-D1164E</italic> or <italic>SMC1</italic> alleles was indistinguishable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). However, otherwise wild type cells carrying the <italic>smc1-D1164E</italic> allele had a moderate cohesion defect at both <italic>CEN</italic>-proximal and <italic>CEN</italic>-distal loci, which arose around the time of replication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). This defect was similar to that observed for the <italic>smc1-D1164E eco1</italic>∆ <italic>wpl1</italic>∆ cells. Thus, cohesin in <italic>smc1-D1164E</italic> cells had an inherent moderate cohesion establishment defect independent of cohesin regulators. Taken together, our results suggest that the <italic>smc1-D1164E</italic> allele was constitutively cohesive as it uncoupled cohesin function from its regulators, which reduced the efficiency of cohesion generation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Analogous D-loop mutations in Smc1 and Smc3 ATPase active sites differentially affect cohesin’s DNA-binding and DNA-tethering activities</title><p>Our two new cohesion activator mutations mapped to residues intimately involved in the Smc3 ATPase active site, and the previously characterized third cohesion activator was in close proximity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Guacci et al., 2015</xref>).

The mutation of the D-loop aspartate in Rad50 to an alanine (Rad50<sup>DA</sup>) dramatically reduced its ATPase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">la Rosa and Nelson, 2011</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). Furthermore, the substitution of the D-loop aspartate with a glutamate (Rad50<sup>DE</sup>) led to a 3-fold reduction in ATPase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>To address how the cohesin ATPase activity would be affected by these substitutions, we purified the <italic>S. pombe</italic> cohesin complex with the analogous mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Murayama and Uhlmann, 2014</xref>) and assayed the ATPase activity (a sum of the ATP hydrolysis by Smc1 and Smc3 active sites) for equivalent amounts of wild type and mutant cohesin complexes. The mutation in the <italic>S. pombe</italic> homolog of cohesin analogous to <italic>smc1-D1164E</italic> (<italic>Sp</italic>Smc1<sup>DE</sup>), which was competent for cohesion and viability in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, reduced the ATPase activity of cohesin to levels close to the Smc3 walker A mutant (<italic>Sp</italic>Smc3<sup>WA</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). In contrast, the D-loop-E mutation in the Smc1 ATPase active site (<italic>Sp</italic>Smc3<sup>DE</sup>), analogous to the <italic>smc3-D1161E</italic> allele that abolished chromosomal association of cohesin, led to a subtler reduction in cohesin’s total ATPase activity. These results suggested that the substitution of the D-loop aspartate with a glutamate in Smc3 and Smc1 ATPase active sites affect cohesin in unique ways that uncouple the level of ATPase activity from DNA tethering and DNA binding.</p><p>The novel and distinct phenotypes of <italic>smc1-D1164E</italic> and <italic>smc3-D1161E</italic> might result from a subtle change that alters rather than abrogates D-loop function, given the chemical similarity of aspartate and glutamate. To test whether these unusual phenotypes persisted with more radical substitutions of the D-loop aspartate, we changed it to alanine in the Smc1 or Smc3 ATPase active sites. We introduced these <italic>smc1-D1164A</italic> or <italic>smc3-D1161A</italic> alleles into strains bearing <italic>SMC1-AID</italic> or <italic>SMC3-AID</italic> alleles, respectively (Figure 6A). We then characterized these alleles under conditions in which the AID-tagged proteins were degraded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Neither <italic>smc1-D1164A</italic> nor <italic>smc3-D1161A</italic> allele was able to sustain viability on auxin plates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6B,C</xref>).

Free cohesin is converted to a stable DNA-bound form by the action of the loader complex (not shown) and ATP binding/hydrolysis by ATPase active sites. A particular unknown nucleotide state at the Smc3 ATPase active site induces the tethering (cohesive) form. Upon finding the correct sister to be paired with, the Eco1-mediated acetylation of Smc3 leads to the stabilization of this cohesive state. Absent this stabilization, the Smc3 ATPase active site destabilizes the tethering form or induces cohesin dissociation from chromosomes. Wpl1 could either promote this Smc3 ATPase active site function or destabilize the cohesin bound to DNA in the non-tethering form.

Lastly, a mutation analogous to one of these activator mutations, <italic>smc1-D1164E</italic>, abolishes most, if not all, cohesin ATPase activity when introduced in purified <italic>S. pombe</italic> cohesin complex. Taken together, our results suggest the robust ATPase activity of DNA-bound cohesin is physiologically relevant, likely acting as an inhibitor of the conversion of stably bound cohesin to a form capable of tethering sister chromatids.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Smc3 ATPase active site has a unique function in DNA tethering</title><p>We also show that the cohesion activator phenotype of the <italic>smc1-D1164E</italic> allele is a unique feature of the D-loop of the Smc3 ATPase active site. The analogous substitution in the D-loop of the Smc1 ATPase active site, <italic>smc3-D1161E,</italic> not only fails to act as a cohesion activator but also is unable to support viability, fails to load cohesin to DNA, and cannot generate cohesion. These results suggest that the Smc1 and Smc3 ATPase active sites differentially affect cohesin ATPase function and that the Smc3 ATPase active site has a distinct function in the generation of cohesion after stable DNA binding of cohesin. This distinct function provides an explanation for the evolutionary diversion of the SMC subunits. Indeed, use of asymmetrical ATPases for regulation purposes is common to ABC transporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Antony and Hingorani, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Furman et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Yang et al., 2003</xref>). We suspect the differential roles of cohesin ATPase active sites and a specialized role for the Smc3 active site in DNA tethering was missed previously, in part due to their composite nature and the particular mutations that have been analyzed to date. How the D-loop of the Smc3 ATPase active site executes its specialized function in regulating the cohesin ATPase remains unclear. The D-loop may impact the nucleotide state only in the Smc3 ATPase active site. Alternatively, it could alter the nucleotide state of both active sites. Support for the latter comes from studies on the ABC ATPase domains in ABC transporters, which suggest that ATP hydrolysis by the two sites is cooperative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Holland and Blight, 1999</xref>), and that D-loops are involved in mediating the communicat﻿on between the two active sites within the ATPase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Furman et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hohl et al., 2012, 2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Cohesin functions can be separated from overall ATPase activity levels</title><p>The phenotypes of the D-loop mutants in the Smc1 and Smc3 active sites did not correlate with the ATPase activities of the corresponding purified <italic>S. pombe</italic> cohesin complexes. For example, cohesin complexes with aspartate-to-glutamate substitution in the D-loop of the Smc1 active site had significant ATPase activity in vitro, but were severely perturbed for DNA binding in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. In addition, cohesin complexes with aspartate-to-glutamate substitution in the D-loop of the Smc3 ATPase had low levels of ATPase activity indistinguishable from the walker A mutant, but could promote DNA binding and cohesion in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. While it is possible that this lack of correlation could be explained by our use of the ATPase activity of the <italic>S. pombe</italic> wild type and mutant cohesins as an approximation of the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> cohesin, this explanaition seems unlikely. The aspartate of the D-loop is absolutely conserved in all SMC complexes and highly conserved among very diverse ABC ATPase modules. Our analysis of analogous substitutions in the homodimeric Rad50 protein shows similar reductions in the ATPase activity. Finally, many published biochemical and structural studies have used cohesin complexes from different organisms as a proxy for <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> cohesin to provide physiologically relevant insights. Intriguingly, the uncoupling of ATPase activity and function by D-loop mutations has been observed for several other ABC ATPases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Furman et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Grossmann et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Therefore, we favor a model in which cohesin’s functions and conformations could be coordinated by the different states in the hydrolysis cycle of ATPase active sites. For example, the tethering-competent state of cohesin could require that the Smc3 active site be bound with ADP+Pi. The <italic>smc1-D1164E</italic> mutation may mimic the ADP-Pi state, whereas the <italic>smc1-D1164A</italic> mutant could be blocked elsewhere in the ATPase cycle (ATP bound or nucleotide free). Both the <italic>smc1-D1164E</italic> and <italic>smc1-D1164A</italic> would dramatically reduce overall ATPase activity but only the <italic>smc1-D1164E</italic> would promote cohesin function. A similar case of trapping the ADP+Pi state is hypothesized for the MRP1 ABC transporter, for a glutamate substitution of an aspartate residue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Qin and Cao, 2008</xref>). Elucidating the exact relationship between the particular nucleotide states of the Smc1 and Smc3 ATPase active sites and cohesin functions will likely require in vitro reconstitution of cohesin’s various functions and detailed structural studies.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Eco1 and Wpl1 regulate cohesin’s tethering activity through cohesin ATPase</title><p>The phenotypes of <italic>smc1-D1164E</italic> cells suggest that Eco1 modulation of cohesin’s ATPase impacts two distinct modes of cohesin regulation. First, <italic>smc1-D1164E</italic> suppresses the inviability of <italic>eco1</italic>∆ cells, which normally die because they are unable to inhibit Wpl1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Rolef Ben-Shahar et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rowland et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sutani et al., 2009</xref>). This result suggests that Eco1 acetylation alters the Smc3 ATPase active site to make cohesin resistant to Wpl1. Second, <italic>smc1-D1164E</italic> also suppresses the cohesion defect in <italic>eco1</italic>△ <italic>wpl1</italic>△ cells, suggesting that it phenocopies the second function of Eco1 acetylation, the activation of DNA-bound cohesin to tether sister chromatids.</p><p>A clue to how Eco1 modulates cohesin ATPase to promote DNA tethering comes from our in vitro and in vivo characterization of <italic>smc1-D1164E</italic>. Since <italic>smc1-D1164E</italic> suppresses the <italic>eco1</italic>∆ cohesion defect, we propose that <italic>smc1-D1164E</italic> mimics the Eco1 acetylation of Smc3 by blocking the cohesin ATPase at a particular stage in its hydrolysis cycle, promoting DNA tethering. In the absence of acetylation, continued cycles of ATP hydrolysis prevent cohesin from maintaining the conformation necessary for tethering (Figure 7D). The completion of the ATPase cycle may render cohesin in a conformation capable of being recognized by and acted upon Wpl1, which leads to cohesin dissociation from DNA.</p><p>This model predicts that Eco1-mediated acetylation of the Smc3 may have an impact on the ATPase activity of cohesin. However, previous studies on in vitro acetylated cohesin or acetyl-mimic mutants of cohesin suggest that Eco1 acetylation does not impact cohesin’s total ATPase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ladurner et al., 2014</xref>). This could be due to (1) the inherent inefficiency of acetylation both in vitro and in vivo, resulting in only a small subset of cohesin being acetylated, (2) the inability of glutamine substitutions of K112 and K113 in Smc3 to mimic the acetylated state, (3) the failure to assay cohesin ATPase activity on DNA. Alternatively, Eco1-mediated acetylation may stabilize an intermediate state of cohesin in a way that makes subsequent cycles of ATP hydrolysis unable to alter the tethering conformation. Either way, the result is that acetylation traps cohesin in its tethering form to stabilize cohesion during or soon after establishment. Testing whether Eco1-mediated acetylation directly downregulates the cohesin ATPase cycle when bound to DNA and how the ATPase cycle affects cohesin conformation will require better reconstitution of cohesin function in vitro.</p><p>Our model of transient conformational changes that must be stabilized provides a plasticity to cohesin-mediated DNA tethering. Cohesin that is bound to a locus could form transient tethers with a number of different DNA loci and at different times. The spatial and temporal control of Eco1 would ensure that only the proper tethers are stabilized, allowing a very tight regulation for cohesion establishment in sister chromatid cohesion. This plasticity of cohesin tethering and its Eco1-dependent regulation may be critical for other aspects of cohesin function, such as condensation, DNA repair and transcriptional regulation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Protein expression and purification</title><p><italic>S.pombe</italic> cohesin complex was over-expressed and purified from <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Murayama and Uhlmann, 2014</xref>) with minor modifications.

The ATPase reaction was started by the addition of 20 μL of 5x ATP hot mix (2.5 mM ATP, 1 μL of 10 μCi/ μL ATP-γ-P32 in 96.5 μL 5xATP buffer) to 80 μL cohesin mix. Thus, in our ATPase reactions, the final concentration of cohesin was 120 nM, and ATP was 0.5 mM. At appropriate time points, 20 μL of this reaction mix was taken out and mixed with 380 μL of 0.25 mg/mL BSA. 300 μL of STOP buffer (100 μL KPO<sub>4</sub> 1 M, 100 μL 1N HCl, 100 μL 20% Norit) was immediately added to the samples. Samples were then spun at 4°C 10000 rpm for 3 minutes. 500 μL of the supernatant was taken out in a new tube and spun again at 4°C 10000 rpm for 3 minutes. 350 μL of the supernatant of this second spin was counted in 5 mL of scintillation cocktail using a scintillation counter.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and James Kadonaga as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Senor Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Cohesins belong to the family of SMC containing protein complexes that play a critical role in chromosome structure and sister chromatid cohesion, the process that holds the replicated DNA strands together until their segregation in anaphase. This manuscript addresses how the SMC ATPases function in this process.</p><p>Previous studies suggested that the two ATPases of cohesin, Smc1 and Smc3, are critical for cohesins to bind DNA. This study addresses this possibility in mechanistic detail and suggests that only one of the ATPases, Smc1, is required for this process and that the other ATPase, Smc3 is required for cohesion establishment after cohesin binds to the DNA.</p><p>The findings presented are interesting, but important aspects of the conclusions need to be validated. We would therefore be interested in a revised manuscript that suitably addresses the points outlined below.</p><p>1) The authors should cite appropriate references for the schematic diagram for the Smc1-Smc3 head domain interaction in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1A</xref> and stipulate that this has not been experimentally proven for cohesin Smc1 and Smc3.</p><p>2) It is interesting that DE mutations in Smc1 and Smc3 at equivalent amino acid residues have distinct effects on ATPase activity, cell viability, and cohesin binding to chromatin. However, no experimental data were provided to demonstrate, as summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>, that Smc1DE and Smc3DE mutations only affect Smc3 and Smc1 ATPases, respectively. Therefore, the authors should test whether Smc1DE affects Smc3 ATPase, and Smc3DE affects Smc1 ATPase. If this is not possible, the conclusions and model figure should be appropriately adjusted to match the supporting data.</p><p>3) Apparent discordance between the mutants' ability to support cohesion/viability and their ATPase activities is confusing. Additional data should be provided by performing both in vivo and in vitro studies using the same species. Alternatively, the authors should acknowledge the possible problem of comparing <italic>S. pombe</italic> cohesin for the in vitro studies and <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> cohesin for the in vivo studies and tone down the conclusion.</p><p>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>: The labeling &quot;Smc3 ATPase&quot; and &quot;Smc1 ATPase&quot; for Smc1-D1164 and Smc3-D1161 mutants are confusing and potentially misleading without further proof and thus, should be deleted unless additional data are provided to validate these conclusions (as in point #2).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11315.035</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) The authors should cite appropriate references for the schematic diagram for the Smc1-Smc3 head domain interaction in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1A</xref> and stipulate that this has not been experimentally proven for cohesin Smc1 and Smc3.</italic> </p><p>We have included the appropriate references in the figure legend and main text, and added that this is a model based on the available Rad50 and Smc1 head domain structures in presence of ATP, and that this model is not experimentally proven for the heterodimeric cohesin ATPase head domain. We also have added the following definition sentence to our Introduction to clarify the composite nature of the cohesin ATPase head domain: “Cohesin’s ATPase domain is composed of two ATPase active sites each containing four conserved motifs: Walker A, Walker B, signature motif, and D-loop. In the Smc1 ATPase active site the Walker A and Walker B motifs are encoded by Smc1, while the D-loop and signature motifs are encoded by Smc3. Likewise, the Smc3 ATPase active site contains the Smc3-encoded Walker A and Walker B motifs, and Smc1-encoded D-loop and signature motifs (Arumugam et al., 2006; Haering et al., 2004; Hopfner et al., 2000).”</p><p><italic>2) It is interesting that DE mutations in Smc1 and Smc3 at equivalent amino acid residues have distinct effects on ATPase activity, cell viability, and cohesin binding to chromatin. However, no experimental data were provided to demonstrate, as summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>, that Smc1DE and Smc3DE mutations only affect Smc3 and Smc1 ATPases, respectively. Therefore, the authors should test whether Smc1DE affects Smc3 ATPase, and Smc3DE affects Smc1 ATPase. If this is not possible, the conclusions and model figure should be appropriately adjusted to match the supporting data.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewers and agree that although the D-loop residues in question form part of pme active site, there is no evidence that our D loop mutants only affect one ATPase active site. Given the proposed role of the D-loops in mediating communication between the two active sites, it is certainly possible that they would have an effect on the ATPase activity of both subunits. Indeed, as shown before, the walker A mutations in either subunit appears to effect activity of both subunits, bringing down the total activity to near background levels, further arguing that it is very difficult to affect one ATPase without affecting the other in ABC ATPases. As mentioned by the reviewers, our main point is that the two ATPase active sites are not functionally equivalent, suggesting that they modulate different steps in cohesin function. To clarify this point, we have now altered our model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>, and expanded our Discussion (please see below) to mention that we refer to the regulation of the cohesin ATPase by these active sites, and that we are not measuring the individual activities of each active site.</p><p>“How the D-loop of the Smc3 ATPase active site executes its specialized function in regulating the cohesin ATPase remains unclear. The D-loop may impact the nucleotide state only in the Smc3 ATPase active site. Alternatively, it could alter the nucleotide state of both active sites. Support for the latter comes from studies on the ABC ATPase domains in ABC transporters, which suggest that ATP hydrolysis by the two sites is cooperative (Holland and Blight, 1999), and that D-loops are involved in mediating the communication between the two active sites within the ATPase (Furman et al., 2013; Hohl et al., 2012; 2014).”</p><p><italic>3) Apparent discordance between the mutants' ability to support cohesion/viability and their ATPase activities is confusing. Additional data should be provided by performing both in vivo and in vitro studies using the same species. Alternatively, the authors should acknowledge the possible problem of comparing</italic> S. pombe <italic>cohesin for the in vitro studies and</italic> S. cerevisiae <italic>cohesin for the in vivo studies and tone down the conclusion.</italic> </p><p>We address the reviewers’ concerns in several ways. First, we now acknowledge that using ATPase activity of the <italic>S. pombe</italic> wild-type and mutant cohesins is an approximation of the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> cohesin and some of the discordance could possibly be explained by this approximation. We present our arguments for why the use of the <italic>S. pombe</italic> cohesin as a proxy and the observed discordance is likely physiologically relevant. Finally, we improve the presentation of our model that the intermediates in the ATPase cycle are critical for regulating cohesin function, not the level of ATPase activity. A mutant protein that blocks the exchange of ADP-Pi with ATP will dramatically reduce the level of ATPase activity, but it would not impair cohesin function if the ADP-Pi state is the active form. In contrast, a mutant that radically reduces ATP hydrolysis will also reduce ATPase activity but trap cohesin in the ATP-bound state, which could impair cohesin function if this state is inactive. We hope that these revisions will make the discordance enlightening and no longer confusing. We have incorporated these points into the Discussion under the subheading “Cohesin functions can be separated from overall ATPase activity levels”.</p><p><italic>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>: The labeling &quot;Smc3 ATPase&quot; and &quot;Smc1 ATPase&quot; for Smc1-D1164 and Smc3-D1161 mutants are confusing and potentially misleading without further proof and thus, should be deleted unless additional data are provided to validate these conclusions (as in point #2).</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewers for pointing out this potentially misleading wording. We included a section in the Introduction to clarify the definition of the two ATPase active sites in cohesin’s ATPase head domain (please see our response to point 1). We have also altered the wording in the mentioned figures and in the manuscript, referring to the sites as Smc1 and Smc3 ATPase active sites (a published convention as used in Arumugam et al. 2006). This change emphasizes location of the mutations in the D-loops without inferring a conclusion about the impact of the mutation on the specific ATPases.</p></body></sub-article></article>
