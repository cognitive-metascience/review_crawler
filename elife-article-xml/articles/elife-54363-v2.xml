A healthy adult woman with complete lifelong germline knockout of <italic>HAO1</italic> (hydroxyacid oxidase 1, encoding glycolate oxidase) was identified. The frameshift variant, rs1186715161 (present on a single Ensembl 99 transcript ENST00000378789.3:c.997delC, ENSP00000368066.3:p.Leu333SerfsTer4), for which the woman is homozygous, is predicted to truncate the final 37 amino acids of the HAO1 protein. Inspection of blood DNA exome sequencing read data confirmed the genotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), as did Sanger dideoxy sequencing in a further saliva DNA sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The volunteer was 7.4% autozygous at the DNA level and the genotype was within a long (5.2 Mb) autozygous region.

The cumulative frequency of known pLOF variants in <italic>HAO1</italic> is low, in gnomAD v2.1 approximately 1 in 2700 individuals is heterozygous. Analysis of pLOF constraint, to assess the degree of natural selection against loss of function, revealed 13 variants observed out of 17.7 expected (obs/expÂ =Â 74%, 90% CI 48â€“117%), with a confidence interval spanning the range for recessive disease genes (mean obs/expÂ =Â 59%) and homozygous pLoF tolerant genes (mean obs/expÂ =Â 92%) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Minikel et al., 2019</xref>). The lack of strong constraint makes the <italic>HAO1</italic> gene unlikely to have a haploinsufficient phenotype, but does not rule out a deleterious health effect in homozygotes or a mild phenotype in heterozygous carriers. However, since the expected homozygote frequency in an outbred population would be onlyÂ ~1 in 30 million individuals, assessing the health effects of <italic>HAO1</italic> loss to date has been challenging. Three children have previously been reported with suspected glycolate oxidase deficiency, however all were ascertained to have complicating factors such as multiple gene deletions or additional mutations associated with a severe genetic disease, thus confounding clinical interpretation. Furthermore none had plasma biochemical assays, and not all had <italic>HAO1</italic> sequencing performed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Frishberg et al., 2014</xref>), (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Clifford-Mobley et al., 2017</xref>), (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Craigen, 1996</xref>).</p><p><italic>HAO1</italic> inhibition is a potential chronic therapeutic approach for a devastating metabolic disease (primary hyperoxaluria type 1, PH1).

Her medical history, and UK National Health Service (NHS) primary and secondary care health records were reviewed. At the time of assessment, she was in her 5th decade and a mother with three healthy children. She declared British-Pakistani ethnicity. Renal ultrasound, carried out as part of a gynaecology assessment, was normal. She was overweight (BMI 30â€“35 kg/m<sup>2</sup>), and other than common non-serious short-term illnesses and pregnancy symptoms, otherwise healthy.</p><p>Standard clinical venous blood biochemistries including serum sodium, potassium, bicarbonate, chloride, creatinine, transaminases, and bilirubin were repeatedly normal at recall and over the previous decade. At genotype directed recall, her serum anion gap was normal, and plasma and urinary oxalate were both normal. However, confirming the loss of function predicted from the genetics, her plasma glycolate and urinary glycolate levels were markedly elevated (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>), at, respectively, 12 times and six times the upper limit of normal in healthy reference individuals.</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Blood and Urine biochemical measurements in a healthy woman with a p.Leu333SerfsTer4 <italic>HAO1</italic> knockout.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Sample and assay</th><th valign="top">Level</th><th valign="top">Reference Range<sup>*</sup></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top"><italic>Venous blood</italic></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Plasma oxalate</td><td valign="top">&lt;1.0 mcmol/L</td><td valign="top">&lt;1.6</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Plasma glycolate</td><td valign="top">171 nmol/mL</td><td valign="top">â‰¤14</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Plasma glycerate</td><td valign="top">&lt;1 nmol/mL</td><td valign="top">â‰¤28</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Urine (single void, same day as blood tests)</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Urine oxalate</td><td valign="top">0.16 mmol/L</td><td valign="top">Not applicable</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Urine oxalate/creatinine ratio</td><td valign="top">20 mg/g</td><td valign="top">â‰¤75</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Urine glycolate/creatinine ratio</td><td valign="top">199 mg/g</td><td valign="top">â‰¤50</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">24 hr urine (on a different day)</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Urine oxalate (total/24 hr)</td><td valign="top">0.27 mmol/24 hr</td><td valign="top">&lt;0.46</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Urine oxalate/creatinine ratio</td><td valign="top">23 mg/g</td><td valign="top">â‰¤75</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Urine glycolate/creatinine ratio</td><td valign="top">309 mg/g</td><td valign="top">â‰¤50</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p><sup>*</sup>Reference ranges (mean+2sd) derived from studies of 67 healthy adults at the Mayo Clinic.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><p>We analyzed 914 metabolites (736 known, 178 unknown, Metabolon HD4 Panel) and 957 lipids (Metabolon TrueMass Complex Lipid Panel) from her blood plasma and from controls. Consistent with the expectation that HAO1 plays a relatively limited metabolic role, the majority of her metabolites were similar (+/-Â 3 sd) compared to those of 25 control individuals. Principal component analysis of the metabolomics data showed her to be an outlier on PC2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), analysis of loadings suggested the high glycolate level to be the major driver. We observed that 18 biochemicals (including glycolate) were markedly elevated (extreme outliers atÂ &gt;5 sd compared to controls) in addition to other more modestly elevated biochemicals (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">2</xref>). Some of these may reflect the known roles of glycolate in human metabolism, and be directly related to the very high glycolate. The elevated cholic acid related compounds might be due to reduced local availability of glycine (a product of the glycolate pathway) to conjugate cholic acid and its bile acid derivatives (unconjugated bile acids are elevated; glycine and taurine conjugated bile acids are reduced). Six of the significantly elevated metabolites have a structure compatible with being potential HAO1 substrates, two further evidenced by reduced levels of their predicted metabolic products (annotated in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Principal component analysis of the Metabolon metabolomics data.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>)Â Data is available in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>.

In healthy volunteers at the highest dose tested (6 mg/Kg) maximal plasma glycolate and urinary glycolate concentrations were 3â€“5 times less than observed in the <italic>HAO1</italic> knockout woman. This lumasiran dose would be expected to silence the <italic>HAO1</italic> mRNA atÂ &gt;95% based upon modeling from preclinical results in mice, rats, and monkeys and from direct comparison to clinical data from RNAi therapeutics to other targets that employ the same molecular design and have similar potency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Fitzgerald et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Hill et al., 2016</xref>).

Overproduction of oxalate occurs in the liver due to an inherited genetic defect of the enzyme alanine-glyoxylate aminotransferase (encoded by <italic>AGXT</italic>). High concentrations of urinary oxalate result in precipitation of insoluble calcium oxalate salts and may lead to paediatric end stage kidney disease. Multi-organ damage can also occur from systemic oxalosis. Substantial unmet need exists for therapies to treat PH1 without requiring dual liver-kidney transplantation.</p><p>Targeting <italic>HAO1</italic> to reduce substrate for oxalate production in the liver is one potential therapeutic approach. Glycolate oxidase is directly upstream of AGXT, reducing glycolate oxidase activity is expected to decrease oxalate production and increase glycolate levels. Excess glycolate is expected to be freely excreted by the kidneys and is highly soluble. However, suppression of <italic>HAO1</italic> is a novel therapeutic approach that poses unknown risks. For example, as well as its glycolate oxidase activity, HAO1 can also metabolise 2-hydroxy fatty acids. Pre-clinical lumasiran studies in mice, rats, and monkeys suggested no adverse signals from chronic <italic>HAO1</italic> silencing ofÂ &gt;95%, with the expected substantial elevations in glycolate levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Liebow et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Martin-Higueras et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Dutta et al., 2016</xref>). Neither studies in non-human species nor relatively short-term therapeutic studies in people, fully inform the lifelong safety of glycolate oxidase targeting in humans, which remains unknown.</p><p>A powerful approach to drug target de-risking is the identification of healthy people who naturally lack activity for a given protein (human knockouts). <italic>PCSK9, LPA</italic> and <italic>APOC3</italic> are classic examples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Zhao et al., 2006</xref>), (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Lim et al., 2014</xref>), (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Saleheen et al., 2017</xref>). Such reverse genetics - identifying individuals with extreme genotypes and then investigating their biology, provides an efficient alternative to the traditional approach of forward genetics - aggregating phenotypes and then investigating their genetic basis. A major challenge is that individuals with homozygous or compound heterozygous deficiency are expected to be extremely rare, made even more challenging to ascertain when the interest is in clinically silent phenotypes (e.g. to de-risk therapeutic targets). However, in selected populations where consanguineous unions are more common, the odds of homozygous mutations of all kinds increases profoundly due to autozygosity. Such naturally occurring genetic variation in autozygous humans provides opportunities to study the mechanism and safety of germline gene knockdown across the full life course of an individual - especially as studies are now sequencing adult populations, rather than focussing on children with rare diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Narasimhan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Saleheen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Mullard, 2017</xref>). Our population genomic program, combined with excellent NHS e-health records; and the ability to directly recall consented subjects for further clinical research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Corbin et al., 2018</xref>) has allowed us to identify a clinically silent (at least in her genetic background, note a possible limitation of this study is that the effect of the knockout on other human genetic backgrounds could not be evaluated), but very informative, genotype leading to <italic>HAO1</italic> deficiency (and previously <italic>PRDM9</italic> deficiency in another individual <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Narasimhan et al., 2016</xref>). The study of even a single human is equivalent to a typical knockout mouse study, in that such mice are very highly inbred and near-identical, thus using multiple mice only increases measurement precision not the assessment of multiple genetic backgrounds. We propose that an international collaborative database of human knockouts could increase understanding of human physiology and accelerate development of therapies for a broad range of rare and common diseases. Such a database would not require a clinical phenotype for enrollment, and might identify most homozygous pLOF variants that are compatible with life. Different genes would be expected to yield different numbers of homozygous knockouts but even an n of 1, as reported here, provides profound insights.</p><p>Most importantly, our data support the potential safety of <italic>HAO1</italic> inhibition as a chronic therapy for the devastating metabolic disease PH1. Furthermore, any potential other effects of <italic>HAO1</italic> suppression beyond glycolate oxidation did not lead to any apparent clinical phenotype. This case demonstrates the value of studying the lifelong complete knockdown of a target protein in a living human to aid development of a potential therapeutic, both in de-risking the approach and providing in vivo mechanistic understanding to optimize its development. Furthermore, lifelong therapy for PH1 is likely to be required. Our approach demonstrates the potential for improved drug discovery through unlocking relevant evidence hiding in the diversity of human genetic variation.</p><p>The top two traces (forward sequencing, then below, reverse sequencing) are of the woman with homozygous ENST00000378789.3:c.997delC genotype.

Urine and plasma oxalate and glycolate quantification was performed at the Mayo Clinical Labs with samples prepared as instructed for each test (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.mayocliniclabs.com/test-catalog">https://www.mayocliniclabs.com/test-catalog</ext-link>). Urine oxalate (Test ID: ROXU) was measured using a modification of the oxalate oxidase method as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Wilson and Liedtke, 1991</xref>). Plasma oxalate (Test ID: POXA) concentrations were determined for an acidified sample (to minimize spontaneous conversion of ascorbate to oxalate) by ion-exchange chromatography using the Dionex ICS 2100 instrument. Urine glycolate (Test ID: HYOX) was determined along with a panel of metabolites (4-hydroxy-2-oxoglutaric, HOG; oxalate, glyoxylate, and glycerate). Briefly, urine samples corresponding to 0.25 mg of creatinine (not to exceed 1 mL of urine) were oximated by reaction with methoxyamine hydrochloride to stabilize one of the target analytes (HOG). The urine was then acidified and extracted with 4:1 ethyl acetate:isopropanol. After evaporation, the dry residue was silylated with 80:20 BSTFA/1%TMCS:pyridine and analyzed by capillary gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) for quantification of each analyte. For plasma glycolate quantification (Test ID: HYOXP), non-acidified plasma samples were spiked with a mixture of stable isotope internal standards and treated with pentafluorobenzyl hydroxylamine HCl to prepare PFB-oxime derivatives of any oxo-acids present. After oximation, available hydroxy groups (alcohols or carboxylic acids) were derivatized with a silylating reagent (N,O-Bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide; BSTFA) to impart necessary volatility and stability for analysis by capillary GC-MS in PCI SIM mode. Quantification was enabled by calibration with use of internal standard, and one quantifier ion and one qualifier ion.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Metabolon metabolomics (UPLC-MS/MS), Metabolon HD4 panel</title><p>Following receipt by Metabolon, samples were inventoried and immediately stored at âˆ’80Â°C. Each sample received was accessioned into the Metabolon LIMS system and was assigned by the LIMS a unique identifier that was associated with the original source identifier only. This identifier was used to track all sample handling, tasks, results, etc. The samples (and all derived aliquots) were tracked by the LIMS system. All portions of any sample were automatically assigned their own unique identifiers by the LIMS when a new task was created; the relationship of these samples was also tracked. All samples were maintained at âˆ’80Â°C until processed.</p><p>Samples were prepared using the automated MicroLab STAR system from Hamilton Company. Several recovery standards were added prior to the first step in the extraction process for QC purposes. To remove protein, dissociate small molecules bound to protein or trapped in the precipitated protein matrix, and to recover chemically diverse metabolites, proteins were precipitated with methanol under vigorous shaking for 2 min (Glen Mills GenoGrinder 2000) followed by centrifugation. The resulting extract was divided into five fractions: two for analysis by two separate reverse phase (RP)/UPLC-MS/MS methods with positive ion mode electrospray ionization (ESI), one for analysis by RP/UPLC-MS/MS with negative ion mode ESI, one for analysis by HILIC/UPLC-MS/MS with negative ion mode ESI, and one sample was reserved for backup. Samples were placed briefly on a TurboVap (Zymark) to remove the organic solvent. The sample extracts were stored overnight under nitrogen before preparation for analysis.</p><p>Several types of controls were analyzed in concert with the experimental samples: a pooled matrix sample generated by taking a small volume of each experimental sample (or alternatively, use of a pool of well-characterized human plasma) served as a technical replicate throughout the data set; extracted water samples served as process blanks; and a cocktail of QC standards that were carefully chosen not to interfere with the measurement of endogenous compounds were spiked into every analyzed sample, allowed instrument performance monitoring and aided chromatographic alignment. Instrument variability was determined by calculating the median relative standard deviation (RSD) for the standards that were added to each sample prior to injection into the mass spectrometers. Overall process variability was determined by calculating the median RSD for all endogenous metabolites (i.e. non-instrument standards) present in 100% of the pooled matrix samples.

requests and the accompanying author responses.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Acceptance summary:</bold></p><p>Your comparison of the plasma metabolic and lipidomic profiles of a healthy adult with a life-long loss of function of the HAO gene provides support for the therapeutic approach of reducing HAO function in primary hyperoxaluria type 1. Furthermore the study demonstrates the value of identifying rare loss of function alleles in the healthy population to provide support for therapeutic strategies for the treatment of metabolic disorders.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Characterising a healthy adult with a rare HAO1 knockout to support a therapeutic strategy for primary hyperoxaluria.&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Detlef Weigel as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Mina Ryten (Reviewer #2); Nicholas Blackburn (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Three reviewers have now assessed your manuscript and all agree that the data are both interesting and important. Although the reviewers agree that the paper is highly significant for the field, the metabolic consequences of the HAO1 deficit are rather descriptive in their current format. These data should be revised to better clarify the observed changes in metabolites particularly as related to lipid and amino acid metabolism. One approach would be to use principal component analysis of the combined Metabolon measurements to demonstrate how metabolically remarkable the HAO1 knockout individual is at a global metabolic level versus the 27 controls as well as with a focus on lipid and amino acid metabolism. These data should be included as a figure in the main text not as supplementary material in the final manuscript. The reviewers also request that the raw measurements are provided for the 1871 lipids and metabolites for the patient and the 27 control individuals, as well as basic demographic and anthropometric information (age, sex, height, weight). This is important given the small sample size of the overall study to assess potential biases.</p><p>A second issue raised by the reviewers is annotation of the variant, rs1186715161. Currently the HAO1 gene is reported by Ensembl (release 99) to generate a single transcript resulting in a single prediction of the impact of the c.997delC variant detected. However, given that HAO1 contains 8 exons and the vast majority of multi-exon genes are alternatively spliced, it is possible that alternative transcript structures exist which could change the interpretation of the variant identified. This view is supported by vizER, which uses RNAseq data to identify potential novel transcripts of known genes (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/499103v2) and suggests the existence of novel transcripts of HAO1 in liver. With this in mind, the reviewers note that AceView predicts truncated transcripts of the gene. We therefore suggest that the authors review and include a discussion of other annotations and whether the interpretation of the variant remains stable across different annotation providers.</p><p>The reviewers also suggest that some caveats be included in the Discussion. While saliva and blood samples were used to test for mosaicism it is well recognised that saliva samples contain large quantities of blood-derived leukocytes, therefore this is not an effective means of demonstrating the absence of mosaicism. If it is possible to obtain a skin biopsy this would be a better way to test for mosaicism. If this is not possible within two months, please include a caveat to address this. Second the fact that the homozygous LoF mutation is studied only in one genetic background is a limitation of the analysis. We realize that examining the variant on multiple genetic backgrounds is beyond the scope of this work but please address this limitation in the Discussion.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.54363.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Three reviewers have now assessed your manuscript and all agree that the data are both interesting and important.

We performed the principal components analyses suggested, and show the HAO1 individual versus the controls. We provide these data as a main text figure. Dr Qin Qin Huang performed this analysis, and is added as a co-author.</p><p>We have preferred to treat the metabolomic and lipidomic data separately. This is because they are distinctly separate assays with completely different laboratory preparation and assay steps, and we believe this the correct way to analyse these data. We do now provide the full individual level dataset, should other journal readers wish to analyse the data in their own way.</p><p>Whilst the HAO1 individual is clearly identifiable in the 2<sup>nd</sup> principal component of the metabolomics, this remains consistent with our existing statement in the text â€˜Consistent with the expectation that HAO1 plays a relatively limited metabolic role, the vast majority of her metabolites were similar to those of 25 control individualsâ€™.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The reviewers also request that the raw measurements are provided for the 1871 lipids and metabolites for the patient and the 27 control individuals, â€¦</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer, and agree this is best practice for a scientific publication.</p><p>The raw measurements for all individuals are now added to both Supplementary file 1A and Supplementary file 1B as additional worksheets.
