mouse kinomes. Here, we report the crystal structure of the <italic>Legionella pneumophila</italic> effector protein, SidJ, in complex with the eukaryotic Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding regulator, calmodulin (CaM). The structure reveals that SidJ contains a protein kinase-like fold domain, which retains a majority of the characteristic kinase catalytic motifs. However, SidJ fails to demonstrate kinase activity. Instead, mass spectrometry and in vitro biochemical analyses demonstrate that SidJ modifies another <italic>Legionella</italic> effector SdeA, an unconventional phosphoribosyl ubiquitin ligase, by adding glutamate molecules to a specific residue of SdeA in a CaM-dependent manner. Furthermore, we show that SidJ-mediated polyglutamylation suppresses the ADP-ribosylation activity. Our work further implies that some pseudokinases may possess ATP-dependent activities other than conventional phosphorylation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>Legionella pneumophila</italic></kwd><kwd>glutamylation</kwd><kwd>ubiquitin</kwd><kwd>SdeA</kwd><kwd>phosphoribosyl ubiquitination</kwd><kwd>SidJ</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000272</institution-id><institution>National Institute for Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5R01GM116964</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mao</surname><given-names>Yuxin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Ruth L Kirschstein National Research Service Award (6T32GM008267)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Minelli</surname><given-names>Marena E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The pseudokinase-like <italic>Legionella</italic> effector SidJ catalyzes the glutamylation of bacterial ubiquitin ligases in a calmodulin-dependent manner.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Phosphorylation mediated by protein kinases is a pivotal posttranslational modification (PTM) strategy affecting essentially every biological processes in eukaryotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brognard and Hunter, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cohen, 2002</xref>). The importance of protein phosphorylation is further endorsed by the fact that the mammalian genome contains more than 500 protein kinases, corresponding to ∼2% of the total proteins encoded in the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Manning et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rubin et al., 2000</xref>). Despite the importance of phosphorylation, about 10% of kinases of the mammalian kinome lack key catalytic residues and are considered pseudokinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jacobsen and Murphy, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Shaw et al., 2014</xref>). Accumulated evidence demonstrated that catalytically inactive pseudokinases have important noncatalytic functions, such as allosteric regulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Scheeff et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zeqiraj et al., 2009</xref>) or nucleation hubs for signaling complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brennan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jagemann et al., 2008</xref>). Interestingly, a recent study uncovered AMPylation activity catalyzed by an evolutionary conserved pseudokinase selenoprotein (SelO) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sreelatha et al., 2018</xref>). The SelO pseudokinases bind ATP with a flipped orientation relative to that of the ATP bound in the active site of canonical kinases and transfer the AMP moiety, instead of the γ-phosphate, from ATP to Ser, Thr, or Tyr residues on protein substrates. This finding suggests that pseudokinases should be reassessed for alternative ATP-dependent PTM activities.</p><p>Protein glutamylation is another type of ATP-dependent PTM, in which the γ-carboxyl group of a glutamate residue in a targeted protein is activated by ATP and then forms a isopeptide bond with the amino group of a free glutamate. Alternatively, multiple glutamates can be sequentially added to the first to generate a polyglutamate chain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Janke et al., 2008</xref>). Protein glutamylation was first discovered on the proteins that build microtubules, the α-tubulins and β-tubulins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alexander et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Eddé et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Redeker et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rüdiger et al., 1992</xref>). Further studies revealed that tubulin polyglutamylation is mediated by a group of tubulin tyrosine ligase-like (TTLL) family glutamylases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">van Dijk et al., 2007</xref>). These glutamylases belong to the ATP-grasp superfamily and have a characteristic fold of two α/β domains with the ATP-binding active site situated between them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Garnham et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Szyk et al., 2011</xref>). To date, the TTLL polyglutamylases are the only family of enzymes known to catalyze protein glutamylation, although new polyglutamylated substrates have been identified in addition to tubulins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">van Dijk et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>The facultative intracellular pathogen <italic>Legionella pneumophila</italic> is the causative agent of Legionnaires’ disease, a potentially fatal pneumonia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">McDade et al., 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">McKinney et al., 1981</xref>). <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> delivers a large number (&gt;300) of effector proteins into the host cytoplasm through its Dot/Icm type IV secretion system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Segal et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Vogel et al., 1998</xref>), leading to the creation of a specialized membrane-bound organelle, the <italic>Legionella</italic>-containing vacuole (LCV) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hubber and Roy, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Isberg et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lifshitz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zhu et al., 2011</xref>). Among the large cohort of <italic>Legionella</italic> effectors, the SidE family of effectors have recently been identified as a group of novel Ub ligases that act independently of ATP, Mg<sup>2+</sup> or E1 and E2 enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bhogaraju et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kotewicz et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Qiu et al., 2016</xref>). These unusual SidE family ubiquitin ligases contain multiple domains including a mono-ADP-ribosyl transferase (mART) domain, which catalyzes ubiquitin ADP-ribosylation to generate mono-ADP-ribosyl ubiquitin (ADPR-Ub), and a phosphodiesterase (PDE) domain, which conjugates ADPR-Ub to serine residues on substrate proteins (phosphoribosyl-ubiquitination) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akturk et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dong et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kalayil et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kim et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wang et al., 2018</xref>). Interestingly, the function of SidEs appears to be antagonized by SidJ (Lpg2155), an effector encoded by a gene that resides at the same locus as genes encoding three members of the SidE family (Lpg2153, Lpg2156, and Lpg2157) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Liu and Luo, 2007</xref>). It has been shown that SidJ suppresses the yeast toxicity conferred by the SidE family effectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Havey and Roy, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jeong et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Urbanus et al., 2016</xref>). Furthermore, SidJ has been shown to act on SidE proteins and releases these effectors from the LCV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jeong et al., 2015</xref>). A recent study reported that SidJ functions as a unique deubiquitinase that counteracts the SidE-mediated phosphoribosyl-ubiquitination by deconjugating phosphoribosyl-ubiquitin from modified proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Qiu et al., 2017</xref>). However, our recent results do not support this SidJ-mediated deubiquitinase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wan et al., 2019</xref>) and the exact function of SidJ remains elusive.</p><p>The goal of the present study was to elucidate the molecular function of SidJ and to investigate the mechanism that underlies how SidJ antagonizes the PR-ubiquitination activity of SidEs. Here, we report the crystal structure of SidJ in complex with human calmodulin 2 (CaM) and reveal that SidJ adopts a protein kinase-like fold. A structural comparison allowed us to identify all the catalytic motifs that are conserved in protein kinases. However, SidJ failed to demonstrate protein kinase activity. Using the SILAC (Stable Isotope Labeling by Amino acids in Cell culture)-based mass spectrometry approach, we discovered that SidJ modifies SdeA by attaching the amino acid glutamate to a key catalytic residue on SdeA. Moreover, we found that this glutamylation activity by SidJ is CaM dependent and that the glutamylation of SdeA suppresses its PR-ubiquitination activity. Thus, our work provides molecular insights into a key PR-ubiquitination regulator during <italic>Legionella</italic> infection. We anticipate that our work will also have impact on studies of pseudokinases and CaM-regulated cellular processes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>SidJ binds CaM through its C-terminal IQ motif</title><p>To elucidate the biological function of SidJ, we performed sequence analyses and found that the C-terminus of SidJ contains the sequence ‘IQxxxRxxRK’, which resembles the IQ motif found in a number proteins that mediates binding with calmodulin (CaM) in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rhoads and Friedberg, 1997</xref>). To test whether this predicted IQ motif in SidJ can mediate an interaction with CaM, we prepared recombinant proteins of SidJ and CaM and incubated these proteins in the presence or absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>. We then analyzed the samples with Native PAGE and observed that a new band, corresponding to the SidJ-CaM complex, appeared in a Ca<sup>2+</sup> independent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The formation of the complex was dependent on the intact IQ motif as the SidJ IQ mutant (I841D/Q842A) did not form a stable complex with CaM. The interaction between SidJ and CaM was further quantified by isothermal calorimetry (ITC), which showed a dissociation constant (Kd) of about 89.6 nM between CaM and wild-type SidJ with a 1:1 stoichiometry, whereas no binding was detected between CaM and the SidJ IQ mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The association between SidJ and CaM was also demonstrated by size exclusion chromatography, in which the wild-type SidJ and CaM co-fractionated while the SidJ IQ mutant migrated separately from CaM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Collectively, these results show that SidJ interacts with CaM through its C-terminal IQ motif in a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent manner.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.51162.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>SidJ binds CaM through its C-terminal IQ motif.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Multiple sequence alignment of IQ motifs (‘IQXXXR’), which mediate the binding of CaM, from the indicated proteins.

However, the stable interaction between SidJ and CaM allowed us to crystallize SidJ in complex with CaM. The structure was determined by the selenomethionine single wavelength anomalous dispersion (SAD) method and was refined to a resolution of 2.6 Å with good crystallographic R-factors and stereochemistry (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). The SidJ-CaM structure suggests that the SidJ protein is comprised of four functional units: a N-terminal regulatory domain (NRD), a base domain (BD), a kinase-like catalytic domain, and a C-terminal domain (CTD) containing the CaM-binding IQ motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). The N-terminal portion of the NRD (residues 1–88) is predicted to be intrinsically disordered and thus was not included in the SidJ construct for crystallization trials. The rest of the NRD (residues 89–133) adopts an extended structure with three β-strands and flexible connecting loops and meanders on the surface across the entire length of the kinase-like domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref>). The BD is mainly comprised of α-helices. It interacts with both the kinase-like domain and the CTD and provides a support for these two domains, allowing them to maintain their relative orientation. The CTD contains four α-helices with the first three α-helices forming a tri-helix bundle and the fourth IQ motif-containing α-helix (IQ-helix) extending away from the bundle to engage in interactions with CaM. In the SidJ–CaM complex, CaM ‘grips’ the IQ-helix with its C-lobe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref>, left panels) while its N-lobe interacts with the NRD, CTD, and kinase-like domains. In agreement with our biochemical results showing that CaM binds SidJ in a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), only the first EF-hand of CaM is observed to coordinate with a Ca<sup>2+</sup> ion on the difference Fourier electron density map. This occurs even though the crystal is formed in a crystallization buffer containing 1 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.51162.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Overall structure of the SidJ–CaM complex.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic diagram of SidJ domain architecture.

The SidJ core, thus named kinase-like domain, assumes a classical bilobed protein kinase fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–B</xref>). A detailed structural analysis revealed that the N-lobe of the SidJ kinase-like domain contains all of the structural scaffolding elements that are conserved in protein kinases, including a five-stranded antiparallel β-sheet and the αC helix (the secondary structural elements are named according to PKA nomenclature) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Furthermore, one of the key catalytic residues, K367 in the β3 strand, is conserved among all SidJ homologs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">2</xref>). This Lys residue is positioned towards the catalytic cleft to interact with the phosphate groups of ATP for catalysis. As in protein kinases, this invariable Lys is coupled to a conserved Glu (E381) in the αC helix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). However, the ‘glycine-rich loop’ that connects the β1 and the β2 strands forms a type I β-turn structure, whereas in canonical protein kinases, the corresponding loop is much longer and packs on top of the ATP to position the phosphate groups for phosphoryl transfer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">2</xref>). Surprisingly, a pyrophosphate (PP<sub>i</sub>) molecule and two Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions are bound within the kinase catalytic cleft (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D and E</xref>). PP<sub>i</sub> is probably generated from the ATP that was added to the crystallization condition. The presence of a PP<sub>i</sub> molecule in the catalytic cleft indicates that SidJ may have an ATP-dependent catalytic function but this is not the traditional phosphoryl transfer that is catalyzed by protein kinases.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.51162.007</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>The core of SidJ adopts a protein kinase fold.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Cartoon diagram of the kinase-like domain of SidJ.

Three recognizable helices, equivalent to the αE, αF, and αH helices in protein kinases, set a foundation for three catalytic signature motifs in the C-lobe, including the HRD-motif-containing catalytic loop, the DFG-motif-containing Mg<sup>2+</sup>-binding loop, and the activation loop. These motifs are distributed within a long peptide that connects the αE and αF helices and are positioned at a location similar to that in protein kinases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Despite the existence of many features that are conserved between SidJ and canonical protein kinases, there are two unique features in the catalytic loop of SidJ. First, the aspartic acid in the HRD motif that is conserved in canonical kinases is notably different in SidJ, in which Q486 takes the position of D166 in PKA for the activation of substrates. Second, the catalytic loop of SidJ contains a 48-residue insertion between Q486 and the downstream conserved N534, albeit there are only four residues between D166 and N171 in PKA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">2</xref>). Interestingly, this large insertion creates a pocket that accommodates an AMP molecule (probably the breakdown product from ATP; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D and F</xref>). The AMP molecule was also observed in this so-called migrated nucleotide-binding pocket in a recent reported SidJ–CaM structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Black et al., 2019</xref>). The presence of this unique migrated nucleotide-binding pocket in SidJ further indicates that SidJ may have a distinct catalytic function rather than being a canonical protein kinase. Indeed, we were unable to detect any kinase activity for SidJ by in vitro kinase assays using [γ-<sup>32</sup>P]ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3A and B</xref>), even though most of the catalytic and scaffolding motifs that are essential for protein kinases are conserved in the SidJ kinase-like domain. In light of a recent discovery that the SelO pseudokinase has AMPylation activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sreelatha et al., 2018</xref>), we then tested whether SidJ is an AMPylase. A similar assay was performed with the substitution of ATP by [α-<sup>32</sup>P]ATP. Surprisingly, <sup>32</sup>P incorporation was observed for SidJ itself but not for SdeA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3C and D</xref>). Interestingly, similar auto-AMPylation activity of SidJ was also observed in a recent publication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gan et al., 2019</xref>). It is likely that auto-AMPylation of SidJ may be either a side reaction or an intermediate step for SidJ-mediated modification of SdeA.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>SidJ catalyzes the polyglutamylation of SdeA</title><p>To determine the exact catalytic function of SidJ, we used a SILAC (Stable Isotope Labeling by Amino acids in Cell culture) mass spectrometry approach. HEK293T cells grown in complete medium containing heavy [<sup>13</sup>C6]lysine [<sup>13</sup>C6]arginine were co-transfected with GFP-SdeA and mCherry-SidJ, whereas cells grown in regular medium were transfected with GFP-SdeA and a mCherry plasmid control. GFP-SdeA proteins were enriched by immunoprecipitation. MS analysis of immunoprecipitated SdeA revealed that one trypsinized peptide, corresponding to the SdeA mono-ADP ribosylation catalytic site (residues 855–877), was dramatically reduced in the heavy sample prepared from cells transfected with both SidJ and SdeA compared to that in its light counterpart prepared from cells transfected with SdeA and a control plasmid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>). This peptide generates two signature ions upon MS2 fragmentation because of the presence of two labile proline residues in the sequence. We then used this feature to search for any peptide from the heavy sample that produced these two signature ions. Multiple MS2 spectra contained these two signature ions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A–D</xref>). Strikingly, all of these peptides had a mass increase of <italic>n</italic> x 129 Da, which matches the mass change corresponding to posttranslational modification by polyglutamylation. The MS data were then re-analyzed for polyglutamylation. The modification of the SdeA peptide was revealed as either mono-, di-, or tri-glutamylation with the predominant species being di-glutamylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Furthermore, the polyglutamylation site was identified at SdeA residue E860 by MS2 analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). The activity of SidJ was then reconstituted in vitro using [U-<sup>14</sup>C]Glu. Consistent with the mass spectrometry results, the wild-type SdeA core (residues 211–1152) but not its E860A mutant, was modified with glutamate. In addition, polyglutamylation of SdeA by SidJ was dependent on both CaM and ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). As E860 is one of the key catalytic residues in the mART domain of SdeA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>), it is likely that polyglutamylation of E860 may inhibit SdeA-mediated ADP-ribosylation of ubiquitin.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.51162.011</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>SidJ catalyzes the polyglutamylation of SdeA.</title><p>Reconstructed ion chromatograms for the SdeA peptide (residues 855–877) from (<bold>A</bold>) cells grown in light medium and co-transfected with GFP-SdeA and mCherry vector control or (<bold>B</bold>) cells grown in heavy medium and co-transfected with GFP-SdeA and mCherry-SidJ.

It has been proposed that the kinase-like active site catalyzes the transfer of AMP from ATP to E860 on SdeA, whereas the migrated nucleotide-binding site catalyzes the replacement of AMP with a glutamate molecule to complete the glutamylation of SdeA at E860 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Black et al., 2019</xref>). It may also be possible, however, that the glutamylation reaction takes place at the kinase-like active site, whereas the migrated nucleotide-binding site serves as an allosteric site, in which binding of an AMP molecule at the migrated nucleotide-binding site is a prerequisite for SidJ activation. To test these two hypothesis, we took advantage of the auto-AMPylation activity of SidJ. If the first hypothesis is true, one would expect that the SidJ H492A mutant would be competent for auto-AMPylation because it has an intact kinase active site. Strikingly however, SidJ auto-AMPylation was completely abolished in both the D542A and H492A mutants. These data suggest that the migrated nucleotide-binding site is likely to be an allosteric site (created entirely by a large insertion within the catalytic loop). The binding of a nucleotide to this site is likely to stabilize the catalytic loop of the kinase-like domain in a catalytically competent conformation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Activation of SidJ by CaM</title><p>Our in vitro assays demonstrated that the polyglutamylation activity of SidJ requires binding with CaM. We next asked how CaM activates SidJ. A close examination of the SidJ-–CaM complex structure revealed that the highly acidic CaM binds with the basic IQ-helix of SidJ mainly through its C-lobe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A and C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). The C-lobe of CaM assumes a semi-open conformation, which creates a groove between CaM helices F and G and helices E and H to grip the amphipathic IQ-helix of SidJ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>). Conserved hydrophobic residues aligned inside the groove make numerous van der Waals interactions with the hydrophobic side of the IQ-helix centered at I841, whereas acidic residues located at the edge of the groove form hydrogen bonds and salt bridges with polar residues on the hydrophilic side of the IQ-helix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). By contrast, the N-lobe of CaM maintains a closed conformation similar to that observed in free apo-CaM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kuboniwa et al., 1995</xref>) or in the myosin V IQ1–CaM complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Houdusse et al., 2006</xref>), even though one Ca<sup>2+</sup> ion is chelated by the first EF-hand of CaM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3A</xref>). Interestingly, the binding of this calcium ion does not cause the conformational change observed in CaM that is fully chelated with Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Meador et al., 1992</xref>) as the conserved E31 of CaM is not positioned for chelation at the –Z coordination position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3B–D</xref>). Along this line, a recent study showed that CaM-binding by SidJ is decreased by ~30 fold if CaM is fully loaded with Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bhogaraju et al., 2019</xref>), indicating that high Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration may reduce the activity of SidJ. To test the effect of Ca<sup>2+</sup> on SidJ activity, we performed in vitro time course glutamylation assays at three different Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations (no Ca<sup>2+</sup>, 0.1 µM and 3 mM of Ca<sup>2+</sup>). In agreement with the reduced affinity for CaM by SidJ at high Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration, SidJ showed a decreased activity (~15%) in the presence of 3 mM of Ca<sup>2+</sup> compared to the condition with 1 mM EGTA. However, we speculate that Ca<sup>2+</sup> may not play a major role in the regulation of SidJ activity given the high residual activity of SidJ even in the presence of 3 mM of Ca<sup>2+</sup>. In addition, SidJ was apparently more active in 0.1 µM of Ca<sup>2+</sup> (the resting concentration of Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the cytoplasm; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s4">Figure 7—figure supplement 4</xref>), indicating that a low amount of Ca<sup>2+</sup> may be optimal for binding of CaM by SidJ or for nucleotide binding and catalysis at the ‘kinase’ active site.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.51162.017</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Activation of SidJ by CaM.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The structure of the SidJ–CaM complex showing the C-lobe of CaM (pink) ‘gripping’ the IQ-motif helix (cyan) of SidJ.

Unlike the CaM in the myosin V IQ1–CaM complex, in which the N-lobe packs close to and makes a large number of contacts with the IQ-helix, the CaM N-lobe in the SidJ–CaM complex is shifted away from the IQ-helix and engages in extensive interactions with other basic areas of SidJ, including the first β-strand (β<sub>N1</sub>) of the NRD domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B and D</xref>). Besides electrostatic interactions between the CaM N-lobe and SidJ, two carbonyl groups within the first Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding loop of the CaM N-lobe form hydrogen bonds with two backbone amide groups of the β<sub>N1</sub> strand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). These interactions between the CaM N-lobe and the β<sub>N1</sub> strand may stabilize a two-stranded antiparallel β sheet composed of β<sub>N1</sub> of the NRD domain and β0 of the kinase-like domain, which may further stabilize the activation loop in a presumably active conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). The stabilization of the activation loop is reminiscent of the activation process in canonic kinases, in which phosphorylation of specific residues in the activation loop provides an anchor to maintain this loop in the correct conformation for catalysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams, 2003</xref>). On the basis of these structural observations, we hypothesized that CaM-binding stabilizes a two-stranded β sheet on the surface of SidJ, which in turn interacts with the activation loop of the kinase-like domain to maintain this loop in an active conformation. Indeed, both the β<sub>N1</sub> deleted SidJ truncation (residue 110–853) and the IQ mutant showed a severe impairment in polyglutamylation of SdeA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E and F</xref>). Together, our data suggest that CaM-binding may activate SidJ through a network of interactions involving the CaM N-lobe, the β<sub>N1</sub> strand of the NRD, and the β0 strand and the activation loop of the kinase-like domain.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we reported the crystal structure of a <italic>Legionella</italic> effector SidJ in complex with human CaM. Through structural, biochemical, and mass spectrometric studies, we identified the biochemical function of SidJ as a protein polyglutamylase that specifically adds glutamates to a catalytic glutamate residue E860 of another <italic>Legionella</italic> effector SdeA, and thus inhibits the PR-ubiquitination process mediated by SdeA. To date, the only enzymes that have been identified to catalyze protein glutamylation belong to the tubulin tyrosine ligase-like (TTLL) protein family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Janke et al., 2008</xref>). The TTLL enzymes have an active site that lies between two characteristic α/β domains. An elegant crystal structure of TTLL7, in combination with a cryo-electron microscopy structure of TTLL7 bound to the microtubule, revealed that the anionic N-terminal tail of β-tubulin extends through a groove towards the ATP-binding active site for the modification. By contrast, the catalytic core of SidJ adopts a protein kinase-like fold. Surprisingly, besides the canonical kinase-like active site, SidJ also has a second ‘migrated’ nucleotide-binding site created by a large insertion in the kinase catalytic loop. The two sites are both required to complete the polyglutamylation reaction as single amino-acid point mutations of key residues at either site inactivate SidJ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). We further showed that the auto-AMPylation activity of SidJ was also impaired by mutations at either the kinase-like active site or the migrated nucleotide-binding site. These observations led us to propose a reaction model for SidJ-mediated polyglutamylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). In this model, SidJ is activated by CaM binding at its C-terminal IQ helix and by a nucleotide binding at its migrated nucleotide-binding pocket. Activated SidJ first attaches the AMP moiety from ATP to the γ-carbonyl group of residue E860 of SdeA. In the second step, the adenylated E860 is attacked by the amino group of a free glutamate to form an isopeptide linkage by releasing AMP. However, several prominent questions remain to be addressed, such as how SidJ recognizes SdeA and specifically attaches glutamates to residue E860 of SdeA, and how the specificity to modify SdeA is achieved with glutamate residues but not other amino acids. To answer these questions, more biochemical assays, as well as structural studies of SidJ in complex with substrates or intermediates, are warranted.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.51162.023</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Hypothetic reaction model for SidJ-mediated polyglutamylation of SdeA.</title><p>SidJ has a kinase-like catalytic cleft, a regulatory nucleotide-binding pocket and a C-terminal CaM-binding IQ helix. Binding of a nucleotide to the allosteric regulatory site and to CaM with the IQ motif activates SidJ. SidJ-mediated SdeA polyglutamylation involves two steps. In the first step, SidJ AMPylates SdeA by transferring the AMP moiety from ATP to the γ-carbonyl group of SdeA E860 and releasing a pyrophosphate molecule. In the second step, a glutamate molecule is activated at the kinase active site and its amino group serves as a nucleophile to attack the AMPylated E860. As a result, this glutamate is conjugated to E860 through an isopeptide bond and an AMP molecule is released.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-51162-fig8-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Interestingly, SidJ contains a C-terminal consensus IQ motif that mediates CaM-binding independent of calcium. The binding of the IQ helix is mainly through the CaM C-lobe, which adopts a semi-open conformation similar to that observed in the apo-CaM–IQ helix complex. However, unlike other apo-CaM complexes, where the CaM N-lobe wraps around the IQ-helix, the N-lobe in the SidJ–CaM complex rotates along the inter-lobe linker about 120 degrees and swings away from the IQ-helix to engage in extensive interactions with other parts of SidJ, particularly the β<sub>N1</sub> strand of the NRD domain. These interactions may allosterically stabilize a hydrophobic core, which may serve as an anchor point for the kinase activation loop to activate the enzyme. SidJ–CaM seems to apply a unique CaM-dependent regulatory mechanism to maintain an active conformation. Thus, the binding mode of CaM with SidJ presents an exemplary mechanism to the repertoire of CaM-effector interactions. The activation of SidJ by CaM is also of particular interest from an evolutionary point of view. Both SidJ and SdeA are expressed in <italic>Legionella</italic> cells, whereas the polyglutamylation, and hence the inhibition of SdeA, can only occur after they have been delivered into eukaryotic host cells. A similar example has been reported for the CaM-mediated activation of anthrax adenylyl cyclase exotoxin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Drum et al., 2002</xref>). This type of cross-species regulation may represent a common theme in bacterial pathogen–eukaryotic host interactions.</p><p>SidJ was first identified as a metaeffector that neutralizes the toxicity of the SidE family phosphoribosyl ubiquitin ligases in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Havey and Roy, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jeong et al., 2015</xref>). A previous publication assigned SidJ as a deubiquitinase that deconjugates phosphoribosyl-linked protein ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Qiu et al., 2017</xref>). However, this unusual deubiquitination activity was not repeatable in another study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Black et al., 2019</xref>), or in our recently published studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wan et al., 2019</xref>). The definitive biochemical function of SidJ is now revealed in this study, and in recent reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bhogaraju et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Black et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gan et al., 2019</xref>), as a polyglutamylase that adds glutamates to a specific catalytic residue E860 of SdeA and subsequently inhibits the PR-ubiquitination activity of SdeA. An interesting question that arises at this point is whether there are other glutamylation substrates, especially from the host, besides the SidE family PR-ubiquitination ligases. Given that SidJ is one of the few effectors that exhibits growth defects when deleted from <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> and plays a role in membrane remodeling during <italic>Legionella</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Liu and Luo, 2007</xref>), it is possible that SidJ modifies host targets to control certain host cellular processes. On the other hand, it seems to be a common scheme for <italic>Legionella</italic> species to encode effectors that catalyze counteractive reactions. For example, the <italic>Legionella</italic> effector SidM/DrrA AMPylates Rab1 and locks it in an active GTP state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Müller et al., 2010</xref>), whereas SidD is a deAMPylase that antagonizes SidM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Neunuebel et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tan and Luo, 2011</xref>). Another example is the pair of effectors AnkX and Lem3: AnkX transfers a phosphocholine moiety to Rab1 family members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mukherjee et al., 2011</xref>), whereas Lem3 removes the phosphocholine moiety added by AnkX from Rab1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tan et al., 2011</xref>). In respect to this scheme, it is possible that <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> may also encode an effector that counteracts SidJ by removing glutamate residues from targets. Future investigation of effectors harboring such a de-glutamylation activity would provide a comprehensive understanding of the regulation cycle of protein glutamylation that takes place during <italic>Legionella</italic> infection.</p><p>It is also noteworthy that homologs of SidJ can be detected in a variety of microorganisms, including <italic>Elusimicrobia bacterium</italic>, <italic>Desulfovibrio hydrothermalis</italic>, and <italic>Waddlia chondrophila</italic>. Furthermore, the key catalytic motifs that are found in SidJ are also readily detectable in these homologs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). It would be interesting to elucidate whether these SidJ homologs have an activity that is comparable to SidJ. In summary, our results have shown that SidJ contains a kinase-like fold and functions as a protein polyglutamylase. Our results may contribute inspiring hints to the search for other potential protein polyglutamylases and to the studies of pseudokinases for alternative ATP-dependent activities.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>The Key Resources Table is in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">supplementary file 1.</xref></p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cloning and mutagenesis</title><p>SidJ was PCR amplified from <italic>Legionella</italic> genomic DNA, digested with BamH1 and Sal1, and cloned into pmCherry-C1 and pZL507 vectors (obtained from Dr Zhao-Qing Luo, Purdue University) for mammalian and <italic>Legionella</italic> expression, respectively.

The digested protein was concentrated and purified further by fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) size exclusion chromatography using a Superdex S200 column (GE Life Science) in purification buffer. Pure fractions were collected and concentrated in Amicon Pro Purification system concentrators.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Native PAGE analysis of SidJ–CaM complex</title><p>SidJ 89–853 WT and the SidJ IQ mutant were incubated at a concentration of 5 μM with 10 μM of CaM in the presence of 1 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> or 1 mM EGTA in 50 mM Tris (pH 7.5) and 150 mM NaCl. Samples were then analyzed by Native PAGE and gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC)</title><p>SidJ 89–853 WT, IQ mutant and CaM were used for ITC experiments. CaM at 88.6 µM concentration was titrated into SidJ 89–853 WT and IQ mutants at a 20 µM concentration. CaM was titrated in 15 injections of 5 µL with spacing between injections ranging from 150 s to 400 s, until the baseline equilibrated. These experiments used the Affinity ITC from TA instruments at 25°C. Data analysis was performed on NanoAnalyze v3.10.0.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Analytical size exclusion</title><p>SidJ and IQ mutant were incubated at a concentration of 35 μM in the presence or absence of a 1.2 molar ratio of CaM. 125 μL of solution was injected onto a Superdex 200 Increase 100/300 GL column (GE) and separated at 0.7 mL/min on an AKTA Pure 25L System (GE). UV traces were generated using R-Studio Software and 0.5 mL fractions were collected and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Protein crystallization</title><p>Protein crystallization screens were performed on the Crystal Phoenix liquid handling robot (Art Robbins Instruments) at room temperature using commercially available crystal screening kits. Prior to screening and hanging drop experiments, SidJ and CaM were incubated at a 1 to 2 molar ratio for 1 hr on ice. The conditions that yielded crystals from the screen were optimized by hanging-drop vapor diffusion by mixing 1 µL of the protein complex with 1 µL of reservoir solution. All optimization by hanging-drop vapor diffusion was performed at room temperature. Specifically, for SidJ–CaM crystallization, SidJ was concentrated to 9.4 mg/mL and crystallized in 0.2 M sodium iodide, 15% PEG 3350, 0.1 M Tris (pH 9.2), 1 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> and 1 mM ATP. Rod-shaped crystals formed within 4–5 days.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>X-ray diffraction data collection and processing</title><p>Diffraction datasets for SidJ–CaM were collected at National Synchrotron Light Source II (NSLSII) beamline AMX (17-ID-1) at Brookhaven National Laboratory. Before data collection, all crystals were soaked in cryoprotectant solutions that contained the crystallization reservoir condition, supplemented with 25% glycerol. All soaked crystals were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen before data collection. X-ray diffraction data were indexed, integrated, and scaled with HKL-2000 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Otwinowski and Minor, 1997</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Structure determination and refinement</title><p>The structure of SidJ was solved by using the single wavelength anomalous dispersion (SAD) method with selenomethionine-incorporated crystals.

Cells were grown for five passages in media containing light (<sup>12</sup>C<sup>14</sup>N Lys and Arg) or heavy (<sup>13</sup>C<sup>15</sup>N Lys and Arg) amino acids. Light HEK-293T cells were transfected using polyethylenimine for 36 hr with pEGFP–SdeA and pmCherry, and heavy HEK-293T cells were transfected with pEGFP-SdeA and pmCherry-SidJ. Cells were then washed twice with cold PBS and resuspended using a cell scraper into lysis buffer [50 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% NaDOC, PMSF and Roche Protease Cocktail]. Cells were sonicated and lysates were centrifuged at 16,000xg for 15 min at 4°C. Supernatants were incubated for 4 hr with GFP nanobeads and washed with IP wash buffer [50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton]. Proteins were eluted by incubation of resin in 100 mM Tris HCl (pH 8.0) and 1% SDS at 65°C for 15 min. Eluates were reduced with 10 mM DTT and alkylated with 25 mM iodoacetamide. Heavy and light samples were mixed and precipitated on ice in PPT (49.9% ethanol, 0.1% glacial acetic acid, and 50% acetone). Proteins were pelleted by centrifugation at 16,000xg, dried by evaporation, and resolubilized in 8 M urea in 50 mM Tris (pH 8.0). The sample was digested overnight with trypsin gold at 37°C. Trypsinized samples were acidified with formic acid and triflouroacetic acid, bound to a C18 column (Waters), and washed with 0.1% acetic acid. Peptides were eluted with 80% acetonitrile and 0.1% acetic acid and dried. Samples were resuspended in 0.1 picomol/uL of angiotensin in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and frozen for mass spectrometry analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Mass spectrometry analysis</title><p>Trypsinized SILAC-IP eluates from HEK-293T cells expressing either GFP-SdeA grown in <sup>12</sup>C<sup>14</sup>N Lys + Arg or GFP-SdeA and mCherry-SidJ grown in <sup>13</sup>C<sup>15</sup>N Lys + Arg were analyzed on a ThermoFisher Q-Exactive HF mass spectrometer using a homemade C<sub>18</sub> capillary column. Peptide spectral matches were identified using a SEQUEST search through Sorcerer2 from Sage-N, and subsequently quantified by Xpress to identify peptides that were highly enriched in the SdeA-light sample (indicating the absence of that peptide from the heavy condition because of a modification). Following identification of a single peptide, R.HGEGTESEFSVYLPEDVALVPVK.V, that was disproportionately enriched in the SdeA-only condition, the .raw file from the mass spectrometer was manually inspected to find MS2 spectra that had a similar retention time and contained peaks at m/z = 351 and 1074, because these masses were characteristic of the precursor peptide found in the SdeA-only condition as the peptide contains two labile prolines. The monoisotopic precursor mass of the original, unmodified peptide from the SdeA-only condition was subtracted from the precursor mass of the most abundant peak fitting the above description. This difference corresponded to glutamylation. The original file was subsequently searched in Sorcerer2 using glutamylation (monoisotopic mass of 129.042587 Da) as a differential modification, and glutamylation sites were identified in the original peptide with Xpress scores that corresponded to their presence exclusively in the heavy condition (SdeA + SidJ).</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>In vitro glutamylation assays and SdeA inhibition</title><p>In vitro glutamylation assays were conducted with 0.5 μM SidJ 89–853, 5 μM CaM, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 5 mM glutamatic acid, and 1 μM SdeA 231–1152 in a buffer containing 50 mM Tris (pH 7.5) and 50 mM NaCl. Reactions were then initiated by addition of 1 mM ATP for 30 min at 37°C. For SdeA inhibition assays, a second ubiquitination reaction was conducted containing 25 μM ubiquitin and initiated with 1 mM NAD<sup>+</sup>. When testing PR-Ub ligation, 10 mM Rab33b 1–200 served as a substrate. Reactions were then fixed with 5X SDS loading buffer or 6X DNA loading buffer and electrophroresed with 12% SDS-PAGE gels to assay PR-Ubiquitination, or on Native PAGE gels to assay Ub modification. Gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue stain.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Radioactive glutamylation assay</title><p>Assays were conducted in a similar manner to non-radioactive glutamylation assays with the following exceptions: the concentration of SdeA was 2 μM, and 50 μM (1.76 nCi) of L-[U-<sup>14</sup>C]Glu (Perkin Elmer) was used as a reactant. For SidJ mutants, glutamylation reactions were terminated after a 15 min reaction at 37°C with 5X SDS loading buffer. In the assays to test the activation of SidJ by CaM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), 50 nM SidJ WT and mutant proteins were used in the reaction with a 1:1 ratio of SidJ to CaM.

For the time-course reactions testing the effect of Ca<sup>2+</sup> on the activity of SidJ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s4">Figure 7—figure supplement 4</xref>), 20 nM SidJ and CaM were preincubated with reaction buffers containing 1 mM EGTA, 0.1 μM Ca<sup>2+</sup>, or 3 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> for 45 min on ice. Reactions were initiated with the addition of a final concentration of 1 mM ATP. 12.5 µL of aliquots were taken from the reaction mixtures at each indicated time point and mixed with 5X SDS loading buffer to arrest the reaction. For all reactions, samples were then electrophoresed by SDS-PAGE and gels were dried. Protein labeling was then visualized by a 3–5-day exposure using an image screen (FUJI BOS-III) and a phosphoimager (Typhoon FLA 7000, GE). Quantifications were performed using the program FIJI in which the background signal was subtracted from band intensity and divided by wild type SidJ intensity.

Prior to this study, SidJ was known to be important in inhibiting the action of another bacterial protein SidE and SidJ was also known to have homology with atypical or pseudo-kinases. Here the authors determine the structure of SidJ and uncover its interaction with calmodulin, which was used in co-crystallization. Importantly, the authors demonstrate using mass spectrometry and other methods that SidJ's catalytic function is to glutamylate SidE on a Glu residue using an adenylation mechanism characteristic of non-ribosomal amide bond forming reactions in nature. This glutamylation is sufficient to disrupt the activity of SidE and thus the findings account for the prior biological observations about SidJ's biological function. The authors partially investigate the catalytic mechanism of SidJ using site-directed mutagenesis and find that both the canonical active site as well as a 'migrated nucleotide binding pocket' contribute to the catalytic reaction. The authors' model is that the migrated nucleotide binding pocket plays an allosteric role (as opposed to a Glu binding site) since even adenylation of SidJ is lost upon mutation of this site. They also report a robust requirement for calmodulin for catalysis. Overall, this is an important advance and the work appears to have been done rigorously.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Protein polyglutamylation catalyzed by the bacterial Calmodulin-dependent pseudokinase SidJ&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

Although three related papers appeared in the last three months prior to submission that make similar findings, <italic>eLife</italic> has a 'no scoop' policy under such circumstances, so it is felt that these very recent articles should not prevent publication of this study.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors have not convincingly characterized the dependence of SidJ-catalyzed glutamylation of SidA on CaM. For example, Figure 7E/F has no controls for CaM dependence and there is no apparent effect of mutating the IQ motif in this assay, which is difficult to reconcile with the other results. At the very least the assay in Figure 7E/F should be performed in the absence of CaM. We suggest the authors show a concentration dependence on CaM (starting at zero CaM) in the presence and absence of Ca. This would provide some sense of how much the enzyme is activated by CaM and whether Ca plays any role. Figure 2 of Bhogaraju et al. shows a 30-fold decrease in CaM binding in the presence of Ca, suggesting that Ca does influence SidJ activity. We think that it is important that the authors address this apparent discrepancy.</p><p>2) The concentration of the enzyme used in the assay is about 0.5 µM, suggesting that the observed activity is fairly low. It would be helpful if kcat and Km values could be determined (for ATP, glutamate, SidE). Given the complexity of the reaction, this may be somewhat challenging but it would be nice if it were attempted. Along these lines, using commercial 14C-BSA (bovine serum albumin) as a standard to calibrate the reaction allowing molar amounts of product to be quantified would be beneficial. A sense of stoichiometry of numbers of glutamates added in a reaction could also be ascertained through such calibration.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.51162.034</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors have not convincingly characterized the dependence of SidJ-catalyzed glutamylation of SidA on CaM.

We took the advice to first test the dependence of SidJ activity on CaM and Ca<sup>2+</sup>. We found that SidJ showed fairly high activity in a CaM concentration as low as 16 nM (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>). This observation suggested that the CaM concentration we previously used in the assay for Figure 7E/F (10 fold excess of CaM) is too high to detect the actual effect of the IQ motif mutant and the SidJ 110-853 truncation. We retested the activity of SidJ IQ and 110-853 truncation mutants at a 50 nM concentration of SidJ and with equal molar amount of CaM. We observed a drastic reduction of the activities of both the IQ and 110-853 truncation mutants compared to that of wild type SidJ. These new data were presented as the revised Figure 7E/F.</p><fig id="respfig1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.51162.028</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>A pilot enzymatic assay of SidJ with a variable concentration of CaM and Ca<sup>2+</sup>.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) In vitro glutamylation of SdeA with 0.5 μM SidJ and five-fold serial dilutions of CaM starting at a concentration of 10 uM.

Previously we used excessive 0.5 µM SidJ and 10x of CaM in the reactions to visualize proteins via Coomassie stain (previous Figure 7E/F). Due to the excessive amount of CaM and enzymes used in the reactions, we only observed a slight reduction of the activity of SidJ IQ mutant. This comment was very helpful and the reduced protein levels allowed detection of differential activity of CaM-binding SidJ mutants. we re-performed the reactions with 50 nM SidJ and CaM, we now observed clear defects of SidJ IQ mutant and SidJ 110-853 truncation (revised Figure 7E/F).</p><p>As suggested by the reviewers, we have intensively tried to obtain quantitative numbers to better describe SidJ activity. We performed experiments to generate reaction time courses for several different conditions (Figure 7—figure supplement 4). However, we experienced significant difficulties to obtain an accurate absolute readout for glutamylated products generated in the reactions. Nevertheless, the enzymes we used in our assays are comparable to the amount used in recent publications by Black et al. and by Bhogaraju et al. Our assays, although quantified in a relative scale, are sufficient to distinguish the activity differences of SidJ mutants as well as the effects of Ca<sup>2+</sup>. We believe that our main conclusions of the paper would not be crucially dampened due to the lack of quantitative enzymatic constants.</p></body></sub-article></article>
