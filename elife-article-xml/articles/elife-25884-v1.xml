evolved convergently. We studied convergence in evolutionary rate in subterranean mammals in order to associate phenotypic evolution with specific genetic regions. We identified a strong excess of vision- and skin-related genes that changed at accelerated rates in the subterranean environment due to relaxed constraint and adaptive evolution. We also demonstrate that ocular-specific transcriptional enhancers were convergently accelerated, whereas enhancers active outside the eye were not. Furthermore, several uncharacterized genes and regulatory sequences demonstrated convergence and thus constitute novel candidate sequences for congenital ocular disorders. The strong evidence of convergence in these species indicates that evolution in this environment is recurrent and predictable and can be used to gain insights into phenotype–genotype relationships.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25884.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Over the past 100 million years, many mammals, such as moles or mole rats, for example, have evolved to live almost entirely underground. During their transition to adapt to life underground, many species have reduced or completely lost their sense of sight, and often have only a small remnant of an eye that can sometimes be completely covered by skin and fur.</p><p>In addition, the sections of the DNA that usually control how the eyes form have changed in these animals. Since there is less need for a working eye in dark environments, DNA related to the eye is no longer protected from damaging mutations in mammals that live underground. So, by comparing the DNA of mammals that live aboveground and underground, scientists can identify the parts of DNA that help form mammals’ eyes.</p><p>Previous studies have discovered many sections of DNA responsible for producing the proteins that make up the eye. However, scientists know less about which sections of DNA control when and where these proteins are made. To address this, Partha et al. have studied the DNA of four underground mammals: the star-nosed mole, the cape golden mole, the naked mole-rat and the blind mole-rat.</p><p>By comparing the DNA of these animals with that of mammals that live above ground, Partha et al. identified sections of DNA that contained an abnormally high number of changes in the blind underground mammals. Many of these sections are involved in forming the eye, including controlling when and where proteins are made. Overall, the findings show that comparing rates of evolution in different species can help uncover sections of DNA that guide and influence how organisms develop.</p><p>Understanding how the eye is formed is not only of interest to scientists studying evolution and biology; it also has wider applications in healthcare. Many people suffer from unexplained eye abnormalities, and insight into the sections of DNA that control the eye’s development could help medical professionals diagnose these cases and design new treatments.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>convergent evolution</kwd><kwd>regressive evolution</kwd><kwd>subterranean life</kwd><kwd>genetics of vision</kwd><kwd>relaxation of constraint</kwd><kwd>functional constraint</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000053</institution-id><institution>National Eye Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Core Grant P30 EY008098</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chauhan</surname><given-names>Bharesh K</given-names></name><name><surname>Nischal</surname><given-names>Ken K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001818</institution-id><institution>Research to Prevent Blindness</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chauhan</surname><given-names>Bharesh K</given-names></name><name><surname>Nischal</surname><given-names>Ken K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001607</institution-id><institution>Eye and Ear Foundation of Pittsburgh</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chauhan</surname><given-names>Bharesh K</given-names></name><name><surname>Nischal</surname><given-names>Ken K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Jack Buncher Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chauhan</surname><given-names>Bharesh K</given-names></name><name><surname>Nischal</surname><given-names>Ken K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Core Grant P30 EY008098</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chauhan</surname><given-names>Bharesh K</given-names></name><name><surname>Nischal</surname><given-names>Ken K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Science Foundation and Department of Defense</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Research Experience for Undergraduates NSF-DBI 1263020</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Robinson</surname><given-names>Joseph D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U54HG008540</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chikina</surname><given-names>Maria</given-names></name><name><surname>Clark</surname><given-names>Nathan L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R03MH109009</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chikina</surname><given-names>Maria</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund9"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01HG009299</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chikina</surname><given-names>Maria</given-names></name><name><surname>Clark</surname><given-names>Nathan L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund10"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000945</institution-id><institution>Pittsburgh Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Charles E.

Obligate fossorial species in particular have adopted the underground as a dedicated home, yet the intense demands of life underground often require unique specializations. For one, the air present in tunnels is often low in oxygen (hypoxic) and high in carbon dioxide (hypercapnic) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Nevo, 1979</xref>). This dark environment also requires the development of enhanced senses to compensate for loss of vision. These and other subterranean specializations have been reported in many independent evolutionary lineages of insects, amphibians, reptiles, and mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Leys et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lacey et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Albert et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wilkinson, 2012</xref>). Within mammals alone, there are several unrelated subterranean species, including the true moles (family Talpidae), the African golden moles (Chrysochloridae), and the marsupial moles (Notoryctidae). There are also at least three unrelated lineages of subterranean rodents: the naked mole-rat (<italic>Heterocephalus glaber</italic>), blind mole-rats (Spalacidae), and the pocket gophers (Geomyidae).</p><p>Fossorial mammals have evolved a number of morphological and physiological traits that are considered adaptations to subterranean life, affecting how they sense their environment, how they move through it, or how they deal with its physiological demands. For one, species that dig with their forelimbs, like the star-nosed mole, have enlarged forelimbs and claws that allow them to tunnel through substrate, whereas species that dig with their teeth, such as the naked mole-rat, have reduced limbs and continuously growing incisors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dubost, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ellerman, 1956</xref>). In the absence of light, non-visual sensory systems have been elaborated. These include the sensitive vibrissae (i.e., sensory hairs) of the naked mole-rat and the large and elaborate snout of the star-nosed mole, which has become a remarkable ‘tactile eye’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Eloff, 1951</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hill et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Catania, 1999</xref>). Fossorial mammals have also evolved an ability to withstand hypoxic conditions that rivals that of species living at high altitude (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Nevo, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ar et al., 1977</xref>). For example, some species have high erythrocyte counts and high skeletal-muscle myoglobin to facilitate oxygen exchange. Some of these adaptive strategies are shared by different fossorial lineages and as such represent prime examples of convergent evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Nevo, 1979</xref>). Yet, some of the most striking convergent transformations in subterranean mammals are the reductions and losses of traits shared among aboveground mammals, of which the most prominent example is the reduction of the eye (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dubost, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hill et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cei, 1946a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">1946b</xref>).</p><p>Vision in many subterranean mammals is limited, and the degree of limitation in each species is related to the extent of its underground habitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Nemec et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Quilliam, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sanyal et al., 1990</xref>). For example, star-nosed moles (<italic>Condylura cristata</italic>) that share their time aboveground and underground possess diminutive eyes with thick eyelids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Catania, 1999</xref>), whereas the naked mole-rat , which spends almost all of its time underground, has tiny eyes that are rarely opened (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hetling et al., 2005</xref>). Even more extreme are the completely subcutaneous eyes of the cape golden mole (<italic>Chrysochloris asiatica</italic>) and the blind mole-rat (genus <italic>Nannospalax</italic>), which are thought to reflect their strictly subterranean lifestyle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sanyal et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Sweet, 1909</xref>). While some degree of visual regression is shared between subterranean mammals, not all visual structures and genetic pathways have regressed to the same degree. For instance, the eyes of true moles and mole-rats show anatomical regression and always exhibit a small eye but retain ocular architecture, suggesting that the basic eye developmental programs must be largely intact in these animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carmona et al., 2008</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Quilliam, 1966</xref>). The convergent loss of vision and visual structures in subterranean mammals allows us to ask which genetic regions – coding or non-coding – contributed to regression in these species and which were conserved.</p><p>The genetic causes of these malformations have been probed through studies of blind cavefish and evolutionary analysis of retinal genes in subterranean mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jeffery, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Emerling and Springer, 2014</xref>). Pioneering work by Hendriks et al. found the evolutionary rate of the lens and retina protein αA-crystallin to be markedly accelerated in the Middle Eastern blind mole-rat (<italic>Spalax ehrenbergi</italic>), as would be expected under relaxed constraint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hendriks et al., 1987</xref>). Furthermore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Emerling and Springer (2014</xref>) revealed that regressive genetic changes in retinal proteins are unevenly distributed across different visual pathways and eye tissues. Previous studies have placed more emphasis on retinal components of vision and connections to the visual cortex because it is these components that sense light and transmit images to the brain for vision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Emerling and Springer, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cooper et al., 1993</xref>). Less emphasis has been placed on the genes contributing to other eye tissues, such as the cornea.</p><p>The genomes of four subterranean mammals have been sequenced and studied for changes that have occurred in response to their unique environment. The naked mole-rat genome revealed genetic changes in key genes involved in thermogenesis and circadian rhythm, as well as gene loss and deactivating mutations in core visual perception genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kim et al., 2011</xref>). The genome of the blind mole-rat (<italic>Nannospalax gailili</italic>) also yielded diverse insights into its subterranean adaptations, such as an impactful change to the P53 protein that allows cells to escape hypoxia-induced apoptosis, as well as the upregulation of specific pathways involved in the response to hypoxia and hypercapnia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fang et al., 2014</xref>). Additionally, parallel evolution was seen in the deactivation of visual perception genes in the blind mole-rat and naked mole-rat. The convergence of such changes provides evidence that they have occurred in response to the subterranean environment rather than as a result of unrelated species-specific conditions or neutral processes, highlighting a potential strategy to discover additional genetic regions showing a similar response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Losos, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Stern, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Rosenblum et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Previous studies have used convergent evolution to reveal genetic changes that are related to environmental shifts without <italic>a priori</italic> expectations of which regions might respond. One strategy has been to search for convergent amino acid substitutions at specific protein sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Foote et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Liu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dobler et al., 2012</xref>). A complementary strategy is to search for convergent changes in selective pressure on larger functional regions, such as genes or regulatory sequences, because evolution at different nucleotides within a gene could nevertheless lead to convergent phenotypic effects. In practice, convergent changes in selective pressure are inferred by studying evolutionary rates, because selective constraint slows evolution, whereas lack of constraint and adaptation speed it. Computational methods employing this strategy search for functional elements whose evolutionary rates changed on those branches exhibiting the convergent environmental change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Marcovitz et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hiller et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chikina et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lartillot and Poujol, 2011</xref>). One demonstration of this approach by our group identified genes that convergently responded when mammalian lineages shifted from a terrestrial to a marine environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chikina et al., 2016</xref>). Another recent study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Prudent et al.(2016</xref>) demonstrated that regions showing convergent rate acceleration in the subterranean environment were enriched in visual perception genes and also contained circadian rhythm genes. Together, these studies show the promise of convergent rates to reveal genes underlying major changes in morphology and physiology that are related to drastic environmental shifts.</p><p>To investigate the demands placed upon subterranean species by their extreme environment, we searched for genes exhibiting convergent rate changes in four subterranean mammals. We report a large set of genes showing marked relaxation of constraint in subterranean species, which were highly enriched for visual functions. This set also contained many genes of undetermined function, which could be unrecognized causative genes in eye-related diseases. Finally, we pinpointed the eye-specific transcriptional enhancers in the <italic>Pax6</italic> gene region using a new variant of our method and demonstrated the potential to detect new eye-specific enhancers at key developmental genes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Many genes have altered evolutionary rates specifically in subterranean mammals</title><p>We first sought to identify the genes that responded to conditions in the subterranean environment. Accordingly, we used relative evolutionary rate (RER) methods to identify protein-coding genes that evolved at a more rapid rate specifically on subterranean branches of the mammalian phylogenetic tree. Subterranean branches consisted of those leading to the star-nosed mole (<italic>Condylura cristata</italic>), the cape golden mole (<italic>Chrysochloris asiatica</italic>), the naked mole-rat (<italic>Heterocephalus glaber</italic>) and the blind mole-rat (<italic>Nannospalax galili</italic>). Each of these species represents a lineage that independently colonized the subterranean habitat, as each is more closely related to aboveground mammals than they are to each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Hence, similar phenotypic changes within these species are regarded as convergent traits. To demonstrate our RER methods, we first present the case of the eye-specific gene <italic>LIM2</italic>, which encodes Lens intrinsic membrane protein 2. First, the amount of amino acid divergence in LIM2 on each mammalian branch was quantified using sequences from 39 species and standard evolutionary models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) (see Materials and methods). The resulting LIM2 tree is markedly different from the genome-wide average tree in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, and reveals distinctly high amounts of divergence in LIM2 for the four subterranean species. This rapid divergence probably resulted from loss of selective constraint in the dark subterranean environment. To quantify this rate acceleration in the LIM2 tree, we normalized all branch lengths for the expected amount of change as defined by the genome-wide average divergence for each branch. This average, after scaling (see Materials and methods), should reflect both the underlying speciation times in the mammalian phylogeny as well as changes in demographic factors affecting substitution rates. The resulting RER values for each branch are plotted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>. An RER of zero indicates that LIM2 evolved at exactly the expected rate on that branch, while positive and negative values reflect faster and slower rates, respectively. By examining RERs it becomes clear that LIM2 changed at abnormally rapid rates in the four subterranean mammals; the rates for all four subterranean species are more rapid than all aboveground species, and this difference is supported statistically (p=0.00084, Mann-Whitney U test). Thus, extending the RER calculations to all other genes, we can distinguish the functions that responded during adaptation to the subterranean environment. Importantly, the convergence of these species allows us to confidently infer genes that responded specifically to subterranean life, because faster rates in all four species are not likely to be due to random fluctuations, as reflected by the low <italic>P</italic>-value for LIM2.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25884.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Lens intrinsic membrane protein 2 (LIM2) evolutionary rates across species.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Mammalian transitions to a subterranean environment occurred in four lineages shown in red.

We will hereafter refer to such genes as ‘mole-accelerated’ and ‘mole-decelerated’, respectively (see Materials and methods). At a false discovery rate (FDR) of 15%, we identified 55 mole-accelerated genes. We expect mole-accelerated genes to result from either selection for amino acid changes (i.e., positive Darwinian selection) or, alternatively, from a reduction in purifying selection, as suggested for the LIM2 protein. At the other extreme, we identified 1306 mole-decelerated genes at the same FDR. We expect genes to show rate deceleration if there is stronger purifying selection on that gene’s function in the subterranean environment, perhaps as the result of increased importance for fitness.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Vision-related functions are highly enriched among mole-accelerated genes</title><p>Genes with the strongest evidence of mole-acceleration were consistently associated with function in two organs, eye and skin.

A similar control analysis showed 626 genes as being significantly decelerated at an FDR of 15%, and these control-decelerated genes were enriched in 24 GO categories. Therefore, despite there being vastly more mole-decelerated genes than mole-accelerated genes, mole-decelerated genes as a group do not show strong functional enrichment. This result stands in stark contrast to the strong enrichment seen in the mole-accelerated genes.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Most mole-accelerated genes are under relaxed constraint</title><p>Accelerated rates could have resulted from adaptive evolution or, alternatively, from relaxation of constraint.

Perhaps because of this selective pressure, many of the top mole-accelerated genes encode proteins that are structural components of skin, hair and epithelial connective tissues. The reasons for their acceleration are the result of relaxation of constraint on their coding sequence. Genes encoding keratin proteins 9, 12, and 81 (KRT9, KRT12, KRT81) were studied using codon models, and the results indicated that they experienced relaxed constraint in subterranean species but not positive selection for amino acid diversification (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>).

By extension, the loss of KRT9 in subterranean species may also have led to hyperproliferation of footpads, which could carry benefits for tunneling.

However, we also observed aboveground species with overall rate accelerations comparable to those of the moles, such as the armadillo, the thirteen-lined ground squirrel, the big brown bat, David’s myotis bat and a shrew. Notably, all of these mammals show varying types of visual regression: the armadillo has poor vision characterized by a lack of cone cells in the retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">McDonough and Loughry, 2013</xref>), and shrews also have poor vision and diminutive eyes, which in some species are hidden in fur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Nowak, 1999</xref>).

Here, we report a genome-wide effort encompassing both coding and regulatory regions to identify the changes in genotype that have accompanied this phenotypic adaptation by studying changes in their evolutionary rates. Our study reveals that genes showing convergent acceleration in subterranean species are highly enriched for function in visual pathways. The decreased selective pressure on visual pathways in the dim-light subterranean environment leads to a relaxation of constraint on genetic elements involved in various eye-related phenotypes, including eye morphology, photoreception and visual transduction. In addition to accelerated change in genes in visual pathways, we observe an accelerated rate of evolution of many genes involved in skin-related phenotypes in the subterranean mammals. Whereas we see accelerated change in visual genes primarily as a result of relaxation of constraint, we see that some skin-related genes also show accelerated change due to positive selection, perhaps as a result of selection of traits contributing to a fossorial lifestyle. Aside from these two phenotypes, we do not observe a comparably strong enrichment for genes involved in the other environmental challenges associated with a subterranean lifestyle, such as hypoxia, hypercapnia and high infectivity. It is possible that the subterranean mammals may show species-specific adaptations to these stresses, whereas our analysis from a convergent evolutionary perspective reflects changes common to all the species.</p><p>Closer examination of the accelerated genes that are enriched for vision-related pathways reveals that accelerated genes tend to be lens- or retina-specific. On the other hand, genes encoding specifically for the outer ocular structure, the cornea, do not show significant acceleration, indicating the preservation of developmental programs that are important for ocular architecture. In two of the four moles with non-subcutaneous eyes, the cornea can come into direct contact with the external environment, perhaps necessitating the proper development of the structure in the highly infective subterranean niche. Lens- and retina-specific genes that are involved with the processes of photoreception and phototransduction would be under greater relaxed constraint given the dim-light environment, accruing damaging mutations at a much higher rate. Our analyses also reveal that genes that are associated with congenital eye diseases are accelerated in the four subterranean mammals. For the lens, which is largely made up of crystallins, we find many crystallin genes (<italic>Crybb3</italic>, <italic>Cryba1</italic>, <italic>Crybb1</italic>, <italic>Cryg</italic>c, <italic>Crygs</italic>, etc.) in our accelerated set of genes contributing to various forms of cataracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Graw, 2009</xref>). Similarly, we find multiple genes involved in ciliopathies to be accelerated, including ‘deleted in primary ciliary dyskinesia’ (<italic>Dpcd</italic>), <italic>Iqcb1</italic> (a component of primary cilia), and ciliary neurotrophic factor (<italic>Cntf</italic>). Further inspection of the accelerated list of genes could potentially reveal new candidate genes that are important for congenital eye diseases.</p><p>Genes that are involved in the embryonic development of eyes do not show significant global acceleration, potentially due to their pleiotropic nature: these developmental transcription factors tend to have important regulatory roles in non-eye-related pathways that are not under relaxed constraint. We successfully tested our hypothesis that eye-specific regulatory elements of such genes are under relaxed constraint in the moles, using a novel variant of our approach that calculates convergent rate acceleration at the non-coding level. Although the strong rate acceleration in the three eye-specific enhancers of PAX6 suggests relaxation of constraint in the subterranean mammals, in the absence of functional tests we cannot be sure that the eye-specific activity is truly lost. Furthermore, we found an enrichment of such convergently accelerated non-coding regions preferentially near eye developmental transcription factor genes, identifying potential enhancer elements driving the expression of these genes specifically in the eye. As a large-scale validation approach, we show that rate acceleration in subterranean mammals strongly overlaps regions identified as eye enhancers by the FANTOM5 consortium. These proof-of-principle analyses serve to illustrate the power of convergent-evolution-based tools for the identification of eye-specific regulatory elements. Despite the apparent rapid rate of enhancer evolution across mammals, our methods and those of colleagues showcase the utility of applying evolution-based approaches to conserved non-coding regions in identifying regulatory elements underlying important developmental functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Marcovitz et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Villar et al., 2015</xref>). These methods present a unique opportunity to perform genome-wide scans for eye- and other tissue-specific regulatory elements, and potentially serve as complementary approaches to genome-wide assays in the identification of active enhancer elements in the genome. As more genomes are sequenced, we expect these methods to become more powerful in revealing gene regulatory changes underlying convergent phenotypes.</p><p>Overall, our results suggest that genes and non-coding regions that are involved in vision pathways are accumulating deleterious mutations by neutral processes, given the relaxation of constraint on these pathways in the subterranean environment. However, this does not preclude the possibility that the initial inactivating mutations in these pathways were adaptive in nature. The initial shutdown of eye development may have been caused by positively selected changes, followed by continued regression of structural and physiological eye genes through neutral processes. Indeed, there is evidence of such a progression of events during eye regression in blind cavefish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jeffery, 2005</xref>). Adaptive forces for reduced eyes may have been driven by the energetic costs of maintaining functioning eyes and the risk of pathogen entry through the eye (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Moran et al., 2015</xref>). We note that our rate-based analysis detects signatures of sequence divergence that are based on what is observed at the end of these processes and does not shed light on the nature of the initial inactivating changes. In addition, our methods detect convergent changes in the rates of evolution of genes and hence are not designed to detect species-specific changes that might contribute to the subterranean adaptation.</p><p>Our results showcasing acceleration in the rates of convergent evolution of visual genes strongly supports previous reports of visual regression in the subterranean habitat. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Emerling and Springer (2014</xref>) studied the regression of retinal genes in three of these four subterranean species and showed that a decrease in the amount of light entering the retina is associated with higher incidence of inactivating mutations in retinal genes. They found a significantly higher number of retinal pseudogenes in the moles compared to that in closely related subaerial species, an observation concordant with our results based on rate acceleration. Genome sequencing efforts for naked mole-rat and blind mole-rat also showed a strong enrichment of pseudogenes in visual pathways that are associated with the degradation of vision in these species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cooper et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kim et al., 2011</xref>). A genome-wide study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Prudent et al. (2016</xref>) detected significant genomic differences in genes involved in vision-related pathways such as eye development and perception of light in two of these four subterranean mammals, namely cape golden mole and blind mole-rat. Using our rates-based framework, we performed a rigorous investigation of convergently evolving genes in a large set of four subterranean species, and elucidated the tissue-specificity and underlying reasons for their convergent rate changes. In a first-of-its-kind demonstration at the non-coding level, we applied our methods successfully to detect eye-specific enhancers showing accelerated evolution in subterranean mammals.</p><p>Visual regression is not limited to these four mole species, and mammals display specific types of regression and other general differences in visual capabilities. Our analysis of visual gene rates across other species revealed interesting patterns and trends, wherein some aboveground species with poor or remodeled visual systems showed mean rate acceleration comparable to subterranean mammals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). This provides an opportunity to further probe specific differences in the development and function of visual systems in terms of the specific pathways that are relaxed or under constraint across species. In addition, integrating these other species into our rate-based framework can help in fine-tuning the predictive power of the evolutionary-based approaches. Deliberate selection of foreground branches based on specific combinations among these vision-impaired mammals might greatly improve the power of the methods in detecting convergent changes, especially at the non-coding level. In this regard, the availability of rich and diverse phenotypic annotations across mammals further lays the ground for the development of evolutionary-based approaches in functional and phenotypic annotation of non-coding regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Marcovitz et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">O’Leary et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">O'Leary et al., 2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Adding <italic>Nannospalax galili</italic> orthologs to alignment</title><p>Given the absence of <italic>Nannospalax galili</italic> (blind mole-rat or BMR) in the 100-species alignments made available by the UCSC genome browser, we employed a custom approach to add the correct BMR orthologous sequence based on its closest relative on the mammalian species phylogeny, mouse.

For each such element, we obtained an alignment of orthologous regions across our species of interest, pruning from the UCSC 100-way multiz alignment. The previous section further details the procedure employed for adding the BMR orthologous region.

LRTs between BS Alt Mod and its null BS Neutral were used to infer positive selection on subterranean mammal branches. Probabilities were assigned for each of these two LRTs using the chi-square distribution with 1 degree of freedom. Mammal-wide positive selection was inferred using the M8 vs M8A models and their respective LRT, using 1 degree of freedom chi square distribution to assess LRT significance. For calculating the correlation between mole-acceleration and degree of tissue-specificity of genes, we estimated the mole-acceleration of each gene as follows: using a branch-site selection model (BS Alt Mod) we estimated two different values of <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:mi>ω</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> (<italic>d</italic><sub>N</sub>/<italic>d</italic><sub>S</sub>) – one for the four subterranean branches and one for the rest of the branches on the tree. Mole-acceleration was calculated as the difference in the two <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf2"><mml:mi>ω</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> values that were estimated.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank John Wible of the Carnegie Museum for discussion of visual phenotypes.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Subterranean mammals show convergent regression in ocular genes and enhancers, and adaptation in tunneling-related genes&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Diethard Tautz as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Leslie M Turner (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors employ a sequenced-based evolutionary rate approach to identify genomic regions under accelerated or decelerated evolution in four species of subterranean mammals, thereby associating convergent genetic changes in these species with phenotypic traits (with a focus on loss of vision). Their results show an enrichment of vision-related gene annotations among genes showing convergent accelerated evolution in subterranean mammals, most of which show signatures of relaxed constraint, rather than adaptation. By comparing accelerated genes to either genes showing eye-specific gene expression or genes involved in eye development, the authors further suggest that regression of eye function associates with relaxed constraint on genes expressed in the eye lens and retina. Lastly, they demonstrate the applicability of this approach to non-coding regions by analysing rates of evolution among subterranean mammals for non-coding regions in the Pax6 locus. Based on these results the authors propose that the regions they identify include novel candidate sequences for congenital eye disorders.</p><p>The reviewers agreed that your analysis of the genetic evolution occurring in four separate lineages of subterranean mammals has potential to be of wide interest, and so the reviewers and handling editor are requesting resubmission. However, the two serious concerns outlined below must be exhaustively addressed, or a revised manuscript will be rejected.</p><p>Essential revisions for resubmission:</p><p>1) Presentation and novelty (see below for specifics).</p><p>All reviewers and editors agreed that your current manuscript needs serious editorial revision to address pervasive logic and presentational problems that results in masking of the story's novelty. Many problematic examples are listed below, compiled from all three reviewer's comments. A specific subpoint that was extensively discussed was whether your manuscript was sufficiently novel for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>, given the recent publication of a highly similar analysis by Prudent et al. of two of the same species in MBE. The additional power of using two more species must be far better argued, or a revision will not be adequate for <italic>eLife</italic> publication.</p><p>2) Genome-wide analysis of enhancers (see below for specifics).</p><p>The final computational analysis that dissected Pax6 enhancers must be extended to a genome-wide analysis of all enhancers to identify the complete set of regions where fossorial pressures have resulted in genetic changes. This analysis should likely be an entirely new figure that compellingly displays the genome-wide data in a way that is broadly understandable and persuasive in highlighting the novelty over Prudent et al. MBE.</p><p>The title is accurate but a bit awkward: authors please suggest your own revision.</p><p>Further detail on points above:</p><p>1) Presentation and novelty (specific details).</p><p>Note that the concerns listed below arose from all four reviews, so some are not in exact occurrence order. In addition, the Reviewing Editor had great difficulty understanding what gene sets were used, when, why, and how – throughout the manuscript. The entire revision must be heavily revised to didactically lay out each analysis more slowly and clearly to non-expert readers.</p><p>In <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>, Tables S1 to S6, the authors continually shift between the top 1000, 500 and 200 accelerated or decelerated genes. For clarity, it would be better to decide on a threshold of statistical significance and state in the main text how many accelerated and decelerated genes are detected using this threshold. The authors could also homogenise the set of genes used in supplementary tables in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>, unless there are specific advantages to using different sets.</p><p>Related to the above, how does the RER method compare to the one used by Prudent et al.?</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> could additionally use as control a set of convergent genes in a different subset of species, such as the one reported by the authors for marine adaptations (Chikina et al., 2016).</p><p>The supplemental excel tables in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> could be better annotated, for example by adding legends at the top. Table S1 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> seems to be duplicated in the excel file.</p><p>Why does Table S7 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> only have 71 genes, given that the authors mention in the main text their using 98 eye developmental genes? It would be helpful to mark significantly accelerated genes in this table.</p><p>Wording in the subsection “Regressive evolution is limited to the lens, retina, and eye-specific developmental genes” is somewhat misleading and should be revised. (&quot;we asked which eye tissues showed acceleration&quot;, whereas I think the authors are actually testing whether genes with eye-specific expression are enriched among accelerated genes).</p><p>While the acceleration that the authors observe in Pax6 eye enhancers is consistent with relaxed constraint or &quot;regression&quot;, in the absence of functional tests of these enhancers it is possible that the function of these enhancers is intact. In contrast, many of the vision genes that exhibit convergent sequence alteration have elevated dN/dS ratios or have stop codons and frame shift mutations that provide clear evidence of relaxed constraint.

The manuscript would tremendously benefit from substantiating this hypothesis with experimental data, for example by evaluating a few of the accelerated loci (genes or regulatory regions) in animal models of eye development, such as mouse or zebrafish. Can the authors show a requirement for some of their novel candidate elements in eye development or eye-specific expression?

Many problematic examples are listed below, compiled from all three reviewer's comments. A specific subpoint that was extensively discussed was whether your manuscript was sufficiently novel for publication in eLife, given the recent publication of a highly similar analysis by Prudent et al. of two of the same species in MBE. The additional power of using two more species must be far better argued, or a revision will not be adequate for eLife publication.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for identifying areas where the manuscript could be improved upon and have addressed each point to the best of our ability. Regarding the question of novelty over Prudent et al., there are a number of reasons our manuscript presents a major advance over their paper:</p><p>1) Our method makes use of 4 species compared to the two used by Prudent et al. and hence can more precisely and confidently identify genetic elements convergently responding to the subterranean environment.</p><p>2) We perform a more detailed investigation including studying the reasons for the rate acceleration in these genes as well as where they were expressed across specific tissues of the eye. On the other hand, Prudent et al.’s presentation of mole evolution was a short description. Their presentation seems to have fulfilled its purpose of demonstrating their new methods but was not intended to reveal biological insights.</p><p>3) To highlight the contrast in the performance of our methods, we conducted a head-to-head comparison of the Prudent method to ours on a common dataset of 3 mole species. We found that ours performs better on both protein-coding and enhancer sequences. For full details see our second response to point 1 below. In the revised manuscript however, we chose to remain focused on the biological conclusions and did not include this comparison of methodologies. If the reviewers feel the comparison to Prudent et al. is crucial for publication, we are happy to add those results to the manuscript.</p><p>4) In a first-of-its-kind demonstration we show the applicability of our methods on non-coding regions, which we view as a more urgent challenge, and correctly identify experimentally validated eye-specific enhancers of Pax6. Prudent et al. did not report mole-acceleration for non-coding sequences.</p><p>5) Additionally, we now include two large-scale non-coding analyses covering 16,000 potential enhancer sites across the genome to illustrate the power of our method in identifying candidate vision-specific genetic elements. We also provide the chromosomal coordinates of the top-scoring regions in a Supplemental Table for the research community.</p><p>We believe that the combination of the aforementioned points clearly illustrates the advancement of our findings in comparison to those reported in the Prudent et al. publication in MBE.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Genome-wide analysis of enhancers (see below for specifics).</p><p>The final computational analysis that dissected Pax6 enhancers must be extended to a genome-wide analysis of all enhancers to identify the complete set of regions where fossorial pressures have resulted in genetic changes. This analysis should likely be an entirely new figure that compellingly displays the genome-wide data in a way that is broadly understandable and persuasive in highlighting the novelty over Prudent et al. MBE.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now performed two large-scale scans for convergently mole-accelerated non-coding elements, totaling to 16,000 in number. These two scans give rise to the following findings – 1) Mole-accelerated genetic elements are strongly enriched near transcription factors with known function in eye development compared to tissue-specific transcription factors outside the eye; 2) Eye enhancers identified by the FANTOM5 consortium show significant mole-acceleration compared to other Fantom5 enhancers with zero expression in the eyeball of developing mouse embryos. These new analyses strongly reflect the power of our method in identifying putative vision-specific non-coding elements, illustrating the first successful attempt at large-scale prediction of vision-specific genetic elements using a convergent-evolution-based approach. For the gene regulation research community, we provide the coordinates of these newly described mole-accelerated non-coding reqions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>, Table S10). In addition to this, we perform a direct comparative analysis that showed better performance of our RER method over the Prudent et al. method as part of our response to point 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The title is accurate but a bit awkward: authors please suggest your own revision.</p></disp-quote><p>We have clarified the title.</p><p>“Subterranean mammals show convergent regression in ocular genes and enhancers, along with adaptations to tunneling”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Further detail on points above:</p><p>1) Presentation and novelty (specific details).</p><p>Note that the concerns listed below arose from all four reviews, so some are not in exact occurrence order. In addition, the Reviewing Editor had great difficulty understanding what gene sets were used, when, why, and how – throughout the manuscript. The entire revision must be heavily revised to didactically lay out each analysis more slowly and clearly to non-expert readers.</p><p>In <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>, Tables S1 to S6, the authors continually shift between the top 1000, 500 and 200 accelerated or decelerated genes. For clarity, it would be better to decide on a threshold of statistical significance and state in the main text how many accelerated and decelerated genes are detected using this threshold. The authors could also homogenise the set of genes used in supplementary tables in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>, unless there are specific advantages to using different sets.</p></disp-quote><p>We address this in the revised submission by performing multiple hypothesis testing corrections. We utilize a permutation-based False Discovery Rate estimation, controlling the FDR at 15%. This results in a total of 55 genes as being identified as accelerated, and 1306 genes as decelerated. The supplementary tables in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> have been modified to consistently utilize these numbers of accelerated and decelerated genes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Related to the above, how does the RER method compare to the one used by Prudent et al.?</p></disp-quote><p>The two methods developed by Prudent et al. address the problem of identifying phenotypic-genomic associations in a different manner compared to our RER method. For one, our RER method relies on estimating sequence divergence by computing branch lengths on a Maximum Likelihood phylogenetic tree (number of substitutions per site). These calculations are based on standard models of amino acid or nucleotide evolution, whereas the methods in Prudent et al. rely on percent sequence identity and sequence mismatch to estimate the sequence divergence, which do not account for several confounding factors. For instance, sequence mismatch has a non-linear relationship with the actual divergence due to hidden mutation events such as back substitutions, multiple substitutions etc. This results in a consistent underestimation of actual divergence that further worsens as the divergence increases. Furthermore, sequence mismatch based measures fail to account for non-uniform substitution rates between nucleotide types and between sites [Li et al.]. Model-based measures of genetic divergence developed over the past years have been done so to control for many of these potentially confounding factors, and hence have been the standard methods employed in the field of phylogenetic inference [Kimura et al., Felsenstein et al., Cantor et al., Holmquist et al.].</p><p>Additionally, our normalization method handles missing orthologs for genes automatically by pruning away the corresponding branch(es) in all trees present, and subsequently generating relative rates, whereas it is unclear if the Prudent et al. methods handle such cases.</p><p>We performed a direct comparative analysis between our RER method and the GLS p-value method developed in Prudent et al. paper by studying the ability of the methods again to rank eye-specific regulatory regions around PAX6 on the same dataset.

We pruned each alignment to include 39 species of interest represented in the proteome-wide average tree (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) after adding the BMR ortholog of the corresponding gene sequence to this alignment as described in the previous section”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> – how was this analysis done?

We employ an empirical permutation-based FDR calculation, often the standard approach in genome-wide analysis. We generated 10,000 null datasets, where each dataset was obtained by randomly permuting the species labels of the relative rates. This process is equivalent to calculating the Mann-Whitney U test and correlation analysis over four random branches vs the rest instead of over the binary variable of “subterranean” vs. “aboveground” branches. The subsequent permuted datasets were used to estimate the FDR q-values for each p-value in our subterranean correlation analysis. Genes showing a correlation greater than equal to 0.5 in the Mann-Whitney U test and significant at a FDR of 15% are considered mole-accelerated genes, and the p-value reflecting the strength of this acceleration is referred to as mole-acceleration.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Arbitrary/inconsistent gene list #s.

If the point the authors want to make is that their approach is applicable to non-coding regions, this approach should be applied to all conserved non-coding elements rather than a single locus. An increased scope of this analysis would add novelty to the author's findings. Can one still detect an enrichment of eye-related gene annotations proximal to enhancers with accelerated evolution in subterranean mammals? How does it compare with that of coding regions?</p></disp-quote><p>We have now added two new sections to the paper expanding from the example analysis using Pax6 enhancers. We have analyzed a total of roughly 16,000 non-coding elements, 8,000 elements scanned for the study contrasting two sets of transcription factors and 8,000 elements corresponding to FANTOM5 putative enhancer elements. We believe these new results further strengthen our argument that convergent rate acceleration can identify candidate vision-specific genetic elements in the mammalian genome.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors highlight their search for convergent patterns of sequence divergence as a means to identify genetic elements that may underlie changes in phenotype. If the authors analyzed each subterranean mammal on its own (looking at sequence divergence but not convergence between subterranean species), do they see strong enrichment of vision-related GO terms in each species? Do they also see other non-vision GO terms (e.g., hypoxia)? How different are the GO enrichments for accelerated proteins in individual subterranean species vs. the list of proteins that show convergent accelerations among subterranean species?</p></disp-quote><p>We have considered the question of looking at relative rates in subterranean mammals individually as against convergent rate changes. Generally, we do not see any GO term significantly enriched from these individual analyses, none related to vision at any rate. Due to the very weak nature of the associations that come out of these analyses, we do not include these results in the main manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Other (non-required) points</p><p>As a strategy to inform the molecular basis of phenotypic traits, the author's approach is an alternative to direct experimental mapping across mammals (e.g. of gene expression; Ma et al., 2016). The authors hypothesize that genomic regions under accelerated evolution in subterranean mammals may inform candidate loci for congenital eye disorders, but no direct evidence is provided. The manuscript would tremendously benefit from substantiating this hypothesis with experimental data, for example by evaluating a few of the accelerated loci (genes or regulatory regions) in animal models of eye development, such as mouse or zebrafish. Can the authors show a requirement for some of their novel candidate elements in eye development or eye-specific expression? (Please see (Kvon et al., 2016) for a similar approach).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for suggesting a complementary strategy to our approach. We are currently in the process of conducting experiments that can provide direct evidence in validating our candidate vision-specific genetic elements. However, because we are developing an expression construct system for those experiments, they are more than a year from being completed. We hope that these experiments will be the subject of future publications.</p></body></sub-article></article>
