TOP2ccs are normally rapidly reversible, but can be stabilized by TOP2 poisons, such as the chemotherapeutic agent etoposide (ETO). TOP2 poisons have shown significant variability in their therapeutic effectiveness across different cancers for reasons that remain to be determined. One potential explanation for the differential cellular response to these drugs is in the manner by which cells process TOP2ccs. Cells are thought to remove TOP2ccs primarily by proteolytic degradation followed by DNA DSB repair. Here, we show that proteasome-mediated repair of TOP2cc is highly error-prone. Pre-treating primary splenic mouse B-cells with proteasome inhibitors prevented the proteolytic processing of trapped TOP2ccs, suppressed the DNA damage response (DDR) and completely protected cells from ETO-induced genome instability, thereby preserving cellular viability. When degradation of TOP2cc was suppressed, the TOP2 enzyme uncoupled itself from the DNA following ETO washout, in an error-free manner. This suggests a potential mechanism of developing resistance to topoisomerase poisons by ensuring rapid TOP2cc reversal.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Molecules of DNA contain the archive of a cell’s genetic information and identity. DNA comprises two strands that twist together into a structure known as a double helix. Physical tension tends to build up in the double helix that can cause it to break apart. To avoid this, cells have an enzyme called Topoisomerase II (TOP2) that relieves the tension by attaching itself to DNA and breaking it in a controlled way before re-sealing the break.</p><p>Drugs known as TOP2 poisons stop TOP2 from working and trap it on the DNA, which may lead to cells accumulating DNA breaks and eventually dying. Cancer cells are particularly prone to acquiring breaks in their DNA, and TOP2 poisons are therefore often used as part of chemotherapy treatments for cancer. However, it remains unclear why TOP2 poisons are more effective at killing some types of cancer cells than others.</p><p>It is thought that a molecular machine, known as the proteasome, helps cells repair the damage caused by TOP2 poisons by removing the trapped TOP2 proteins and allowing DNA repair proteins access to the broken DNA underneath. Now, Sciascia et al. have used a genetic approach to study the relationship between the proteasome and DNA repair in mouse cells exposed to TOP2 poisons.</p><p>The experiments found that when the proteasome removed TOP2 proteins that had become trapped on DNA, the subsequent DNA repair was prone to errors. Pre-treating mouse cells with another drug that inhibited the proteasome protected the cells from the effects of the TOP2 poison. Once the TOP2 poison had left the cells, the previously trapped TOP2 proteins correctly fixed the DNA and detached as they would normally. As a result, cells that had been treated with a proteasome inhibitor were more likely to survive treatment with TOP2 poisons.</p><p>Since both TOP2 poisons and proteasome inhibitors are clinically approved drugs for treating cancer they can be, and already have been, tested for use together in combination drug therapies. However, these findings suggest that caution should be taken when using these drugs together, because instead of harming the cancer cells, the proteasome inhibitors may protect the cells from the toxic effects of TOP2 poisons.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>topoisomerases</kwd><kwd>cancer</kwd><kwd>DNA repair</kwd><kwd>genome instability</kwd><kwd>DNA damage</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Intramural Research Program</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nussenzweig</surname><given-names>André</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000863</institution-id><institution>Ellison Medical Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Senior Scholar in Aging Award AG-SS- 2633-11</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nussenzweig</surname><given-names>André</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000005</institution-id><institution>U.S. Department of Defense</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Idea Expansion Award W81XWH-15-2-006</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nussenzweig</surname><given-names>André</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000005</institution-id><institution>U.S. Department of Defense</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Idea Breakthrough Award W81XWH-16-1-599</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nussenzweig</surname><given-names>André</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001445</institution-id><institution>Alex’s Lemonade Stand Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nussenzweig</surname><given-names>André</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Intramural FLEX Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nussenzweig</surname><given-names>André</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Analysis of genome integrity in primary murine B-cells reveals how depleting 26S proteasome activity enhanced cell survival following treatment with topoisomerase poisons.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Topoisomerase II (TOP2) is an evolutionarily conserved enzyme capable of generating reversible double strand breaks (DSBs) in DNA, which enables the resolution of problematic DNA topological structures that arise during normal cellular processes, such as transcription, replication, and mitosis. This process is mediated by the topoisomerase II cleavage complex (TOP2cc), a transient DNA-protein complex that is formed when each monomer of the dimeric TOP2 anchors itself to the DNA backbone via a covalent 5’-phosphotyrosyl bond. A second DNA strand can then be passed through the enzyme-bridged DSB, after which the break is re-ligated. Under physiological conditions, topoisomerases reliably execute this reaction without error, as TOP2ccs are highly reversible and short lived (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pommier et al., 2016</xref>). However, when they become trapped, the abortive TOP2ccs fail to re-ligate the transient DSB intermediate, presenting a severe threat to genome integrity which must be resolved quickly via the DNA repair machinery. The resolution of TOP2ccs is, therefore, crucial for cell survival.</p><p>TOP2 poisons, such as the anti-cancer agent etoposide (ETO), efficiently trap and stabilize TOP2ccs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Muslimović et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nitiss, 2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pommier et al., 2016</xref>). The accumulation of these TOP2 DNA-protein complexes can create significant problems for cells by stalling replication forks and the transcription apparatus, generating torsional and genotoxic stress, which leads to the accumulation of single and double strand DNA breaks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cowell and Austin, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Muslimović et al., 2009</xref>). How these abortive TOP2ccs are recognized and targeted by the DNA damage response (DDR) remains unclear.</p><p>It has been suggested that a robust DNA damage response (DDR) is elicited only after ETO-trapped TOP2ccs have been converted to ‘clean’ protein-free DSB ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mårtensson et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sunter et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zhang et al., 2006</xref>). This suggests that a DSB shielded by a covalently bound protein can evade detection. Several mechanisms exist for removal of trapped TOP2ccs. However, the factors that determine how a cell chooses to deploy them are complex and remain poorly understood. The covalently-linked TOP2 protein is partially or completely degraded by the 26S proteasome, after which the residual DNA-peptide adduct is hydrolyzed by tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase 2 (TDP2) to release the remnants of the entrapped protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ledesma et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gómez-Herreros et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lee et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sunter et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zagnoli-Vieiral and Caldecott, 2017</xref>). Current evidence suggests that transcription increases the rate at which TOP2 is processed by the proteasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Canela et al., 2019</xref>). It has also been reported that TDP2, with the co-operation of secondary cofactors, can resolve unprocessed TOP2ccs in a proteasome-independent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Schellenberg et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>An alternate, more error-prone mechanism for TOP2cc removal is mediated by MRE11 endonucleolytic cleavage in the vicinity of a trapped TOP2cc, which releases the entire TOP2 DNA-protein complex that results in the loss of small stretches of DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hoa et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lee et al., 2012</xref>). Either of these mechanisms are able to produce protein-free DNA breaks that can then be recognized and repaired by the major cellular DSB repair pathways: non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) and homologous recombination (HR).</p><p>It has long been recognized that trapped TOP2ccs are intrinsically reversible upon ETO washout (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hsiang and Liu, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Long et al., 1985</xref>). Consistently, we observed that inhibiting the proteasome prior to ETO treatment enhanced the number of rapidly reversible ETO-stabilized TOP2ccs across the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Canela et al., 2019</xref>). Other studies have shown that inhibiting the proteasome not only preserves the reversibility of TOP2ccs but also is able to suppress DDR signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mao et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zhang et al., 2006</xref>). However, the implications of suppressing the DDR in response to ETO using proteasome inhibitors, on both the long-term genome integrity and the overall viability of the cell, have not been fully explored. Considering that both proteasome inhibitors and topoisomerase poisons are used, sometimes in tandem, as frontline chemotherapeutic agents to treat a variety of cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cowell and Austin, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dittus et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Manasanch and Orlowski, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Thomas et al., 2017</xref>), understanding how TOP2cc reversibility may impact the effectiveness of these drugs is clinically relevant.</p><p>Here, we utilize high-resolution genome-wide mapping of DSBs by END-seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Canela et al., 2016</xref>) to examine the impact of proteasome inhibition on the fate of TOP2ccs. We found that once ETO-stabilized TOP2ccs had been proteolytically processed throughout the genome, and a robust DDR had been initiated, the large number of newly generated protein-free DSBs were repaired in a highly error-prone manner, resulting in toxic chromosomal translocations and rearrangements that led to cell death. Notably, the major DSB repair pathways (NHEJ and HR) contribute to the mis-repair of ETO-induced DSBs following proteasomal processing. By inhibiting proteasome-mediated degradation of TOP2ccs either through chemical inhibition or by ablation of RNF4-mediated ubiquitination of TOP2ccs, an intact and enzymatically competent TOP2 was able to re-seal the protein-linked DSBs without invoking a significant DDR. As a result, cells were protected from genomic instability, which ultimately led to enhanced cell survival after treatment with topoisomerase poisons.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Proteasomal activity is necessary for triggering a DNA damage response following ETO treatment</title><p>Building on previous observations that proteasome inhibition can specifically attenuate the induction of γ-H2AX by ETO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mao et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zhang et al., 2006</xref>), we sought to first confirm these findings in mouse primary splenic B-cells. Since ETO stabilizes both TOP2A and TOP2B isoforms, resting B-cells were activated with cytokines for 12 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). This short-term treatment ensures that B-cells remain in G1 where only the TOP2B isoform is expressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Canela et al., 2017</xref>). This treatment regime, therefore, allows us to minimize any differential effect of ETO on each isoform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Errington et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Willmore et al., 1998</xref>) and to bypass essential TOP2-dependent processes, such as DNA replication.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Proteasome machinery is essential for triggering DNA damage response to ETO treatment.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) As indicated in the schematic, primary splenic B-cells were isolated from mouse spleens and activated with a cocktail of Il-4, LPS, and RP105. 12 hr post-activation, while the B-cells were still in the G1 phase of the cell cycle, they were pre-treated with proteasome inhibitor (10 µM MG132 or 5 µM Bortezomib) for 1 hr prior to an additional 2 hr co-treatment with 50 µM ETO. Following the ETO pulse, the cells were washed with ice cold drug-free media (3 × 5 min spin at 1500 rpm and 4°C to pellet B-cells between washes; 15–20 min total time to complete washout), then returned to fresh drug free media and allowed to recover at 37°C for up to 48 hr. In the case of post-treatment, proteasome inhibitor was added to the wash media and then the cells were incubated for an additional 2 hr at 37°C with proteasome inhibitor only. For western blot and ICE assay analysis, cells were harvested immediately following drug treatment or washout (0 hr washout).

To confirm that proteasome inhibitors were having the same effect in our experimental system, we quantified TOP2ccs using the ICE assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anand et al., 2018</xref>) in ETO-treated primary B-cells pre-incubated with or without BTZ. In the presence of ETO, TOP2ccs were readily detected on DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Immediately after ETO was washed out, however, the amount of DNA-bound TOP2 diminished strongly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). The proteasome continuously degraded ETO-trapped TOP2ccs, as evidenced by the markedly enhanced accumulation of TOP2ccs when cells were pre-incubated with BTZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). The majority of these TOP2ccs also dissociated from DNA immediately following ETO washout (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Thus, inhibiting proteasomal degradation appears to preserve the integrity of TOP2ccs enabling reversal of complexes by completion of the enzymes' catalytic cycle upon drug removal.</p><p>Alternatively, proteasome activity could recover immediately after the removal of ETO and the proteasome inhibitor and would similarly lead to a loss of TOP2cc signal in the ICE assay. To determine the duration and reversibility of proteasomal inhibition, we directly monitored proteasome activity in eHAP cells transfected with a YFP-Degron reporter that has been demonstrated to be a <italic>bona fide</italic> proteasomal substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bence et al., 2001</xref>). As expected, a 2 hr treatment with MG132 or BTZ significantly increased the YFP signal from baseline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Following washout of MG132 or BTZ, the elevated YFP signal persisted for several hours before it began to decrease and BTZ appeared to be a more potent and persistent inhibitor of the proteasome than MG132 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kisselev and Goldberg, 2001</xref>). As an additional measure of proteasome activity, we quantified the protein levels of p53, as it is known to be stabilized upon proteasome inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">An et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Halasi et al., 2014</xref>). Consistent with the YFP-degron results in eHAP cells, we observed that p53 protein remained stabilized in primary B-cells for several hours after proteasome inhibitors were washed out, with BTZ again being more potent than MG132 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>).</p><p>Thus, proteasome activity is not readily recovered even after the removal of proteasome inhibitor, suggesting that the rapid loss of ETO-induced TOP2ccs in MG132 pre-treated cells upon washout most likely reflects the reversal of TOP2ccs by completion of the enzymes' catalytic cycle upon drug removal. Accordingly, we did not observe a delayed γ-H2AX induction at either 2 hr or 6 hr post-ETO and BTZ washout, suggesting that proteasomal activity remain suppressed for at least several hours post-washout (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>).

First, we assessed whether proteasome inhibition blocked TOP2 from making incisions in DNA.

As expected, END-seq analysis revealed that TOP2-mediated DSBs were readily detectable in ETO-treated B-cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–C</xref>). The number and intensity of TOP2-mediated DSBs were reproducible across experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>). Consistent with the results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, we found that BTZ pre-treatment did not dramatically affect the overall number or location of TOP2-mediated DSBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C–D</xref>); TOP2-mediated DSBs were still strongly induced in the BTZ pre-treated sample, despite eliciting only a weak γ-H2AX response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Thus, while proteasome inhibition does not affect the ability of TOP2 to cleave DNA, it helps maintain the resultant DSBs in a protein-linked form (persistent TOP2cc) that conceals them from the DDR. Nevertheless, we did observe a small decrease in the overall intensity of the TOP2-mediated DSB signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and C</xref>) upon BTZ pre-treatment.

To directly evaluate the impact of proteasome inhibition on repair of TOP2-mediated DSBs, we used END-seq to assess their longevity by harvesting primary B-cells both immediately following ETO/BTZ washout (0 hr washout) and after a 2 hr recovery in drug-free media at 37°C (2 hr washout). Notably, BTZ exerted a substantial impact on the rate at which TOP2-mediated DSBs resolved over the course of the 2 hr washout, with very few detectable breaks remaining after recovery relative to cells treated with ETO alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>). We plotted the fraction of TOP2-mediated DSBs at each washout timepoint relative to the initial level of breakage following ETO treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Using this analysis, we found that immediately following drug washout, 30% of the initial TOP2-mediated DSBs were still detectable in cells treated with ETO only, while just 15% were still present in the corresponding BTZ pre-treated sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and D</xref>). After a 2 hr recovery, B-cells treated with ETO alone still had a detectable break signal (17%), whereas in BTZ-pretreated cells, it returned almost to baseline (4%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and D</xref>). This suggested that inhibiting the proteasome enhanced the amount of TOP2ccs which rapidly reverse following ETO washout.</p><p>As a second form of analysis, we normalized the TOP2-mediated DSB intensity at each post-washout timepoint. We introduced a new parameter, termed TOP2-mediated DSB persistence, which was calculated as the ratio of the peak intensity (RPKM) for individual TOP2-mediated DSBs at each timepoint (either 0 hr washout or 2 hr washout) relative to its initial intensity in the corresponding pre-washout sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1F</xref>). Through this analysis, we found that approximately 20% of the initial TOP2-mediated DSBs were classified as persistent immediately following ETO washout (0 hr washout), and 13% of initial TOP2-mediated DSBs were still persistent 2 hr post-washout (2 hr washout) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). By contrast, BTZ pre-treatment more significantly reduced the fraction of persistent TOP2-mediated DSBs both immediately following washout (~13%), as well as at 2 hr post-washout (~3.5%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). These results, in conjunction with the ICE assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), suggested that inhibiting the proteasome enhances TOP2cc reversal following ETO washout.</p><p>To directly measure the reversibility of TOP2ccs, we took advantage of the fact that ExoT lacks the ability to process protein-linked DSBs (persistent TOP2ccs that still have an intact 5’-phospotyrosyl bond) and therefore allows for the detection of only protein-free (i.e. proteolytically processed) DSBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Canela et al., 2019</xref>).

Our analyses revealed that 76% of TOP2-mediated DSBs reversed immediately following washout (0 hr washout), with the majority of remaining lesions being converted into protein-free DSBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). The fraction of reversible TOP2ccs was even higher in the BTZ pre-treated cells, as 90% of the initial TOP2-mediated DSBs were reversible immediately following washout (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>).

After 2 hr post ETO treatment, the extent and intensity of resection had increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), indicating ongoing end-processing at persistent TOP2-mediated DSBs. In ETO-treated cells pre-incubated with BTZ, while there were still low levels of protein-free DSBs present immediately following drug washout (0 hr washout), we could barely detect end-resection at individual breaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Genome-wide, we were able to identify 1289 resected breaks in ETO-treated cells immediately following washout, while only 496 resected breaks were detected in BTZ pre-treated cells, a 2.5-fold decrease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).

We consistently detected the presence of elongated chromosomes in mitotic spreads prepared from ETO-treated B-cells, suggesting that these might result from complex fusions involving multiple chromosomal fragments. To further characterize these seemingly intact long chromosomes, we performed spectral karyotyping (SKY) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Liyanage et al., 1996</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C and D</xref>, SKY analysis revealed that ETO-induced chromosomal fusions were extensive and complex. Indeed, these events resembled chromothripsis, in which fragments originating from three or more chromosomes are fused together (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>). Strikingly, pre-treating B-cells with MG132 before ETO completely protected them from all types of chromosomal fusions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C and D</xref>).

To determine whether classical NHEJ or HR is primarily responsible for the misrepair of DSBs, we tested primary B-cells deficient in the key end joining factor DNA ligase IV (Lig4<sup>-/-</sup>) or the key HR factors BRCA1 (BRCA1<sup>Δ11</sup>) and BRCA2 (BRCA2<sup>-/-</sup>). To this end, primary resting (G0) Lig4<sup>-/-</sup>, BRCA1<sup>Δ11</sup> and BRCA2<sup>-/-</sup> B-cells were first activated with cytokines for 12 hr and 24 hr to drive G1- or S-phase entry, respectively, at which point they were exposed to ETO. After ETO was washed out, B-cells were given an additional 24 hr to recover before mitotic spread analysis. We found that loss of Lig4, BRCA1 or BRCA2 failed to mitigate aberrant chromosomal rearrangements in ETO-treated G1 and cycling B-cells, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B and C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Recent work has described a SUMO-ubiquitin (Ub) pathway that recognizes DNA-bound topoisomerase-DNA complexes, wherein the SUMO-targeted E3 ubiquitin ligase (STUbL) RNF4 ubiquitinates TOP2 leading to its degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sun et al., 2019</xref>). We therefore assessed whether interfering with the cell’s ability to sense and recruit the proteasome to trapped TOP2ccs would confer a chemo-protective effect similar to cells treated with BTZ and ETO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–F</xref>). To this end, we treated WT and RNF4<sup>-/-</sup> MEFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hu et al., 2010</xref>) with 10 µM ETO for 1 hr with or without BTZ pre-incubation (1 µM, 1 hr), and probed for γ-H2AX. ETO produced a weakened γ-H2AX response in RNF4<sup>-/-</sup> MEFs compared to WT MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>), suggesting that RNF4 facilitates proteasomal degradation of TOP2ccs, which in turn generates γ-H2AX. Notably, while BTZ pre-treatment suppressed the ETO-induced γ-H2AX response in WT MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>), it did not further reduce the γ-H2AX response in RNF4<sup>-/-</sup> MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>), suggesting that RNF4 is epistatic with the proteasome with regard to TOP2cc degradation. To explore this further, we used END-seq to quantify the number and intensity of TOP2-mediated DSBs in ETO treated RNF4<sup>-/-</sup> and WT primary B-cells. Our results showed that there was a 6-fold reduction of protein-free DSBs detected by END-seq in RNF4<sup>-/-</sup> B-cells compared to WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, top right), while the initial levels of total TOP2-mediated DNA cleavage were similar between the genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, top left).

In the absence of proteolytic degradation, TOP2 remains enzymatically competent and is able to reseal the protein-linked DSB without invoking a DNA damage response (DDR). However, once degradation commences, a TOP2cc is no longer reversible, and the previously hidden DSB become unmasked, triggering a potent DDR signaling response. Following degradation of a TOP2cc, the resultant protein free DSBs appear to engage multiple repair pathways, including error-free NHEJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gómez-Herreros et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gómez-Herreros et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). However, due to the large number of lesions induced by ETO, many DSBs remain unrepaired or mis-repaired which can destabilize the genome. In contrast, by preventing proteasome-mediated unmasking of TOP2-mediated DSBs, error-prone repair is not engaged, thereby facilitating the reversal of TOP2ccs through completion of the enzymes' catalytic cycle upon drug removal, and preserving genome integrity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>).</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Model of proteasome mediated repair of TOP2ccs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) ETO-stabilized TOP2ccs are targeted for proteasomal degradation by the 26S proteasome via both SUMOylation and Ubiquitination, mediated by the SUMO-targeting ubiquitin ligase RNF4 and possibly other enzymes.

We addressed this apparent discrepancy by showing that the timing of proteasome inhibition has a remarkable impact on the outcome of ETO treatment. Inhibiting proteasomal function prior to or during ETO administration significantly improved genome stability by minimizing DSB mis-repair associated with TOP2 proteolysis. However, inhibiting the proteasome after ETO treatment did not effectively protect cells from ETO-induced genome instability, presumably because proteasome-mediated degradation of TOP2ccs is an extremely fast process. Taken together, our study suggests that caution needs to be taken when scheduling therapeutic regimens combining topoisomerase poisons with proteasome inhibitors.</p><p>Our analysis also revealed that TOP2-mediated DSBs, especially ones that are not promptly repaired, undergo extensive DNA end-resection. We interpreted this as an indicator of active DNA repair occurring at TOP2ccs that have been partially or completely degraded by the proteasome. By contrast, when proteasomal degradation was inhibited by BTZ, we could only detect trace levels of DNA end-resection. This suggests the possibility that MRE11, which is required for DNA end-resection, may not recognize unprocessed TOP2. Similar to TOP2, the meiotic recombination initiator SPO11 forms protein-linked DSBs, which are thought to trigger MRE11 nuclease removal of SPO11 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Neale et al., 2005</xref>). However, recent studies reveal that mammalian meiotic cells accumulate significant levels of DNA-bound SPO11, which could, in principal be partially proteolyzed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Paiano et al., 2020</xref>). While the mechanism by which TOP2 (and perhaps SPO11) shields its associated DSB from early detection by DDR surveillance factors is unclear, our results highlight that γ-H2AX is only a reliable marker for proteolytically degraded TOP2ccs. In contrast, END-seq can be used to distinguish intact TOP2ccs, partially proteolyzed TOP2ccs, as well as fully processed protein-free DSBs.</p><p>Finally, we found that the SUMO-targeted ubiquitin ligase RNF4 played a critical role in recruiting the proteasome to degrade TOP2ccs, confirming a report by another group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sun et al., 2019</xref>). The loss of RNF4 afforded cells significant protection from the genotoxic effects of ETO, further highlighting how impairing proteasome-mediated degradation of TOP2ccs can preserve genome integrity. However, RNF4 deletion did not prevent ETO-induced chromosomal aberrations or blunt the γ-H2AX response as efficiently as chemical proteasome inhibition. This indicates the likely existence of additional ubiquitin ligases that are functionally redundant to RNF4. Nevertheless, our data suggests that RNF4 could be potentially used as a biomarker to predict the effectiveness of chemotherapeutic regimens that incorporate topoisomerase poisons. In addition, de-regulation of RNF4 may represent a potential mechanism for tumors to acquire resistance to topoisomerase poisons by favoring TOP2cc reversal over degradation.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(Species or <break/>Source)</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source</th><th valign="top">Identifier</th><th valign="top">Add. info</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Anti-phospho-Histone H2A.X (Ser139) (mouse monoclonal)</td><td valign="top">Millipore</td><td valign="top">Cat# JBW301;

Lymphocyte separation media (Corning) was used after harvesting the B-cells to separate dead cells from live cells prior to use for END-seq protocol. Cellular Viability was measured using CellTiter-Glo Cell Viability Assay Kit (Promega) according to manufactures directions. Luminescence was quantified using a Tecan Infinite M200 Pro plate reader. B-cells were pre-treated with proteasome inhibitor, either 10 μM MG132 (Sigma-Aldrich) or 5 μM Bortezomib (Millipore) for 1 hr then co-treated for an additional 2 hr with 50 μM Etoposide (E1383, Sigma-Aldrich). Following the ETO pulse, the cells were either harvested in the presence of the drugs, or washed three times in ice-cold drug free media (3 × 5 min spin at 1500 rpm and 4°C to pellet B-cells between washes; 15–20 min total time to complete washout), and returned to 37°C to recover in fresh drug free media, until they were harvested at various timepoints post-washout for END-seq, western blot, Immunofluorescence, ICE assay, or for mitotic spread analysis as described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>. Asynchronous WT B-cells were treated 24 hr post-activation for 2 hr with 50 μM ETO or 12.5 μM Camptothecin (Sigma-Aldrich) ±1 hr 10 μM MG132 pre-treatment, then fixed following a 24 hr recovery in drug free media for mitotic spread analysis. Abelson-transformed pre-B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bredemeyer et al., 2006</xref>) were retrovirally transduced with the tetracycline-inducible ER-AsiSI, pTRE3G-HA-ER-AsiSI as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Callen et al., 2013</xref>).

Primary B-cells were washed twice in cold PBS and resuspended in cold cell suspension buffer (Bio-Rad CHEF Mammalian Genomic DNA plug kit), equilibrated for 5 min at room temperature, mixed with 2% melted CleanCut agarose (Bio-Rad CHEF Mammalian Genomic DNA plug kit) prewarmed at 37°C for a final concentration of 0.75%, and transferred immediately into plug molds and let them solidify at 4°C for 20 min. Embedded cells were lysed and digested using Proteinase K (50°C, 1 hr then 37°C for 7 hr). Etoposide and drugs were maintained at the same experimental concentrations in all the steps until digestion with Proteinase K. Plugs were rinsed in TE buffer and treated with RNaseA at 37°C, 1 hr. The next enzymatic reactions were performed with the DNA in agarose plugs to prevent shearing. DNA ends were blunted for 1 hr at 37°C with Exonuclease VII (ExoVII) followed by Exonuclease T (ExoT) (NEB) for 1 hr at 25°C to detect all TOP2-mediated DSBs (protein-linked and protein-free), or only with Exonuclease T (NEB) for 1 hr at 25°C to detect only protein-free DSBs. After blunting, A-tailing was performed to attach dA to the free 3’-OH, followed by ligation of ‘‘END-seq hairpin adaptor 1,’’ listed in reagents section, using NEB Quick Ligase. Agarose plugs were then melted and dialyzed, and DNA was sonicated to a median shear length of 170 bp using Covaris S220 sonicator for 4 min at 10% duty cycle, peak incident power 175, 200 cycles per burst, at 4°C. DNA was ethanol-precipitated and dissolved in 70 ml TE buffer. Biotinylated DNA was isolated using MyOne Streptavidin C1 Beads (Thermo Fisher #650–01), followed by end repair (dNTPs, T4 polymerase (NEB), Klenow (NEB), T4 PNK) and dA-tailing (Klenow exo- (NEB), dATP). The second end was ligated to ‘‘END-seq hairpin adaptor 2’’ using NEB Quick Ligase. Hairpins were digested using USER (NEB), and the resulting DNA fragments were PCR amplified using TruSeq barcoded primer p5, <named-content content-type="sequence">AATGATACGGCGACCACCGAGATCTACACNNNNNNNNACACTCTTTCCCTACACGACGCTCTTCCGATC</named-content>*<named-content content-type="sequence">T</named-content> and TruSeq barcoded primer p7, <named-content content-type="sequence">CAAGCAGAAGACGGCATACGAGANNNNNNNGTGACTGGAGTTCAGACGTGTGCTCTTCCGATC</named-content>*T, (<named-content content-type="sequence">NNNNNNNN</named-content> represents barcode a * a phosphothiorate bond) listed in reagents. PCR fragments were isolated by size selection from agarose gel, selecting 200–500 bp fragments followed by DNA purification using QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit. Libraries were quantified using KAPA Library Quantification Kit and sequenced using Illumina NextSeq 500 or 550.

For END-seq data, where cells with ZFN break were spiked-in to the library at a 1:40 (2.5%) ratio, the RPKM value for each peak was divided by the signal around the spiked-in breaks and then multiplied by 2.5, to get values as cell-percentage.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10-4"><title>Resection quantification</title><p>To quantify the width of maximum resection endpoint, a sliding window containing 10 50 bp bins was used to start from the summit of each break, out to 2.5 kb on either side of the summit to detect the END-seq signal around the break summit. Maximum END-seq signal for 50 bp bins within 2.5 kb ~5 kb around break summit was used as background. When more than half of the bins within this sliding window had an RPKM values equal to or lower than the background, then the last bin within the window which had a detectable signal over background is regarded as the maximum resection endpoint from the break summit.

Similarly, TOP2cc fraction, [TOP2CC], was defined as [TOP2CC]=1-[DSB] fraction for each lesion. To calculate the reversible TOP2cc fraction ([TOP2CC]<sub>R</sub>), we subtracted the data obtained from the END-seq ETO washout experiment (see above), from the data obtained from END-seq ETO experiment without washout, to get [TOP2CC]<sub>R</sub>. Finally, the irreversible TOP2cc fraction ([TOP2CC]<sub>I</sub>) was defined as [TOP2CC]<sub>I</sub> = 1-[DSB]-[TOP2CC]<sub>R</sub>.

consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Maureen Murphy as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Wolf-Dietrich Heyer (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Title: The title should be modified as follows: &quot;Suppressing proteasome mediated processing of topoisomerase II DNA-Protein complexes preserves genome integrity&quot;</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript the authors follow-up on previous observations regarding the fate of TOP2 cleavage complexes and the role of the proteasome in processing such adducts. The authors confirm previous observations that TOP2 cleavage complexes are readily induced by etoposide eliciting a DNA damage response as measured by accumulation of histone γ-H2AX. They also confirm the previous observation that proteasome inhibitors suppress the DNA damage response in response to etoposide using primary B-cells. Interestingly the authors find this effect still occurs in B cells isolated from mice with ATM<sup>-/-</sup> and H2AX<sup>-/-</sup>, indicating that the repair may be independent of HR or NHEJ. In cycling MEFs from the RNF4 knockout mouse, deletion of RNF4 is epistatic with proteasome inhibition, supporting the premise that RNF4 plays a role in the degradation of TOP2 complexes.</p><p>Significant points:</p><p>1) The authors extend upon previous insights and demonstrate that pre- or co-treatment of etoposide with proteasome inhibitors completely suppresses the typical chromosomal rearrangements associated with etoposide treatment. This suppression is the likely consequence of a defect in processing etoposide-induced DNA damage by DSB end resection.</p><p>2) The authors demonstrate that the observed chromosomal rearrangements after etoposide treatment are independent of Ligase IV, excluding NHEJ as a mechanism, and BRCA1, suggesting independence of homologous recombination.</p><p>3) In an orthogonal genetic approach, the authors show that the SUMO-targeted ubiquitin ligase RNF4 is required for required for proteasome-mediated turnover of TOP2 cleavage complexes and acts epistatically with the proteasome in processing TOP2 cleavage complexes to result in induction of the DNA damage response, loos of viability, and generation of chromosomal aberrations.</p><p>4) The conclusions about the role of the proteasome in processing etoposide-induced DNA damage are relevant and potentially impactful, as both etoposide and proteasome inhibitors are used in the clinic alone and in combination. The mechanistic insights gained through this study could provide possible explanation for the variability in efficacy observed for etoposide and has implications for the staging in protocols involving both types of drugs.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The main interpretations are, in general, supported by the data, though there are some concerns/exceptions noted below.</p><p>1) According to the present draft, many of the experiments appear to have only been done once: for example Figure 1B, C, D, F; Figure 2D and G; Figure 3B; Figure 4B and D; Figure 5B and C; Figure 6A. The authors need to more accurately state how many biological and technical replicates were done, and how exactly statistical analysis was done. Whereas a table stating such was provided to the reviewers, this information needs to be now included in clear manner in a revised manuscript.</p><p>2) Figure 1D is a slot blot of ICE assay fractions. It is unclear what the difference is between ETO and ETO + 0 hr washout; or between pre-MG132 + ETO and pre-MG132 + ETO + 0 hr washout. It seems this was done only once. Why? In the reference cited for the method it recommends doing the ICE assay N=3. In order to make quantitative conclusions from this type of data, the experiment must be carried out several times (at least three) so that statistical testing can be applied. And why has only TOP2B been probed for and not TOP2A? If this is because the cells used express very little TOP2A then this should be stated (and preferably demonstrated).</p><p>3) In several cases there are not enough details about methods, and it is requested that the authors carefully go through the manuscript to ensure there are enough details that will enable others to reproduce their findings:</p><p>a) The section on DNA END-seq is novel, yet it is not clearly detailed enough for others to repeat.</p><p>b) In the text it says ETO was washed out &quot;immediately&quot;, but in the Materials and methods section, it says cells were washed three times in drug free media. Washing three times would take time. The authors should state how long this took and at what temperature was the washing done. These details are necessary to interpret the reported data.</p><p>c) Figure 3A and C – not clear images, and not clear how many replicates. Please clarify how long after the drug treatments were the mitotic spreads produced.</p><p>4) In Figure 1, the authors use primary mouse B-cells to show that pre-treatment with proteasome inhibitors suppresses the γ-H2AX response to Etoposide. After washout of the drugs, TOP2 trapped complexes quickly turn over, and the authors suspect that this is due to resumption of TOP2 activity rather than reactivation of the proteasome. To support this conclusion, the authors conduct an experiment in eHAP cells (Figure 1E) to show that in particular in response to BTZ, the proteasome remains inhibited for 6 hrs, well beyond the turnover observed in Figure 1D. The question is: Does this response in eHAP cells reflect the situation in primary B-cells? Could this question of how long the proteasome remains inhibited be answered directly in primary B-cells?</p><p>It should be clarified which cells were used in Figure 1F. The authors write: &quot;Thus, proteasome activity is not readily recovered even after the removal of proteasome inhibitor, which contrasts starkly with the rapid recovery of TOP2 enzymatic activity.&quot; What is the direct evidence for the rapid recovery of TOP2 enzymatic activity? The evidence of Figure 1E is indirect.</p><p>5) The results of Figure 5, that the repair of Etoposide-induced DNA damage is not repaired by NHEJ (using the Ligase IV mutant) or HR (using the BRCA1 mutant) leaves the obvious question: which DSB repair pathway is responsible for joining these DSBs? While an experimental answer would go well beyond what a revision should achieve, the authors should discuss this. The observed DSB resection at etoposide-induced DSBs would be consistent with repair by aNHEJ/MMEJ and may suggest a role of Polθ. How clear is it that the BRCA1 defect inhibits all DSB repair by HR? Is DSB resection at etoposide induced DSB normal in BRCA1-deficient cells?</p><p>6) Figure 6A lacks error bars. Was this a single experiment? Are the results reproducible? The data for N=3 and error bars should be included.</p><p>7) The authors suggest in the Discussion that this work implies that the timing of etoposide with proteasome inhibitors for cancer cells needs to take this work into consideration, but the authors do not formally show that this same effect occurs in tumor cells. As this appears to be a very clinically relevant and important hypothesis, I believe the work could be improved by showing in two tumor cell lines whether the timing of proteasome inhibition influences the extent of chromosome aberrations induced by etoposide. As the authors analyze cycling MEFs in this work, it is assumed that the proliferative nature of the tumor cells will not interfere with this experiment.</p><p>8) There is a lack of adequate references to prior work in this manuscript:</p><p>As examples:</p><p>a) The authors state: &quot;It has been suggested that a robust DNA damage response (DDR) is elicited only after ETO-trapped TOP2ccs have been converted to &quot;clean&quot; protein-free DSBs (Zhang et al., 2006)&quot;. These publications should be cited as they show this is the case: Mårtensson et al., 2003, Muslimović et al., 2009 (PMCID: PMC2689654), Sunter et al., 2010 (PMCID: PMC2935090), Lee et al., 2018 (PMCID: PMC6073685).</p><p>b) The authors state: &quot;Other studies have shown that inhibiting the proteasome not only preserves the reversibility of TOP2ccs but also is able to suppress DDR signaling (Mao et al., 2001); Zhang et al., 2006). However, the implications of suppressing the DDR in response to ETO using proteasome inhibitors, on both the long-term genome integrity and overall viability of the cell, have not been fully explored.&quot; The authors should look more carefully at, and cite where appropriate, other studies looking at combinations of proteasome inhibitors and drugs targeting TOP2:</p><p>Lee et al., 2016 (PMCID: PMC5071433), Metzler et al., 2009, Dittus et al., 2018, Aras and Yerlikaya, 2016 (PMCID: PMC4841005), Destanovic, Boos and Lanvers-Kaminsky, 2018.</p><p>c) The half-lives of TOP2 complexes following ETO removal has previously been reported for both TOP2A and TOP2B; TOP2B has a shorter half-life than TOP2A.</p><p>This should be addressed in the text: Willmore et al., 1998, Errington et al., 2004, Lee et al., 2016 (PMCID: PMC5071433).</p><p>d) The authors report that γ-H2AX signal is delayed by proteasomal inhibition preventing processing of TOP2 covalent complexes. This have been reported before by several groups: Mårtensson et al., 2003, Muslimović et al., 2009 (PMCID: PMC2689654), Sunter et al., 2010 (PMCID: PMC2935090), Lee et al., 2018 (PMCID: PMC6073685).</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Suppressing Proteasome Mediated Processing of Topoisomerase II DNA-Protein Complexes Preserves Genome Integrity&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Maureen Murphy as the Senior and Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved and there are no new experiments required, but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed within the text before final acceptance, as outlined below.</p><p>1) In some places you mention &quot;spontaneous reversal&quot; of complexes; a more precise way of stating this, would be &quot;reversal of complexes by completion of the enzymes' catalytic cycle upon drug removal.&quot;</p><p>2) You clarify that there are two replicates of the END-seq data, with ~ 70% overlap between the two replicates (supplementary figure). Data for one gene are shown in Figures 2A and 3A and various types of data analysis on the END-seq data are shown. Were these data generated from just one replicate or are they combined data from the two replicates, and if the latter, was it just on the ~ 70% of the data that was concordant between the two replicas? Can you please clarify this?</p><p>3) END-seq is a novel approach in this study; it would be good to have a bit more discussion of the END-seq data. In Figure 3A resection data is shown; how was this determined/measured? Also can you comment as to what proportion of the breaks were SSBs versus DSBs? And how does this data compare with what has been recently reported by Gittens et al., 2019?</p><p>4) This study reports TOP2B complex levels following short term exposure to proteasome inhibitors prior to the TOP2 drug etoposide; this has been previously studied and published by Lee et al., 2016, for both TOP2A and TOP2B, using the TARDIS assay (Figure 9 in Lee et al., 2016). The current study and Lee et al. report similar findings, that the complexes are short lived and remain for longer when the proteasome is inhibited. Thus, the biochemical studies in both studies produce comparable results; this should be clearly mentioned.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.53447.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) According to the present draft, many of the experiments appear to have only been done once: for example, Figure 1B, C, D, F; Figure 2D and G; Figure 3B; Figure 4B and D; Figure 5B and C; Figure 6A.

The difference between ETO and ETO + 0 hr washout is that cells were harvested in the presence of ETO in the former, while in the latter, cells were harvested immediately after ETO was washed out three times in cold media and centrifuged for 5 minutes at 1500 rpm to pellet cells. Additional details are provided in the text, Materials and methods and figure legends. The same explanation applies to pre-MG132 + ETO and pre-MG132 + ETO + 0 hr washout. This has been clarified in the figure legends, Materials and methods and text.</p><p>To address the reviewers’ comments about the levels of TOP2B vs. TOP2A, we have updated the text to clarify that TOP2B is the primary isoform present in G1 primary mouse B-cells. We refer to a previous paper from our group where levels of TOP2A and TOP2B were measured in the same primary mouse B-cells (Canela et al., 2017) used in these experiments.

To support this conclusion, the authors conduct an experiment in eHAP cells (Figure 1E) to show that in particular in response to BTZ, the proteasome remains inhibited for 6 hrs, well beyond the turnover observed in Figure. 1D. The question is: Does this response in eHAP cells reflect the situation in primary B-cells? Could this question of how long the proteasome remains inhibited be answered directly in primary B-cells?</p><p>It should be clarified which cells were used in Figure 1F. The authors write: &quot;Thus, proteasome activity is not readily recovered even after the removal of proteasome inhibitor, which contrasts starkly with the rapid recovery of TOP2 enzymatic activity.&quot; What is the direct evidence for the rapid recovery of TOP2 enzymatic activity? The evidence of Figure 1E is indirect.</p></disp-quote><p>To directly address the reviewers’ concerns about the longevity of proteasomal inhibition in primary B-cells, we assessed pan-p53 protein levels by western blot at several timepoints following proteasome inhibitor treatment. Proteasome inhibition has been reproducibly shown to cause accumulation of p53 (An et al., 2000 (PMID:10914553); Halasi, Pandit and Gartel, 2014 (PMID: 25485499)). Indeed, we found that both BTZ and MG132 treatment led to accumulation of p53 in primary B cells. Moreover, elevated p53 protein levels persisted for many hours after proteasome inhibitors were removed. The kinetics of p53 accumulation in B cells was comparable to YFP accumulation in eHAP cells suggesting that proteasome activity remains suppressed for an extended time after the wash out of ETO and proteasome inhibitors. We have now included a representative pan-p53 Western blot in the revised Figure 1 (now Figure 1F). We also observed similar results when we measured the total level of ubiquitinated proteins over a similar time course (data not shown). We have revised the text accordingly.</p><p>The reviewer makes a good point and is entirely correct that Figure 1D and E only provided indirect evidence for the rapid recovery of TOP2 enzymatic activity. We have, therefore, tempered our conclusion by stating: “Thus, proteasome activity is not readily recovered even after the removal of proteasome inhibitor, suggesting that the rapid loss of ETO-induced TOP2ccs in MG132 pre-treated cells upon washout most likely reflected spontaneous recovery of TOP2 enzymatic activity.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The results of Figure 5, that the repair of Etoposide-induced DNA damage is not repaired by NHEJ (using the Ligase IV mutant) or HR (using the BRCA1 mutant) leaves the obvious question: which DSB repair pathway is responsible for joining these DSBs? While an experimental answer would go well beyond what a revision should achieve, the authors should discuss this. The observed DSB resection at etoposide-induced DSBs would be consistent with repair by aNHEJ/MMEJ and may suggest a role of Polθ. How clear is it that the BRCA1 defect inhibits all DSB repair by HR? Is DSB resection at etoposide induced DSB normal in BRCA1-deficient cells?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for bring up this important question and have tried to address it experimentally. Like the reviewers, we were also confounded by the fact neither classical NHEJ nor HR appeared to be absolutely critical for mediating error-prone repair of ETO-induced DSBs. To further address this question, as well as concerns that BRCA1 function may not be totally essential for HR, we have performed additional experiments in B cells lacking BRCA2 or Polθ. The new results are now shown in Figure 5 and Figure 5—figure supplement 1. Briefly, we observed that loss of BRCA2 or Polθ did not significantly attenuate chromosomal rearrangements in ETO-treated B cells. These data strengthened our initial conclusion that no single repair pathway is essential to produce genome instability by ETO. Thus, the large number of DSBs induced by high dose ETO likely engages multiple repair pathways, all of which carry some potential for misrepair. We speculate that it may be possible to suppress ETO-induced genome instability by inhibiting multiple DSB repair pathways at once. However, this would be a major undertaking.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Figure 6A lacks error bars. Was this a single experiment? Are the results reproducible? The data for N=3 and error bars should be included.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now performed the western blot for γ-H2AX in WT vs. RNF4<sup>-/-</sup> MEFs three times (N=3) and updated Figure 6A to include both a western blot as well as a bar graph with error bars. Statistical information is noted in the figure legend.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The authors suggest in the Discussion that this work implies that the timing of etoposide with proteasome inhibitors for cancer cells needs to take this work into consideration, but the authors do not formally show that this same effect occurs in tumor cells.

As the authors analyze cycling MEFs in this work, it is assumed that the proliferative nature of the tumor cells will not interfere with this experiment.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this suggestion. To test this, we have performed CellTiter-Glo viability assays in two human tumor cell lines (DMS114 a small cell lung cancer cell line, and HeLa cells). The cells were pretreated or not with BTZ and then exposed to graded doses of ETO for 1 hour. There was considerable variability among the cancer cell lines in terms of their individual sensitivities to ETO and BTZ. Nevertheless, taken in total, our results showed that a 1 hr BTZ pre-treatment was able to modestly increase the viability in both ETO-treated human cancer cells (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>). Although we note that the cytoprotective effects of proteasome inhibition were not as dramatic as what was observed in primary B-cells, the protective trend of proteasome inhibition held true, and reinforced our argument that caution should be exercised when designing <italic>treatment</italic> regimens that combine TOP2 poisons and proteasome inhibitors.</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-53447-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) There is a lack of adequate references to prior work in this manuscript:</p><p>As examples:</p><p>a) The authors state: &quot;It has been suggested that a robust DNA damage response (DDR) is elicited only after ETO-trapped TOP2ccs have been converted to &quot;clean&quot; protein-free DSBs (Zhang et al., 2006)&quot;. These publications should be cited as they show this is the case: Mårtensson et al., 2003, Muslimović et al., 2009 (PMCID: PMC2689654), Sunter et al., 2010 (PMCID: PMC2935090), Lee et al., 2018 (PMCID: PMC6073685).</p><p>b) The authors state: &quot;Other studies have shown that inhibiting the proteasome not only preserves the reversibility of TOP2ccs but also is able to suppress DDR signaling (Mao et al., 2001); Zhang et al., 2006). However, the implications of suppressing the DDR in response to ETO using proteasome inhibitors, on both the long-term genome integrity and overall viability of the cell, have not been fully explored.&quot; The authors should look more carefully at, and cite where appropriate, other studies looking at combinations of proteasome inhibitors and drugs targeting TOP2:</p><p>Lee et al., 2016 (PMCID: PMC5071433), Metzler et al., 2009, Dittus et al., 2018, Aras and Yerlikaya, 2016 (PMCID: PMC4841005), Destanovic, Boos and Lanvers-Kaminsky, 2018.</p><p>c) The half-lives of TOP2 complexes following ETO removal has previously been reported for both TOP2A and TOP2B; TOP2B has a shorter half-life than TOP2A. This should be addressed in the text: Willmore et al., 1998, Errington et al., 2004, Lee et al., 2016 (PMCID: PMC5071433).</p><p>d) The authors report that γ-H2AX signal is delayed by proteasomal inhibition preventing processing of TOP2 covalent complexes. This have been reported before by several groups: Mårtensson et al., 2003, Muslimović et al., 2009 (PMCID: PMC2689654), Sunter et al., 2010 (PMCID: PMC2935090), Lee et al., 2018 (PMCID: PMC6073685).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for directing us to references that should have been cited in the original submission.

Data for one gene are shown in Figures 2A and 3A and various types of data analysis on the END-seq data are shown. Were these data generated from just one replicate or are they combined data from the two replicates, and if the latter, was it just on the ~ 70% of the data that was concordant between the two replicas? Can you please clarify this?</p></disp-quote><p>As requested, we have clarified how the END-seq data analysis was performed in the Materials and methods section. Briefly, as shown in Figure 2—figure supplement 1, the END-seq signal at ETO break sites is very reproducible between replicates. The data presented in Figures 2 and 3 are generated from one of the END-seq replicates. We have performed the same analyses for the other replicate, and the results are consistent. We have updated Figure 2—figure supplement 1 with some further analysis (Figure 2—figure supplement 1C-F) using data from second replicate to support the results shown in Figures 2B-E to illustrate this point and added Figure 3—figure supplement 1A-C to support the results from Figure 3B-D).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) END-seq is a novel approach in this study; it would be good to have a bit more discussion of the END-seq data. In Figure 3A resection data is shown; how was this determined/measured? Also can you comment as to what proportion of the breaks were SSBs versus DSBs? And how does this data compare with what has been recently reported by Gittens et al., 2019?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for their comments, while ETO can generate high level of SSBs as detailed in previous studies and in Glittens et al., END-seq only monitors DSBs that are generated by ETO, which is also mentioned in Glittens et al. Therefore, we have updated the text in the Results section, when discussing the use END-seq, to clarify this point and cite Glittens et al. to support it. In regard to the methodology to quantify resection, there is a section in the Materials and methods labelled “Resection Quantification” that details how the analysis was performed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) This study reports TOP2B complex levels following short term exposure to proteasome inhibitors prior to the TOP2 drug etoposide; this has been previously studied and published by Lee et al., 2016, for both TOP2A and TOP2B, using the TARDIS assay (Figure 9 in Lee et al., 2016). The current study and Lee et al. report similar findings, that the complexes are short lived and remain for longer when the proteasome is inhibited. Thus, the biochemical studies in both studies produce comparable results; this should be clearly mentioned.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for clarifying that this reference should have been cited more explicitly in the previous submission. We have now updated the text to reflect the findings from this reference with regard to our results measuring TOP2B complex levels by ICE assay.</p></body></sub-article></article>
