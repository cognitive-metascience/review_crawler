The membrane determinant to initiate the formation of autophagosomes remains elusive. Here, we establish a cell-free assay based on LC3 lipidation to define the organelle membrane supporting early autophagosome formation. In vitro LC3 lipidation requires energy and is subject to regulation by the pathways modulating autophagy in vivo. We developed a systematic membrane isolation scheme to identify the endoplasmic reticulum–Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) as a primary membrane source both necessary and sufficient to trigger LC3 lipidation in vitro. Functional studies demonstrate that the ERGIC is required for autophagosome biogenesis in vivo. Moreover, we find that the ERGIC acts by recruiting the early autophagosome marker ATG14, a critical step for the generation of preautophagosomal membranes.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00947.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00947.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00947.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cells continually adapt their behavior to accommodate changes in their environment. For example, when nutrients are abundant, cells can grow or proliferate; in times of scarcity, however, they must conserve resources for essential tasks. In particular, during periods of starvation, cells can cannibalize themselves in a process called autophagy, which literally means ‘self-eating’. Structures called autophagosomes engulf bits of cytoplasm and carry the contents to the digestive compartment of the cell, the lysosome, to be broken down into their constituent parts. This can include the degradation of proteins into amino acids, which can then be recycled into other proteins needed by the cell.</p><p>In cells, proteins are shipped to their destinations—which can be the plasma membrane or a specific organelle within the cell—via a delivery system known as the secretory pathway. This pathway begins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where many of these proteins are made. From the ER, the proteins move to a compartment called the Golgi apparatus, which then sends them to their destinations, or to the lysosome to be broken down. Between the ER and Golgi they pass through a structure called the ER–Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC).</p><p>Although the signaling pathways that initiate autophagy are known, less is understood about the actual formation of the autophagosomes. Now, Ge et al. have developed an in vitro system to study their formation, and gone on to identify a membrane that is both necessary and sufficient to create these structures.</p><p>Previous studies have implicated a variety of membranes—including the plasma membrane and the membranes belonging to the ER, the Golgi apparatus, the lysosome and various other organelles—in the formation of autophagosomes. To identify which of these membranes might be involved, Ge et al. focused on a protein called LC3 that is a key marker for the formation of the autophagosome. This protein is recruited to the growing autophagosome by a lipid, so discovering which membranes can add a lipid to LC3 should shed light on the assembly process.</p><p>By separating the full range of organelles in a cell lysate into fractions (a process called fractionation), Ge et al. found that the ERGIC was the most active membrane to attach lipid to LC3. Additionally, the lipid was only added when signaling pathways that stimulate autophagy—such as the PI3K pathway—were activated. Together, these results provide insight into the mechanism of autophagosome formation, and the structures in the cell that participate in this process.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00947.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00947.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>autophagy</kwd><kwd>ER–Golgi intermediate compartment</kwd><kwd>LC3 lipidation</kwd><kwd>autophagosome</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schekman</surname><given-names>Randy</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>University of California, Berkeley Miller Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schekman</surname><given-names>Randy</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Human Frontier Science Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>LT000003/2012</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ge</surname><given-names>Liang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Jane Coffin Childs Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ge</surname><given-names>Liang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A cell-free biochemical assay for protein lipidation identifies the ER–Golgi intermediate compartment as a key early station in the formation of an autophagosome.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Autophagy is a conserved catabolic process underlying the self-digestion of cytoplasmic components through the formation of double-membraned vesicles termed autophagosomes. One basic role of autophagy is to turn over damaged proteins and organelles to maintain cellular homeostasis. Autophagy also allows cells to cope with stresses such as starvation, hypoxia, and pathogen infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mizushima et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Burman and Ktistakis, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Levine, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Yang and Klionsky, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Weidberg et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>In the process of starvation-induced autophagy, several upstream signals are triggered, including inhibition of the mechanistic target of rapamycin (MTOR), and activation of the Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and AMP kinase (AMPK) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Noda and Ohsumi, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wei et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kim et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rubinsztein et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kim et al., 2013</xref>). These signals are conveyed to activate the serine/threonine-protein kinase complex containing the Atg1 homologs ULK1/2, ATG13, FIP200 (RB1CC1) and ATG101 (C12orf44) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mizushima, 2010</xref>). Together with upstream signals, this complex promotes the formation and membrane docking of the class III phosphatidylinositol 3 (PtdIns3)-kinase (PI3K) complex consisting of ATG14 (ATG14L/Barkor), the Atg6 homologue BECN1 (Beclin1), VPS34 (PIK3C3) and VPS15 (p150) for phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI3P) production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Obara and Ohsumi, 2011</xref>). Subsequently, DFCP1 (ZFYVE1), an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated PI3P binding protein, is recruited to the site of newly-generated PI3P to form omegasomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Axe et al., 2008</xref>). This is followed by two ubiquitin-like conjugation systems to produce the ATG12–ATG5 conjugate and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE)-lipidated ATG8/LC3, which initiates the formation of a preautophagosomal organelle termed the phagophore or isolation membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mizushima et al., 1998a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">1998b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ichimura et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Geng and Klionsky, 2008</xref>). The membrane then expands and engulfs cytoplasmic components. Finally, the crescent-shaped tubular membrane seals to form a double-membraned autophagosome with cytoplasmic components enclosed within the inner membrane. Fusion of the autophagosome with the lysosome leads to the breakdown of the inner membrane together with the trapped cytosolic material (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mizushima et al., 1998a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Burman and Ktistakis, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Yang and Klionsky, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Weidberg et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rubinsztein et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>A long-standing quest in the autophagy field has been to define the origin of the autophagosomal membrane. Recent data suggest a multi-membrane source model for autophagosome biogenesis. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) supports PI3P-dependent formation of the omegasome, a cradle for phagophore generation and elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Axe et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hayashi-Nishino et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Yla-Anttila et al., 2009</xref>). The outer membrane of the mitochondrion may also supply lipids for the phagophore and autophagosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hailey et al., 2010</xref>). Recently, a study by Hamasaki et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hamasaki et al., 2013</xref>) indicates the ER–mitochondrial junction as being required for autophagosome biogenesis, possibly reconciling these two origins. In addition, clathrin-coated vesicles from the plasma membrane have been shown to promote phagophore expansion through the SNARE protein VAMP7 and its partner SNAREs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ravikumar et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Moreau et al., 2011</xref>). Moreover, ATG9-positive vesicles cycle between distinct cytoplasmic compartments to deliver membrane to a developing autophagosome or, in yeast, to phagophore assembly sites (PAS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Young et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sekito et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mari et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nair et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Orsi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yamamoto et al., 2012</xref>). Autophagosomes may also acquire membrane from other sources including Golgi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Geng et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ohashi and Munro, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Yen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">van der Vaart et al., 2010</xref>), early endosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Longatti et al., 2012</xref>) and vesicles budding from the ER and Golgi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hamasaki et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Zoppino et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Guo et al., 2012</xref>). Although tremendous progress has been made, a direct functional link between a membrane source and autophagosome biogenesis has not been established. Furthermore, the identity of the membrane determinant that responds to a stress signal to initiate autophagosome formation is unknown.</p><p>A variety of visual techniques have been developed to define the origin of the autophagosome membrane. Here, we developed a functional approach relying on the lipidation of LC3 to assay an early stage in autophagosome biogenesis. We establish a cell-free system that reflects many of the physiological and biochemical landmarks of early events in the autophagic pathway and define the ER–Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC), a membrane compartment between ER and Golgi for cargo sorting and recycling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Appenzeller-Herzog and Hauri, 2006</xref>), as a key membrane determinant for autophagosome biogenesis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Establishment of a regulated in vitro LC3 lipidation assay</title><p>A key step in autophagosome biogenesis is the generation of PE-lipidated LC3 by a ubiquitin-like conjugation system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ichimura et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kabeya et al., 2000</xref>). The level of LC3 lipidation has long been a reliable measure of autophagy activity in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Klionsky et al., 2012</xref>). In vitro LC3 lipidation has recently been reconstituted with synthetic liposomes, recombinant LC3 and other components including the ATG12–ATG5 conjugate, ATG7 and ATG3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sou et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hanada et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Oh-oka et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Shao et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gao et al., 2010</xref>). We sought to capture this modification in a more physiological context by relying on native membranes and cytosol to provide the core components of LC3 lipidation as well as any regulatory proteins that may be required for early autophagosome formation.</p><p>To establish such an assay, we mixed autophagosome precursor-deficient membranes with cytosol from normal and starved cells. Cells lacking ATG5 are deficient in starvation-induced autophagy and phagophore formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mizushima et al., 2001</xref>). Hence they only contain unmodified LC3 (LC3-I) in both cytosol and membrane fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Cytosols derived from WT cells (including WT MEF [mouse embryonic fibroblast], COS-7 [<italic>Cercopithecus aethiops</italic> fibroblast-like kidney cells], and HEK293T [human embryonic kidney 293T cells]) were highly enriched in LC3-I whereas the lipidated form of LC3 (LC3-II) sedimented with membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kabeya et al., 2000</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

Starvation-induced autophagosome biogenesis requires the class III PI3K complex which contains ATG14, BECN1, VPS15, and the PI3K subunit VPS34 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Burman and Ktistakis, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Obara and Ohsumi, 2011</xref>). Inhibition of the PI3K activity prevents autophagy. LC3 lipidation was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by 3-methyladenine (3-MA) and wortmannin, two PI3K inhibitors of different potency but which act in the same concentration ranges to block autophagy in intact cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Klionsky et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>In starved cells, downstream effector proteins recognize the PI3P generated by the autophagy-specific VPS34 PI3 kinase. The FYVE domain binds to PI3P (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Stenmark and Aasland, 1999</xref>) and when expressed in excess blocks autophagy in the cell by sequestering PI3P (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Axe et al., 2008</xref>). To study the role of PI3P in the in vitro reaction, we isolated a FYVE domain derived from FENS-1 (WDFY1), an endosomal protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ridley et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Axe et al., 2008</xref>), and included the peptide in a lipidation reaction mixture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A,B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). As reported in intact cells, the FYVE domain peptide inhibited LC3 lipidation in a dose-dependent manner whereas a cysteine to serine (C/S) mutation, which abolishes the ability of FYVE to bind PI3P (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A,C</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Axe et al., 2008</xref>), had no effect on lipidation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).</p><p>One technical limitation is that the lipidation reaction relies on the conversion of endogenous LC3-I to LC3-II.

Finally, we provided evidence that the ERGIC membrane acts by recruiting ATG14 to initiate PI3K activity, an early step essential for autophagosome biogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10 fig11 fig12">Figures 10–12</xref>).</p><p>Numerous morphological studies have indicated several possible sources of the autophagosomal membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Burman and Ktistakis, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mari et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Weidberg et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rubinsztein et al., 2012</xref>). Indeed, it is improbable that one organelle contributes all the membrane constituents that become part of a mature autophagosome. Nonetheless, it seems likely that one membrane responds to the signal that triggers autophagosome formation and the identity of that membrane has remained elusive. Our isolation of the ERGIC as the locus of LC3 lipidation is in line with morphological studies that describe an omegasome structure projecting directly from the ER membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Axe et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hayashi-Nishino et al., 2009</xref>). However, our results show clearly that the bulk ER membrane is not the site of lipidation, thus if the omegasome arises from the ER, it must become modified in some way to be active for LC3 lipidation.</p><p>Starvation induces the membrane localization of soluble oligomeric proteins including ATG14 and the PI3K complex, followed by the recruitment of DFCP1 to generate the omegasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Axe et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Matsunaga et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sun et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Zhong et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Matsunaga et al., 2010</xref>). This process occurs upstream of phagophore generation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Itakura and Mizushima, 2010</xref>). Our data show that in starved cells and in isolated membranes, the presence of ERGIC is required for the efficient membrane recruitment of ATG14 and DFCP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11 fig12">Figures 11 and 12</xref>). Thus the ERGIC may play a role in an early stage of phagophore formation by providing a platform to recruit the class III PI3K complex and provide precursor membranes for phagophore initiation, which may be further expanded in a special subdomain of ER.</p><p>How and why the ERGIC is used to trigger phagophore formation remains unclear. Perhaps the tubular and curved structure of the ERGIC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Appenzeller-Herzog and Hauri, 2006</xref>) in mammalian cells favors recruitment of the ATG14 complex and subsequently of other components. ATG14 has been reported to sense membrane curvature via an amphipathic alpha helix located in a C-terminal ‘BATS’ domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fan et al., 2011</xref>). In yeast, it has been shown that highly curved membranes positive for ATG9 are delivered to the PAS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mari et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nair et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yamamoto et al., 2012</xref>). Subsequently, the curvature sensing protein Atg1 recruits Atg13 and the Atg17–31–29 protein complex to initiate the formation of the phagophore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ragusa et al., 2012</xref>). The suggested requirement for a tubular membrane together with the possible existence of an integral membrane protein(s) that triggers ATG14 recruitment are now open for biochemical analysis.</p><p>The cell-free LC3 lipidation reaction responds to a starvation signal, likely originating in the cytosolic fraction. Fractionation of the cytosol should reveal the full range of biochemical requirements including regulatory components induced by starvation as well as the core proteins essential for LC3 lipidation. Furthermore, this approach could be exploited to evaluate the maturation of the phagophore through subsequent stages of morphological transformation including envelope closure and fusion with the lysosome.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Materials, antibodies, and plasmids</title><p>We obtained horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories (West Grove, PA); fluorescent secondary antibodies and Earle’s Balanced Salt Solution (EBSS) from Invitrogen (Grand Island, NY); PIP Strips from Echelon (Salt Lake City, UT); 3-methyladenine (3-MA), wortmannin, rapamycin, H89 and clofibrate from Sigma (St. Louis, MO); ATG4B from Boston Biochem (Cambridge, MA); SEC22B antibody blocking peptides (sequence CG+HSEFDEQHGKKVPTVSRPYSFIEFDT) from David King (University of California, Berkeley); Torin 1 and kbNB142-70 from Tocris (Minneapolis, MN); Pitstop 2 from Abcam (Cambridge, MA); reagents for PE measurement as described by Hokazono et al.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor, a Reviewing editor, and two reviewers.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the two reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We agree that your manuscript represents an elegantly designed and carefully performed study that provides an important new tool to the field (i.e., the development of an in vitro assay system to analyze LC3 lipidation using components of mammalian cells) and increased insight into the mechanism of autophagosome biogenesis (i.e., further clarification of the role of the ERGIC as a membrane determinant of the site of LC3 lipidation).</p><p>The reviewers have suggested some studies that would either (a) further increase the impact of your findings or (b) provide additional controls to further strengthen the findings. Here, we provide a summary of the suggestions. In our collective view, the most crucial point is to provide additional data such as EM analysis (or another approach) to determine whether your in vitro system for studying LC3 lipidation results in actual autophagosome reconstitution.</p><p><italic>Suggestions to increase the impact/significance of the findings:</italic></p><p>1) As mentioned above, further characterization of the cell-free system would be important. Specifically, does the reconstitution system allow for the formation of mature autophagosomes and autolysosomes? Protease protection assays, EM analysis, and analysis of the effects of lysosomal inhibitors should be considered to strengthen this aspect of the study.</p><p>2) EM analysis of the tissue culture experiments would help determine whether the ERGIC compartment directly contributes to autophagosome formation.</p><p><italic>Suggestions for additional controls to further strengthen your data:</italic></p><p>1) The lipidation of LC3 requires the Atg12–5–16 complex. Using gel filtration of the cytosol, we suggest that you demonstrate that this complex is formed or maintained in your reconstitution systems using 1) ERGIC membrane fractions, and 2) a membrane fraction you have ruled out as being a membrane source (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>), such as ER, late endosomes and plasma membrane. This would be an important control to show the integrity of the E3 activity in the cytosol even though the lipidation is reduced, and eliminate the possibility that the membrane fractions or assay conditions can deplete or contribute inhibitory factors, which may be altering the lipidation activity of the Atg12–5–16 complex.</p><p>2) In light of the recent data about the MAM and autophagosome biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hamasaki, et al. 2013</xref>), you should consider validating your MAM fractionation for Atg14L by Western blot.</p><p>3) One of the most important experiments is the recruitment of Atg14 and DFCP1 to the ERGIC in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12</xref>.

Accordingly, we would like you to mention (and discuss as you deem appropriate) the results of LC3-II protease protection experiments in the text. As you point out, the absence of complete reconstitution of a closed membrane sphere does not detract from the overall importance of your work; however, we feel that it is important for readers to know this limitation of your in vitro LC3 lipidation system.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00947.028</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Suggestions to increase the impact/significance of the findings:]</p><p><italic>1) As mentioned above, further characterization of the cell-free system would be important. Specifically, does the reconstitution system allow for the formation of mature autophagosomes and autolysosomes? Protease protection assays, EM analysis, and analysis of the effects of lysosomal inhibitors should be considered to strengthen this aspect of the study</italic>.</p><p>We too would like to have our cell-free reaction recapitulate the entire pathway of authophagosome biogenesis, but this goal may be a bit much for a first report. Nonetheless, we have performed a protease protection assay hoping to observe the progressive enclosure of lipidated LC3 within a sealed compartment as might be expected when the autophagosome precursor membrane closes to segregate cytosolic components. Unfortunately, on repeated tests in prolonged incubations, we find little evidence for reproducible protease protection of the LC3-II species. We are not discouraged by this because the overall pathway is likely to be quite complex, including the fusion of additional membranes carrying such proteins as ATG9 (which is missing from our enriched ERGIC membrane), as well as a substantial morphological transformation from a membrane sheet into a closed concentric membrane sphere. An alternative strategy could be to start with membranes from an <italic>Atg</italic> null cell line blocked at a distinctly later step in the pathway. We hope the reviewers will appreciate that this is beyond the scope of this paper, which we believe is already quite complex.</p><p><italic>2) EM analysis of the tissue culture experiments would help determine whether the ERGIC compartment directly contributes to autophagosome formation</italic>.</p><p>We thank the reviewers for the suggestion. Our antibodies are not good enough for immunogold labeling in EM analysis. Instead, we performed confocal microscopy to analyze the colocalization of ERGIC with ATG14 and DFCP1, two early autophagy markers as indicated in the manuscript. We found that the starvation-induced puncta of ATG14 partially overlaps with ERGIC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12s2">Figure 12—figure supplement 2A</xref>). DFCP1, the autophagy-related PI3P binding protein, colocalizes with ERGIC shortly after starvation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12s2">Figure 12—figure supplement 2B</xref>). These data are consistent with our membrane recruitment assay in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12</xref>. Together, the results suggest that ATG14 may transiently associate with ERGIC to generate PI3P, and subsequently be recognized by DFCP1 to initiate autophagosome biogenesis.</p><p>[Suggestions for additional controls to further strengthen your data:]</p><p><italic>1) The lipidation of LC3 requires the Atg12-5-16 complex.

We did the lipidation assay with ERGIC membrane fractions and the P fraction enriched in ER. After the reaction, we sedimented the membranes and collected the supernatant fractions followed by chromatography on a Superpose 6 column. Fractions were collected and immunoblots were performed to examine the distribution of ATG5–12 and ATG16. We found that the ATG5–12–16 complex is formed and maintained in both conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Therefore, the distinct lipidation activity observed with different membrane fractions is not due to an alteration of ATG5–12–16 complex.</p><p><italic>2) In light of the recent data about the MAM and autophagosome biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hamasaki, et al. 2013</xref>), you should consider validating your MAM fractionation for Atg14L by western blot</italic>.</p><p>We thank the reviewers for the suggestion. We performed an immunoblot with ATG14 antibody and detected a tiny amount of ATG14 in the MAM fraction under normal conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1A</xref>). However, after starvation, we observed an increase of ATG14 in the MAM faction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1B</xref>). The observation is consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hamasaki, et al. 2013</xref>.</p><p><italic>3) One of the most important experiments is the recruitment of Atg14 and DFCP1 to the ERGIC in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12</xref>. These data are not as robust as the rest of the manuscript and it would be important to show that a transfected negative control (e.g., GFP alone) does not float up on the ERGIC membranes. In addition, you might consider testing GFP–LC3–II recruitment as an addition further validation in this assay</italic>.</p><p>We thank the reviewers for the suggestion. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12s1">Figure 12—figure supplement 1</xref>, we validated the assay by showing that the recruitment of ATG14 and DFCP1 is regulated similarly to cellular autophagy, including starvation stimulation and PI3K dependency. We also showed that tubulin, an abundant cytosolic protein, was barely recruited to the membrane. For the LC3-II recruitment, we took the reviewer’s suggestion and added the T7-tagged LC3-I in the in vitro recruitment reaction. We found that the lipidated T7-LC3 was recruited to the membrane fraction while the soluble form LC3-I was not. Moreover, depletion of ERGIC mitigated the generation of LC3-II as indicated by the reduced signal in the top membrane fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12</xref>).</p><p><italic>[Editors’ note: before acceptance, the following revisions were also requested.</italic>]</p><p><italic>There is one remaining issue that needs to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below</italic>:</p><p><italic>We agree that the formation of a closed concentric membrane sphere (autophagosome) is likely to be quite complex, and we are willing to accept your argument that the in vitro reconstitution of this process is beyond the scope of the present paper.
