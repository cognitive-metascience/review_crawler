Yet, their regulation is only incompletely understood. We recently identified myotubularin related protein-2 (Mtmr2), a phosphoinositide (PI) phosphatase, in the native Piezo2 interactome of murine dorsal root ganglia (DRG). Here, we demonstrate that Mtmr2 attenuates Piezo2-mediated rapidly adapting mechanically activated (RA-MA) currents. Interestingly, heterologous Piezo1 and other known MA current subtypes in DRG appeared largely unaffected by Mtmr2. Experiments with catalytically inactive Mtmr2, pharmacological blockers of PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> synthesis, and osmotic stress suggest that Mtmr2-dependent Piezo2 inhibition involves depletion of PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub>. Further, we identified a PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> binding region in Piezo2, but not Piezo1, that confers sensitivity to Mtmr2 as indicated by functional analysis of a domain-swapped Piezo2 mutant. Altogether, our results propose local PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> modulation via Mtmr2 in the vicinity of Piezo2 as a novel mechanism to dynamically control Piezo2-dependent mechanotransduction in peripheral sensory neurons.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32346.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>We often take our sense of touch for granted. Yet, our every-day life greatly depends on the ability to perceive our environment to alert us of danger or to further social interactions, such as mother-child bonding. Our sense of touch relies on the conversion of mechanical stimuli to electrical signals (this is known as mechanotransduction), which then travel to brain to be processed. This task is fulfilled by specific ion channels called Piezo2, which are activated when cells are exposed to pressure and other mechanical forces. These channels can be found in sensory nerves and specialized structures in the skin, where they help to detect physical contact, roughness of surfaces and the position of our body parts.</p><p>It is still not clear how Piezo2 channels are regulated but previous research by several laboratories suggests that they work in conjunction with other proteins. One of these proteins is the myotubularin related protein-2, or Mtmr2 for short. Now, Narayanan et al. – including some of the researchers involved in the previous research – set out to advance our understanding of the molecular basis of touch and looked more closely at Mtmr2.</p><p>To test if Mtmr2 played a role in mechanotransduction, Narayanan et al. both increased and reduced the levels of this protein in sensory neurons of mice grown in the laboratory. When Mtmr2 levels were low, the activity of Piezo2 channels increased. However, when the protein levels were high, Piezo2 channels were inhibited. These results suggest that Mtmr2 can control the activity of Piezo2. Further experiments, in which Mtmr2 was genetically modified or sensory neurons were treated with chemicals, revealed that Mtmr2 reduces a specific fatty acid in the membrane of nerve cells, which in turn attenuates the activity of Piezo2.</p><p>This study identified Mtmr2 and distinct fatty acids in the cell membrane as new components of the complex setup required for the sense of touch. A next step will be to test if these molecules also influence the activity of Piezo2 when the skin has become injured or upon inflammation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Piezo2</kwd><kwd>PI(3,5)P2</kwd><kwd>Mtmr2</kwd><kwd>mechanotransduction</kwd><kwd>somatosensation</kwd><kwd>peripheral sensory nerves</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SCHM 2533/2-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schmidt</surname><given-names>Manuela</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004189</institution-id><institution>Max-Planck-Gesellschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Open-access funding</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hütte</surname><given-names>Meike</given-names></name><name><surname>Gomez-Varela</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name><name><surname>Schmidt</surname><given-names>Manuela</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004939</institution-id><institution>Göttinger Graduiertenschule für Neurowissenschaften, Biophysik und Molekulare Biowissenschaften</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PhD fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Narayanan</surname><given-names>Pratibha</given-names></name><name><surname>Hütte</surname><given-names>Meike</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CRC889 Project A9</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schmidt</surname><given-names>Manuela</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GO 2481/2-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gomez-Varela</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund9"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CRC 937 Project A13</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rehfeldt</surname><given-names>Florian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Local Mtmr2 activity and PI(3,5)P2 abundance dynamically control Piezo2-dependent mechanotransduction in peripheral sensory neurons.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Our sense of touch relies on mechanotransduction, that is the conversion of mechanical stimuli to electrical signals in primary afferent sensory neurons of the somatosensory system. Piezo2 ion channels have emerged as major somatosensory mechanotransducers and mediate rapidly adapting mechanically activated (RA-MA) currents in sensory neurons, such as those of dorsal root ganglia (DRG) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Coste et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">2012</xref>). By now it has been established that Piezo2 is crucially involved in vertebrate light touch and proprioception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Coste et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Florez-Paz et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Ranade et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Woo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Woo et al., 2014</xref>). Despite its importance, the regulation of native Piezo2 is only beginning to be elucidated. Mechanistically, several scenarios might be at play (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wu et al., 2017</xref>): direct action of phospholipids, the modulation of local membrane properties and protein-protein interactions, just to name a few. Studies on other mechanosensitive ion channels such as the family of small conductance channels (MscS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Sukharev, 2002</xref>) as well as eukaryotic TRAAK, TREK1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brohawn et al., 2014a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">2014b</xref>) and Piezo1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cox et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lewis and Grandl, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Wu et al., 2016</xref>) demonstrated their direct interplay with components of the lipid bilayer. In case of Piezo2, RA-MA currents were shown to be inhibited through depletion of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>) and phosphatidylinositol 4-monophosphate (PI(4)P) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Borbiro et al., 2015</xref>), and also by depletion of cholesterol at the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Qi et al., 2015</xref>). Besides, lipid- or cytoskeleton-induced changes in plasma membrane tension have been shown to impact somatosensory mechanotransduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jia et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Morley et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Qi et al., 2015</xref>). In contrast to the vast knowledge of the molecular network governing mechanotransduction in the nematode C. elegans, to date only few protein-protein interactions relevant for Piezo2 physiology have been identified in vertebrates. These include stomatin-like protein STOML3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Poole et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Qi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Wetzel et al., 2007</xref>), unidentified protein tethers to the extracellular matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hu et al., 2010</xref>) and Pericentrin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Narayanan et al., 2016</xref>). It is noteworthy that all of these exhibit pronounced effects on the magnitude or mechanical sensitivity of Piezo2 RA-MA currents.</p><p>In order to advance the molecular understanding of Piezo2 regulation, we recently performed an interactomics screen, which revealed several additional binding partners of native Piezo2 in murine DRG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Narayanan et al., 2016</xref>). A significantly enriched and prominent member of the Piezo2 interactome was myotubularin related protein 2 (Mtmr2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Narayanan et al., 2016</xref>), a phosphoinositide phosphatase of the MTMR family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bolino et al., 2002</xref>). Interestingly, Mtmr2 was previously described to be highly expressed in DRG sensory neurons and Schwann cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bolino et al., 2002</xref>). Functionally, Mtmr2 catalyzes the removal of a 3-phosphate group from its phosphoinositide (PIPs) substrates phosphatidylinositol 3-monophosphate PI(3)P and phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Begley et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Berger et al., 2002</xref>). Remarkably, PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> is much less abundant than most other PIPs, for example PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Zolov et al., 2012</xref>), but can be rapidly and transiently regulated by a large enzymatic protein complex in response to cellular stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">McCartney et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Vaccari et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Zolov et al., 2012</xref>). Hence, PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> is exquisitely suited to control rapid cellular signaling events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ho et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ikonomov et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Li et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">McCartney et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>), and also the activity of receptors and ion channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dong et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ho et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Klaus et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">McCartney et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">McCartney et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Tsuruta et al., 2009</xref>). Altogether, this raises the question whether Mtmr2 and its PIP substrates are implicated in Piezo2-mediated mechanotransduction and generally, in somatosensory mechanosensation.</p><p>Here, we show that Mtmr2 levels control Piezo2-mediated RA-MA currents. While elevated Mtmr2 expression attenuated Piezo2 RA-MA currents, siRNA-mediated knockdown of Mtmr2 resulted in Piezo2 RA-MA current potentiation. Interestingly, heterologously expressed Piezo1 and other known subtypes of MA currents in DRG were largely unaffected. Mechanistically, our experiments with catalytically inactive Mtmr2, pharmacological inhibitors, and osmotic stress suggest that changes in the levels of PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> regulate Piezo2 RA-MA currents. In line with these findings we uncovered a previously unknown polybasic motif in Piezo2 that can bind PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> and confers Piezo2 sensitivity to Mtmr2. Collectively, our study reveals a link between Mtmr2 activity and PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> availability to locally control Piezo2 function.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Mtmr2 suppresses Piezo2-mediated RA-MA currents</title><p>Our previous work revealed Mtmr2 as a highly enriched member of the native Piezo2 interactome in DRG (significance of identification: p=0.00030, unpaired t-test; enrichment factor: log<sub>2</sub> 9.96) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Narayanan et al., 2016</xref>).

In peripheral sensory neurons changes in cellular osmolarity cause activation of diverse ion channels and receptors followed by initiation of various signaling pathways involved in volume regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lechner et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Liu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Quallo et al., 2015</xref>).

Upon hypoosmotic stress Mtmr2 trafficking was altered and PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> levels were reported to be elevated in eukaryotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berger et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dove et al., 1997</xref>). In the case of Piezo2, hypoosmotic stress was shown to potentiate Piezo2 RA-MA currents, which was independent of the prominent osmosensor TRPV4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jia et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, we employed osmotic stress as a physiological stimulus to investigate the link between Mtmr2, PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> and Piezo2. First, we confirmed the previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jia et al., 2016</xref>) potentiation of Piezo2 RA-MA currents by application of extracellular hypotonic stress to DRG cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1c</xref>). We then postulated that an increase of PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> levels by extracellular hypotonicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berger et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dove et al., 1997</xref>) should counteract the RA-MA suppression upon Mtmr2-overexpression, which we described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1h</xref> above. Indeed, in Mtmr2 overexpressing DRG cultures we recorded significantly higher RA-MA currents under extracellular hypotonic conditions compared to isotonic conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>). Other RA-MA current parameters were unchanged (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). We then tested whether the opposite was also true: Would an expected decrease of PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> levels by intracellular hypotonicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dove et al., 1997</xref>) prevent RA-MA current sensitization upon Mtmr2 knockdown? Conceptually, this experiment is analogous to Apilimod application in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref> above, where we pharmacologically inhibited PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> production in DRG cultures. As predicted, under intracellular hypotonic conditions RA-MA currents were significantly smaller in siRNA-treated cultures compared to isotonic conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). In parallel, the displacement threshold was significantly increased, while other RA-MA current parameters remained unchanged (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). As specific probes to assess the cellular distribution of PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> are not available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hammond et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Li et al., 2013b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">McCartney et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Nicot and Laporte, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Previtali et al., 2007</xref>), we could not measure the actual levels of PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> in neurons under different osmotic conditions.

Therefore, we set out to test a possible impact of Mtmr2 knockdown upon mechanical properties of cultured DRG neurons by atomic force microscopy (AFM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Nawaz et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Qi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Rehfeldt et al., 2007</xref>). However, our experiments did not show any significant differences between <italic>Mtmr2</italic> siRNA-treated and control-treated DRG neurons. Neither the Young´s elastic modulus (an indicator for cellular elasticity including membrane tension and cortex stiffness) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Morley et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Qi et al., 2015</xref>) as determined from the indentation, nor the tether force (an indicator for membrane tension and mechanical coupling to the cortex) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Qi et al., 2015</xref>) obtained from the retraction portion of the force distance curves were altered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>).

PIPs are known to bind to proteins through various domains such as the FYVE domain, WD40 domain, PHD domain or electrostatically via poly-basic regions with unstructured clusters of positively charged amino acid residues (Lysine or Arginine) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dong et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">McCartney et al., 2014a</xref>).

We performed a peptide-lipid binding assay to test if this sequence in Piezo2 could bind to PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub>, which was indeed the case (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b,d</xref>). In addition, we also observed that the Piezo2 peptide was able to bind PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> and weakly to PI(3,4)P<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b,d</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). This is an intriguing result because Borbiro and colleagues showed that TRPV1 modulates Piezo2 currents through PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> depletion, though the study did not report a PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> binding region in the Piezo2 sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Borbiro et al., 2015</xref>). In parallel we performed the binding assay with a mutated version of the Piezo2 peptide, in which positively-charged amino acid residues shown to be relevant for PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> binding in TRPML1 were changed to neutral Glutamine (Q; Piezo2 3Q mutant; QQILQYFWMS). This mutated peptide did not bind to any lipid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b,d</xref>). The here identified PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub>-binding region in Piezo2 exhibits 50% sequence identity to Piezo1 with conservation of positively charged amino acid residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>). Therefore, we also tested whether Piezo1 was able to bind PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub>, but did not find any evidence for this (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c,d</xref>). These data suggest that not only positively charged amino acid residues, but also flanking amino acids in this Piezo2 region contribute to PIP<sub>2</sub> binding in a yet to be explored manner. Further, these in vitro binding studies substantiate our functional data on the specific link between Piezo2 and the Mtmr2 substrate PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> by identifying a PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> binding domain in Piezo2, but not in Piezo1. It is important to note that the peptide region defined here may not be the only PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> binding region in Piezo2 especially when considering the known diversity of PIP modules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dong et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">McCartney et al., 2014a</xref>).

In our study, we demonstrate that Mtmr2 limits Piezo2 MA currents, and that this effect likely involves local catalysis of PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub>. Thus, our work elucidated a link between Mtmr2 and PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> availability as a previously unappreciated mechanism how Piezo2-mediated mechanotransduction can be locally controlled in peripheral sensory neurons.</p><p>Originally, we identified Mtmr2 as a significantly enriched member of the native Piezo2 interactome in DRG neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Narayanan et al., 2016</xref>). Mtmr2 is an active phosphatase that catalyzes the removal of 3-phosphate from its substrates PI(3)P and PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub>. Hence, its subcellular localization is crucial as it dictates access to its substrates, which are embedded in membrane lipid bilayers. Interestingly, several reports suggest that membrane association of Mtmr2 is enhanced by hypotonic stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berger et al., 2003</xref>) and also by interactions with other members of the Mtmr family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kim et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ng et al., 2013</xref>). For example, Mtmr13 and Mtmr2 reciprocally control their abundance at the membrane of cultured cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ng et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Robinson and Dixon, 2005</xref>) and in uncharacterized endomembrane compartments in Schwann cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ng et al., 2013</xref>). In addition, Mtmr2 enzymatic activity is augmented through interaction with Mtmr13 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Berger et al., 2006</xref>). In this respect it is noteworthy that our interactomics screen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Narayanan et al., 2016</xref>) identified two additional Mtmr family members: Mtmr1 and Mtmr5. Mtmr1 was shown to be similar to Mtmr2 in structure and substrate specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bong et al., 2016</xref>), but is much less studied than Mtmr2. Mtmr5 is a catalytically inactive phosphatase which binds to Mtmr2, increases its enzymatic activity and controls its subcellular localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kim et al., 2003</xref>). The fact that Mtmr5 was previously reported as a binding partner of Mtmr2 further validates our published interactomics data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Narayanan et al., 2016</xref>), and hints towards the intriguing possibility that a multiprotein complex of different Mtmr family members might affect Piezo2 function. Future experiments should focus on assessing the role of these two Mtmr family members for mechanotransduction in peripheral sensory neurons.</p><p>Mechanistically, our in vitro data strongly suggest that enzymatic activity of Mtmr2 and consequently PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> availability modulates Piezo2 RA-MA currents. Several lines of evidence support this conclusion. We found that, unlike wild type Mtmr2, a catalytically inactive mutant of Mtmr2 (C417S) did not suppress Piezo2 currents in HEK293 cells. In sensory neurons expressing <italic>Mtmr2</italic> siRNA, we could counteract RA-MA current potentiation by inhibiting PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> synthesis in two ways: via Apilimod (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Laporte et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">McCartney et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mironova et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Previtali et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Vaccari et al., 2011</xref>) and via intracellular hypoosmolarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dove et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">McCartney et al., 2014a</xref>), respectively. In analogy, increasing PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> levels by extracellular hypoosmolarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berger et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dove et al., 1997</xref>) attenuated the suppression of RA-MA currents upon Mtmr2 overexpression. Here, it is important to note that Mtmr2 activity usually serves a dual function: dephosphorylation of PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> and of PI(3)P, albeit the latter with lower efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Berger et al., 2002</xref>). Yet, our results upon application of Wortmannin suggest only a marginal contribution of PI(3)P to altering Piezo2-mediated mechanotransduction. Wortmannin is commonly used to block class III PI 3-kinase (please see scheme in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>), however, it also is reported to inhibit class I PI 3-kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Messenger et al., 2015</xref>). Hence its action on class III PI 3-kinase might not have been efficient enough in our experiments. Biologically, many enzymes control PI(3)P synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Yan and Backer, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Zolov et al., 2012</xref>) and previous work on Mtmr2 has only shown minor modifications of PI(3)P levels in Mtmr2-deficient cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cao et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Vaccari et al., 2011</xref>) in line with its substrate preference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Berger et al., 2002</xref>). Moreover, our lipid-peptide binding assays demonstrated that, in a cell-free system, a distinct region in Piezo2, which is similar to the known PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub>-binding motif of TRPML1, can bind PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub>. Therefore, our data are highly indicative of a prominent involvement of the Mtmr2 substrate PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> in controlling somatosensory mechanosensitivity. Whether or not the expected change of PI(5)P after PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> catalysis (please see scheme in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>) plays a role could not be investigated due to the lack of tools and knowledge about PI(5)P-specific physiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">McCartney et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Zolov et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, the here identified PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub>-binding region is conserved among Piezo2 in vertebrates and exhibits 50% of sequence identity to mouse Piezo1 with conservation of basic amino acid residues.

It would be of high interest to determine in future studies whether other members of the Piezo family also bind PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> and are potentially regulated by Mtmr2 or its homologs. Yet, in mice the here described PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub>-binding and inhibition via Mtmr2 seemed quite specific for Piezo2 as indicated by our peptide-lipid binding assays and functional experiments on the domain-swapped Piezo2 P1 mutant. In contrast to the majority of studies on the regulation of vertebrate mechanotransduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Borbiro et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Eijkelkamp et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Morley et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Poole et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Qi et al., 2015</xref>), we did not observe alterations in Piezo1-mediated MA currents in HEK293 cells, and the magnitude of IA- and SA-MA currents was largely unaffected in DRG cultures. Surprisingly though, we detected a mild increase in the proportion of RA-MA cells paralleled by a decrease of the IA-MA subpopulation. While there is some evidence that Piezo2 might also play a role for IA-MA currents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lou et al., 2013</xref>), to date the molecular identity of IA-MA currents has not been resolved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Viatchenko-Karpinski and Gu, 2016</xref>). For that reason the interpretation of this finding awaits further clarification of the molecular nature of IA-MA currents.</p><p>In principle, the regulation of Piezo2 by lipids is not unexpected and our data significantly advance our knowledge about the link between mechanotransduction and components of the lipid bilayer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brohawn et al., 2014a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cox et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lewis and Grandl, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Sukharev, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Wu et al., 2016</xref>). In particular, PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> and its precursor PI(4)P (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Borbiro et al., 2015</xref>) as well as cholesterol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Qi et al., 2015</xref>) were recently found to be implicated in mechanotransduction mediated by both, Piezo1 and Piezo2. In contrast to PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>, our understanding of PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> function, localization and regulation is limited to date (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">McCartney et al., 2014a</xref>). PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> is much less abundant than most PIPs, for example 125-fold less than PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Zolov et al., 2012</xref>), and tightly regulated by a large protein complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Vaccari et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Zolov et al., 2012</xref>) (please see scheme in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>). PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> was believed to predominantly act in the endo-lysosome system of eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Di Paolo and De Camilli, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dong et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ho et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Zolov et al., 2012</xref>). By now the picture is emerging that PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> can serve a diverse range of cellular functions, such as autophagy, signaling in response to stress, control of membrane traffic to the plasma membrane as well as regulation of receptors and ion channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dong et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ho et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ikonomov et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Klaus et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">McCartney et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Tsuruta et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>). Moreover, depending on the cell type, PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> synthesis and metabolism are dynamically regulated and subject to cellular stimulation and stressors, for example insulin-mediated PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> changes in adipocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ikonomov et al., 2007</xref>), neuronal activity-dependent synthesis at hippocampal synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">McCartney et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>) and the here exploited regulation of PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> upon osmotic shock in mammalian cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dove et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Nicot and Laporte, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Previtali et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>These reports nourish the notion that changes of PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> via Mtmr2 might contribute to regulating Piezo2 and, by extension, touch sensitivity. How could this be achieved mechanistically? Instead of acting in a cell-wide manner, PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> synthesis and turnover is confined to membrane microdomains. Despite their unknown composition and subcellular localization, these microdomains are believed to ensure dynamic and local control of PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ho et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Jin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">McCartney et al., 2014a</xref>). Concomitantly, the abundance of downstream effector proteins is likely to be altered, as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ho et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Jin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">McCartney et al., 2014a</xref>). Mtmr2 may physically bind to Piezo2 in order to ensure its enrichment in PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> microdomains, so that local PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> changes or yet to be identified effector proteins can efficiently modulate Piezo2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, working model). In these microdomains Mtmr2 would catalytically decrease PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> levels, which in turn could inhibit Piezo2 function. Hence, a physical interaction between Mtmr2 and Piezo2 would selectively concentrate Piezo2 at the sites of PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> depletion thereby allowing its inhibition in a defined membrane compartment. On the contrary, reduced Mtmr2 expression or activity would be expected to increase local PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Laporte et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">McCartney et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mironova et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Previtali et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Vaccari et al., 2011</xref>) and facilitate Piezo2 potentiation. It is conceivable that Mtmr2-controlled PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> availability could in turn cause local changes in membrane tension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lewis and Grandl, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Perozo et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Vásquez et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wu et al., 2017</xref>). The latter has already been demonstrated to affect Piezo1 MA currents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cox et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lewis and Grandl, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Wu et al., 2016</xref>). Whether Piezo2 is also sensitive to local membrane tension and whether PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> levels indeed influence membrane tension in sensory neurons remains to be investigated. Unfortunately, local changes in membrane tension in the vicinity of Piezo2 are likely too small to be captured by our AFM-based measurements.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32346.014</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Working model: Local control of Piezo2 function by interdependent actions of Mtmr2 and PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub>.</title><p>Mtmr2 controls the abundance of PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> by dephosphorylation (please see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>). Mtmr2 and Piezo2 expression as well as PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> might be compartmentalized in membrane microdomains. Piezo2 localization in Mtmr2-negative microdomains would facilitate its access to local PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> and consequently potentiate Piezo2 RA-MA currents (left side). On the other hand, high Mtmr2 levels and its localization in the proximity of Piezo2 would augment PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> turnover, thereby decreasing local PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> availability and suppressing Piezo2 RA-MA currents (right side). One could further speculate that Mtmr2, via binding Piezo2, might recruit Piezo2 to membrane microdomains depleted of PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub>. This would provide an active mechanism to inhibit Piezo2 RA-MA currents in membrane compartments – may they be at the plasma membrane or intracellular membranes. Ultimately, Mtmr2 and PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> may contribute to dynamically tuning touch sensitivity of an organism in response to diverse conditions modulating Mtmr2 and PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> levels (e.g. osmotic stress as indicated by results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).The following questions await further clarification: (i) How are Mtmr2/PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> regulated during (patho)physiological conditions in the somatosensory system, (ii) does the modulation of RA-MA currents require additional yet to be identified effector proteins, and (iii) are other PIPs also involved, for example PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> shown to modulate Piezo2 function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Borbiro et al., 2015</xref>)? As the structure of Piezo2 has not been resolved yet, Piezo2 is depicted after the recently solved structure of Piezo1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ge et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Guo and MacKinnon, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Saotome et al., 2018</xref>). If this structure holds also true for Piezo2, the PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> binding domain (depicted in green) would roughly be localized within the first third of the N-terminal blade.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-32346-fig6-v2"/></fig><p>Nevertheless, the data presented here allow us to infer an attractive mechanism exquisitely suited for transient and compartmentalized control of Piezo2 function, that is physical vicinity to Mtmr2, the activity status of Mtmr2 and consequently PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> availability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). We can further speculate that this local control of Piezo2 function may serve to tune the threshold and magnitude of neuronal activity to light touch. Ultimately, Mtmr2 and PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> may represent a means by which touch sensitivity of an organism can be dynamically adjusted in response to diverse stimuli modulating Mtmr2 and PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). In this respect it is noteworthy that multiple Mtmr2 mutations – including those affecting its activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Berger et al., 2002</xref>) – have been implicated in Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 4B1 (CMT4B1) disease, a peripheral neuropathy characterized by abnormalities in myelination and nerve conduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bolino et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bolis et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bonneick et al., 2005</xref>). An analysis of Piezo2 mechanotransduction, light touch as well as tactile hypersensitivity in Mtmr2 knockout (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bolino et al., 2004</xref>) and Mtmr2 mutant mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bonneick et al., 2005</xref>) would be warranted to thoroughly examine the potential role of Mtmr2 for (patho)physiological aspects of vertebrate mechanosensation.</p><p>Several important questions remain to be investigated. While we identified a PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> binding motif in Piezo2 in vitro, we can neither gauge the affinity of the fully assembled Piezo2 trimer for PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> nor assess whether PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> and Mtmr2 bind allosterically, competitively or independently of each other. Moreover, our peptide-lipid binding assay shows that the extremely abundant PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> and to a lesser extent PI(3,4)P<sub>2</sub> could bind the same motif as PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub>. This raises the question how PIP<sub>2</sub> specificity can be achieved by Piezo2 when embedded in cellular membranes. Piezo2 might be differentially localized in membranes dependent on PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> levels and Mtmr2 abundance. We did not observe any differences in the overall abundance of Piezo2 channels at the plasma membrane of sensory neurons. Yet, given that PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> acts in membrane microdomains, it would be desirable to visualize whether Piezo2 is localized in subcellular membrane compartments, that is (i) in PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub>-enriched versus PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub>-depleted and/or (ii) Mtmr2-harboring versus Mtmr2-negative microdomains. It remains to be seen whether these membrane compartments are confined to the plasma membrane and/or to intracellular membranes such as endo-lysosomes, which are known to contain the majority of PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Di Paolo and De Camilli, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dong et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Zolov et al., 2012</xref>). Along these lines it is worth mentioning that AMPA receptor abundance at hippocampal synapses has been shown to be regulated by PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub>-controlled cycling through early and late endosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">McCartney et al., 2014b</xref>). While unknown so far, localization of Piezo2 to intracellular membranes would not be unexpected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Coste et al., 2010</xref>) since its family member Piezo1 has originally been described to reside in the endoplasmic reticulum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">McHugh et al., 2010</xref>). Thus, exploring endocytosis and intracellular trafficking of Piezo2 may offer novel insights into its regulation by the intracellular membrane pool of PI(3,5)P2.</p><p>To address some of these issues the development of high-affinity Mtmr2 and Piezo2 antibodies as well as PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub>-specific probes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hammond et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Li et al., 2013b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">McCartney et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Nicot and Laporte, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Previtali et al., 2007</xref>), which faithfully represent their subcellular spatial and temporal dynamics, would be required. In contrast to PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>, such probes have not yet been successfully designed for PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub>, and the value of the few existing probes is questionable due to spatial restrictions and limited specificity for PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hammond et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Li et al., 2013b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">McCartney et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Nicot and Laporte, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Previtali et al., 2007</xref>). Future studies using these tools combined with high-resolution microscopy have the potential to address fundamental aspects of Piezo2 trafficking, localization, and function.</p><p>Taken together, our data present Mtmr2 as a novel modulator of the mechanosensory apparatus, and we provide evidence for the functional convergence of Mtmr2 enzymatic activity and PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> availability onto Piezo2-mediated mechanotransduction in peripheral sensory neurons. In essence, we propose the Mtmr2-Piezo2 interaction as a previously unappreciated mechanism to locally and dynamically regulate Piezo2 function and, consequently, the organism´s response to light tough. Therefore, our study significantly advances our understanding of the complex molecular machinery underlying somatosensory mechanosensitivity in vertebrates.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

In brief, DRG neurons were promptly isolated and digested with collagenase (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Germany) and papain (Worthington, Lakewood, USA). Neurons were plated on poly-D-lysine (1 mg/mL, Merck Millipore, Germany) coated coverslips, which were additionally coated with laminin (20 µg/mL, Thermo Fisher Scientific).

Briefly, (protocol adapted from [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Coste et al., 2010</xref>]) to elicit mechanically activated currents, the cell soma was mechanically stimulated using a blunt probe (fire polished borosilicate glass capillary). The stimulation was delivered using a piezo-electrically driven micromanipulator (Physik Instrumente GmbH and Co.KG, Germany). The probe was initially positioned ~4 µm from the cell body and had a velocity of 0.8 µm/ms during the ramp phase (forward motion). The stimulus was applied for 150 ms with an inter-stimulus interval of 180 ms. Stimulus-current measurements were performed using mechanical stimulations from 0 to 6 µm in 1 µm increments at a holding potential of −70 mV in whole cell mode. All recordings other than specifically indicated were made in standard extracellular solution containing (in mM) 127 NaCl, 3 KCl, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 2.5 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 Glucose and 10 HEPES; pH = 7.3; osmolarity = 285 mOsm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Coste et al., 2010</xref>).

Based on protocols published elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jia et al., 2016</xref>) recordings in extracellular hypotonic solutions were performed as follows: Cells were incubated with the hypotonic solution for 5 min at 37°C prior to recording, after which RA-MA currents were recorded in hypotonic extracellular solution between 0–20 min after initial application. For some experiments described in this study, DRG neurons were treated with chemical inhibitors of the phosphatidylinositol phosphate pathway. Cells were treated with 35 µM Wortmannin (Sigma Aldrich; protocol adapted from [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Mo et al., 2009</xref>]) in DMSO or 1 µM Apilimod (Bertin Pharma, Germany ; protocol adapted from [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mironova et al., 2016</xref>]) in DMSO for 2 hr prior to recording. DMSO (0.08% for Apilimod and 0.35% for Wortmannin), was used as vehicle for each experiment. For PIP addition experiments, 1 µM PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> (Echelon) or 1 µM PI(3)P (Echelon) were included in the isotonic intracellular solution (protocol adapted from [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dong et al., 2010</xref>]).

The latter analysis (data not shown) yielded similar results as the presented analysis based on current amplitudes for all DRG datasets in this manuscript. IA currents were randomly recorded across all neuron sizes.</p><p>Of note, current amplitudes and displacement thresholds cannot be compared among experimental datasets because of differential treatments (e.g. nucleofection, inhibitors) requiring measurements at different culture days in vitro (DIV), and due to the inherent variability in DRG cultures dependent on mouse cohorts used throughout the course of this study. For this reason each dataset consists of experiments and respective controls measured in parallel (i) in the same mouse cohort and (ii), where possible, on each experimental day. For each dataset (experimental versus control conditions) several coverslips from at least 4 (range: 4–18) independent cell cultures or 2–12 independent platings of HEK293 cells were used.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Immunostaining and analysis</title><p>Immunostaining was carried out as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Narayanan et al., 2016</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Richard Aldrich as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>All three reviewers appreciated, very much, the concept of investigating membrane modulators of Piezos, which they consider as significant and timely. However, they raised strong concerns on your skin-nerve and behavior experiments.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript reports a mechanism by which mechanically-activated Piezo2 ion channels are modulated by myotubularin-related protein-2 (Mtmr2) and PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub>. Whereas Mtmr2 is a protein the same group recently identified as a novel interaction partner of Piezo2, the work here uncovers the functional significance. The data show that Mtmr2 through PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> production regulates Piezo2 currents in HEK293 cells and DRG neurons, and present evidence for a binding site on Piezo2 for cellular PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub>.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Overall, the area of work is of interest for the mechanotransduction field, as relatively little mechanistic information is known about how changes in the lipid membrane can affect somatosensation or how mechanotransduction channels are modulated. In addition to that, Mtmr2 has not been studied and the modulation of Piezo2 after injury is not well understood.</p><p>However, in its current form, although the manuscript is well written, it is difficult to conceptualize the mechanism that is proposed.

Remarkably, MA currents mediated by the Piezo2 P1 mutant were only slightly attenuated upon co-expression with Mtmr2 compared to mock-transfected controls (Figure 5D). Also, the displacement threshold and inactivation time constant (τ) of MA currents remained unchanged (Supplementary file 1).

Unfortunately, we could not obtain any functional recordings of RA-MA currents from this mutant despite intensive efforts, i.e. we tried to record from &gt;40 cells from &gt;7 independent transfections. To exclude any technical issues with recordings, we included the Piezo1 wildtype plasmid as a positive control (the same, which was used in Figure 1—figure supplement 2) and managed to successfully record RA-MA currents in parallel. To assess whether issues with the Piezo1 P2 mutant clone itself might be responsible for the lack of functionality we fully sequenced the Piezo1 P2 mutant, and additionally recloned the mutated region into a non-mutated backbone of pcDNA3.1 Piezo1-IRES-GFP. However, we did not obtain a functional Piezo1 P2 clone as assessed by electrophysiology.</p><p>Hence, despite all our efforts, we are not able to provide this dataset in our revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) For the lipid binding data that are key to the paper, more quantification should be performed, since large batch to batch variability is a common issue and relying on a representative of n=3 is not very rigorous.

Therefore, we (i) added more experimental repetitions using both Piezo2 peptides, (ii) combined these experiments with lipid binding assays using Piezo1 in parallel on the same day (please see our reply to point 2 above), and (iii) added a statistical evaluation for all experiments. Of note, these additional experiments also uncovered weak, but statistically significant binding of the Piezo2 peptide to PI(3,4)P<sub>2</sub>. Taken together, these data suggest that not only positively charged amino acid residues, but also flanking amino acids in this Piezo2 PIP binding region contribute to PIP<sub>2</sub> binding in a yet to be explored manner. Further, these in vitro binding studies substantiate our functional data on the specific link between Piezo2 and the Mtmr2 substrate PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> by identifying a PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> binding domain in Piezo2, but not in Piezo1.</p><p>These data are included and discussed in the revised manuscript: Figure 5B–D; Figure 5—figure supplement 1; Subsection “Piezo2 harbors a PIP2 binding motif”; Discussion section.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining minor issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below.

In the revised version of the manuscript we included a critical evaluation of PLA results in transfected HEK293 cells.</p><p>Results section: “For a more detailed subcellular analysis we used the proximity ligation assay (PLA). In this way we could show the close vicinity of Piezo2 and Mtmr2 in both, somata and neurites of cultured DRG neurons, and upon co-transfection in HEK293 cells (Figure 1A–D and Figure 1—figure supplement 1C,D). It is important to note here that the PLA technique is prone to high background upon heterologous expression as shown by our additional control experiments in HEK293 cells (Figure 1—figure supplement 1D). In these we co-overexpressed Piezo2 with TRPA1 and Vti1b, respectively. Both of these controls exhibited clear PLA signal (likely attributable to massive overexpression upon transfection), though less than co-overexpression with Mtmr2 (Figure 1—figure supplement 1D).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> is thought to be mainly in intracellular membranes.

Along these lines it is worth mentioning that AMPA receptor abundance at hippocampal synapses has been shown to be regulated by PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub>-controlled cycling through early and late endosomes (McCartney et al., 2014). While unknown so far, localization of Piezo2 to intracellular membranes would not be unexpected (Coste et al., 2010) since its family member Piezo1 has originally been described to reside in the endoplasmic reticulum (McHugh et al., 2010). Thus, exploring endocytosis and intracellular trafficking of Piezo2 may offer novel insights into its regulation by the intracellular membrane pool of PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub>.</p><p>Figure legend 6: “This would provide an active mechanism to inhibit Piezo2 RA-MA currents in membrane compartments – may they be at the plasma membrane or intracellular membranes.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
