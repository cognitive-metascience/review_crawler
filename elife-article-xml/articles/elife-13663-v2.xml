assembly of multi-protein complexes called inflammasomes that are responsible for initiating pro-inflammatory responses and a form of cell death termed pyroptosis. We describe here the identification of an intracellular trigger of NLRP3-mediated inflammatory signaling, IL-1β production and pyroptosis in primed murine bone marrow-derived macrophages that is mediated by the disruption of glycolytic flux. This signal results from a drop of NADH levels and induction of mitochondrial ROS production and can be rescued by addition of products that restore NADH production. This signal is also important for host-cell response to the intracellular pathogen <italic>Salmonella typhimurium</italic>, which can disrupt metabolism by uptake of host-cell glucose. These results reveal an important inflammatory signaling network used by immune cells to sense metabolic dysfunction or infection by intracellular pathogens.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.13663.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.13663.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13663.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cells of the innate immune system, such as macrophages, are the body’s first line of defense against infection. Macrophages can sense a wide variety of danger signals associated with the presence of infectious microbes, and some of these signals cause macrophages to form protein complexes called inflammasomes inside the cell. Inflammasomes produce molecules that stimulate inflammation and trigger the death of the macrophage. This attracts other immune cells to the infection site to help combat the source of danger.</p><p>Inflammasome complexes form around an activated receptor molecule called NLRP3. NLRP3 is activated by a range of danger signals, including those produced by <italic>Salmonella</italic> bacteria. However, the sequence of events that leads to NLRP3 activation is still not well understood.</p><p>Sanman et al. have now identified a small molecule that unexpectedly causes the formation of inflammasomes via NLRP3 and so triggers the death of macrophages. Further investigation revealed that this molecule disrupts glycolysis, a process macrophages use to produce energy. The energy imbalance caused by disrupting glycolysis triggers a stress response in macrophages, which ultimately activates the NLRP3 receptor and hence the inflammasome.</p><p>Sanman et al. then found that <italic>Salmonella</italic> bacteria also activate the inflammasome by disrupting glycolysis when they invade macrophages. This occurs because the bacteria use up the macrophage’s supply of glycolysis precursor molecules. Replenishing the macrophage with products of glycolysis restored partial energy production and prevented the inflammasome from being activated.</p><p>Overall, Sanman et al. have identified a previously unknown trigger of inflammation and cell death in macrophages whereby cells can respond to infectious bacteria by sensing a change in energy levels. A next step will be to define the signaling molecules that activate NLRP3 to trigger the construction of the inflammasome. Sanman et al. also hope to uncover other infections and diseases where changes in energy balance might trigger inflammation and cell death.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.13663.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.13663.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>Salmonella typhimurium</kwd><kwd>inflammasome</kwd><kwd>glycolysis</kwd><kwd>pyroptosis</kwd><kwd>NLRP3</kwd><kwd>Caspase-1</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 EB005011, R01 CA179253</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bogyo</surname><given-names>Matthew</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DGE-114747</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sanman</surname><given-names>Laura E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001021</institution-id><institution>Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DRR-18-12</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Weerapana</surname><given-names>Eranthie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 AI063302, R01 AI065359</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Monack</surname><given-names>Denise M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A signal for inflammatory cell death is induced by the disruption of cellular metabolism.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Inflammation is an immunological process required for an organized response to infection, injury, and stress. Because excessive inflammation can be damaging, its initiation is highly regulated. Innate immune cells such as macrophages have evolved sensors of pathogens and homeostatic perturbations which, when activated, induce an immune response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Medzhitov, 2008</xref>). Amongst these sensors are Nod-like receptors (NLRs), which are activated in response to a diverse set of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). Activated NLR proteins recruit and facilitate activation of the protease caspase-1 either directly, through caspase activation and recruitment domain (CARD) interactions, or indirectly, through the adaptor apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD (ASC; also known as <italic>Pycard</italic>). The resulting macromolecular complex is referred to as the inflammasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lamkanfi and Dixit, 2014</xref>). The inactive precursor of the cytokine interleukin-1β (pro-IL-1β) is also recruited to the inflammasome complex, where proteolysis by caspase-1 induces activation and secretion of the bioactive cytokine, further promoting inflammation. In addition to cytokine maturation, inflammasome formation and caspase activation are associated with a pro-inflammatory form of cell death termed pyroptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fink and Cookson, 2006</xref>). This form of cell death results in lytic release of cytosolic contents and other pro-inflammatory factors such as interleukin-1α and high-mobility group protein B1 (HMGB1), which are potent inducers of inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Medzhitov, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Croker et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Diverse activation signals have been reported as triggers of NLR signaling. For example, the NLR AIM2 is activated by cytosolic double-stranded DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lamkanfi and Dixit, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fernandes-Alnemri et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hornung et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bürckstümmer et al., 2009</xref>), a structural feature associated with infections with pathogens and not found in healthy host cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fink and Cookson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hornung et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jones et al., 2010</xref>). The NLR NLRP3 is a sensor of a wide variety of PAMPs and DAMPs but the unifying mechanism of its disparate activators is not understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sutterwala et al., 2014</xref>). Furthermore, while the NLRP3 signaling pathway can be activated by a variety of both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, the mechanism by which these pathogens induce inflammasome signaling through this receptor is often unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Storek and Monack, 2015</xref>). Specifically, effective defense against <italic>Salmonella typhimurium (S. typhimurium)</italic> requires NLRP3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Broz et al., 2010</xref>), yet the mechanism by which the pathogen activates this pathway remains unknown.</p><p>Here, we report a small molecule, GB111-NH<sub>2</sub>, that induces NLRP3 inflammasome formation, caspase-1 activation, IL-1β secretion, and pyroptotic cell death in bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM). Using chemical proteomics, we identify the glycolytic enzymes GAPDH and α-enolase as the phenotypically relevant targets of this molecule. Facilitating TCA metabolism downstream of glycolysis by addition of pyruvate or succinate blocked the effects of the compound. We find that <italic>S. typhimurium</italic> infection, like direct chemical inhibition of the glycolytic enzymes, reduced glycolytic flux and that restoring metabolism downstream of glycolysis also prevented <italic>S. typhimurium</italic>-induced inflammasome formation, IL-1β secretion, and pyroptosis. We find that glycolytic disruption induced by either the small molecules or <italic>S. typhimurium</italic> infection impaired NADH production, resulting in the formation of mitochondrial ROS that were essential for NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Therefore, disruption of glycolytic flux is a biologically relevant trigger of NLRP3 inflammasome activation that is mediated by mitochondrial redox changes, revealing a mechanistic link between cellular metabolism and initiation of inflammation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Identification of a small molecule activator of inflammasome formation and pyroptosis</title><p>While screening peptide-based compounds for their effects on inflammasome signaling, we identified one compound, GB111-NH<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Blum et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Verdoes et al., 2012</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), that was sufficient to induce caspase-1 activation in LPS-primed bone marrow-derived macrophages.

Formation of these foci was dependent on NLRP3 and ASC but not caspase-1, caspase-11, NLRC4, or AIM2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E–F</xref>). We observed that GB111-NH<sub>2</sub> induced a similar level of IL-1β secretion as the NLRP3 stimuli ATP and nigericin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>) and that the absence of NLRP3 completely abrogated IL-1β secretion induced by GB111-NH<sub>2</sub> treatment. The absence of other NLRs, specifically NLRC4 and AIM2, had no effect on IL-1β secretion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). Taken together, these data indicate that GB111-NH<sub>2</sub> induces caspase-1 activation and IL-1β secretion solely through the NLRP3 inflammasome, acting as an activating ‘Signal II’ for the canonical NLRP3 pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lamkanfi and Dixit, 2014</xref>).</p><p>In order for ‘Signal II’ to activate the NLRP3 inflammasome, BMDM must first be primed by a ‘Signal I’ such as LPS. LPS priming induces NF-κB-dependent transcription of pro-inflammatory genes such as IL-1β and inflammasome-independent secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and TNF-α (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lamkanfi and Dixit, 2014</xref>). We measured lysate protein levels by Western blotting and supernatant cytokine levels by ELISA in BMDM treated as in previously described experiments; first primed for 3 hr with LPS and then treated for 2 hr with GB111-NH<sub>2</sub>. We observed the appearance of pro-IL-1β upon LPS priming (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>) but there was no effect of GB111-NH<sub>2</sub> on either IL-1β protein levels in BMDM that had received LPS priming (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). In addition, IL-6 secretion decreased with increasing dose of GB111-NH<sub>2</sub> and TNF-α secretion was unaffected by GB111-NH<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Therefore, GB111-NH<sub>2</sub> does not have a direct effect on Signal I, but functions predominantly as a Signal II for the NLRP3 inflammasome.</p><p>Macrophages containing active inflammasome complexes often rapidly die by a pro-inflammatory process called pyroptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fink and Cookson, 2006</xref>). We observed features of this form of cell death in GB111-NH<sub>2</sub>-treated BMDM, including release of the intracellular enzyme lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>), and foci of caspase-1 activity in propidium iodide (PI) and Annexin V (AnnV) positive cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref>). These data confirm that GB111-NH<sub>2</sub> is a small molecule activator of the NLRP3 inflammasome that also triggers pyroptotic cell death.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Identification of the phenotypically relevant targets of GB111-NH<sub>2</sub></title><p>Given that GB111-NH<sub>2</sub> is chemically distinct from other known activators of NLRP3 and easily modifiable, we wanted to use it as a tool to identify protein targets that are involved in triggering this pro-inflammatory response. To accomplish this, we first conducted a small structure-activity relationship (SAR) study in which we synthesized a series of analogs of GB111-NH<sub>2</sub> to identify compounds that could be used for affinity isolation of labeled targets. We identified a number of modifications to the primary compound scaffold that resulted in loss of activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), suggesting that the effects of the parent compound are likely dictated by affinity to specific protein targets. Importantly, our SAR efforts identified both an inactive analog (GB-IA) as well as an azide-containing analog (az-GB) that retained the inflammasome-activating ability of GB111-NH<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Pretreatment with GB111-NH<sub>2</sub> blocked az-GB binding to both GAPDH and α-enolase in a dose-dependent manner, indicating that both compounds bind to similar sites on their enzyme targets. The GB111-NH<sub>2</sub> analog containing a more reactive phenoxymethylketone electrophile (compound 6), which also induced IL-1β secretion more potently in cells than GB111-NH<sub>2</sub>, also blocked az-GB binding to both GAPDH and α-enolase at lower concentrations compared to GB111-NH<sub>2</sub>. Importantly, the analogs that did not induce IL-1β secretion in BMDM, compound 2 (which lacks the AOMK electrophile) and GB-IA (which lacks the carboxybenzyl cap of GB111-NH<sub>2</sub>), did not compete for az-GB binding to GAPDH and α-enolase.

To further investigate the proposed covalent interaction of GB111-NH<sub>2</sub> with reactive cysteine residues in GAPDH and α-enolase, we performed competition studies with the general cysteine reative probe iodoacetamide fluorescein (IAF). IAF labeled both GAPDH and α-enolase, consistent with previous reactive cysteine profiling data demonstrating that the catalytic Cys 152 of GAPDH is highly reactive and Cys 388, an active-site proximal cysteine of α-enolase, is also reactive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Weerapana et al., 2010</xref>). NEM potently blocked IAF labeling, confirming that IAF was reacting with cysteine residues in GAPDH and α-enolase.

To confirm that binding of our compounds to these enzymes also inhibits enzyme activity, we performed substrate assays with recombinant GAPDH and α-enolase and found that GB111-NH<sub>2</sub> dose-dependently inhibited turnover of the respective substrates, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate and 2-phosphoglycerate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). GB-IA did not significantly inhibit GAPDH but did exhibit modest inhibitory activity towards α-enolase. GB111-NH<sub>2</sub> also showed time-dependent inhibition of GAPDH and α-enolase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>), suggesting that it is acting as an irreversible inhibitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Singh et al., 2011</xref>). Taken together, these data indicate that GB111-NH<sub>2</sub> binds covalently to reactive cysteine residues in both GAPDH and α-enolase and that binding to these cysteine residues inhibits enzyme activity.</p><p>Because GAPDH activity was recently shown to determine flux through aerobic glycolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pietzke et al., 2014</xref>), we hypothesized that our compounds were activating NLRP3 by disrupting glycolytic flux. Productive glycolysis results in conversion of NAD+ to NADH, secretion of lactate, and ATP production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). To first test the hypothesis that GB111-NH<sub>2</sub>, KA, and EB block glycolytic flux we measured the ratio of NAD+/NADH, lactate production, and intracellular ATP concentration in inhibitor-treated BMDM. LPS stimulation, which up-regulates glycolysis in macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Krawczyk et al., 2010</xref>), resulted in an increase in NADH levels (demonstrated by a decrease in NAD+/NADH ratio) and an increase in lactate secretion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B–D</xref>). GB111-NH<sub>2</sub> treatment completely blocked the lactate and NADH production induced by LPS stimulation, indicating that it directly impaired LPS-induced glycolytic flux (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B–D</xref>). ATP production was also significantly impaired in LPS-primed BMDM upon GB111-NH<sub>2</sub> treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Notably, treatment with the NLRP3 activator nigericin did not reduce NADH levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>), indicating that the metabolic disruption that we observed with GB111-NH<sub>2</sub> is not a general feature of inflammasome activation and cell death. The GAPDH and α-enolase inhibitors KA and EB also affected metrics of glycolytic flux (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B–D</xref>). Finally, GB111-NH<sub>2</sub> suppressed the increase in extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) induced by glucose stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). 2DG, a glycolytic inhibitor that targets hexokinase, did not dramatically impair glycolytic flux (as measured by NADH production and lactate secretion) and did not induce inflammasome formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). This indicates that severe limitation of glycolytic flux is required to activate the NLRP3 inflammasome. Furthermore, these results are in accord with recent studies showing that inhibiting GAPDH, and not enzymes in upper glycolysis, is flux-limiting in highly glycolytic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Shestov et al., 2014</xref>). Inhibitors of the TCA cycle and pentose-phosphate pathways (AA5 and 6-AN, respectively), carbohydrate metabolism pathways that are closely tied to glycolysis, also had no effect on lactate secretion or NADH production in LPS-primed BMDM and did not induce IL-1β secretion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13663.013</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Inhibition of glycolytic flux creates a unique metabolic defect that activates the NLRP3 inflammasome.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Map of relevant metabolic pathways.

To test whether either of these signals is important, we manipulated the NAD+/NADH and ATP levels downstream of glycolysis by chemically blocking specific components of the TCA cycle and oxidative phosphorylation. We first treated LPS-primed BMDM with GB111-NH<sub>2</sub> and pyruvate to block glycolysis and stimulate downstream metabolism. We then added the succinate dehydrogenase (TCA cycle enzyme) inhibitor AA5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Miyadera et al., 2003</xref>) to reduce NADH levels, the Complex I inhibitor rotenone to increase NADH levels and reduce ATP production, or the ATP synthase inhibitor Oligomycin A to only inhibit ATP synthesis by oxidative phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A–B</xref>). We found that AA5 addition partially reversed the protection conferred by pyruvate, as demonstrated by an increase in the number of inflammasome complexes. Rotenone treatment suppressed inflammasome formation more than pyruvate alone. Oligomycin A induced a small but statistically insignificant increase in the number of inflammasomes that formed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). The number of inflammasomes positively correlated with a drop in NADH production (an increase in NAD+/NADH ratio) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>), while ATP concentration exhibited no correlation with the numbers of inflammasomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>).

While inflammasome formation and pyroptotic cell death are critical for fighting infection and also contribute to inflammation in diseases including type II diabetes, obesity, and atherosclerosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kuemmerle-Deschner et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">2012</xref>), the signals that trigger caspase-1 activation remain poorly understood. In this study, we used a small molecule, GB111-NH<sub>2</sub>, to identify two glycolytic enzymes that regulate inflammasome formation. When functionally blocked, innate immune cells sense metabolic perturbation as a danger signal, resulting in inflammasome formation, caspase-1 activation, and cytokine secretion. Our results using this molecule and other established inhibitors of these enzymes suggest that disrupting glycolytic flux serves as a trigger for inflammation and cell death in macrophages. Disturbance of glycolytic flux by the intracellular pathogen <italic>S. typhimurium</italic> similarly results in inflammasome formation and pyroptotic cell death in an effort to clear the pathogen. Restoration of metabolism downstream of glycolytic disruption by GB111-NH<sub>2</sub> or <italic>S. typhimurium</italic> infection was sufficient to abrogate the inflammasome response by restoring NADH production and preventing mitochondrial ROS production.</p><p>Though the enzymes and metabolites involved in glycolysis are well established, the specific mechanisms that limit glycolytic flux are not well understood. The irreversible reactions within glycolysis, catalyzed by hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, and pyruvate kinase, were historically thought to be rate limiting. However, recent metabolite flux analyses have also suggested that flux through GAPDH, the enzyme separating upper and lower glycolysis, is rate-limiting under nutrient-rich conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Shestov et al., 2014</xref>). Under similar conditions, we also observed that targeting GAPDH or enzymes in lower glycolysis is sufficient to disrupt glycolytic flux and activate the NLRP3 inflammasome. Conversely, targeting entry into glycolysis using 2DG was not sufficient to disrupt glycolysis in highly glycolytic cells, as has previously been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pietzke et al., 2014</xref>), or to activate NLRP3. This reaffirms previous observations that the pre-existing metabolic state of the cell and the point of intervention are equally important for effectively limiting glycolytic flux (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sengupta et al., 2013</xref>).

Two inflammasome complexes, NLRP3 and NLRC4, are required to fully combat infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Broz et al., 2010</xref>). The NLRC4 inflammasome responds to a clear pathogen-associated molecular pattern presented by <italic>S. typhimurium</italic>—cytosolic flagellin and type 3 secretion system components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zhao et al., 2011</xref>). Here, we provide evidence that NLRP3 activation results in response to another effect of <italic>S. typhimurium</italic> colonization of the host cell, namely disruption of host cell glycolytic metabolism. This could explain a recent study showing that mutants of <italic>S. typhimurium</italic> defective for the TCA cycle enzyme aconitase induce a more rapid NLRP3-dependent immune response in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wynosky-Dolfi et al., 2014</xref>). We reason that aconitase deficiency would force <italic>S. typhimurium</italic> to rely even more heavily on glycolysis to survive within the host. These <italic>S. typhimurium</italic> mutants would likely disrupt cellular glycolysis more quickly and thus activate NLRP3 more rapidly. It is also interesting that, in long-term models of <italic>S. typhimurium</italic> infection, the bacteria preferentially resides within alternatively activated or ‘M2’ macrophages, which primarily utilize oxidative metabolism rather than glycolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Eisele et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, the macrophages in which <italic>Salmonella</italic> survives the longest are those in which host metabolic pathways are minimally perturbed, enabling prolonged infection without invoking an inflammasome response.</p><p>These findings additionally shed light on recent work highlighting the connection between metabolic changes and immune system activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Blatnik et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chawla et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Young et al., 1984</xref>). For example, metabolic sensing by immune cells has been recently shown to drive NLRP3-dependent IL-1β release and inflammation in diseases ranging from type II diabetes and obesity to Muckle-Wells syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kuemmerle-Deschner et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Strowig et al., 2012</xref>), though the specific mechanisms driving macrophage and NLRP3 activation in these diseases have remained unclear. We speculate that, since glucose metabolism is often impaired in these diseases, glycolytic impairment may be the mechanism driving NLRP3-dependent inflammation. Restoring glycolysis or downstream TCA cycle metabolism through supplementation with specific metabolites or activation of glycolytic enzymes could be therapeutically useful for dampening inflammation and associated immunopathology.</p><p>In summary, our results suggest that inhibition of glycolysis creates a unique metabolic state that activates the NLRP3 inflammasome. They suggest that innate immune cells sense perturbed metabolite production and flux through the glycolytic pathway, in turn activating NLRP3 to initiate inflammatory responses. Inhibitors of flux-limiting enzymes and <italic>S. typhimurium</italic> effectively limited glycolysis through distinct mechanisms, each resulting in NLRP3-mediated inflammasome formation and pyroptosis. Glycolytic disruption may be a broadly relevant mechanism of NLRP3 activation triggered in response to metabolic parasitism by microbes. Moreover, this pathway may also provide novel avenues for treating diseases in which NLRP3-driven inflammation results in pathology.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Compound information</title><p>See below for synthesis and characterization of GB111-NH<sub>2</sub> and analogs.

For microscopy experiments, at least four fields of view were generally analyzed – covering the four quadrants of the cover slip. Within each quadrant, a field was chosen at random using the DAPI channel (to simply find a region that contained cells). Each field of view was counted as a technical replicate because it was a separate measurement of a singly seeded culture. When ascertaining whether differences between samples were statistically significant, an unpaired, two-tailed t test was used. This makes the assumptions that the two samples under analysis were approximately normally distributed and had equal variances. p&lt;0.05 was considered significant.

responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Disruption of glycolytic flux is a signal for NLRP3 inflammasome formation and pyroptosis&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been favorably evaluated by Charles Sawyers (Senior editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The manuscript by Sanman and colleagues describes the discovery that disruption of glycolysis, either by chemical probes or pathogen infection, activates the NLRP3 inflammasome of macrophages. The initial findings were made using a small-molecule phenotypic screen, which furnished a covalent ligand that blocks GAPDH and enolase activity. This compound, as well as other GAPDH and enolase inhibitors, promoted NLRP3 inflammasome formation, and this effect was blocked by treating cells with the glycolytic end product pyruvate. Further studies indicate that reductions in NADH are important for promoting NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Similar effects were also observed in macrophages infected with <italic>Salmonella typhimurium</italic>, which appears to impair macrophage glycolysis by consuming host glucose.</p><p>The reviewers agreed that your manuscript reports novel findings of potentially sufficient general interest for eventual publication at <italic>eLife</italic>. However, two major concerns were raised that must be addressed with additional experiments.</p><p>1) Both Reviewers 1 and 2 expressed concern about the target identification experiments for GB111-NH<sub>2</sub>. More evidence to support how GB111-NH<sub>2</sub> interacts with GAPDH and enolase-1 to apparently inhibit these proteins, for instance, would benefit the manuscript. Likewise, the use of additional inactive control probes could be helpful (e.g., probes that are structurally related to GB111-NH<sub>2</sub>, but not reactive, which would support that a covalent mechanism of target binding is required for the observed pharmacological effects).</p><p>2) A more thorough characterization of the effects of GB111-NH<sub>2</sub> and comparison compounds on the metabolism and inflammatory responses (e.g., IL-1β secretion) of cells would strengthen the paper, as noted in more detail by Reviewer 3.</p><p><italic>Reviewer 1:</italic></p><p>1) The target identification and validation for GB111-NH<sub>2</sub> was difficult for this Reviewer to follow. More details on how the final candidate target list (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Supplementary file 3</xref>) was generated would be helpful (e.g., what filter were used to designate these proteins as targets over other proteins identified in their proteomic experiments). Also, the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> are confusing – this Reviewer had difficulty noting any substantive change in az-GB labeling of GAPDH in the GB111-NH<sub>2</sub> competition lane. Likewise, why is there a background signal in the DMSO lanes for both enzymes? Perhaps this relates to non-specific reactivity of the TAMRA-alkyne tag with the proteins, since click reactions run in the orientation used by the authors are known to exhibit some background reactivity. This point should be clarified. The authors should also consider performing a quantitative, concentration-dependent analysis of GB111-NH<sub>2</sub> blockade of az-GB labeling of GAPDH and Eno1, which might better convince readers that these chemical probes are competitively binding/reacting with the same site on each enzyme.</p><p>2) Somewhat related to point 1, the authors state in the subsection “Inhibition of glycolytic enzymes activates the NLRP3 inflammasome and induces 139 pyroptosis” that both GAPDH and enolase have &quot;key catalytic site cysteine residues&quot;. This Reviewer knows that GAPDH uses a conserved cysteine for catalysis, but was not aware that enolase depends on cysteine residues for activity. Could the authors clarify this statement as relates to enolase and cite relevant papers showing the importance of one or more active-site cysteines in enolase. This is important, since the authors do not appear to directly identify the site of GB111-NH<sub>2</sub> reactivity in either enzyme.</p><p><italic>Reviewer 2:</italic></p><p>Although not explicitly stated in the manuscript, the method used to identify cellular targets of GB111-NH<sub>2</sub> is heavily biased towards the identification of proteins that are covalently modified by the small molecule. Therefore, potential cellular targets making non-covalent interactions with GB111-NH<sub>2</sub> are likely missed. This should be stated clearly in the text, and is a limitation of the analysis.</p><p>The cellular effects of GB111-NH<sub>2</sub> are compared against those of published GADPH and α-enolase inhibitors. It is unclear to me if these compounds are selective and properly validated- the data in the references I can find is quite limited. Would be good to clarify this with additional data or text.</p><p>The 'inactive compound' still appears to be active against α-enolase (only 2-3 fold less inhibition at 10 µM). Is dual inhibition of GAPDH and α-enolase required for inflammatory signaling or is it only inhibition of GAPDH that is relevant? If we assume that the published ENOblock compound is selective for α-enolase, then this should not be the case.</p><p>Does GB111-NH<sub>2</sub> react with unique sites on GAPDH/α-enolase? The SAR data shown suggests that it does, however there is no mutational analysis of the proteins to confirm. Furthermore, do the published inhibitors used in the study bind/react with similar sites?</p><p>Finally, mapping the binding site of GB111-NH<sub>2</sub> would potentially enable identification of resistance mutations, which could be used to convincingly show that GAPDH/α-enolase are indeed the phenotypically relevant targets of the compound.</p><p><italic>Reviewer 3:</italic></p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> – measurement of NAD/NADH levels – LPS/GB111 vs. LPS/Nigericin and showing that nigericin does not behave like GB111 in terms of altering NAD/NADH ratios – this is a useful control but are kinetics/extent of inflammasome activation in GB111 vs. nigericin treated cells the same under these conditions? Measurement of LDH release or PI uptake by these cells and showing that they are equivalent is important for this interpretation to be correct. LPS + Enoblock does not seem to do the same thing as LPS + GB111 or LPS + KA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C and D</xref>), suggesting that blocking α-enolase alone, while inducing inflammasome activation (by IL-1β secretion) does not do so in the same way as GB111.</p><p>Addition of downstream metabolites to GB111-treated cells prevented inflammasome activation providing a nice test of the authors' hypothesis. A prediction is that these metabolites should also reverse alteration of the NAD/NADH ratio by GB111. Is this the case? If the NAD/NADH ratio is the thing being sensed by the cell as a trigger of inflammasome activation, is it possible to directly alter these ratios in primed cells to mimic the effect of GB111, or conversely to override the effect of GB111?</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> – lack of inhibition of GB111-induced inflammasome activation by extracellular potassium is quite interesting, but it would be important to have an additional readout besides just% of cells with ASC foci – LDH release or IL-1β secretion – 5% is quite low, and although the background tends to be very low as well, it isn't much above noise, so having an additional way of confirming this is important.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> – the levels of IL-1β secretion that are being measured in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref> are low relative to what is typically seen. While there are other data that support the conclusion that disruption of glycolysis by <italic>Salmonella</italic> induces NLRP3 inflammasome previous literature (for example Broz et al. 2014) suggests that there should be quite a bit more IL-1β secretion under these conditions. Moreover, while it is fair to say that pyruvate reduces <italic>Salmonella</italic>-induced inflammasome activation, a drop from 80 to 40 pg/mL IL-1β or a drop from 30% to 25% LDH does not seem exceptionally convincing – since all of the inflammasome activation that <italic>Salmonella</italic> is inducing under these conditions depends on NLRP3, what accounts for the pyruvate-independent inflammasome activation in response to <italic>Salmonella</italic>? Presumably this is due to caspase-11. At the very least this discrepancy between the effect of pyruvate on <italic>Salmonella</italic>-induced inflammasome activation and GB111 induced inflammasome activation should be discussed. A further test of whether <italic>Salmonella</italic> induces NLRP3 inflammasome activation by altering the NAD/NADH ratio is whether adding pyruvate or glutamine to <italic>Salmonella</italic>-infected cells prevents this NLRP3 inflammasome activation.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> – this is a poor quality western blot that should really be cleaned up for publication purposes. The relevant band is hard to distinguish from the background in the western blot. Even though this is a supplemental figure it should still be done to the same standard as a main text figure.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—Figure supplement 2</xref> – the title of this figure is that GB111 doesn't impair secretion of inflammasome-independent pro-inflammatory cytokines, but it has this effect only for TNF – it DOES inhibit IL-6 in a dose-dependent way. The explanation is likely related to the difference in kinetics of IL-6 and TNF transcription – since the priming was only done for 3 hours, it is likely that at higher concentrations of GB111 more of the cells are dying more quickly, leading to the appearance of an effect on IL-6, but not TNF since TNF is a primary response gene and much more rapidly expressed. This is testable with a longer period of LPS priming. This should either be done or the title of the figure legend should be changed to appropriately reflect the data.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13663.040</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>The reviewers agreed that your manuscript reports novel findings of potentially sufficient general interest for eventual publication at eLife. However, two major concerns were raised that must be addressed with additional experiments. 1) Both Reviewers 1 and 2 expressed concern about the target identification experiments for GB111-NH<sub>2</sub>.

Likewise, the use of additional inactive control probes could be helpful (e.g., probes that are structurally related to GB111-NH<sub>2</sub>, but not reactive, which would support that a covalent mechanism of target binding is required for the observed pharmacological effects).</italic>We conducted several additional studies to further demonstrate how GB111-NH<sub>2</sub> interacts with both GAPDH and α-enolase and added data from these studies to the manuscript.</p><p>We agree that the GAPDH labeling by az-GB was initially hard to interpret (revised manuscript <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). We optimized buffer conditions and now observe much cleaner labeling. Using these conditions, we performed a dose-response pretreatment of GB111-NH<sub>2</sub> before labeling with the az-GB probe. We observe that GB111-NH<sub>2</sub> inhibits az-GB binding to GAPDH and α-enolase in a dose-dependent manner, indicating that it likely binds to a discrete site on both enzymes. Compound 6, which contains a more reactive electrophile than GB111-NH<sub>2</sub> and more potently induces IL-1β secretion in BMDM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), also competed with az-GB for binding to both GAPDH and α-enolase. Importantly, this compound showed competition at lower concentrations than GB111-NH<sub>2</sub>, consistent with it having greater potency for the two targets. Furthermore, as suggested by the reviewers, we more carefully evaluated the two negative control compound. This includes compound 2 which lacks the electrophile and GB-IA which is identical to GB111 but lacks a carboxybenzyl cap. Both of these compounds did not induce IL-1β release and we show now also do not compete for az-GB binding to GAPDH or α–enolase (revised manuscript <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A-B</xref>). Collectively, these data strengthen our correlation between in vitro target-binding and cellular effects.</p><p>Our initial observation in our original manuscript that the cysteine alkylating compound N-ethylmaleimide blocked az-GB binding to GAPDH and α-enolase (revised manuscript <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>), suggested that GB111-NH<sub>2</sub> covalently binds to reactive cysteine residues on GAPDH and α-enolase. To further explore this mechanism of compound binding, we performed labeling experiments on purified GAPDH and α-enolase with iodoacetamide fluorescein (IAF), which labels reactive cysteine residues. Our collaborator in this study has previously shown (Weerapana et al., Nature 2010) that iodoacetamide preferentially labels the active site Cys 152 of GAPDH and Cys 388 of α-enolase. Notably, chemical modification of Cys 388 is deleterious to α-enolase activity (Ishii et al., Chem Res Toxicol 2004). Our new data (revised manuscript <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C-D</xref>) shows that IAF labels both GAPDH and α-enolase and is competed by both N-ethylmaleimide and by GB111-NH<sub>2</sub>. Together, these results indicate that GB111-NH<sub>2</sub> binds to the same active site cysteines as IA and support a mechanism in which GB111-NH2 function by blocking activity of these enzyme targets by direct binding to active site cysteine residues.</p><p>To further support a covalent mechanism of target binding, we conducted experiments in which we pretreated GAPDH and α-enolase with GB111-NH<sub>2</sub> for increasing periods of time. Longer pretreatment resulted in increased inhibition of both GAPDH and α-enolase (revised manuscript <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>), which indicates that GB111-NH<sub>2</sub> is a covalent inhibitor, again consistent with a mechanism in which inhibition results from covalent modification of the active site cysteines.</p><p>Taken together, these data support the hypothesis that GB111-NH<sub>2</sub> covalently binds to reactive cysteine residues on both GAPDH and α-enolase and identifies target cysteines that GB111-NH<sub>2</sub> may bind. Furthermore, these data strengthen the correlation between the binding of our GB111-NH<sub>2</sub> analogs to GAPDH and α-enolase and their ability to induce IL-1β secretion in cells.</p><p>Finally, while we agree rigorous analysis of target binding is important for any small molecule, we would like to point out that the major diving focus of this paper is not to identify a new class of selective inhibitors of GAPDH or α-enolase. Rather, we use these tools to uncover a previously unknown pathway for activation of pyroptosis that is relevant to pathogen infection. By showing this result using many different classes of small molecule and pathogen stimuli we feel that we have made the point very clearly. Finally, by rescuing the phenotype induced by both the small molecule stimuli as well as the pathogen using downstream components of glycolysis, we confirm that changes in glycolytic flux are in fact responsible for the induction of pyroptosis, thus making extensive characterization of all possible targets of the original small molecule relatively unimportant to the conclusions of the paper.</p><p><italic>2) A more thorough characterization of the effects of GB111-NH<sub>2</sub> and comparison compounds on the metabolism and inflammatory responses (e.g., IL-1β secretion) of cells would strengthen the paper, as noted in more detail by Reviewer 3.</italic>As suggested by the reviewers, we identified a concentration of nigericin (1 μM) which has a similar timecourse of inflammasome formation/pyroptosis to 10 μM GB111-NH<sub>2</sub>. We analyzed NADH levels (alongside LDH release and IL-1β secretion) and found that NADH levels are reduced by treatment with GB111-NH<sub>2</sub>, but that the nigericin controls do not show this reduction in NADH levels (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). We think that these data more convincingly indicate that changes in metabolism observed upon GB111-NH<sub>2</sub> treatment are indeed due to its proposed mechanism of action rather than a side effect of inflammasome formation and/or cell death.</p><p>We agree with the Reviewer’s conclusion that LPS+Enoblock has a somewhat different metabolic signature from LPS+GB111 and LPS+KA, specifically that NAD+/NADH ratio is not altered in BMDM by Enoblock treatment. Therefore, it is possible that a) all glycolytic inhibitors converge on a different secondary signal than NAD+/NADH that creates mitochondrial ROS and activates the inflammasome or, b) Enoblock activates the inflammasome through a distinct mechanism. We addressed these possibilities in the text as they are important avenues for future studies.</p><p><italic>Reviewer 1: 1) The target identification and validation for GB111-NH<sub>2</sub> was difficult for this Reviewer to follow. More details on how the final candidate target list (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Supplementary file 3</xref>) was generated would be helpful (e.g., what filter were used to designate these proteins as targets over other proteins identified in their proteomic experiments). Also, the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> are confusing – this Reviewer had difficulty noting any substantive change in az-GB labeling of GAPDH in the GB111-NH<sub>2</sub> competition lane. Likewise, why is there a background signal in the DMSO lanes for both enzymes? Perhaps this relates to non-specific reactivity of the TAMRA-alkyne tag with the proteins, since click reactions run in the orientation used by the authors are known to exhibit some background reactivity. This point should be clarified. The authors should also consider performing a quantitative, concentration-dependent analysis of GB111-NH<sub>2</sub> blockade of az-GB labeling of GAPDH and Eno1, which might better convince readers that these chemical probes are competitively binding/reacting with the same site on each enzyme.</italic>The Reviewer is correct regarding the background signal in the DMSO lanes – we believe that the background labeling we see is nonspecific because alkynes can function as cysteine-targeting electrophiles (Ekkebus et al., JACS 2013) and both GAPDH and α-enolase contain reactive cysteine residues. We changed the buffer to one in which nonspecific interaction of the TAMRA-alkyne with α-enolase and GAPDH is reduced to allow clearer interpretation of our results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A, C</xref>). We will address this in the text to clarify for the readers.</p><p>We did experiments looking at competition of GB111-NH<sub>2</sub> and analogs for az-GB binding to both GAPDH and α-enolase over several concentrations, as the reviewer suggested. We observe dose-dependent inhibition of az-GB binding to both GAPDH and α-enolase by GB111-NH<sub>2</sub>. Compound 6, which contains a more reactive electrophile than GB111-NH<sub>2</sub> and more potently induces IL-1β secretion in BMDM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), also competed az-GB binding to both GAPDH and α-enolase more potently than GB111-NH<sub>2</sub>. Importantly, both the GB111-NH<sub>2</sub> analog that lacks an electrophile (compound 2) and the GB111 analog that lacks a carboxybenzyl cap (GB-IA) (both of which did not induce IL-1β secretion in BMDM) did not compete for az-GB binding to GAPDH and α–enolase (revised manuscript <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A-B</xref>).</p><p>In addition, we conducted experiments where we pretreated GAPDH and α-enolase with GB111-NH<sub>2</sub> for increasing amounts of time and then measured activity. Longer pretreatment time resulted in less enzyme activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>), which is a characteristic of covalent inhibitors.</p><p><italic>2) Somewhat related to point 1, the authors state in the subsection “Inhibition of glycolytic enzymes activates the NLRP3 inflammasome and induces 139 pyroptosis” that both GAPDH and enolase have &quot;key catalytic site cysteine residues&quot;. This Reviewer knows that GAPDH uses a conserved cysteine for catalysis, but was not aware that enolase depends on cysteine residues for activity. Could the authors clarify this statement as relates to enolase and cite relevant papers showing the importance of one or more active-site cysteines in enolase. This is important, since the authors do not appear to directly identify the site of GB111-NH2 reactivity in either enzyme.</italic>We agree that this statement is a bit confusing and will clarify both here and in the main text of the paper. As the Reviewer notes, GAPDH has an active site cysteine. Our collaborator (Weerapana et al., Nature 2010) has identified a reactive cysteine in α-enolase that can be labeled with iodoacetamide. Based on the crystal structure of human α-enolase (Kang et al., Acta Crystallogr Sect D 2008), this cysteine, Cys 388 is close to the entrance to the enzyme’s substrate-binding site. Furthermore, it has previously been shown that modification of this cysteine residue results in a loss of activity (Ishii et al., Chem Res Toxicol 2004).</p><p>We did an experiment to confirm that GAPDH and α-enolase contain reactive cysteines by labeling with the reactive cysteine probe iodoacetamide-fluorescein (IAF). Both label with IAF and labeling can be blocked by incubation with the cysteine-alkylating compound N-ethylmaleimide (NEM). We observe that GB111-NH<sub>2</sub> pretreatment results in reduced iodoacetamide fluorescein labeling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C-D</xref>), indicating that GB111-NH<sub>2</sub> binds to these reactive cysteines.</p><p><italic>Reviewer 2: Although not explicitly stated in the manuscript, the method used to identify cellular targets of GB111-NH<sub>2</sub> is heavily biased towards the identification of proteins that are covalently modified by the small molecule. Therefore, potential cellular targets making non-covalent interactions with GB111-NH<sub>2</sub> are likely missed. This should be stated clearly in the text, and is a limitation of the analysis.</italic>This will be stated in the text. Based on data with our non-reactive analog of GB111-NH<sub>2</sub>, we did not think that non-covalent interactions are important for the phenotype under study, but we will state this clearly anyway.</p><p><italic>The cellular effects of GB111-NH<sub>2</sub> are compared against those of published GADPH and α-enolase inhibitors. It is unclear to me if these compounds are selective and properly validated- the data in the references I can find is quite limited. Would be good to clarify this with additional data or text.</italic>The relevant papers in which specificity characterization was reported have been cited. Specifically, specificity of KA was determined amongst enzymes in the glycolytic pathway in Endo et al., J Antibiotics 1985 (cited in our manuscript). Proteomic analysis has not been undertaken but its effects in different species correlate with the in vitrosensitivity of those species GAPDH isoforms (indirect genetic evidence of its effects). When EB was first reported (ACS Chem Biol 2013), the authors performed an affinity enrichment of all binding partners of EB. The proteins that they identified were all enolase isoforms (Jung et al., ACS Chem Biol 2013).</p><p><italic>The 'inactive compound' still appears to be active against α-enolase (only 2-3 fold less inhibition at 10 µM). Is dual inhibition of GAPDH and α-enolase required for inflammatory signaling or is it only inhibition of GAPDH that is relevant? If we assume that the published ENOblock compound is selective for α-enolase, then this should not be the case.</italic>Our data suggest that inhibition of either GAPDH or α-enolase is capable of activating the inflammasome. GAPDH inhibition may drive the phenotype more than α-enolase inhibition, based on the observation that the metabolic signature of GB111-NH<sub>2</sub> is more similar to KA. However, the increase in potency from GB111-NH<sub>2</sub> relative to KA or EB alone may be due to a synergistic effect of blocking both. Therefore, we do not think that the in vitro activity that the ‘inactive compound’ exhibits towards -enolase is sufficient to cause it to have activity in cells, especially if α-enolase inhibition is less of a driver of the biological phenotype.</p><p><italic>Does GB111-NH<sub>2</sub> react with unique sites on GAPDH/α-enolase? The SAR data shown suggests that it does, however</italic>α</p><p> <italic>there is no mutational analysis of the proteins to confirm.

We did a competition labeling study of GAPDH and α-enolase with 10 μM iodoacetamide-fluorescein (IAF) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C-D</xref>). According to proteomic data previously generated by the authors (Weerapana et al., Nature 2010), 10 μM iodoacetamide will predominantly label the active site Cys 152 of GAPDH and Cys 388 of α-enolase (a cysteine flanking the substrate-binding pocket of α-enolase). We see that IAF binding to both GAPDH and α-enolase is competed by GB111-NH<sub>2</sub> pretreatment, indicating that GB111-NH<sub>2</sub> also binds to these cysteines.</p><p><italic>Finally, mapping the binding site of GB111-NH<sub>2</sub> would potentially enable identification of resistance mutations, which could be used to convincingly show that GAPDH/α-enolase are indeed the phenotypically relevant targets of the compound.</italic>An interesting study, but beyond the scope of this paper. The feasibility of this study is also questionable because it has previously been shown that expression of GAPDH mutants that lack activity is cytotoxic (Yogalingam et al., JBC 2013), and our studies are being conducted in BMDM which do not live long enough in culture to generate resistance mutants.</p><p><italic>Reviewer 3:<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> – measurement of NAD/NADH levels – LPS/GB111 vs. LPS/Nigericin and showing that nigericin does not behave like GB111 in terms of altering NAD/NADH ratios – this is a useful control but are kinetics/extent of inflammasome activation in GB111 vs. nigericin treated cells the same under these conditions? Measurement of LDH release or PI uptake by these cells and showing that they are equivalent is important for this interpretation to be correct. LPS + Enoblock does not seem to do the same thing as LPS + GB111 or LPS + KA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C and D</xref>), suggesting that blocking α-enolase alone, while inducing inflammasome activation (by IL-1β secretion) does not do so in the same way as GB111.</italic>We have done a more careful titration of nigericin to find a concentration at which the kinetics of inflammasome activation and cell death are similar to those in GB111-NH<sub>2</sub>-treated BMDM. At this concentration of nigericin (1 μM), we see a decrease in NADH production upon GB111-NH<sub>2</sub> treatment but do not observe a decrease in NADH production in the nigericin-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>The α-enolase inhibitor does not have an identical metabolic signature to the GAPDH inhibitor or GB111-NH<sub>2</sub> – though lactate production is impaired, NAD+/NADH is not significantly altered. This either indicates that the α-enolase inhibitor is working through a distinct mechanism from glycolytic inhibition or that NAD+/NADH, while predictive of inflammasome formation, is not the universal signal sensed downstream of glycolytic disruption. To prevent confusion for future studies, this will be directly discussed in the text.</p><p><italic>Addition of downstream metabolites to GB111-treated cells prevented inflammasome activation providing a nice test of the authors' hypothesis. A prediction is that these metabolites should also reverse alteration of the NAD/NADH ratio by GB111. Is this the case? If the NAD/NADH ratio is the thing being sensed by the cell as a trigger of inflammasome activation, is it possible to directly alter these ratios in primed cells to mimic the effect of GB111, or conversely to override the effect of GB111?</italic>These metabolites do reverse the NAD+/NADH ratio defect observed upon GB111 treatment – see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>. We do override this by adding rotenone (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E-F</xref>), where we see a reversal of the NAD+/NADH ratio caused by GB111 and then see complete suppression of inflammasome formation induced by GB111.</p><p><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> – lack of inhibition of GB111-induced inflammasome activation by extracellular potassium is quite interesting, but it would be important to have an additional readout besides just% of cells with ASC foci – LDH release or IL-1β secretion – 5% is quite low, and although the background tends to be very low as well, it isn't much above noise, so having an additional way of confirming this is important.</italic>We think that this is also an interesting point so we also looked at LDH release under these conditions. We also observe that high extracellular K<sup>+</sup> blocks nigericin-induced LDH release but does not have a significant effect on GB111-induced LDH release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> – the levels of IL-1β secretion that are being measured in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref> are low relative to what is typically seen. While there are other data that support the conclusion that disruption of glycolysis by Salmonella induces NLRP3 inflammasome previous literature (for example Broz</italic> et al.</p><p><italic>2014) suggests that there should be quite a bit more IL-1β secretion under these conditions. Moreover, while it is fair to say that pyruvate reduces Salmonella-induced inflammasome activation, a drop from 80 to 40 pg/mL IL-1β or a drop from 30% to 25% LDH does not seem exceptionally convincing – since all of the inflammasome activation that Salmonella is inducing under these conditions depends on NLRP3, what accounts for the pyruvate-independent inflammasome activation in response to Salmonella? Presumably this is due to caspase-11. At the very least this discrepancy between the effect of pyruvate on Salmonella-induced inflammasome activation and GB111 induced inflammasome activation should be discussed. A further test of whether Salmonella induces NLRP3 inflammasome activation by altering the NAD/NADH ratio is whether adding pyruvate or glutamine to Salmonella-infected cells prevents this NLRP3 inflammasome activation.</italic>The difference could be due to caspase-11. Another explanation is that pyruvate supplementation is not completely blocking NLRP3 inflammasome formation because it is actively used – it is not a genetic block. However, it is true that pyruvate more effectively blocks GB111-NH<sub>2</sub>-induced NLRP3 inflammasome formation than <italic>Salmonella typhimurium</italic>-induced NLRP3 inflammasome formation, and we have added text to point this out and discuss both potential reasons for this difference. As a note, we do observe that cells infected with <italic>Salmonella</italic>, when supplemented with pyruvate, regain their ability to turn over NAD+ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9I</xref>).</p><p><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> – this is a poor quality western blot that should really be cleaned up for publication purposes. The relevant band is hard to distinguish from the background in the western blot. Even though this is a supplemental figure it should still be done to the same standard as a main text figure.</italic>While we agree that the western blot is not ideal, we have not be able to get any significantly better results with the antibody we have. We think that the results are still clear in that we consistently see the appearance of the processed IL-1β mature form in cells at concentrations of GB111-NH<sub>2</sub> where we get induction of pyroptosis and accumulation of IL-1b signals by ELISA.</p><p><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref> – the title of this figure is that GB111 doesn't impair secretion of inflammasome-independent pro-inflammatory cytokines, but it has this effect only for TNF – it DOES inhibit IL-6 in a dose-dependent way. The explanation is likely related to the difference in kinetics of IL-6 and TNF transcription – since the priming was only done for 3 hours, it is likely that at higher concentrations of GB111 more of the cells are dying more quickly, leading to the appearance of an effect on IL-6, but not TNF since TNF is a primary response gene and much more rapidly expressed. This is testable with a longer period of LPS priming. This should either be done or the title of the figure legend should be changed to appropriately reflect the data.</italic></p><p>We agree with the reviewer’s explanation of the IL-6 data, given published time course data of IL-6 secretion after LPS priming (Bjorkbacka et al. Physiol. Genomics 2004). We changed the title of the figure legend accordingly.</p></body></sub-article></article>
